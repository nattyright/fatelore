Given that this goddess is a happy-go-lucky person, Artemis has almost no regard for human life. Fundamentally, Orion has a role to keep her in check, and Artemis personally hates more than anything the words called “patience” and “perseverance”.

After being shot to death by Artemis, due to her actions, Orion was transformed into a mascot character and became adorable… adorable? Characteristically, he is quite lazy, yet he is shrewd, occasionally evading even Artemis’ accusations of unfaithfulness splendidly. In relation to Artemis, if there is an opportunity for him, one can assume that Orion is nearby having an affair, and it gives the impression that they are a married couple who are constantly in a crisis of one being unfaithful to the other, seeing that they are like lovers who can, yet cannot, avoid each other or that situation. However, in the case where Artemis falls into an emergency, Orion has the resourcefulness to a degree to come to her aid to the point of being truly reckless in doing so.</p>\n<h3 id="motivation-·-attitude-towards-master">Motivation · Attitude towards Master</h3>\n<p>Artemis basically takes up a neutral position towards the Master. However, because she is a “goddess”, in spite of how great the Master is, she always takes up the higher position in their relationship standing. Orion’s role is to pacify the relationship between Artemis and the Master. Since Orion fundamentally has no power, he tries to curry favour with the Master.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>Artemis: “Heeere!

I love Orion, but hey, I like you a tiny bit too, ok?”<br>Orion: “This one becomes emotionally attached to no one except me… but, will snow suddenly start to fall too because of this?”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>Artemis is one of the deities of the Twelve Olympians, and she was born as a child of Zeus and as the younger sister of Apollo<sup id="fgo-material-ii.character.n1" class="note"><a title="n1" href="#fgo-material-ii.character.note1">1</a></sup>. She is the virgin goddess who governs over hunting and chastity, and her eyes towards the opposite sex were unusually relentless, such as when she killed a hunter who was thoughtlessly peeking at her bathing.</p>\n<p>Artemis is like that, of all things, for some reason. She fell in love with the hunter Orion, a child of Poseidon who won fame as a playboy in those days. Usually if circumstances allow it, no matter if she was a goddess or someone other than a goddess, if he was charmed by a woman, Orion would take her on a one-night stand at once, but when it was regarding Artemis, for some reason or another, why does his defensive instincts come into play? He refrained from taking her hand immediately.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, even the rumours of Orion and Artemis’ rendezvous ascended to the heavens, and the talk of whether these two were getting married or not was being spread around too.</p>\n<p>The one who did not permit their marriage back then was Apollo, the Sun God and Artemis’ elder brother. Apollo was aware. Of the nature of, ‘it can’t be helped’, belonging to the man named Orion. And yet, Artemis did not even lend her ear to Apollo’s warning. So Apollo drafted a plan, perceiving from afar a swimming Orion, and he provoked Artemis by saying “Over there is a scoundrel named Candaon. Aim and bring down that person.” It is natural that Artemis merely aimed at Orion’s head————and magnificently shot through him. The next day, Artemis became aware of Orion’s death and grieved, having attempted to restore him back to life, but that wish was not granted, and Orion inevitably ascended to the sky and became a celestial body.</p>\n<p>And yet, Orion really did not learn his lesson, where he was quarrelling with his companion Artemis, who came to visit him occasionally, and was being exposed by Artemis for being unfaithful to her, before he would be beaten half to death.</p>\n<p>This time, sensing an uncommon crisis where the Holy Grail Wars would be held for the sake of the Human Order Restoration, Artemis accomplished the materialization of her form by forcing herself into Orion’s summoning… Although that is just half the reason, for this other remaining half is to express the feelings of her as a girl bravely, said to be her wanting to make out with Orion to her heart’s content when the opportunity arises.</p>\n<p>… Wait, bravely?</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="atalanta">Atalanta</h4>\n<p>A heroine who believes in Artemis.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay, because I’ll give you full of blessings, alright?!

Sure, he is a stuffed (male) bear who is not cute enough to be liked by everybody, but nonetheless, one cannot conclude that he is not cute enough to the point that he would be dumped away. Because of his overblown individuality at the occasion of being a stuffed animal, everybody is saying that those clothes are Orion’s, and they are probably imagining that his original appearance is viewed as being right in the center of ‘that’ archetype. Although it is justified, he does not wear lower-body clothing.</p>\n<p>And then, at first for Artemis, I thought of making her a flat-chested girl because of the occasion where she was named the virgin goddess that made up one element of Meltryllis, but in the first place, since there would be no reason for the current Artemis to materialize in a body that would not be liked by Orion, I did her design over again for a voluptuous body, saying “You’re kidding, someone like that is a virgin in this body?” So one can conclude that, if by some chance, there may be a loli goddess Artemis also existing in some dimension. Although, unless there is a change in the settings I heard about, her original form is planned to be in a boring figure that is neither a loli nor does it have huge breasts. (I-IV)</p>\n"}}}]};
