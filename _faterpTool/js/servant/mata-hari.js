Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, also known as Mata Hari, was born as the eldest daughter of a wealthy household in Amsterdam<sup id="fgo-material-ii.character.n1" class="note"><a title="n1" href="#fgo-material-ii.character.note1">1</a></sup>, Netherlands. However, her happy days have signalled their end because of her parents’ bankruptcy. After the breakup of her family. she made an effort to study under the guidance of her guardian as much as possible to become a kindergarten teacher, but because her school’s headmaster had a blatant meddling affair with her, she was evicted by her guardian.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, after her marriage and divorce, she debuted as the dancer “Mata Hari” in Paris. Mata Hari is the Sun, the name standing for ‘eye of the day’ in the Malay language, and it seems she has been named as such by her employer who was pleased with her exotic appearance.</p>\n<p>Mata Hari shared the bed with a great number of people as not only a dancer, but as a harlot too. Some of her clients were foreigners who visited Paris, in which some of them being high-ranking military officers, politicians, etc., and it is believed that at this time, she was operating behind the scenes as a spy.</p>\n<p>… Regarding Mata Hari’s spying activities, no clear evidence could be procured. At the time of being 41 years old, she was executed as a double agent of France as well as of Germany. However, both the French and German sides who executed her did not particularly believe her to be a spy who extracted important intelligence, and it is even said that she was treated, at most, as a somebody who sold secret information to some degree.</p>\n<p>Granted that, at any rate, France took advantage of this convenient situation and just pushed all their military failures onto Mata Hari. Due to their inept military operations, and also because a scapegoat was presented to them, she was accused of being a spy who had leaked information on France, and it resulted in the existence of Mata Hari being carved into history.</p>\n<p>There are various episodes that talk about Mata Hari, such as one where she claimed “There’s no man could who shoot me” at the time of her execution as she became naked, her beauty causing those nearby to go crazy for her, so the shooters wore blindfolds in order to avoid that, but those episodes were probably exaggerated as one would expect.</p>\n<p>Was Mata Hari truly a spy, or was she just a common secret information broker? The original name of a beautiful woman trifled by fate has been completely forgotten, and only her usual stage name has become a legend.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="boudica">Boudica</h4>\n<p>Being of the type of that nature, Mata Hari is not able to have a particularly close relationship with another Servant, but among other things, she is relatively on good terms with Boudica, who arrived at an untimely death much like herself.</p>\n<h5 id="notes">Translator’s Notes</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><a id="fgo-material-ii.character.note1" class="notelink" title="note1" href="#fgo-material-ii.character.n1">^</a> Should have been Leeuwarden instead of Amsterdam.</li>\n</ol>\n'}}},{parent:"mata-hari",source:"fgo-material-ii",id:"comment-from-illustrator",weight:5,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"comment-from-illustrator",name:"Comment from Illustrator"},source:{id:"fgo-material-ii",name:"FGO material II"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:"<p>You know, I agreed that it would be nice if I drew an erotic elder sister, so I designed one as this dancer and female spy.
