She won’t loathe a Master simply “because the Master is evil” or “because the Master is a turncoat”.<br>If her Master is a scoundrel, her stance is to also enjoy herself as a villain, fooling around at the same time with her philosophy of “since nothing’s gonna be left behind in the end after all” appearing and disappearing.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“Alright you rascals, it’s time!
