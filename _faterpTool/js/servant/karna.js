It allowed her to summon forth any god and bear a child of the gods. As a test, Kunti summons the sun god Surya and bears his child. A decision she comes to regret.<br>At the time, giving birth to a child before marriage was a huge problem, so the concerned Kunti discards Karna in a river.<br>Luckily enough, he is adopted by a charioteer couple and starts displaying remarkable martial arts talent as he grows up.<br>In a Kaurava conference, Arjuna, one of the 5 Pandava princes, showed transcendental archery skills.<br>The audience showered him with praise, with the only contrarian being Karna. Karna displays archery skills on par with Arjuna and goes as far as requesting a one-on-one duel. However, the 5 Pandava brothers respond asking “What is your caste?”. In order to challenge Arjuna, a prince, your caste needs to be at least Kshatriya (warrior) and Karna didn’t qualify for that.<br>Luckily, Duryodhana, a dissenter of the Pandavas, takes a liking to Karna and ushers him into kinghood.<br>However, Karna’s foster father appears there, exposing Karna’s origins. He was the son of a charioteer.</p>\n<p>Karna was indignant at the Pandava brothers for making his caste into laughingstock. He’s always complete fine with himself being mocked, but they insulted his foster father.</p>\n<p>Karna started to serve his new friend Duryodhana. Karna and Arjuna’s mutual rivalry would deepen in the competition for Draupadi (who later became the wife of the Pandava brothers), until they finally settle who is on top on the Kurukshetra War. A war for territory breaks out between the 100 Kaurava princes (Duryodhana being one of them) and the 5 Pandava brothers.<br>At this time, a woman approaches Karna as he commands his army.<br>It was Kunti, the biological mother who birthed, then abandoned Karna. She confesses to him that she is his mother. The Pandava brothers are also sons of Kunti, therefore Arjuna is Karna’s half-brother.<br>Although Karna rejected her wish for him to switch to the Pandava brothers’ side, impressed by Kunti’s courage to admit her shameful crime, he swore not to attack any brother other than Arjuna.<br>For that reason, Karna let the non-Arjuna Pandava brothers escape the battlefield alive multiple times.</p>\n<p>Later, immediately before the final battle, Indra, the thunder god, appears before Karna.<br>Karna was under an oath to never reject a request from a Brahmin, so when asked for his golden armor and earrings (that is, his Noble Phantasm Kavacha &amp; Kundala), he peels away the items that were fused with his flesh. Impressed by his outstanding nobility, Indra grants Karna a single Divine Spear. The one and only Vasavi Shakti.<br>But even that wasn’t a fair replacement for an armor that promised him de facto immortality. When Arjuna approached Karna in the final battle, he had no trace left of his former strength.<br>With one curse making his chariot’s wheel get bogged down, another curse rendering unable to remember his weapons’ True Names, and without his immortality, Karna no longer had any ways to avoid Arjuna’s arrow.<br>But Arjuna wouldn’t shoot.<br>Because before the war, both parties agreed upon a rule: it’s forbidden to attack anyone who is no longer able to fight.<br>As long as his chariot was bogged, Arjuna was not allowed to shoot him.</p>\n<p>“Ignore this rule”, whispers Arjuna’s charioteer Krishna.<br>Arjuna listen to the devilish whispers and regrets it for the rest of his life.<br>Karna, on the other hand, is weirdly proud of the fact that a hero on Arjuna’s level would go as far as breaking the rules to defeat him.<br>Karna and Arjuna drew their bows with all their might…</p>\n<p>And in the end, Arjuna’s bow shot down the sun.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="arjuna">Arjuna</h4>\n<p>His half-brother, with enough connections of fate to him to fill entire books.
