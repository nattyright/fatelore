On the other hand, they have a gentle nature at times of peace. The likes of an expression that shows them being hard at work in domestic chores while they are looking forward to afternoon teatime can probably be seen too.</p>\n<p>The loyalty d’Éon devoted to the French Royal Ramily is truly everlasting, and even if they materialize as a Servant, that will never change. As a Heroic Spirit related to the Royal Family, they will surely display the state of their loyalty that had remained changeless since when they were alive. For example, even if the White Lily of the Royal Family has been lost, as long as France exists in the world, d’Éon will take their sword into their hand without any doubt.

That is who I, Chevalier d’Éon de Beaumont, am.”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>Charles Geneviève d’Éon de Beaumont. A figure of the 18th~19th Century. A legendary figure who was either talked about as a man who was a woman, or a woman who was a man. A swordsman and writer accomplished in both the military and literary arts. He/she left behind as many meritorious services as possible in his/her career, such as playing an active role as a spy of the secret channels that conducted themselves against many of the world’s major powers, a French plenipotentiary minister, a commanding officer of a dragoon regiment, and so forth.</p>\n<p>It is said that, despite having dressed formally and behaved like a man, d’Éon was endowed with such good looks to the extent that he/she can be called an innocent pretty girl. In fact, before becoming an adult, he/she agreed to wear a dress, gathering rumours among high society that d’Éon is a “beautiful girl”, and later on as an adult, when he/she infiltrated the Russian Empire for an objective regarding his/her secret mission, d’Éon even interacted with the Russian Empress as Mademoiselle Lia de Beaumont, leaving behind an anecdote where his/her beauty was praised by the empress and her servants.</p>\n<p>In later years, a secret was publicly revealed————d’Éon was not a man, but a woman. Consistently thereafter, he/she spent the days as a woman, and it is said that d’Éon was given a dress for “a female knight more suited as a folding fan than a sword” by Marie Antoinette, who was the French Queen at that time.</p>\n<p>Born as a female, brought up as a girl, grew up to be a man, and served the Royal Family————He/she speaks of their own life as such. There is also an anecdote where d’Éon was definitely raised up as a girl in his/her early childhood and was then raised up as a man thereafter his/her childhood. The truth is, was he a woman, or was he a man? His/her way of life, in which even the opinion of the doctor who performed the examination of his/her body after his/her death was divided into two, is full of beautiful and mysterious glamour, similarly like the impressions he/she kept on giving off to the many men and women. Therefore, Charles Geneviève d’Éon, as a Heroic Spirit in “Fate/Grand Order”, has got the figure of “a beautiful woman disguising herself as a man” as the form that symbolizes his/her own life.</p>\n<h3 id="general-armaments">General Armaments</h3>\n<p>A sabre.

Though sometimes, her smile is awfully scary.</p>\n<h4 id="amadeus">Amadeus</h4>\n<p>A person closely connected with their master, Marie Antoinette. Although they know in their head that Amadeus is a musical prodigy they should respect and love, d’Éon is fairly poor at doing that. “What a perverted devil… Why do you continue to treat me as a friend…? If you were at least a French citizen…”</p>\n<h4 id="sanson">Sanson</h4>\n<p>Although Sanson is a French citizen and a person of a family lineage that continued to pledge their allegiance to the Royal Family for generations, he is also the companion who dyed the demise of the White Lily in blood. A subject who d’Éon harbours love and hate for and one who they find hard to cut off from. Someone difficult to deal with. However, if it is the case that Marie forgives him, then it is not something they can raise an objection to…</p>\n<h4 id="robespierre">Robespierre</h4>\n<p>Although Robespierre is a bitter enemy of the Royal Family, d’Éon recognizes that————he is also a person who was concerned about the future of France. A subject of their love and hate similarly like Sanson.
