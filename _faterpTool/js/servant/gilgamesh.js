The difference would be, 粛清 is the desire to make disappear not only things that are unjust and impure, but also EVERYTHING that stands in your way. Basically, press ctrl+delete on anyone that is a nuisance for you.<br>Whereas 粛正, the terms being used for Enuma Elish here, is the desire to remove all that is unjust and impure, and then returns to proper form.

Heroes are those who bear responsibility of all human being within their view. -----------And I had long since bear all of the world.”<br>“What is a king, if not arrogant!?”<br>“How dare you-----how dare you, howdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyou…!”<br>“Fool! I have not even the slightest intention to die…! You stay there until I pull myself out!”<br>“Thoughts extolling desperation; an agreeable start!”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>The king of Uruk, a city state of ancient Mesopotamia.<br>It began with the “Epic of Gilgamesh”, said to be the oldest epic of a hero; he appeared in Mesopotamia ancient tale, and thus is called the king of heroes.<br>He was a warrior excelling and proficient in handling arms, flushing out youths in the war against other city states while rebelling against the elders. The gods, who heard of the lamentation of the parents who lost their child in the war, grant to him an equal friend, and thereafter they both went on adventures together.<br>They had made various exploits, such as defeating the monster of the forest Humbaba; however, by the design of Ishtar, whose allure he had severely spurned, he lost his friend and ended up fearing death.<br>Gilgamesh, who wished for the secret of immortality, went to meet the sage who had lived on since the age of the great flood, Utnapishtim. And although through the sage’s advice he was able to get in his hand the miraculous medicine of immortality, it was eaten by a snake when he had momentarily let his guard down for but a small period of time.</p>\n<h3 id="role-within-the-game-selling-point">Role within the Game, Selling Point</h3>\n<p>Compared to the original works, he plays less of an active role.<br>In his interludes, in a manner of very much like him, many times he would appraises the Master of whether or not they are worthy of his interest and bestow trials upon them. By his words, “Mankind does not have any value; but the things mankind made does.” Perhaps that belief of his is one of the reason he is quite particular with his treasures.</p>\n<h3 id="role-in-past-works">Role in Past Works</h3>\n<p>In two of Fate/stay night routes, he appears in a last boss-like role. In contrast with Saber (Artoria), who was consecutively summoned in the fourth and the fifth war, he stayed as he was as an Archer of the fourth war.</p>\n<p>In this work, his ability and personality are of the extreme antithesis of those on the protagonist’s side, and so he is completely on the opposing side. However, in Fate/hollow ataraxia, he reclaims another aspect of his unique way of being as the “King of Heroes”, and then in Fate/Zero his character and true motive was reaffirmed.</p>\n<p>In Fate/EXTRA CCC, because he is one of the main Servant of the neutral character protagonist, he is inclined to neither good nor evil, bewitching with his behaviour as a “hero of the age of the gods”. In the short story of Fate/strange fake, he was summoned together with a hero he possesses deep bond with during his live, depicting the figure of his in great joy of their reunion and rematch.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="artoria">Artoria</h4>\n<p>That figure of hers, floundering on the ground as she aim (wish) for the unreachable ideal----truly is the only star that can be found above ground.<br>The star is something beyond reach, be it from the heaven or earth. And so it is beautiful.</p>\n<h4 id="cu-chulainn">Cu Chulainn</h4>\n<p>“At last, I have ascertained why you grate on my nerves so! It is because your way of being as a king is simply directly opposite of mine!”</p>\n<h4 id="karna">Karna</h4>\n<p>Having low self-assertion is a fault; however, he see no other fault with Karna. In particular is that golden armor; truly excellent. He dare say he has the second best sense in this world.</p>\n<h4 id="enkidu">Enkidu</h4>\n<p>No comment.</p>\n<h4 id="ishtar">Ishtar</h4>\n<p>“Fuhaha! Let me tell you, goddess!
