Born between the God of War Mars and the beautiful princess Silvia, Romulus was raised by a wolf, which is a beast of the gods, as a friend.</p>\n<p>After triumphing in the battle against Amulius, the King of Alba Longa who deceived his grandfather Numitor for the throne and persecuted his mother Silvia, instead of ruling over Alba Longa, Romulus established the city-state of Rome in the Italian Peninsula. And after overcoming the tragedy where he killed his younger brother Remus, who fought together with him in the Alba Longa War, with his own hands in a quarrel during the occasion of the founding of the nation, Romulus annexed the states around the Mediterranean Sea in an instant, building up the cornerstone of Rome, which will become a great empire that will boast a glory spanning over a long time.</p>\n<p>The Great Nation Founding King. In his last moments, Romulus did not die, but rather had “disappeared”. After storms and lightning broke out suddenly at a field nearby the Palus Caprae (Goat Marsh), his figure was erased. Because of the words spoken by a farmer later on after Romulus’ disappearance, the people of Rome interpreted this anomalous phenomenon as, “The Great Romulus had arrived at the queue to become a god due to the intentions of the God of War, Mars, who is his father”, and that became the conclusive interpretation. The farmer encountered Romulus after his “disappearance” at Quirinal Hill, and from the mouth of the Great King of Nation Founding, he informed him that Romulus has now changed into a god referred to as Quirinus————It is said that this is what has been informed to the people.</p>\n<p>Quirinus. That is the name of an olden god purported to be among the ranks of Jupiter, the Supreme Being spoken of in Roman Mythology, and Mars, the God of War. This anecdote was spread to the people of Rome, and this olden god was born again as a new god who became unified with the King of Nation Founding.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="nero">Nero</h4>\n<p>“A child of Rome who is my own beloved child.
