Soothing the people with a smile, gaining adoration with a gaze. Marie was born to be loved, and this is not a theory to her, but her actually feeling this as an instinct.

That mentality is already not far off from some kind of goddess.</p>\n<p>Marie never hates the people. As she was born for the sake of being loved, she therefore loves the people. If the people deem her to be unnecessary, and even if they shout at her, capture her, and kill her, she will show a smile to them even at the moment of her death. However, because her mentality as a Servant is fundamentally being stopped at “the moment she married Louis XVI, visited France as its queen, and was blessed and loved by the many citizens”, she does not easily display her aspect as a tragic queen. (It is not the case that she has no memories after that moment. Nevertheless, the stage of her mentality and character is simply at “that time”.)</p>\n<p>Upfront. Spontaneous. Marie will speak of anything she thought of. She will say the likeable things are what she likes, and the not so likeable things are what she dislikes.</p>\n<p>Marie likes baths. Awfully liking to keep herself clean is an influence from her mother, Maria Theresa. Because “the light perfumes with a scent similar to flowers and herbs are pleasant”, the perfumes she uses are not that strong.</p>\n<p>Marie is a spendthrift.

The consort of Louis XVI. An ephemeral lady. Born between Maria Theresa, a descendant of the House of Habsburg – the great German royal house – and Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, a person originating from the House of Lorraine as its Duke, Marie was born and raised as an existence that symbolizes “the rule of the nobility” of the European world, but in the violent torrents of human history where the absoluteness of the Royal Authority was continually being lost, she lost her life before the changes of the world.</p>\n<p>Loved as a symbol of the Royal Authority, being blessed while living————<br>Detested as a symbol of the Royal Authority, shown contempt as she ended up dead.<br>The protruding eyes of the nobility, political marriage, living the royal court life, and then, revolution and execution.

The answer at that time was…</p>\n<p>Even now where he became a Heroic Spirit, Marie recognizes that she “likes” the sincere and fun Amadeus.

Furthermore, Marie deeply respects d’Éon as a person who devoted herself to secret missions and diplomacies while she was a woman. Marie had given a dress to d’Éon during their lifetimes.
