Popularly known as Madame Blavatsky. Immersing herself in mysticism out of belief of the existence of the Lemurian continent that was said to be a land erased in the ancient times, she came in contact with a higher existence, “Mahatma”, and its collective body, “Hierarchy”, having acquired an abundant amount of wisdom in the process————If that is surely the case, it may not be known that she might have caught sight of a possibility towards the Root.</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>A prodigious mage born as a mutation. She called the pioneers who have reached the Root as “Mahatma” and “Hierarchy”, and stipulated (assumed) that they are higher existences. Helena herself says that she always felt their messages, but for others to feel the same things, it seems that the same kind of ability (special Magical Circuits) she possesses is needed. It is highly likely that neither the Lemurian continent nor Mahatma actually exists, and she is “merely a prodigy who performed a peculiar interpretation of the world.” Up to her last moments, she could not reach an agreement with London’s Mage’s Association.</p>\n<p>As a Servant, Helena materializes as an all-rounder Caster who manipulates many magecrafts, from the ancient times to the modern era, that became a foundation for Theosophy. Although she can show that she can even so far as manipulate the Ancient Egyptian Magics and the Holy Church’s Baptism Rites, it seems that those ancient ones are not really her forte as expected.</p>\n<h3 id="general-armaments">General Armaments</h3>\n<p>She can perform magical attacks by means of incantations. She can also perform distant magical attacks not by using attributes such as fire and wind, but by projecting pure magical energy. Specifically, a book (secret doctrine) floats around and fires beams with a ‘bang!’</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="edison-and-nikola-tesla">Edison and Nikola Tesla</h4>\n<p>Helena is on good terms with Edison like how it was before when they had a networking connection with each other during their lifetimes. Regarding the relationship between Edison and Nikola Tesla and their eternal rivalry, her comment from an elder sister’s point of view is this: “Good grief, even after they became Heroic Spirits…”</p>\n<h4 id="nursery-rhyme">Nursery Rhyme</h4>\n<p>At any rate, because she remembers “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” when she looks at Nursery Rhyme, Helena has mixed feelings. If she says it plainly, it is not a pleasant feeling. For that is because Lewis Carroll, aka Charles Dodgson, the author of “Alice”, was a supporter of the SPR (The United Kingdom’s Society of Psychical Research). As a Heroic Spirit, Helena Blavatsky happens to go into the relatively calmer group of people, but she cannot get used to being kind to those authoritarians who chased after her during her lifetime. Regarding this matter, she says “I still loathe them.”</p>\n<h4 id="arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</h4>\n<p>Although Sir Conan Doyle was a supporter of the SPR, concerning him, his reaction to Helena was somewhat kind.</p>\n<p>“Although Mr. Doyle is by no means a bad person, he… was a person involved with the SPR, wasn’t he?… Um, of course? I understand that Mr. Holmes isn’t bad, right?”</p>\n<h4 id="indian-heroic-spirits">Indian Heroic Spirits</h4>\n<p>To Helena, India is her second home… or rather, it is even like the home of her soul. She wants to do something like getting along with them.</p>\n'}}},{parent:"helena-blavatsky",source:"fgo-material-iii",id:"comment-from-illustrator",weight:5,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"comment-from-illustrator",name:"Comment from Illustrator"},source:{id:"fgo-material-iii",name:"FGO material III"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:"<p>At first, I was designing a concept of a beautiful Russian girl in a military uniform, but I settled down with the current design after having a briefing session with Mr. Takeuchi.
