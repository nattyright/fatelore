Charles-Henri Sanson was involved with the executions of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, and many others. The reason that a mere executioner got so famous was that, in spite of being in an executioners’ household that boasted a history of more than two hundred years, and in spite of being in the faction that opposed the death penalty too, it was the result of things like being the person that carried out the second most death penalties in history.</p>\n<p>The Sanson House was a contradictory existence, having lived while being financially blessed despite having a low social status as “executioners”. Even when the country turned around because of the French Revolution, a verdict of innocence was handed down against the execution of the Sanson House which had continued for generations. To guillotine without their will; that was their role.</p>\n<p>Charles-Henri Sanson, just then in those turbulent times, became the Executioner————Monsieur de Paris. He executed targets from every social class, from figures such as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre whose reputations were literally linked with the history of France, to as far as obscure people.</p>\n<p>In particular, the execution of Louis XVI seemed to be an extreme shock for even Sanson, and after Louis XVI’s execution, Sanson entreated some priests to hold a Mass for the King. That was a counter-revolutionary crime at the time of the French Revolution, and it was something so serious, it became a capital crime, but even so, Sanson repeatedly held a Mass for the King.</p>\n<p>It has also been noted that Charles-Henri Sanson was an exceptional advocate for equality even in those days. He helped abandoned patients as a physician, and he accumulated research so that the people having their sentences carried out would have no pain and prognostic symptoms.</p>\n<p>————Supposing that…<br>Even if it was something anybody and everybody would not concern themselves with, even if it was something that would not be rewarded…<br>Sanson would put up with the agony and respectably continue on with that role.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="marie-antoinette">Marie Antoinette</h4>\n<p>As everyone knows, a respected and beloved queen, maiden, and eternal existence.
