Moreover, she is a goddess of the forest. Fergus usually wears a composed face, but frankly, there is a hidden peerlessness behind it.

Even now, the fame of the hero Fergus as a magnificent brave warrior is being left behind in posterity.</p>\n<p>There is also a legend where Fergus was the King of Ulster from the previous generation. According to that, it is said he had temporarily handed over the throne to Conchobar under the condition that Conchobar’s beautiful mother was made into his lover, but Conchobar’s mother, who was overflowing with sinister designs, left Fergus out of the kingship permanently with those designs.</p>\n<p>Fergus was formerly a man who established a corner of the Red Branch Knights, but he ran away from the order of knights out of rage at the betrayal of Ulster King Conchobar. During the time when the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle broke out, Fergus took the side of his lover, Queen Medb of Connacht, and displayed his valour. Because Cú Chulainn stayed with Ulster, Fergus was kept from demonstrating his true seriousness in battle, but he still had once reached the point where he was one breath away from slaying King Conchobar.</p>\n<p>Due to the pledge (geis) exchanged with Cú Chulainn at the occasion of this battle, Fergus will almost unconditionally win against Cú Chulainn in the situation where a rematch is done with him. At the time of the second Ulster invasion, because Queen Medb was scheming her revenge against Cú Chulainn, she concluded that “Fergus’ existence will be a nuisance”, and she did not invite Fergus to the battlefield. Afterwards, Fergus was assassinated by the hands of a jealousy-driven King Ailill, Medb’s husband.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="cú-chulainn">Cú Chulainn</h4>\n<p>His adopted son and friend.
