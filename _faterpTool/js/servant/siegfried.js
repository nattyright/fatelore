Siegfried was a prince of a noble lineage with various adventures having unfolded around him. And then, he heard rumours about the beautiful Kriemhild of the Kingdom of Burgundy and went towards her for a marriage proposal————Thus, the tragedy had begun.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, in “The Nibelungenlied”, Siegfried is not in the role of the leading character. The true leading character is his wife, Kriemhild, and this epic poem is a great revenge tragedy brought about by her despair and hatred.</p>\n<p>Consequently, even Siegfried’s adventures, up to him obtaining the demonic sword Balmung and the event where he felled the evil dragon Fafnir, were only just talked about as hearsay by the characters and were not actually depicted in the tale. In the First Chapter of the FGO Story, when Siegfried told his companions that he does not remember anything of the time when he confronted Fafnir, it is because no one even saw, heard or talked about that in the first place.</p>\n<p>At the end of his adventures, Siegfried obtained a cloak that hides his figure, obtained the demonic sword Balmung, and in the end, accomplished the feat of dragon slaying where he felled the evil dragon Fafnir. And, almost a large number of these extremely gruesome battles were events that went untold————<br>Without even choosing to waste even a considerable amount of Das Rhinegold that he obtained as he likes, Siegfried entrusted his back, his only weak point, to his peerless friend.</p>\n<p>Judging from Siegfried’s point of view, it was the only way in order to resolve the antagonism between Kriemhild and the wife of his older brother-in-law where it was growing to the point that Siegfried already found himself in a sticky situation with his involvement, but he was fatally misjudging the situation.</p>\n<p>If it is for the sake of revenge for her murdered husband, then it does not even matter if Kriemhild sells her soul to the devil for she loves Siegfried so much to the extent that she would do so. Her hatred was not only pointed towards Hagen, the one who killed Siegfried, but also towards Gunther, her older brother. And then, it has been decided that even Kriemhild herself, who was taken prisoner to her hatred, would therefore be brought down by an attack filled with a righteous spirit. Furthermore, it was Siegfried’s beloved sword, Balmung, that Kriemhild used to kill Hagen, so there are even people that said that after twists and turns, Siegfried has fulfilled his revenge. However, it was still certain that Siegfried and Hagen were once friends whom exchanged drinks of alcohol and talked together of their dreams as well.</p>\n<p>For the times when he is summoned as a Servant, Siegfried will think to himself. Of how he was celebrated as a hero who killed a dragon, but the only thing he did in the end was nothing more than giving birth to further tragedy. An absolute retribution, as if to say, ‘Since you were spilling the blood of various people so far, you will even spill the blood of the people you are protecting.’ Therefore, his self-esteem is constantly negative, and in one way or another, he is muttering thus:</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="vlad-iii">Vlad III</h4>\n<p>“I’m really sorry for inconveniencing you in some other world.”</p>\n<h4 id="brynhildr">Brynhildr</h4>\n<p>“I want you to calm down and take a deep breath.
