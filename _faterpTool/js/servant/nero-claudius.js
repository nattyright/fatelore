She has a passionate nature, and although she is generous with love relationships because of matters during her lifetime among other things, she has a side to her where she would pout if those relationships were extravagant to her.<br>Still, Nero does not doubt of herself as a genius, calling herself an artist too, and she possesses a unique sense of beauty. Her unconditional justice is “to be beautiful.” She likes pretty boys and handsome elders. She likes beautiful girls even more. She loves anything so long as it is beautiful, no matter what it is. A “tyrant” who, while extolling herself as the supreme art, also extols the lives of every person as beautiful. Above all else, a dazzling girl who is also more self-centered than anyone; it feels as if she symbolizes a life that spectacularly fell.</p>\n<p>There are hardly any Masters who will summon her out of that history.

There is never a time where she will love something that is disconnected from that definition, and even if it is the command of a Master who exchanged a contract with her as a Servant, she will absolutely not obey them if she felt that they are ugly. There is no mage who wishes to summon a Servant who would decide to evaluate their standards by such “beauty”, and in the Holy Grail War of the Moon as well, Servants are summoned not because of a Master, but by going down into the selection grounds for their own intentions.<br>Although she is a lonely person, Nero is furthermore proud in that she would never sell herself cheaply, only feeling like contracting with a partner who she deemed to be a genius on the same level as herself. For that reason, if there is a partner she once approved of as her Master, she would not point out or even criticize their inexperience, and from the bottom of her heart, she would not look down on them as well. It seems one can gain her straightforward favour in the event that they are able to answer her expectations, that they are both rejoicing together, and that the trust in each other are being strengthened.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“Silence!

He is the Fifth Emperor of Imperial Rome. That life of his was coloured with schemes and poison, and in Rome during the 50~60 AD period, he oppressed all religious influences and the Senate. In the Roman period, because of his stance towards the Senate, and because of his oppression towards Christians thereafter, it caused him to be called a tyrant. It is being said that the “Revelation of Saint John the Divine” was written out of opposition towards this oppression.<br>Although Nero was enthroned as emperor at 17-years-old, he had demonstrated his talent as a competent judge from before that enthronement. After his enthronement, he boasted tremendous popularity with the citizenry due to his lavish policies, and he had excelled in diplomacy too. He also personally participated in the “Nero Fest” – an athletic meet which has three groups of competitions: music, gymnastics and equestrian – that followed the example of and was hosted after the Olympics.<br>Because of a rebellion that occurred in the year 69<sup id="fgo-material-i.character.n2" class="note"><a title="n2" href="#fgo-material-i.character.note2">2</a></sup>, Nero was driven out of the emperor’s throne and escaped from Rome.
