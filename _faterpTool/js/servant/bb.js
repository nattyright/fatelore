The cup that has been held by the Whore of Babylon, who appears in the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. It is a fake Holy Grail, but it is surely because it is a fake Holy Grail that it has become a “genuine” Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans without a regard to what is right and wrong. Concerning the Christians who regarded honourable poverty as a virtue in those days, this grail, which was formed as a symbol of riches such as gold, was surely to them the connotation of corrupted wealth and greed, as well as the vanity that one decides to adorn themselves in. Although it was clear at that point in time that it is called a cup held by the Whore of Babylon, who is the personification of the Roman Empire, this grail symbolizes the riches of the world, which inverted the words of Christ of “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth.”</p>\n<p>“Now, it’s such a trivial story since it doesn’t even have annny sort of relation to me, so… it’s throoown away into the trash can!

In order to enhance her calculation faculties, she predated/dismantled NPCs, AIs, and even Servants on top of that with black noises to utilize them as her own memory. A retrofit addition that does not spare herself from breaking down, but as a result, BB has been improved into a hyper grade AI that possesses an enormous capacity. These circumstances are similar to a city on reclaimed land that continues to construct buildings even while it is submerging, or maybe even Frankenstein’s monster as well.</p>\n<h3 id="potnia-theron-womb-of-all-animals-ex">Potnia Theron: Womb of All Animals: EX</h3>\n<p>Potnia Theron (Animal Mistress). It is the Authority of the goddesses whom BB compiled and absorbed from the abyss of the Moon Cell. It is the embodiment of the power to create all things that the Mother Goddesses possess, originating approximately 8000 years ago from a goddess who already lost her name (the goddess of Çatalhöyük), and branching to Tiamat, Cybele, Ishtar, Inanna, Anat, Astarte, Gaia, Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, Athena, and so forth. Many of these goddesses have been pictured with an appearance that has a mural crown on them. That is because many of these goddesses were also simultaneously the guardian deities of cities.</p>\n<p>This Authority is symbolized by things like the gates that opened in the earth and the sky (the caves and the moon), the whirlpools and waterspouts of the sea, and the craters of volcanoes, and from these, it gives birth to evil influences that bring about every sort of death. However, after these evils have finished spreading death, it promises a definite good harvest and fecundity. This Authority is none other than the power to bring death at the same time as creating life. The Earth Mother Goddesses are guardian deities that were worshipped by the people and blesses them with their divine protection, and at the same time, they are also the very sacrifices that feed the people with the grain and crops as well as with the beasts of the plains and forests that were brought into existence from their bodies. The Earth Mother Goddesses nourish humans with their own flesh and blood, and when time goes by, they kill those humans for their own nourishment in order to restore their flesh and blood, before they once again feed humans with the restored flesh and blood. This process is the very circle of the food chain too, and one could surely say that this cycle of life and death is the true nature of the Earth Mother Goddesses. With this Authority, nearly all these goddesses either gave birth to countless monsters and giants and became a threat to the gods and mankind, or they birthed heroes and protected the people after that. On the topic of threats, Tiamat and Gaia are examples of that, while on the topic of mothers of heroes, Hera is an example of that.</p>\n<p>Those born on this earth cannot go against the Authority of the Mother Goddess. That is because it would mean rebelling against the system of life itself. However, it is surely when one has separated from the earth, aims to venture into outer space, and has finished their childhood as an intelligent lifeform that they would break free from this Authority. The wish of Çatalhöyük is for when that day has arrived.</p>\n'},zh:{name:{id:"personal-skills",name:"保有技能"},source:{id:"fgo-material-v",name:"FGO material V"},img:"",translation:"Akiraka",category:[],html:'<h3 id="十顶王冠：ex→d">十顶王冠：EX→D</h3>\n<p>权能级的超级技能。<br>所谓十顶王冠，指的是十位邪恶之王；所谓七座山丘，指的是令人厌恶的恶之都市。<br>单纯来看，就是能将所受的伤或者发生过的事情等各种结果“变为不存在”的技能。<br>实际上，只要有这个技能，BB就是无敌的。</p>\n<p>『开玩笑的啦，这都是过去的事情了。<br>你看，无敌外挂什么的在他人眼里会显得很不像样吧？<br>这次美丽又可爱的BB酱根本不需要这种技能了啦☆　<br>啊，但稍微用一下还是OK的哦？　你看~就像这样！<br>大家最喜欢的，邪恶又可爱的BB酱降临，的说！』</p>\n<h3 id="黄金之杯：ex→c">黄金之杯：EX→C</h3>\n<p>通往兽之路。BB所持的黄金之杯。亦即圣杯。<br>根据所有者的厚颜无耻来任性妄为地实现愿望的负之圣杯。<br>启示录中巴比伦大淫妇所持之杯。<br>虽然是伪圣杯，但正因为它是伪圣杯，才会成为无分正邪地实现人类愿望的“真正的”圣杯。<br>对当时以清贫为美德的基督教徒来说，由金子这种财富象征所构成的杯子，正正是意味着污秽的财富与贪婪，以及矫饰己身的虚伪。<br>当说明到这是身为罗马帝国化身的巴比伦大淫妇手持的杯子时就很明瞭了，这个杯子与基督徒所述的『不要为自己积攒财宝在地上』的正相反，象征着地上的财富。</p>\n<h3 id="自我改造：ex">自我改造：EX</h3>\n<p>改造自身的技能。<br>Moon Cell所制作的AI有着 “不能提升自己的机能”这一绝对命令。<br>然而，因为故障而得以从这桎梏当中摆脱开来的BB开始扩张自己的机能。<br>为了提高计算能力，用黑色噪声捕食·分解NPC、AI、甚至Servant，并把他们当做自己的记忆体来使用。<br>不惜自我崩溃也要附加扩建的结果，就是BB化为了拥有庞大容量的超级AI。这副模样就有如一边沈入水中一边不断扩建填海造地都市一样，抑或说是弗兰肯斯坦的怪物一般。</p>\n<h3 id="百兽母胎：ex">百兽母胎：EX</h3>\n<p>Potnia Theron。<br>这是BB自Moon Cell的深渊中编辑并获取的女神权能。<br>发源自早在约8000年前便已失去名字的女神（加泰土丘女神），派生为提亚玛特、库柏勒、伊什塔尔、伊南娜、阿娜特、阿斯塔蒂、盖亚、赫拉、阿耳忒弥斯、阿芙洛狄忒、德墨忒尔、雅典娜等，是母神所拥有的创造万物之力的具现。<br>给人的印象大多是壁形头冠。<br>这是因为这些女神中的大多数，同时也是都市的守护神。<br>以大地与天空中敞开的门（洞穴和月亮）、海流漩涡与龙卷风、火山口等作为象徴，从中诞生出一切带来死亡的灾害。<br>但是，这些祸害在散布完死亡之后，又必将带来丰收与高产。<br>该权能正是在死亡同时又创造出生命的力量。<br>大地母神是受到人类崇拜，并会给予人类加护的守护神，同时也是从自身产出的谷物与农作物、原野与森林的兽类来养育人类的牺牲其本身。<br>大地母神以自身血肉来养育人类，又随时间经过将那些人杀死并当作自己的粮食来回复自身血肉，又再次以回复的血肉来养育人类。<br>这一过程也是食物链的闭环本身，这个生与死的循环，可以说正是大地母神的本质。<br>大部分女神藉由该权能，诞生出无数的怪物或巨人来威胁诸神与人类，抑或是诞生下英雄来守护人类。<br>举例而言，威胁人类的是提亚玛特与盖亚，英雄之母则是赫拉。<br>诞生于这片大地的存在，是无法忤逆母神的权能的。<br>因为这就等同于在反抗生命系统本身。<br>然而在离开大地，以宇宙为目标，结束作为智慧生命而言的幼年期的时候，该权能就会被打破了吧。加泰土丘的愿望，便是这一日的到来。</p>\n'}}},{parent:"bb",source:"fgo-material-v",id:"noble-phantasm",weight:3,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"noble-phantasm",name:"Noble Phantasms"},source:{id:"fgo-material-v",name:"FGO material V"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:'<h3 id="ccc">C.C.C.</h3>\n<table>\n  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Range</td><td>1~10</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>1 person</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Cursed Cupid Cleanser.</p>\n<p>It was once a Noble Phantasm called the Spiritron Imaginary Trap (Cursed Cutting Crater) that BB operated, but she has now brought out a new technique with a shit-eating grin, saying “Since I used, that, so many times by now, I got tired of it.

Even if she flubs her condescending manners and speeches, BB is a wire pulling girl who plunges forward as she is. Her main personality points are introverted, confident and active. Although she originally had a reserved character that did not move forward before, if it is for the sake of her beloved one, she will devotedly become active as the personification of a love’s awakening. Meekly from the start, she was a gentle AI that performed health care on Masters, but by having acquired “love”, she woke up to the fact that she “cannot save anything just by enduring through things”, so she threw away everything for the sake of her beloved one, a hard working-type heroine who resolved to fight. The strongest case of that is terrific when it is a young docile woman who erupts to a large degree.</p>\n<p>The words heard from BB assume the air of greatness, but sometimes they would go around in circles since her character was originally docile and reserved. BB herself plays the part of a villain in high spirits, but because there is no grounding in her being one, she completely fails in being a villain in the end. Regarding her confidence, she potentially has it because of her sadistic tastes. Her little devil characteristic stems from here. Additionally, since she is an enduring-and-enduring-only-to-later-explode-type, she displays a dreadfully extreme sadism during the moments when she shows that type of person she is. In the middle of playing out the part of a villain, she gets into a kind of high of “This is to-tal-ly fun!”, but withdrawing to the backstage and becoming composed, she becomes troubled to the point that she is in low spirits, saying “How embarrassing… Even though I planned to perform it more stylishly…”, and this series of events is a one-set course of events for her.</p>\n<p>Although BB created the Alter Egos – lower grade AIs – as familiars to assist her in her work, her relationship with the Egos is bad. Which is not surprising because they are not “copies of BB’s persona”, but AIs “manufactured to be based on BB’s persona”, so that being the case, the Alter Egos each have differing views from BB, their parent. Meltryllis and Passionlip are not avatars, but Alter Egos (different personas), so they are designated as such for that reason.</p>\n<h3 id="attitude-towards-master">Attitude towards Master</h3>\n<p>Without tearing down her wicked underclassman character, BB sincerely serves as a Servant. There are no personal romantic feelings in that. Although BB’s misanthropy is not any different, she loves the “good humans themselves” as gratitude to the person who once taught her.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“I’ve turned up to the rumoured Chaldea, for the walls between worlds aren’t even a big deal to me!

Ohhhh, even when many thousands of years elapse, it’s WONDERFUL to see everybody, among other things, not progressing! Even the wicked BB-chan is unintentionally being sympathetic to this!”<br>“Eh? You’re asking why I can call you senpai with confidence even though we’re classmates, when you’re thinking I’m the Senpai to you in something? Is that right…? That’s wrong. Tsk, that’s like, compleeetely wrong. “Senpai” is directed to only one person in this universe, a Senpai of the “Oh… impossible, how precious…” type. On the other hand, “senpai” is something to use towards a new TOY. Please proooperly bear in mind about that subject ok, s-e-n-p-a-i?”<sup id="fgo-material-v.character.n1" class="note"><a title="n1" href="#fgo-material-v.character.note1">1</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>The rampaging AI that caused Case: CCC on SE.RA.PH. A junior devil heroine who jauntily appeared at the Far Side of the Moon. BB manipulated a Master there as a cheerful and precocious young underclassman. She was the management AI in control of the school infirmary, but due to a bug, her self-preservation’s command system went into a rampage. Arriving at the conclusion of “continuing her self-preservation no matter what the sacrifice” because of a certain motive, she took in NPCs, Servants and Masters into herself, completely becoming a monster that continues to grow. Declaring that she “hates humans”, she drew in a certain Master to the Far Side of the Moon and tormented them. BB herself believes that she is normal, but when observing her objectively, she has obviously gone mad. One can feel the contradictions of her superabundant affection/disordered love and hate from her every word and deed hanging in the air, but for what caused that, it can be referred to in the “CCC” Story.</p>\n<p>Also, the value of her Luck parameter was of the lowest rank, E-, but because of the hard work (and devotion) done by BB herself to the extent that it distorted the World, her Luck grew to the Rank of EX. In short, she has once accomplished a “miracle” that is impossible to accomplish unless her Luck was assumed to be “Luck: EX”.</p>\n<p><div style="text-align:center">◆</div></p>\n<p>The records of a cyber demon that once existed, a cyber demon that would be dispatched as an AI for the use of resolving CCC (a special case), was salvaged. Due to the incident where Kiara of the FGO World was being identified with the Kiara of the CCC World, the Moon Cell copied the data of BB from records that were located within malignant information (records that were never browsed) as a countermeasure to that, temporarily transformed her into a Servant, and dispatched her to the FGO World. (That is because BB, who is a user of the Imaginary Numbers Space, happens to be suitable in being able to manage Kiara.) Thus, although it is a “reproduction of BB”, BB has reached the point where she is able to intervene at Seraphix as an independent cyber lifeform. The BB who came out to the FGO World conducts herself as a little devil just like during the occasion of the “CCC Incident”, but for her, the “CCC Incident” has become an event that feels like it even happened tens of thousands of years ago. Moreover, she can take the form of a Servant in this way only in the “Fate/Grand Order” World, and she further grasps the matter that someone like BB does not exist in the original “CCC World”. BB understands the situation in that she is just an overnight dream.</p>\n<p>Even so, BB remembers the event where a Master had taught her love on the Moon. She remembers the love that she acquired for eternity, the conclusion that “BB” reached.</p>\n<p>Despite flaming them with abusive language, BB chooses to support the humans, because “a fellow human had taught her love.” BB was perfected as an AI and grew into a species that surpasses mankind as an intelligent lifeform. By all rights, there is neither a reason for her to protect mankind, nor is there a reason for her to save them. However, while that may be true, AIs do not consider “humans as something on a lower order.” It is ironic that wanting to establish a hierarchical order is a trait only humans have. BB pledges to her former benefactor that she will help the species called “humans” that had created her, and that had taught her love.</p>\n<p>BB places herself not as “a tool that saves humanity”, but as “a devil that does things such as tempting humanity, and sometimes helping humanity.”<br>“Therefore, even if you’ve grown to like me, it’s futile you hear? Because no matter how madly in love you are with BB-chan, I’ll never be caught♥” says BB herself while showing a shit-eating grin.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="meltryllis">Meltryllis</h4>\n<p>“On the topic of final specs, she’s an unmanageable ego that ranks next to me, someone who can “quickly grow strong if left alone”, no?

Although she acts like she’s part of the innocent bunch, she’s someone like “I want to approach the people I’m in love with and get bullied by them instead, EEK!☆”, so she’s not inferior to Melt either when it comes to the depth of her performance.”</p>\n<h4 id="kiara-sessyoin">Kiara Sessyoin</h4>\n<p>“Huuuuh?

I use “Senpai” with the capitalized S for the first and “senpai” with the lower-case S for the second. It may be hard to identify which senpai is being referred to if it comes first in a translated sentence, but you should be able to identify which senpai BB is referring to by the context behind the sentences.</li>\n</ol>\n'},zh:{name:{id:"character",name:"人物"},source:{id:"fgo-material-v",name:"FGO material V"},img:"",translation:"",category:[],html:'<p><span id="contact" class="contact"><a href="../contact/">!missing・contribute</a></span></p>\n'}}},{parent:"bb",source:"fgo-material-v",id:"comment-from-illustrator",weight:5,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"comment-from-illustrator",name:"Comment from Illustrator"},source:{id:"fgo-material-v",name:"FGO material V"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:"<p>Whenever I see her now, I think… ‘Just to be frank for a moment, but I wonder if I drew her eyes too big…’!

Such as, the embroidered badge and her knee-high stockings. I even got to draw Nurse BB and she was very fun to do as well.
