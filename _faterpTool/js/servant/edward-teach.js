There were much bigger things lay beyond, and many people dreamt of making a killing the quick and easy way, and so they make their name as pirates.<br>And then, one among them had established a legend as a pirate. Blackbeard-----Edward Teach.<br>Although, it is not clear whether Edward Teach was his real name, nor is his lineage before becoming a pirate.<br>What is certain is that he had once been employed under Benjamin Hornigold, who had been a powerful pirate at the time.<br>Perhaps it was not within him to work under someone; soon, he withdrew from under Hornigold’s flag to captaining and starting up his own pirate crew.<br>And then at one point, after he had plundered the French ship La Concord, he furnished it with forty cannons and renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge. Having managed to obtain just about the most powerful ship in the Caribbean Sea, he had truly reached the golden age of his piracy.<br>The alias Blackbeard was wellknown in the Caribbean Sea. To speak nothing of ordinary sailors, even the other pirates and his own underlings had feared his atrocity. White fuses are weaved within his wellgrown beard, his blazing and burning eyes are like that of a beast itself------it was said that it was only natural of him to be even extolled as the personification of the goddess of hell.</p>\n<p>One night, he was drinking together with his underlings.<br>But suddenly. Like they had thought a shooting has begin, unaware that the Devil looms above; the underling on the other side had had his kneecap blasted away.<br>“Sometimes I gotta blow an underling down. Gotta keep ya scallywags shiverin’ yer timbers that I’m yer captain.”<br>That cruelness of his had made his underlings believed that Blackbeard is the personification of the Devil himself.<br>He was both cruel as well as eccentric, but as the many countries of the world established the countermeasures against pirates, it also looms as a threat for his actions. Although he had once retired from piracy due to the amnesty from the English monarch, he had completely, without any remorse, resumed it once again at a different location. In the end, the order to subjugate him was handed down.<br>Receiving a surprise attack from the navy, Blackbeard together with barely twenty of his underlings boldly welcomed them in open fire. Even after being cut in 20 different places and shot 5 times, Blackbeard kept on fighting with raging expression; but in the middle of reloading his gun, he had finally used up all of his strength and been defeated.</p>\n<p>According to the legend.<br>Blackbeard had been taken down by beheading. His head was suspended on the bowsprit, but his body was thrown away to the sea. And thereupon, for three days and three nights his body had swum about the ship’s surrounding in search of his head-----<br>Blackbeard has no shortage for daring and brutal episodes such as that. But then, in what way and just how and where did he get the information; before anyone had realized it, he had changed into an oddball that speaks with hopeless otaku verbal tic.<br>Furthermore, going by the flow of things from the start, with the otaku knowledge added he had only become completely unmanageable.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="all-female-character">All female character</h4>\n<p>Everybody is a member of my hare (the rest of the sentence is plastered with blood, impossible to be discerned)</p>\n<h4 id="francis-drake">Francis Drake</h4>\n<p>For me, she’s my fated rival.
