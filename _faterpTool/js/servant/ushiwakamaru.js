Despite her beautiful figure, showing an appearance like a flower blooming in the moonlight, Ushiwakamaru is without self-assertion. She does not have a talkative disposition that can express a beautiful voice that would draw everybody in to listen to it in ecstasy, but she will decide to speak at a necessary event or occasion if needed of her. Also, she approves not of one boasting about their outstanding arts of war, but of one who proves their arts of war at the scene of battle and with nothing but results. It is possible to say that this person is a paragon of knighthood who discerns propriety and speaks with actions before words… and, someone openly seen as no more than a genuine fighting machine.</p>\n<p>Because her character is straightforward and does not put on a falsehood, all the things Ushiwakamaru does completely becomes the “shortest, fastest straight line” towards the goal. When ordinary people do this, they usually fail and reflect on their failure, and they consider… and polish their plans and a variety of things subsequently from that… but the problem is, Ushiwakamaru is a super genius. Because she does not fail at these things, she has completely grown to as she is now with this unmanageable nature.</p>\n<p>In battle, Ushiwakamaru is cold-hearted, cool-headed, and the personification of the most suitable hand, but ordinarily, she is a girl who wholeheartedly wishes the following: “I want to become my older brother’s power, I want to be the head’s strength, and I want to help this splendid figure.” To address this aspect in a few words, “a faithful dog with a broken brake.” She is friendly, bright and faithful, but a screw got out of place somewhere… no, it becomes unclear of its whereabouts.</p>\n<h3 id="motivation-·-attitude-towards-master">Motivation · Attitude towards Master</h3>\n<p>Ushiwakamaru’s talents sublimated up to its utmost limits and her extraordinary loyalty become intertwined, and to a person who does not notice that, they will not only think, “Even though this unthinkable genius does not truly have a reason to, she is becoming so emotionally attached to me”, it might not be evident that they will harbour fear at that peculiarity too. On the other hand, how Ushiwakamaru treats her subordinates is surely demonic. “Die on behalf of me so you can make an easy place for me to fight. That’s your role.”</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“Ushiwakamaru, I’ve called on you. I humbly receive you, and I shall serve you as a samurai with my whole heart.”<br>“Even though I was betrayed many times, I still want to fight for someone’s sake. If you would allow me, my Lord, together until the end, let me… no, it’s nothing.”<br>“Pompoko… lin.”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>Minamoto no Yoshitsune. In Japan, one can dare say her to be a figure where there is probably no person in existence who does not know that name. That recognition is also frequently apparent in the proverb called “Sympathy for a Tragic Hero”. Namely, a tragic military commander who, while having natural talents and was overflowing with charisma, was driven off in defeat at the end of a confrontation with Yoritomo, her older brother who was jealous of this prominent figure’s nature————Apart from that matter of whether it was distinctly right or wrong… This Ushiwakamaru is unmistakably a monster.</p>\n<p>In any case, Ushiwakamaru cannot read the hearts of men. She cannot understand this matter, perplexed at her own human being.</p>\n<p>“Love, what in the world is it?” Ushiwakamaru inquires of such. She was left under the care of a temple from when she was very young, she was raised up while as someone unaware of either a mother’s love or a father’s love, and a proper parents’ love as well as a love spun from a significant other are unknown to her. If there is only one fact, Ushiwakamaru was a samurai. A samurai is a person who serves a lord and swears allegiance to them. Concerning her, that was the only truth, and with the exception of that, everything else was not worth worrying about. Separated from her parents since when she was a very young child, she was disciplined by a tengu deep in the mountains, and she was never able to nurture her “humanity”. That is the way a faithful dog ought to be… Close to a genuine beast, she fights for the sake of her master without concerning herself. For the cause of being praised, Ushiwakamaru triumphed. She even won thoroughly. That is to say, she removed all ostentation from herself, for that is none other than because she chose a way to slaughter her enemies quite efficiently. Yoritomo was afraid of that, and Ushiwakamaru’s circumstances did not make her popularity rise. It may not be discovered that her fangs could turn towards her allies if it is to tear off their veneers… They were afraid of her inhuman nature that did not truly fit in with the relationship of gaining profit by acquiring power.</p>\n<p>After he destroyed the Taira clan, Yoritomo immediately began to obliterate Ushiwakamaru. Her social position has not yet settled within their clan, and if he does not destroy her, he will always become anxious about the future. At any rate, Yoshitsune does not understand politics. She does not understand the hearts of men. If an antiquated beast similar to that exists as his kin, then it will result in Yoritomo being unable to make the era he is aiming for. It was rumoured in the public streets that Yoritomo killed his younger brother at the end of a power struggle. Ushiwakamaru consented. The synopsis was correct. Regardless of Yoritomo’s intentions, and regardless of Ushiwakamaru’s feelings, if this is the state of affairs around her, then the sense of having herself be disposed of was reasonable.</p>\n<p>Since the Taira disappeared, Ushiwakamaru was Yoritomo’s next political opponent. In addition, as far as Masako Houjou, her older brother’s wife, was concerned, the likes of Minamoto no Yoshitsune was probably unneeded. If so, Ushiwakamaru will behave as her older brother’s enemy and do nothing but fight and die in battle, all in accordance with what her older brother desires. Although Ushiwakamaru intended of such, her subordinates persuaded her, and it resulted in her escaping to Oshu. And yet, Yoritomo persistently chased her. He deemed her not as family, but as an inhuman monster, and chased after her.</p>\n<p>————“That’s strange, you know. This is somewhat unreasonable.”<br>————“Though, it was human beings that preferred emotions rather than gains and losses.”<br>————“I only wanted my older brother to praise me, but I was lacking something.”<br>————“I’m sorry… that I couldn’t change up to my last moments————”</p>\n<p>Although Ushiwakamaru was defeated at Oshu, her name was carved into the history of Japan. All without understanding the essence of anyone as she is.</p>\n<p><div style="text-align:center">◆</div></p>\n<p>In Fate/Grand Order, Ushiwakamaru is a girl who loves her brother, and is making great efforts as a girl who loves her Master. That cool behaviour that does not even get agitated by anything… from there is a ferocity one step short of an unleashed Berserker’s, and anyone would probably be bewildered by that side of hers.</p>\n<p>If her Master is vexed about “If that enemy’s ship is usable…”, Ushiwakamaru will gallop and head towards the ship visibly like a gale while saying “My Lord, please leave the decisions to me!”, and in a few minutes later, she would inform her Master about the ship and say “My Lord, this way!” However, except for the sailors operating the ship for the good of everyone, everybody else will be completely crushing the scene of carnage where it is like the enemies are bound for the netherworld.</p>\n<p>Ushiwakamaru is a cool-headed subordinate, but as expected, she too is a person who draws on the blood of the Minamoto clan, a clan of which its origin used to be the word “ruler”. She is only a faithful dog towards her Master, and she will display a cold-hearted yet sadistic side to anyone except her Master.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="musashibou-benkei">Musashibou Benkei</h4>\n<p>“The man calls himself Benkei… and I understand the gist of it, but it’s also extremely audacious of him to call himself Benkei.

Each one of them wears the skin of a person with common sense, but given that they are oddballs, their wavelengths greatly match.</p>\n<p>“When I speak the things on my mind, mostly everybody gives me a serious look, but Lady Jing Ke and Lady Martha openly continue on the conversation like nothing strange happened.
