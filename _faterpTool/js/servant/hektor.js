Even though he was eventually defeated————it was not only his individual military prowess, but Hector also having that daring smile worn on him face that made the Achaean army thoroughly suffer.

He was called “Hector of the Shining Helmet”. Hector scolded Troy who was at a disadvantage in regards to numbers, moved to the aged king who was his father, brought together the Trojan army, and continued to wage war against the Achaeans. When and after Hector lost to Achilles in a one-on-one duel, the Trojan side proceeded to decline.</p>\n<p>Originally, the impetus of the Trojan War rose forth from the beginning when Paris, the younger brother of Hector, snatched away Helen, the Queen of the Achaeans. Helen had received abuse from her husband Menelaus, and as far as Paris was concerned, it was a justified reason for him to save her back then. (In the first place, Menelaus married Helen for the purpose of reaching Elysium after death. Helen was a priestess of the Moon Goddess, and it was a condition to marry her in order to reach Elysium.)</p>\n<p>No matter what, Hector could not grow to dislike his younger brother, who was not able to look at the whole picture and completely made the situation worse by saving a person just in front of his eyes. “Older brother. I can’t get used to becoming king. I… can’t abandon a crying woman before my eyes after all.” If they returned Helen, it might not be obvious that it will result in reparations in some way or another, such as the cession of territories and even Paris’ decapitation in the case they do so. However, Hector refused those options and decided to fight.</p>\n<p>“There’s no justice in this conflict. If that happens to be so, then it’s really about the resentment towards Paris for harbouring Helen for himself.”</p>\n<p>And as he recited this to himself, Hector has decided that he will fight to the bitter end his opponents, the Greek heroes who gathered in the Achaean army, for ten years thereafter. Hector was viewed as the strongest warrior of the Trojan army, their army commander, and even a politician on top of that, easily betraying even the expectations of the gods and having cornered the Achaean army to the brink of retreat for a period of time.</p>\n<p>However, the war situation was proceeding to be gradually overturned by Achilles, a hero loved by the gods. Although Hector held out somehow by sometimes repeatedly escaping and by sometimes repeatedly fighting, all while repeatedly making provocations, he was compelled to engage in a one-on-one duel in a semi-compulsory manner because of Achilles’ spear, which was his foe’s Noble Phantasm.</p>\n<p>Hector already resigned for his luck to run out, but on the other hand, he had not cast away his temptation for victory, so he accepted the one-on-one duel, where he happened to lose that duel. However, he realized the secret of Achilles’ body just before he died, so he carved a dying message on his body. Paris became aware of that message when Hector’s body was later returned to Troy, and later on in the war, he happens to splendidly shoot through Achilles’ heel by borrowing the support of the Sun God Apollo.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="achilles">Achilles</h4>\n<p>As a Servant, Achilles has not appeared yet in the Grand Orders.</p>\n<p>“Hey, if he comes to stand out, I can say with confidence that this old man intends to run away immediately!”</p>\n<h4 id="leonidas">Leonidas</h4>\n<p>As similar defensive-type Servants, in one way or another, they would occasionally talk together about things such as “how to be able to hold onto these things in these situations.” And among other things in the opposite direction, the talk would be about muscle foundations, so with that being the case, it does not result in much of a consultation then for Hector.</p>\n'}}},{parent:"hektor",source:"fgo-material-ii",id:"comment-from-illustrator",weight:5,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"comment-from-illustrator",name:"Comment from Illustrator"},source:{id:"fgo-material-ii",name:"FGO material II"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:"<p>A hero in the Trojan War… to an old man who feels like he is bound to be aloof from the world.
