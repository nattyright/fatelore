At the same time as being such a person, Fionn is open-minded and pleasure-seeking. He also does not bear any doubt, not even a tiny bit, about his own charm. “Come now, for even these days, I’m completely shining, no?!” Similarly like his looks, his conducts are also elegant. However, his way of thinking is comparatively bold. Because he has the disposition of his youth that is suitable for this outward appearance, one would not particularly catch sight of that tenacious personality in the later anecdotes of his past life. He is self-conscious of his own beauty as a reality. Regarding his looks, it is something he was born with, so he does not have to boast about it, but it is a pet theory that it is something that can even be utilized.</p>\n<p>Although he has a personality that is filled with a lot of love, even Fionn has that sort of love that is treated as unique and eternal, consecrated only to his first wife. Only in the moments when he thinks about her, Fionn mac Cumhaill is not a knight leader, but one young man who is honest with himself.</p>\n<p>Even though he does not realize it, as a matter of fact, Fionn is deeply jealous. After decades of years later from his present appearance, of which this present appearance was the prime of his life as a knight, there was an anecdote where he resented his subordinate Diarmuid for snatching away his third wife, the beautiful Gráinne; later on, Fionn chose to let Diarmuid die without helping him after the latter fell into a predicament, solely out of the resentment that stemmed from his deep jealousy. As a result, Fionn stirred the disappointment of many of his subordinates after that incident, causing a war where the Knights of Fianna divided into two sides, and before long, even Fionn had lost his life in the middle of the conflict.</p>\n<h3 id="motivation-·-attitude-towards-master">Motivation · Attitude towards Master</h3>\n<p>Fionn will not make changes to his elegant speeches and conducts in regards to his Master. Because he also worked for the sake of the High King of Ireland since while he was alive, he has absolutely no reluctance in regards to acting under somebody as a Servant. As a hero, he takes into consideration that if he can work for the sake of the people, there will also be no problem of any kind for him because of that.</p>\n<p>The wish Fionn wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to fix his tendency to get into trouble with women.” He thinks that perhaps all the tragedies of his lifetime stemmed from his fate of having trouble with women, no matter what. However, since that is his way of thinking at the occasion of having materialized in this form, in the case of having materialized in another form, there is even the possibility in that he may have a different view and wish.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“When it comes to beauty, it’s my victory. So, I wonder who the victor will be if it comes to military prowess?”<br>“Hey, I’m strong. That’s bad luck for you, isn’t it?”<br>“Even if it’s to the extent that I wouldn’t call it omniscience, you would somewhat understand. For instance, if I materialized as a Caster, then it’s expected that I’m able to demonstrate the power of the Salmon of Knowledge even more.”<br>“Magnificent.

Yeees, wisdom is swelling up!”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>A descendant of the Celtic War God Nuada, and the leader of the glorious Knights of Fianna. A great hero who established many valourous deeds, such as by aiding the capital by killing a wicked Divine Spirit that manipulated slumber and flames as well as by defeating invaders and monsters as the guardian of Erin (Ireland). Having mastered Celtic magic and wisdom, Fionn is endowed with many abilities and Noble Phantasms.</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>Serving the High King of Erin, Fionn was a man who earned the achievements worthy for him to be declared the leader and further judged as the greatest knight of the Knights of Fianna. The fallen Divine Spirit Aillen, the magical Demon Boar, the horse of the underworld————he defeated a large number of these wicked yet powerful monsters, and in the end, he defeated even the War God Nuada, who is his divine ancestor, in battle; however, when times of peace come about, it has been said that he was a magnanimous man who spent his time quietly while carrying out hunts and the like together with his subordinates in the order of knights.</p>\n<p>Fionn willingly went on a journey as a great hero with nothing about that journey that can be criticized by others, but during his personal life, he had a fate of trouble with women. His first trouble was being charmed by a pair of beautiful sisters, having received a curse from that incident. His misfortune further continued thereafter, where seven years of his youth were stolen from him for antagonizing a fairy in a dispute concerning his first wife, and then, because of the dispute concerning Gráinne, his third wife, it resulted in the collapse of the glorious order of knights.</p>\n<p>Troubles with women. Is it not that he himself is surely the problem of those, and not that there is a problem with women? Up to his final moments, Fionn mac Cumhaill never really took that into consideration.<br>“What the heck went wrong?”<br>Even now, having transformed into a Heroic Spirit and having materialized as a Servant, he still does not comprehend that.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="diarmuid">Diarmuid</h4>\n<p>As far as Fionn himself, who materialized in his youthful appearance, is concerned, because whatever happened around his later years were no more than “memories of that time then, and not now”, he will definitely say to Diarmuid, “I’m glad to see you again in a long time”, without relatively minding about it.
