She is a holy maiden whose name is known not just in France, but across the whole wide world.</p>\n<p>At one point in the year 1839, the number of books that depicted Jeanne as a heroine had reached five hundred, and as of now in the present time, it is easy to imagine that such books of an unimaginable number have been published. She had set off on a trip for the sake of saving France at seventeen-years-old, and she was sentenced to death by burning at nineteen-years-old. Her activity in merely two years (though given that one of those years was her being in the position of prisoner, it was really about one year) has rewritten the history of the world.</p>\n<p>Saying “I heard a voice from heaven”, Jeanne leapt out of her own house, relied on the connections of those who believed in her words, and met with Charles VII. At this moment, Jeanne, who earned Charles VII’s trust by exactly and correctly guessing who he was when the latter had disguised and concealed himself as a subordinate, commanded a group of troops and continued to steadily advance, before she finally liberated Orléans. For the French army who had defeat occur again and again, this victory was something evidently miraculous. Because of this, the name of Jeanne d’Arc resounded not only in France but even in Italy and Germany. After Orléans was liberated, the English Crown had even ordered for discipline on their troops whom refused to cross over into France. The soldiers were afraid of being cursed by Jeanne d’Arc————the witch who turned the war situation around. When taking the situation into account at that time, depending on the trend of the Hundred Years’ War, the possibility that the very country called France could have been annihilated has not even been able to be discarded completely, and it may not be known that (although there are the French Revolution’s very many good points and bad points themselves) the advanced/democratic social system itself could have gotten a very late start.</p>\n<p>It is being said that the start of Jeanne’s fall came about because of her confrontation with Charles VII. After the coronation at Reims, Jeanne and those supporters of hers further attempted to advance towards Paris, but concerning Charles, who desired peace, she was gradually becoming an obstacle. Thus, in the Battle of Compiègne, Jeanne encountered a scathing betrayal where the gate that should have ushered her in as she was defending the rear guard at the time of her force’s withdrawal had closed on her instead, and she was then captured.</p>\n<p>Here is the glory of Jeanne d’Arc so far, and the time it took for that was but one year. And then, the remaining year were days like hell where she suffered all sorts of pains as one in the position of prisoner. Regarding Charles VII, he never paid for her ransom, and various theories were given for that, but in any case, as Gilles de Rais lamented, Jeanne had actually become a figure that was cast away by the state called France. Nonetheless, for the English side, they had to execute her not as a Saint, but as a witch. So they accordingly gathered top-notch theologians before they tried to denounce the revelations she received, her deeds, and her very existence————It was the beginning of an Inquisition. But Jeanne, who should be an illiterate country girl, eloquently responded to their inquiries and further saw through their traps that were set up from the standpoint of theology. Ultimately, with the trivial crime of having disguised herself as a man (for on the occasion of travelling, although it was called a crime, it was a custom for women to disguise themselves as men for the sake of protecting themselves from being raped, and it was something minor enough to be overlooked), she had been sentenced to death by being burned at the stake. About twenty-five years had passed since her death, and she, who was cursed at for being a witch and a prostitute, had her honour finally restored to her due to a reinstated trial that was carried out under the command of Charles VII.</p>\n<p>Jeanne did not care that much about suffering the humiliating experience of being burned at the stake, and after all, she was even resolved on top of that to be in the role of prisoner… Rather, is it not right for her in being able to have the resolve to also accept any kind of future? Even following what has been told repeatedly in either the genuine work or in other works, Jeanne does not recognize that she herself is a Saint. ‘It’s possible for an occurrence where someone has received a revelation to occur for anybody, and I can say with confidence that it was unexpectedly just me who was chosen for that occurrence.’ ‘Revelations can be given to all human beings, and I can say with confidence that if anyone prays to receive them, then they’re bound to receive them.’ But in the end, a person who took the trouble to receive those revelations did not appear in her lifetime.</p>\n<p>From the episode where she did not pull out her sword even once during her lifetime, Jeanne uses a flag as her weapon without making use of the sword hung on her waist. “La Pucelle: The Crimson Holy Maiden” is a Suicide Attack Noble Phantasm where flames blossom in full glory not from the sword’s blade, but from its hilt. It is an article where in the case that it is employed, Jeanne herself will also be extinguished. Without looking back on the life that she ran through, the holy maiden named Jeanne d’Arc constantly keeps her eye on the future. Even though she can lead the living, she knows that she cannot walk alongside them for she is already part of the deceased; but even despite knowing this, she will smile seemingly with contentment.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="jeanne-darc-alter">Jeanne d’Arc (Alter)</h4>\n<p>The girl who coercively came to force herself in from the other side of the coin. However, be that there was a time where they had opposed each other, Jeanne is a little happy when Jeanne Alter transformed into a Servant in that it is sort of like a vulgar younger sister was made, and she must never, ever let said person hear that.</p>\n<h4 id="gilles-de-rais-saber">Gilles de Rais (Saber)</h4>\n<p>A former brethren.

At that time, she was being considered as a character who feels like she forms a pair with Artoria, and if Artoria is treated as a girl knight, then Jeanne was consciously designed so that she becomes an older female knight in comparison to Artoria. For her third stage in FateGO, I collected all of my focus on the concept of a “holy maiden” that was left out at the time of her design, so concerning the result, I am thinking, ‘I wonder if I successfully brought out that characteristic into prominence.’ (Takeuchi Takashi)</p>\n"}}}]};new e({target:document.body,props:{attribute:a.attribute,content:a.content}});
