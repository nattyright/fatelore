Intervening into a fight between fellow monkeys to rescue his ally monkey, Sugriva, he performed a sneak attack on the enemy monkey, Vali. Unable to forgive that, Vali’s wife placed a curse on him.</p>\n<p>“Even if you are able to take back your queen, you will never share joy together with her again.”</p>\n<p>That curse still continues on even after Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. It has been arranged so that Rama, the reincarnation of the god Vishnu, will continue to pass by Sita, his beloved queen, for all his life. The day the two can cuddle close together is when they must take back their original forms and ascend to the heavens.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, that also meant eternal separation from Sita until then. Though she was recaptured from the hands of Ravana that one time, it has been decided that Sita would leave Rama’s side during that moment as the nation’s people voiced suspicions of her being unfaithful to him.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously. When Rama is being summoned, it has been decided so that the circumstances of this curse, at the time of being summoned by the Holy Grail, will have “Sita” be summoned instead as a different side of Rama. That is to say, it is also a sign that even being summoned due to the Holy Grail will not be able to make the two stand side-by-side.</p>\n<p>Rama is primarily not a Saber, and it would be more proper to summon him as an Archer. As far as he is concerned, it is because Brahmastra is an arrow that eliminates all things demonic. However, an exemplary anecdote that has to do with Sita is her bow (her Noble Phantasm is “Haradhanu Janaka: Peerless Bow of Reminiscence”), so considering the likelihood that she would be summoned, Sita could not be a Saber; thus, Rama takes that Class instead so that Sita can get the Class of Archer.</p>\n<p>… But then, since the Saber Class happens to be famed as the most superior of all the Classes, it may not be known that it was inevitable for Rama to choose this Class because being a young boy, he would try to put on a show for Sita.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="sita">Sita</h4>\n<p>Rama dreams of the day, that one day, where he fortuitously meets Sita.</p>\n<h4 id="arjuna">Arjuna</h4>\n<p>“Also, it is said that you were sharing your wife briefly.

For you, the finest good-looking guy one can think about right now!“ (There is no such western movie though). Drawing a shy expression, I thought, ’You’re super cute I tell you!’ In spite of him being a great king, I see that the contents of his character is like a great princess character when I was playing the game, so with that being the case, that does hit a moe point too, don’t you think?

Still, the concept for Sita is a girl with twintails, but in the beginning, I misunderstood it as ’Rama transforms and becomes this young woman!’ as the concept (what are you saying!), and because I was misunderstanding, I thought, ’Changing into those clothes and underwear whenever he transforms… He’s TOTALLY a pervert I tell you…’ I was relieved that he’s very much a different person. I’m thinking, ’Personally, because of this super satisfying design, I can’t draw any more of these characters for another ten years you know!’… And it’s also something called like… ’It looks like I stopped continuing my work for the next ten years (shudders).’ (Rin Kususaga)</p>\n'}}}]};
