But not just the fact that it’s a troublesome task, more than anything her pride refused such “boring job”.</p>\n<p>But father’s order is absolute. So reluctantly, Suzuka found an oni inhabiting Takkoku cave, Otakemaru<sup id="fgo-material-v.character.n3" class="note"><a title="n3" href="#fgo-material-v.character.note3">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>“I will make you my subject, so do as I say. First, invade Japan in my place.”</p>\n<p>That’s what she wrote to him. But for some reason he did not reply (with that kind of letter, of course not). Angered by his disrespectful attitude, Suzuka sent him a final letter explaining why she will come to kill him.</p>\n<p>“I, after countless times of being disrespected, am extremely pissed off. You, despite being an oni, dare to reject orders from me - Daughter of Tenma. Thus, it is certain that you are evil. Come to me so I can kill you. As Tenma’s daughter I’ll be fair and chop your head off from the front!”</p>\n<p>Good good, now Otakemaru will show up for sure. And then after I beat him up he will have to follow my orders, thought Suzuka.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, a swordsman shows up before Suzuka. He is Sakanoue no Tamuramaro.</p>\n<p>To put it bluntly, Suzuka fell in love at first sight, but pride takes priority. She attacked the demon who dare disobey her. She mistaken Sakanoue for Otakemaru. And Sakanoue is also wielding the sword he used to slay the onihime.</p>\n<p>But the story is different. The moment of their final clash, Sakanoue is about to lose, he screamed in desperation as his death is certain:</p>\n<p>“I was worried about this awhile ago! My name is Sakanoue no Tamuramaroooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Suzuka is like being struck by thunder, her eyes opened with a shocking expression “Whattt??”. Seizing that chance, he slashed her across her shoulder and the battle was decided.</p>\n<p>The defeated Suzuka fell down, but Sakanoue still could not believe in his last attack, thinking it’s deception. As a result, he did not kill Suzuka. Later on, Suzuka changed and fell in love with Sakanoue, and they lived together on Suzuka mountain.</p>\n<p>The couple had a daughter named Shourin<sup id="fgo-material-v.character.n4" class="note"><a title="n4" href="#fgo-material-v.character.note4">4</a></sup> together, and went on to exterminate the oni Otakemaru and Akuro.</p>\n<p>(In Fate interpretation, when Suzuka declared that “My life on Earth is only 25 years”, Sakanoue accepted that explanation)</p>\n<p>Of course the Demon King is angry, but seeing his daughter happiness, the daddy side in him thought “Hm…it can’t be helped. If she is laughing happily like that, then the country of human isn’t that bad afterall”.</p>\n<p>Just when we thought this would be a happy ending, a flag from the past popped up. It’s Otakemaru who received those disrespectful letters earlier. He also loves Suzuka!</p>\n<p>However, the pride of a man does not allow him to snuggle up to her, so his strategy was to wait till she arrives, but the result is what we’ve seen.</p>\n<p>Otakemaru got angry at Suzuka who fell to humans, and marked Sakanoue who took Suzuka away (in Otakemaru’s words: NTR) as the enemy. Day by day, the amount of curses weaving Takkoku cave continues to increase.</p>\n<p>To Suzuka it’s just an eyesore, but not for Sakanoue. He decided to battle Otakemaru.</p>\n<p>Suzuka, knowing from the start that Otakemaru’s body is as hard as rock that no arrow or sword can pierce, went to Takkoku cave herself and became Otakemaru’s (fake) wife.</p>\n<p>Of course, it was all for Sakanoue’s sake. However to deceive Otakemaru, only her knows the details of her plan. So without explaining to Sakanoue, she became Otakemaru’s wife, an oni princess, and used her Supernatural Power to soften his body. Three years later, she successfully assassinated Otakemaru in the cave.</p>\n<p>As she let out a sigh, thinking she can finally return home, she noticed another assassin appeared. It was Sakanoue who was devastated by the thought of Suzuka abandoning him, betrayed him, and his country was destroyed.</p>\n<p>Sakanoue, blinded by love and hate, walks towards Suzuka, who realized there’s no salvation left and that she made a mistake. Deep down she apologized to him, as she is killed by him.</p>\n<p>(If she is killed when considered doing an evil act, then at least Sakanoue will not be tortured by “regret that he killed his love one”)</p>\n<p>And thus, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro killed both Otakemaru and his wife.</p>\n<p>After this, it is uncertain if he realized the truth and went to the Underworld to take her back. There are various theories about whether the story of their reunion in the Underworld told in “Sakanoue and Suzuka Gozen’s activities” happened before or after she became Otakemaru’s wife.</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>Suzuka who drowns in love only has one wish, that is to be happy and live happily ever after with the one she loves.
