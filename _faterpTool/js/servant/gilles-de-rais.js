When Jeanne was captured in England, he tried to rescue her but ended failing.<br>After Jeanne’s death, he felt nostalgic about Jeanne when he stayed in Orléans in summer of 1435, and when a girl that claimed to be Jeanne appeared in 1439, he took action and tried to make her feel his strong emotions towards her by giving her his soldiers. However, he was enticed by the mage François Prelati at the same time, and by repeating rituals of black arts at his territory, he atrociously murdered hundreds of children as sacrifices.<br>It is said that he attempted to secure his fortune through alchemy, but there are also records of him having indulged himself in magecraft since he was young.
