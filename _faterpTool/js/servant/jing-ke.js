She views that roistering in alcohol together with friends is a supreme joy, but on the other hand, she has tastes in reading and swordsmanship, and she also likes talking with wise men.</p>\n<p>Dan, the Crown Prince of Yan, was anxious about Qin, whose power still continues to grow day after day, and his resentment towards them became stronger after he received a heartless treatment at the time when he consented to being a hostage for Qin, so he was finally determined in carrying out the assassination of Qin Shi Huangdi. Dan sought advice for the assassination from Tian Guang, a wise man so well known, there was no person in Yan who does not know of him. Tian Guang recommended Jing Ke for the assassination, but because of Dan’s careless words, he completely gave up his life after recommending Jing Ke.</p>\n<p>Jing Ke was moved by the trust made with Tian Guang’s life, so she accepted the assassination mission of Shi Huangdi. A plan was polished where she has an audience with Shi Huangdi by presenting the head of a general who was escaping from Qin and a map of Yan, but an assistant who will take that same life with Jing Ke was necessary for this mission.</p>\n<p>Jing Ke was thinking about bringing along a friend who can be trusted, but within the passage of time, Dan begins to question that maybe, Jing Ke was under fear. Reluctantly, Jing Ke decided to take a young man named Qin Wuyang, who was recommended by Dan. Qin Wuyang murdered a man at the age of 13, and was professing to be————a great man where there is not even a person who can compare with his experience nowadays at the age of 19, but Jing Ke recognizes that he is a coward.</p>\n<p>Although the audience with Shi Huangdi was going smoothly, just as she thought, Qin Wuyang was shivering and could not even take one movement forward, so Jing Ke unavoidably attempted a solo assassination. However, plenty of misfortunes overlapped with each other, and Jing Ke’s one attack had not reached Shi Huangdi. Furthermore, it was also reported that Qin Wuyang was killed by being trampled upon during a riot at this time as he fled. At the verge of death, Jing Ke laughed and sneered that “If I wanted to kill you, I could’ve done so, but it was my objective to take you as a hostage. Unfortunate, so unfortunate.” It is said that she was cut up into pieces by Shi Huangdi’s retainers. In addition, Jing Ke left behind one song at the time of her departure from Yan:</p>\n<p>“The wind blows, the river freezes. The hero fords, never to return!”</p>\n<p>… Jing Ke was already prepared in that she would not return alive, and it is said that at that time when she sang this verse, every person seeing her off started shedding tears.</p>\n<p>In future years, Gao Jianli, who was a friend of Jing Ke, attempted the assassination of Shi Huangdi too, but that likewise ended in failure.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="king-servants-in-general">King Servants in General</h4>\n<p>“Yeahhh, I want to stab them…”</p>\n'}}},{parent:"jing-ke",source:"fgo-material-ii",id:"comment-from-illustrator",weight:5,img:"",category:[],i18n:{en:{name:{id:"comment-from-illustrator",name:"Comment from Illustrator"},source:{id:"fgo-material-ii",name:"FGO material II"},img:"",translation:"Clyton",category:[],html:"<p>Although I made a design that placed an emphasis on her thigh which daringly reveals her legs as she has an anecdote where her thigh was slashed by Shi Huangdi, due to the battle scenes, I happen to get the feeling that she seems terribly cold in the snowy mountains and the like, so I felt a little pitiful for her as a result.
