He has no interest in wealth, whether the battle is an honourable one or not. And whether there is honour in battle or not, that however, is whether it was all in accordance with his sense of values (of which they are of the ancient Indian values) as a warrior.</p>\n<p>… However, when the opportunity has come, Arjuna will wonder and carry out all kinds of cowardly schemes. Although he is extremely hesitant in the preliminary stages, when he wonders if he can carry them out at that opportune time, he lets a wicked smile show. That must not be seen by anybody and everybody————suppose that, someone sees it. He warns himself then that he has no choice but to kill that person.</p>\n<h3 id="motivation-·-attitude-towards-master">Motivation · Attitude towards Master</h3>\n<p>Fundamentally quiet, Arjuna openly follows his Master like a butler, and to most Masters, he would also not show the slightest bit of pride and the like even though he was actually of royalty. However, if his Master decides to take a grip to the point of attaining their Servant’s true nature like some common Masters for instance, there is a likelihood where Arjuna is even willing to kill his Master. “Trust” is not the only thing that can be gained by grasping the true nature of a partner. There is also a possibility of losing “trust” surely from “having grasped the true nature of a partner.” For example, even if his partner chooses to accept that darkness, the way Arjuna carries that dark side is all the more something he feels ashamed of in that case.</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“I was summoned as the Servant Archer. Treat me well please.”<br>“It is not pleasant to worry about me. You and I, we should simply do what must be done. Is that good?”<br>“My True Name is Arjuna. Similarly like the times of battle, I will show my Master the way to victory, even now.”<br>“————You saw, my… smile?”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>If Karna is the “Hero of Charity”, Arjuna is indeed “The Awarded Hero”. He was born as the son of the King of Kuru, the third of the five Pandava brothers, and is also simultaneously the son of Indra.</p>\n<p>And his destined rival was Karna, his older brother from a different father. Arjuna – who was certainly a hero where every aspect of him, from his calibre to his personality, has no faults to point out and hit on – was expelled from his country due to his older brother being defeated in a gamble. Already at this moment, he had a premonition inside him where there will be an inevitable confrontation with Karna. Because one can see that Karna looks up to Duryodhana – who scowls at the five Pandava brothers as his archenemies – as his father.</p>\n<p>Every time Arjuna thinks of Karna, he shudders as if it appears that he was seeing himself reflected in a mirror. And then, with that being plain to see————he became frightened; furthermore, the reflected expression is similar to one possibly seeing through everything about him completely.</p>\n<p>“In my heart… resides ‘Black (Krishna)’.”</p>\n<p>He loved his brothers, and was loved in return. He loved both his father and mother, and was loved in return. He loved the people, and was loved in return. And yet, Arjuna finds himself staring at some place with those eyes that had grown cold.</p>\n<p>How terrifying.</p>\n<p>“My darkness is terrifying. I differ from Karna. He, while cool-headed, is the warmth that believes in the people. I, while quiet, has a resignation that is so far as desperate.”</p>\n<p>Since when was it that Arjuna had resolved to kill Karna no matter what? Probably, it was from the moment they had faced each other in the beginning. That time, why did Arjuna not even remonstrate his brothers by expressing a single word to them when they were loudly speaking ill of Karna? Was it not because he envied Karna who displayed martial arts that actually surpasses his own’s? What an ugly, petty emotion. This Arjuna must not harbour such a thing, for that is supposed to be the way he is. And thus, Karna must not notice that reason.</p>\n<p>“That discernment, if it exposes me————surely I, without a doubt, would die in shame. I regulated myself. Thoroughly, I continued to regulate, regulate, regulate. Consequently, the gods, my father, my mother, my wife, my brothers, they all loved Arjuna. If I am not loved, I am not even worth anything.”</p>\n<p>Karna fell out of his chariot by the hands of his charioteer, who was his betrayer. Arjuna pierced through Karna while the latter was struggling to budge the wheels of his chariot, and that is a deed that should not be done in the way of the warrior. Cowardly, fiendish, it is a conduct not even strange to others and really spoken ill of.</p>\n<p>However. Opportunities, they should not be limited to being taken when it comes about a second time. And above all, Karna, who was nocking arrows to his bow————was smiling. Of course, that was not as a sneer to Arjuna. Although it was a smile of various emotions and reasons, to Arjuna, it was not seen as that. At this moment, Arjuna abandoned being a warrior (Kshatriya) that held great joy in battle, but that became a mechanism with the purpose of finishing the war.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Arjuna’s bow shot down the sun.</p>\n<p>Thus, the role of Arjuna also came to an end. Heroes behave as heroes up to the end; they were heroes up to the moment they died out. Brilliant heroic tales, they finished brilliantly up to the conclusion. Afterwards, Arjuna as a holy man who perceived everything is also still Arjuna, but his heart as a warrior was in a state of disorderly pieces.</p>\n<p>————“Sure enough, that one arrow shot down the sun.”<br>————“Am I probably going to shoot it at him, once more?”</p>\n<h3 id="general-armaments">General Armaments</h3>\n<h4 id="gandiva">Gandiva</h4>\n<p>… The bow that Arjuna always uses.
