As a young man freshly graduating from the University of Cambridge, while doing an enormous amount of calculations on the movement of the celestial bodies, he was wondering about something.<br>“It’s not just the celestial bodies. The governmental research institutes and private businesses need dozens of people acting as human computers for the massive amounts of calculations necessary for almost every experiment and project. If we could use a steam engine to perform a portion of these innumerable calculations, then…”</p>\n<p>And then, he thought more.<br>It can be done, he thought.<br>Machines that can perform complex and advanced calculations―――the Difference Engine.<br>In theory, it’s not impossible at all. Then, it can be done in practice too.<br>Mathematics is used in every branch of science. Therefore, when this machine is completed, mankind will dramatically save time in every field, and civilization as a whole will flourish for several centuries. This was a thing of pipe dreams that nobody has accomplished before.<br>However, he was convinced he could do it.<br>Since he was a genius.</p>\n<p>He was not only a talented mathematician, but a gifted mechanical engineer too.<br>In only half a year, he managed to make a miniature model of the real thing.<br>The blueprints he drew were correct, lacking even the smallest of errors in its theory.<br>The first component was intellect. There was more than enough of it.<br>However. The second component was insufficient. As in, time and equipment. To finance these, he needed funds.<br>With the Royal Society of the British Empire’s authorization as the foundation, the British government acknowledged his theory and 「Difference Engine」 and provided him with fund at first, but eventually stopped supporting the projects.<br>However, instead of giving up, he started to work on a machine capable of even more advanced calculations, the 「Analytical Engine」.<br>This was a machine that could run the world’s first program and it could make complete calculations (Turing completeness) a reality.</p>\n<p>Halfway through his ambition, he died.<br>The Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine were both unfinished.<br>He died, leaving behind to the world the dream of an envisioned future that vanished into the 「threshold of the eras」.<br>Eventually, advanced computing machines intended for the same function were invented as electronical devices and the world flourished. Just the way he dreamed of it. However, this was not a world of the steam engine; a world powered by electricity that was produced by internal-combustion engine​s was realized.</p>\n<p>And now, he manifested.<br>The future that could have been wrapped in grotesque steel.<br>The future he envisioned hidden in the shadow of a grotesque world.<br>The King of Steam who dreamed of revolutionalizing the world.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="leonardo-da-vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</h4>\n<p>I respect her as a great pioneer.<br>The ornithopter is an excellent article.</p>\n<h4 id="nikola-tesla">Nikola Tesla</h4>\n<p>The electricity is annoying.

It’s assumed that the arms are controlled from there.</p>\n<p>Instead of the walking stick of a gentleman, the weapon was changed into a drill.<br>To be accurate it’s not a drill, but a cross between a group of gears extracted from the Difference Engine and a tunnel boring machine.<br>The official stance on why a gentlemen is wielding something like a weapon of a savage tribe, is that a gentleman does not use uncivilized tools like blades or guns, and you can’t beat others up with a calculator.
