Or so it is speculated.<br>Additionally, at the time (and even now), Dai-Jizai Ten was often confused with Ishana Ten, the king of a place named Take-Jizai Ten, due to their similar names.<br>Ishana Ten is considered to be on the same god as Izanagi, the ancestor god of Japan. And, due to how its name is pronounced, he is associated with Shana-ou (Minamoto no Yoshitsune).

Many stories write about his anecdotes and he is probably the man who most strongly embodies the image westerns have of samurais.<br>However, most of the anecdotes from his 10 years of fighting have their circumstances shrouded in mystery and are highly suspected to be fictional.<br>Also, the difference between some of these anecdotes is so big, it is hard to believe they were all the same person. The divergence in his personality between them is especially extreme.<br>The only point that they pretty much all have in common is that he was quite the thug in his younger years, and then started reflecting and trying to calm down as much as possible with the years.</p>\n<p>He was born in Ohara Town, Sakushuu Province (currently Mimasaka City, Okayama Prefecture).<br>In 1584, his father served the lords of the Takeyama Castle (the Shinmen family) as a martial arts instructor and received his lords’ family name, becoming Munisai Shinmen.<br>Munisai Shinmen built a jittejutsu dojo in Miyamoto Village, Yoshino District. Since this place was Musashi’s hometown, he took Miyamoto as his family name.<br>Munisai was quite well-paid for a martial arts instructor, but lost his job before Musashi could grow, and as result, he had a poor childhood.<br>It is said that since he was a child, he was abnormally big, and was nicknamed “Bountiful Boy” (Hounen Warabe) for it.<br>They said he was so big because he was born in a year the harvest was bountiful.<br>His strength was proportional to his size, and he never lost a fight since his childhood. According to his father, Munisai Shinmen, his martial arts training was the true source of Musashi’s strength.</p>\n<p>At age 13, he was already strong enough to put adults to shame. He challenged Kihei Arima, a warrior-in-training from a village nearby, and killed him in the fight.<br>Later, at age 17, when Musashi was full of ambition, he and his village friend Matahachi joined the Battle of Sekigahara as members of the Western Army. He experienced a brutal defeat. After losing the war, he fled back to his village perplexed, was condemned for the underlying crime of belonging to the defeated army, and had the bitter experience of being arrested for 3 years. But there, he met High Priest Takuan and his friend Terumasa Ikeda, who caused Musashi’s change from a beastly murderous scoundrel to a respectable warrior.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Musashi travelled all over the country, met powerful enemies like the Yoshioka household from the capital, the Houzouin from Nara, and the Yagyuu clan, and kept maturing from his interactions with them. Before long, Musashi embraces the decision of pursuing “the art of the sword” instead of “the techniques of the sword”.<br>However, this form of maturing was fleeting as dew if compared to the cruelty of the world.<br>People die if they do not eat, and they can get sick if hit by the rain.<br>Musashi was still too young to reach an unfeeling mental state while still living.<br>Pushed by the multiple intertwinings in their fates, the people’s expectations, and his own high fame as a warrior, Musashi challenges Ganryuu’s Kojirou Sasaki to a battle.<br>This fight was definitely not a long one, but it was a fierce clash between their martial skills and their humanities. Musashi got a hard-fought victory, but commented “I’m not sure whether or not I can really find another enemy like you in my life” on Kojirou.<br>The texts said “Kojirou believed in the sword of power and technique, while Musashi believed in the sword of the spirit. That was the only difference between them.” Their clash was truly the battle between “the technique of the sword” vs. “the art of the sword”.<br>There are no records of how Musashi lived after that fight.<br>The only clue he left was “The crash of the waves is constant in the world. (…) Someone will know. About the heart two meters under the water. About the water’s depth.”</p>\n<p>After numerous battles, Musashi looked back at the 30 years of his life and reached the realization that him excelling at his martial arts was not the only reason for him to continuously win all his battles so far.<br>In a sense, you could say that after 30 years, Musashi finally faced the path of martial arts.<br>Additionally, it is said that Musashi only finally felt like he learned the path of martial arts at the age 50.</p>\n<h3 id="book-of-five-rings">Book of Five Rings</h3>\n<p>Before dying, Musashi wrote a book about the mental state he reached during his lifetime and the techniques he cultivated.<br>The book was split into 5 volumes titled Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Void. They are a compiled documentation of the human known as “Musashi”. The Book of Five Rings is composed by:<br>the Book of Earth, containing the ideas for the Niten Ichi-ryuu’s tactics and a summary of them;<br>the Book of Water, containing the concrete techniques;<br>the Book of Fire, containing the art of war in the dimensions of tactics and strategy;<br>the Book of Wind, explaining that one’s basic understanding of the Niten Ichi-Ryuu “will come naturally to your subconscious” by rejecting specific tactics and techniques. (For example, one random part in the Fire volume states “Use the same attack up to two times but never repeat it a third time”, but this idea only applies to real battles);<br>And lastly, in the Book of Void, it contains Musashi’s personal understanding of the “Void”, as well as so-called “confrontation” techniques.<br>It ends saying “The Void contains no evil, it’s only filled with good. Knowledge is filled. Logic is filled. The path is filled. The heart is void.”</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>A Musashi Miyamoto from another world, different from the historical Musashi Miyamoto.<br>A character from a parallel world much too separate from ours.<br>In that world, Musashi is a woman, and history proceeds in said scenario.</p>\n<p>“Huh?

Color me surprised!”</p>\n<p><div style="text-align:center">◆</div></p>\n<p>As you can see, she acts relaxed and carefree.<br>She does not care much for victory or glory, is a messy drinker, is a sucker for money, and cannot resist free food. But the ones who lost their duels against her all left the same words:</p>\n<p>“The vibrant Flower of Tengen. Her swords reach the unreachable voidlessness.”</p>\n<p>She was abused and hated by her father Munisai “for being a woman, and for having the Heavenly Eye.”<br>If the only problem were her being a woman, Munisai would have felt no need to make her into a swordsman, so he would have just abandoned her. If the only problem were the Heavenly Eye, he would have just laughed it off as excessive talent and killed his child.<br>Without being given anything from Munisai, she wandered the entire country to one day become a swordfighter who would surpass her father, but in the end, she was not acknowledged as a swordfighter by society because she was a woman.<br>This is why Girl Musashi was not considered one of “Japan’s numerous swordsmasters”. She became a historical figure sunk into obscurity.<br>As such, ever since she was summoned into our world, it has been surprise after surprise for her.<br>Like “No way, I’m famous!? Me!?”<br>But there was one thing Musashi does not know.<br>At their last years, the swordsmasters from the same era as Musashi nostalgically whispered to their pupils in their last breaths: ”She will likely not be recorded in history, but there was one tremendous swordsmaster only I know of”.<br>For the swordsmen, the way she appeared unexpectedly at relay stations to fight remarkable duels with swordsmasters then leave was considered a beautiful flower, even amongst the bloodiest war strategists.</p>\n<h3 id="drifter">Drifter</h3>\n<p>The Heavenly Eyes are the eyes that gaze at possibilities. Consequently, Musashi used to see even “different worlds” without trying to.<br>Before the world she lived in (a world to be pruned) was erased by human history, she rolled over to another world by chance.<br>From this point on, she made leap after leap and became a drifter who does not know the way back to her own world. Musashi has a vague idea what this will lead her to at the end, but she did not let that bring her down and made her journey to achieve the first and the last goal given to her, the “mental Zero”.<br>After her encounter with Chaldea, she learned about the historical Musashi Miyamoto and started called herself “Girl Musashi” due to acknowledging that she is “not someone from the correct history”.<br>Also, in a less relevant note, udon is pretty much Girl Musashi’s favorite food, so becoming a drifter made her realize how different udon is from region to region/from country to country. She has been making a secret lifework of trying the different udons from everywhere she goes.</p>\n<h3 id="musashis-favorite-swords">Musashi’s Favorite Swords</h3>\n<p>Records state Musashi had numerous favorite swords.</p>\n<p>Inscriptionless Kinjuu: A tachi from the Nanbokuchou Period, which had its inscription erased by scratches.<br>It was the sword used to slay hundreds of Yoshioka retainers in the battle against the Yoshioka household, along with the 85cm straight sword Ryoukai.</p>\n<p>Izumi-no-kami Fujiwara Kaneshige and Kazusa-no-suke Kaneshige: Swords said to be made by Musashi himself.</p>\n<p>Those aside, there are also records for swords named Musashi Masamune and Yamatokokujuu Kunimune.<br>Girl Musashi did not have any of these named swords, but, just like her historical counterpart, she also possessed multiple katanas.<br>Her reason was simply “The more weapons the better, right?”<br>As such, when she sees a Heroic Spirit with many weapons (like, say, Gilgamesh), she groans in jealousy, despite the fact that Musashi would not want to carry more than 5 katanas.<br>(The 5th katana is her Noble Phantasm, the Sword of Void. She only carries up to 4 katanas in her belt.)<br>Girl Musashi is one who quickly acknowledges, “If I break 5 swords before finishing them off, then they’re not an opponent I can beat”, then runs away if she can or graciously accepts her death if she cannot.</p>\n<h3 id="niten-ichi-ryuu">Niten Ichi-ryuu</h3>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, the Niten Ichi-ryuu is not just kenjutsu with 2 swords. (Niten Ichi-ryuu’s two-sworded kenjutsu was not even perfected during Musashi’s lifetime; its techniques were perfected by the efforts of his future apprentices.)<br>According to the notes Musashi left in the Book of Five Rings, taking the text literally, the Niten Ichi-ryuu is stronger in its disciplinary methods and mental preparation aspects than in its practical kenjutsu.</p>\n<p>If one were to ask what is the Niten Ichi-ryuu, the answer would be none other than Musashi Miyamoto himself.<br>The father called himself “Munisai” (with the “Muni” part meaning “no two of”), so the son coined the term Niten Ichi (meaning “two heavens into one”), containing a direct antithesis and a roundabout agreement to his father.<br>Musashi put high emphasis on the Buddhist concept of “Void”.<br>Void is nihil, emptiness, and 0.<br>The concept of “ ”. The very concept that “the ‘nothing’ exists” is 0, and is void.<br>It other words, beyond the “1”, to which there is “no two of”, there is 0.<br>The path to reach it is none other than the Niten Ichi-ryuu. Through the sword, one can reach the understanding necessary to embody the “Void”… Zen and the Sword As One is, without a doubt, exactly what Musashi aimed for.</p>\n<p>However, the concept of “Void” is remarkably difficult to understand. Even 2000 years after its discovery, humanity still has not fully comprehended it.<br>(It actually has not been much more than 300 years since humanity managed to perfectly understand the number 0.)<br>Therefore, when people talk about the “Void”, even many Zen priests will strongly deny that it is “something that already exists”.<br>One takes the concepts, objects and phenomena in front of them and keeps completely shredding them up, scraping them off and erasing their existence as much as possible.<br>Then, after one scraped off something’s existence to the extremes, to the point one could say it no longer has any, “something” still remains. That is what they believe to be “Void”.<br>(Pursuing the concept of Void also requires “confrontation” aside from just “denial”, but we will omit that part.)</p>\n<p>Also, Musashi believes “An art’s path runs and crosses through all arts”, so by learning the essentials of the sword, he learned the essentials of painting and sculpting. Conversely, this also means that in order to comprehend the essentials of the sword more deeply, he needed to get involved with painting and sculpting.</p>\n<p>To become Zero, one must master all. That was the path the Niten Ichi-ryuu strived for.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="kojirou-sasaki">Kojirou Sasaki</h4>\n<p>When we faced off against each other, he told me he had no name but oh, so this person is Kojirou Sasaki!<br>He looks as dandy as the rumors said, but, hmm, this sir looks like he doesn’t care about anything besides the sword!

style="text-align:center">◆</div></p>\n<p>她的父亲无二斋因为『身为女子，且拥有天眼』的理由而虐待她，憎恶她。<br>对无二斋而言，只是身为女子便无必要成为剑士，舍弃便可，拥有天眼便是过度的才能，讥笑杀害便可，仅此而已。<br>没能从无二斋身上获得任何东西，为了有朝一日能成为超越父亲的剑士而流浪全国的她，结果还是因为女子之身，而不被世间承认为“剑士”。<br>因此，在女武藏的世界当中，武藏不被当作『日本屈指可数的剑豪』，而是化作了沉没于历史之影的人物。<br>所以，她被召唤到这边伊始，便是惊吓连连。<br>「真的假的，我居然这么有名！？」像是这般。<br>然而女武藏并不知道。<br>与她生于同一时代的剑豪们在晚年，对弟子们低声细语地感怀道，『其实有一位不被历史所记载，只有老夫才知道的了不起的剑豪哦』，然后撒手人寰。<br>对剑士们而言，突然现身在客栈，并与自己进行了一番精彩的剑豪决胜后便抽身离去的她的存在，在弥漫着血腥味的兵法者之中，可谓是美艳的花朵。</p>\n<h3 id="漂流者">漂流者</h3>\n<p>天眼是注目于可能性的瞳眸。因此，武藏甚至能看见『不同的世界』。<br>她，在她所处的世界——应被剪定的世界——被人类史所抹消之前，偶然地辗转到另一个世界。<br>此后，不断重复转移，成为了失去回到原本世界的道路的漂流者。武藏隐约直觉到，转移的尽头中存在着些什么，因此她并没有灰心丧气，而是朝着自己被赋予的最初且最后的目的·『零之境地』踏上了旅途。<br>与迦勒底结下缘分，知晓了史实的宫本武藏后，称自己为『女武藏』，并认识到自身『并非正确人类史当中的存在』。<br>另外，提些闲话，据说原本便挺喜欢吃乌冬的女武藏在成为漂流者之后，对比较各地·各世界乌冬的口味不同涌起了兴趣，并暗自下定决心，要将尝遍天下的乌冬当作自己的毕生事业。</p>\n<h3 id="武藏的爱刀">武藏的爱刀</h3>\n<p>据记载，武藏拥有着数把爱刀。<br>『无铭金重』<br>用南北朝时期的太刀研磨而成，因此刀铭已经消失。<br>用此刀与吉冈一门战斗时，将数百人的吉冈一门尽皆砍倒，据说那时还携带着二尺八寸的直刀『了戒』。<br>『和泉守藤原兼重』『上总介兼重』<br>据说是武藏佩带的，武藏自制的刀。<br>另外，记录中还有铭为『武藏正宗』『大和国住国宗』的刀。<br>虽然女武藏并未持有这些名刀，但她跟史实一样，也佩带着数把刀。<br>这么做的理由纯粹是因为——「武器不是越多越有利的吗？」<br>因此见到吉尔伽美什等持有众多武器的英灵时，就会「噢噢~」般称羡，不过武藏本人并不打算佩带五把以上的刀。<br>（第五把刀是宝具的空之剑。女武藏随身携带的刀只有四把）<br>要是全部剑都被对手击碎时，<br>武藏便会爽快的承认到「既然五把刀都击碎了还没能决出胜负，那就肯定是我赢不了的对手吧」，<br>若是能逃便逃，若是逃不了便毅然赴死，如此便是女武藏。</p>\n<h3 id="二天一流">二天一流</h3>\n<p>时常会受到误解，其实二天一流并非单纯的二刀流剑术。<br>（武藏生前并没有完成作为二刀流剑术的二天一流，其技法方面是由武藏后世的弟子们协助完成的）<br>据武藏遗笔的『五轮书』，按字面意思理解的话，二天一流与其说是实践剑术，不如说更侧重于锻炼法与精神准备。<br>若问二天一流为何，除宫本武藏本人外无人能作答。<br>父亲自称『新免“无二”斋』，身为其儿子，给自己的技艺取名为『“二天”一流』，当中包含了对父亲明确的对抗，以及委婉的肯定。<br>武藏十分重视佛教概念的“空”。<br>“空”即为虚无，即为虚空，即为0。<br>「  」之概念。「存在之“无存”」，这一概念正是0，正是“空”。<br>亦即，位于“无二”之“1”更为前方的“0”。<br>抵达该处的道路正为二天一流。通过剑体现出“空”，以此来开悟……剑禅一如无疑正是武藏的目标。</p>\n<p>然而“空”之概念非常难解，其被发明以来历经2000年有余的时光，仍未有人类能完全理解这一概念。<br>（人类能够准确理解0这个数字所花费的时间虽长，但实际也只经历了300年左右）<br>因此，人们在谈及“空”的时候，就如大多数禅僧一般，只埋头于否定『既存的事物』。<br>将眼前所视之事象、物体或概念等，彻底地切碎、削落，尽可能地消去其存在。<br>抵达究极，将其存在削减至无可再削的地步，如此仍旧残存着的“某物”。他们认为如此便是所谓的“空”。<br>（追求空之概念，除『否定』外还有着『相对』，这里就割爱不提）</p>\n<p>另外，武藏认为「一道通万艺」，由剑之精髓可习得绘画或工艺之精髓。但反而言之，若要更为深入的理解剑之精髓，也必须染指于较为发达的绘画或工艺的技艺。</p>\n<p>为成为Zero而修行百艺。如此正是二天一流所求之道。</p>\n<h3
