Alriiight, let’s make something to eaaat!”</p>\n<h3 id="historical-image-·-character-image">Historical Image · Character Image</h3>\n<p>In the 1st Century, Boudica is the Young Battle Queen of Britannia. At the end of a vicious invasion where she and her daughters were disgraced by the Roman Empire, Boudica caused a rebellion with her spearheading the various kings of Britannia as she would not forgive the Romans, and although she made military gains for a while and overwhelmed the Imperial Army, in the end, she lost to Emperor Nero’s army, losing her life in the process. In future years, she became the legend of a “Queen of Victory” in Britain.</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>Boudica loves everything about Britannia. The wind and the earth. The flowers and the plants. The springs and clear streams. The insects and the birds and all the wild animals. And more than anything, she loves the people. She is close to her kind-hearted husband, King Prasutagus, and was blessed with a couple of daughters in her younger years. Except for when the skirmishes happen between fellow tribes, it is possible to say that Britannia is peaceful.</p>\n<p>Boudica had even incidentally planned to get into contact with the Roman Empire, who arrived in Britannia from a land beyond the waters and built several settlements, and moreover, she had faith in them. She believed that conflict is something that can be avoided through dialogue and exchange. In fact, then Roman Emperor Claudius sought exchange more than conflict too.</p>\n<p>But, on that day, at that time.<br>King Prasutagus died, and everything changed.<br>Succeeding Claudius, who died around the same time, was the fresh Nero, and at the time when she ascended to the throne as Roman Emperor, the imperial magistrate imposed heavy taxes on Britannia, stole away their plots of land one after another, and started to conscript their people as slaves. That is to say, these very actions were undoubtedly that of an invasion’s. Boudica carried out a protest furiously as the Queen of Britannia————What was waiting for her was a poor treatment that was so far as fierce. Scorn and disdain. Violence and disgrace. Pain and fresh blood. Though she received deep wounds to both her heart and body, she was still determined. For the rebellion against Rome. For the protection of her birthplace. For revenge. Thus, she became the Young Battle Queen.</p>\n<p>Boudica brought together various kings from various places within Britannia, and she led this large army to oppose the powerful Roman army. The rebels, they received their bitter tears and suffering from the people of the abominable empire. Trampling down the three Roman settlements constructed in Britannia, they exhaustively killed the Romans without distinguishing them between soldiers and citizens. Even the women. As well as the children. Even if they are young mothers much like herself, and even if they are very young children, as long as they are Roman citizens, Boudica swung her sword without hesitation and struck them down.</p>\n<p>The final decisive battle, it took place at Watling Street. Opposing the rebels was Roman army governor Suetonius Paulinus, who was known as a great commander. The extent of his military prowess he displayed in the distant land of Mauretania was so great, news of it resoundingly crossed over even into the land of Britannia that was separated two seas away. That capability being displayed in the suppression of Britannia’s western areas (present-day Wales) was formidable. Even with the allied forces of Britannia’s various kings that were superior to the Romans in numbers, will they really win? Boudica took on the challenge as she drove her chariot into battle. The allied forces of the various kings numbered 200,000, and the Roman Imperial Army numbered 10,000. Despite that, the difference in military strength between the two forces was expectedly overwhelming, and the rebel forces were defeated. With Suetonius’ ingenuity that did not differ from the rumours, and before the Roman soldiers’ extremely meticulous combat behaviours that were trained to a high-degree, the Army of Justice was completely defeated to the extent that it was over too soon.</p>\n<p>Justice————</p>\n<p>Camulonunum, Londinium, Verulamium. Trampling down the three Roman settlements, was it really the divine protection of the goddess Andraste that gifted violence and disgrace to the Romans under the rebels’ scorn and disdain while Boudica herself was scattering pain and blood? Her daughters were exhaustively raped as much as possible. While in tears, Boudica was begging in her thin voice for mercy on her little children. That then, what was once her figure and voice, was that itself not here anymore? She thought of that while on the verge of death.</p>\n<p>“Justice. I might have already let go of the things I truly wanted to protect.”</p>\n<p>Boudica was deeply enshrined in the United Kingdom since the modern times, and on the occasion of materializing as a Servant, she has parted with her furious self from the time of her past battles. Boudica, as a Heroic Spirit, is her original self; that is, she surely swings her sword in battle as an affectionate woman. Britannia… when one from there thinks of their birthplace, they think of it as this mother’s power.</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="roman-servants">Roman Servants</h4>\n<p>Enemies.</p>\n<h4 id="nero">Nero</h4>\n<p>An opponent Boudica is not pleased with. Honestly, she declares that Nero is her nemesis. However, if Boudica just knows how Nero is as an individual, she would be troubled in using her as an outlet of her anger. (After that battle, it is said that Nero reprimanded those generals for their actions so that they can know to the utmost of the cruel deeds they had done to Boudica and the others who were defeated in that battle.)</p>\n<h4 id="artoria-and-the-knights-of-the-round-table">Artoria and the Knights of the Round Table</h4>\n<p>They are like her cute younger sisters and brothers. Boudica regards that queen and those knights as the people who protected Britannia, and she loves each one of them, who all tend to be adorable cats, as her “younger sister” and “younger brother” who succeeded in doing what she could not do. Every time they meet, one thing or another, she will bake for them and look after them.
