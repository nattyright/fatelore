He was also a member of the Argonauts led by Jason.</p>\n<p>His father is Apollo, one of the twelve Olympians. Apollo became romantically involved with a woman named Coronis and got her pregnant. However, after learning of her infidelity from a crow (which was said to be a lie in some versions), he killed Coronis and turned the crow’s white feathers black in a fit of rage.<br>Apollo regretted killing Coronis. When she was laid on her funeral pyre, he rescued the child (Asclepius) inside her belly and entrusted him to Chiron, the wise centaur, to raise him.</p>\n<p>Asclepius studied medicine and hunting under Chiron and later began showing talent in medicine that surpassed Chiron. By creating a medicine with Gorgon’s blood given to him by Athena, he eventually succeeded in resurrecting the dead.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this feat posed a problem. If men were to conquer death, the Underworld would lose its value. Sensing an impending crisis, Hades turned to Zeus (he could not harm him himself because Asclepius was a son of Apollo) and Zeus killed Asclepius with a bolt of lighting. In order to appease the enraged Apollo, Zeus deified Asclepius and turned him into the constellation Ophiuchus.</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>A mad doctor who is only interested in the advancement of medicine.</p>\n<p>His medicine encompasses all fields including clinical pharmacology, surgery, as well as medical magecraft, and is highly effective. However, his fundamental goal isn’t “to relieve people of their suffering” or “to be thanked for healing people” but “to advance his skill at medicine”, making him completely different from an ordinary “doctor”.</p>\n<p>He would gladly treat novel illnesses that could potentially advance medicine, but would rather not spare a moment to examine mundane illnesses. He often performs unnecessarily experimental and dangerous treatments, the likes that would make another doctor’s blood run cold.</p>\n<p>Because of his own genius abilities, his treatments still end up in success. Patients with no medical knowledge would simply exclaim, “I’m healed! This man really is an amazing doctor!” This is the reason behind his reputation.</p>\n<p>His one and only goal is “to continue devoting himself to his medicine in order to advance it”. But there’s one thing he can never forgive: Zeus’ cruel treatment of him. Even after manifesting as a Servant, he still bears anger and hatred due to the fact that he was killed by a god.</p>\n<p>Why did I have to die?<br>All I wanted was to devote myself to medicine. I excelled in medicine, that’s all. Why did I have to be killed?<br>You turned me into a constellation and a god after my death.

It might have been an initial impulse to him, but he himself has forgotten about it. The reason is so natural to him that he himself has forgotten about it. That’s why he will never say it.</p>\n<p>The answer is clear and simple: “I aimed to advance medicine for the future. In other words, for posterity.” His love for humanity.</p>\n<p>If you have stayed by his side and spent time with him, the answer might come to you naturally. At the very least, the heroes who sailed with him in the Argo had more or less realized it. Telling him would put him in a sour mood, though. It will bring out his orneriness, and there’s a possibility that he would head in the wrong direction so they made sure not to tell him.</p>\n<p>Going deeper, the reason for that initial impulse might be a personal one.<br>By advancing medicine even further and successfully conquering death, no one will have to meet a pitiful end due to the gods’ foolishness just like my mother…<br>In other words, his reason might be “(indirect) salvation for the mother I never met, whose death at the hands of the gods left me bereaved”.</p>\n<h3 id="general-armaments">General Armaments</h3>\n<p>Rod of Asclepius<br>Snake<br>Medicine</p>\n<h3 id="connections-with-characters">Connections with Characters</h3>\n<h4 id="the-thing-on-top-of-paris-head">The thing on top of Paris’ head</h4>\n<p>…</p>\n<h4 id="nightingale">Nightingale</h4>\n<p>Some of her words and actions do not quite make sense to me, but we are aiming for the same goal… That’s the impression I get.
