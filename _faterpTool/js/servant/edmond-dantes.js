Namely, the form of his current self that was revealed as “the self (Edmond Dantès) that was trifled with by vicious fate and reality”, and the form as “a person who got close to the self (The King of the Cavern) that materialized as the idol of hatred.”</p>\n<p>Particularly regarding the latter form, before long, it seems he will surely recognize the profile of the Master who continues to struggle, seemingly remembering at first Abbe Faria, his benefactor, or Haydée, a princess of a ruined country.</p>\n<p>“He is not Abbe Faria.”<br>“She is not Haydée.”<br>“Of course, this form is not even the self that shows my very own self. The Master who walks together with me is just one person in the past, present and future. Even though, the others should not be here. If that is the case, the feelings embraced then is also the sole thing that must be there, and not here.”</p>\n<h3 id="dialogue-examples">Dialogue Examples</h3>\n<p>“————Wait, and Hope.”<br>“I hold no pity.

His popular names are known as “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “The King of the Cavern”. Due to a false charge derived from an unscrupulous conspiracy, Edmond was imprisoned in the hellish Tower of If (Château d’If), but he did not fall into despair despite that because of his mind of steel, and eventually, he acquired the treasure of Monte Cristo Island and swooped down upon Paris————It was said that he dealt with the many influential people reigning over France, namely, the people who once deceived him, and pulled them down to Hell.</p>\n<p>That stern way of life, the revenge tragedy that concealed his identity, his love and attachment towards his lover Mercedes – which were trampled on and snatched away from him – and his journey that led to his reform because of his anguish and remorse, are all acclaimed by people not only from France, but also from around the world, and Edmond is remembered as “the most famous avenger in the world.”</p>\n<p>Although the story of the King of the Cavern is viewed as a literary creation of Alexandre Dumas père, it has been confirmed in modern times that “Abbe Faria”, the father who guided Edmond when he was imprisoned in the Tower of If, existed…</p>\n<h3 id="character-image-in-fatego">Character Image in “FateGO”</h3>\n<p>Although his True Name is indeed Edmond Dantès, he perceives himself as a different person from the “Edmond Dantès” who lived as a seaman from Marseille. “The reason is that “Edmond Dantès” gave up his evil nature at the end of an extremely gruesome revenge tragedy in Paris, but I, who materialized as a Servant, continue to exist in the “image of a vengeful demon”. That being the case, I am not Edmond”, or so he says.</p>\n<p>“My name is the King of the Cavern (Monte Cristo).
