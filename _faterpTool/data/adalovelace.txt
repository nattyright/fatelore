Thankfully, this Servant has manifested with working knowledge of basic etiquette, so the master only needs to remind him of it periodically. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Ada takes his work seriously and passionately, believing he could solve anything with the right tool and the right mindset.

He holds deep loathing for manipulative individuals, believing them to be the reason for his death and therefore will not hesitate to nip any potential problem in the bud. He isn’t dumb enough to relive his tragic life a second time.\n</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, he gets along great with single minded people who are willing to take a bit of risk. He is fascinated with modern day electronics and would quickly develop a fondness for gaming (especially gacha games), at the expense of his master’s funds and sanity.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","backstory":"<b>Overview\n</b><p><b></b></p><p>Ada Lovelace was born in London as the only legitimate child of two high society parents with clashing morals: Lord Byron, a romantic poet who was the definition of a ‘bad boy’ in his time and Lady Byron, an educated and religious woman who believed in reform and good work. Suffice to say that the marriage did not last, and Lady Byron took over the responsibilities of rearing her child. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Ada’s interest in maths and logic bloomed at a young age, which drove her to pursue them well into adulthood. However, she was often deterred in her studies due to poor health conditions that accompanied her throughout her life, having to constantly put them off even months or years at a time, during which she stayed bedridden. But despite all that, Ada’s passion never waned, and she would go on to meet a great number of accomplished scientists, eventually leading her to working with Charles Babbage and producing the first computer program in human history.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>Family Trouble \n</b></p><p>Ada had a rather difficult relationship with her mother, who was often portrayed as controlling and manipulative in her private accounts. After her divorce, Lady Byron raised Ada in isolation, enforcing an unusual system of education on her that involved strictly ‘unimaginative’ subjects in science, dubious exercises in ‘self control’, and even paying people to befriend and spy on her in an attempt to purge creativity and romantic thoughts from Ada’s head, so she wouldn’t turn out like her wild poet of a father. Yet, Ada remained very conscious of her background and of being Lord Byron’s son. She eschewed poetry at her mother’s behest, but was inadvertently drawn to abstract ways of thinking, which shone through maths. She even went on to conclude that her greatest strength lay in bridging the scientific with the romantic, a term she lovingly coined ‘poetical science’.\n</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, even her advancements in science couldn’t bridge Ada’s relationship with her mother. They had numerous falling outs throughout Ada’s adulthood, often over the topic of her father: bickering after Ada had visited Lord Byron’s former residence unannounced, dropping bombshells of her father’s incestual scandal which shocked Ada so much that she stopped pursuing maths, and failing to attend Ada’s funeral after she had requested to be buried next to her father. She would even go on to collect Ada’s letters with her acquaintances after her death and destroy a portion of them in private.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>Major Accomplishments\n</b></p><p>Perhaps the biggest highlight of Ada’s life was her encounter with the Difference Engine (a mechanical calculator) courtesy of its inventor, Charles Babbage. The machine ignited her interest in mathematics and subsequently a lifetime of correspondence with Babbage on many intellectual topics. Babbage would eventually introduce Ada to his latest conception of what would be a modern day computer called the Analytical Engine, which was capable of performing multiple logical operations without human-prone error, something that was inconceivable in the 1900s.\n</p><p><br></p><p>After offering to translate the paper on Babbage’s machine, Ada went on to include extensive notes of her own that were full of ingenuity: a fully working example of using the machine to compute complex formulae not unlike how a modern day programmer would write a piece of code along with all the necessary steps of debugging, suggestions of using punched cards to mimic loops, and even visionary proposals of using the machine to create music by replacing keys with numerical values, which would be the predecessor to the modern day notion of variables in computation. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Babbage may have had the technical prowess to invent the Analytical Engine, but the machine only truly gained life of its own in Ada’s hands with her abstract, big picture thinking. Even Babbage himself admitted that Ada understood and saw in his machine more potential than he would ever have conceived on his own. \n</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Downward Spiral\n</b></p><p>Ada’s later years were less spectacular to say the least. Despite her passionate intent on spearheading the Analytical Engine project in Babbage’s stead, her health steadily and continuously declined. Numerous collapses wasted her months at a time on doctor visits and various dubious cures from her mother, massively hindering her scientific endeavors. She was also addicted to gambling, throwing away what would be the equivalent of millions in horse races while she tried (and failed) to design an algorithm to predict horse racing outcomes. Rumors of multiple affairs also accompanied her frequently, much to the chagrin of her mother. Eventually, Ada was diagnosed with cancer and had to be put on opiates to alleviate the pain, which accompanied her until the end of her life.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>Legacy\n</b></p><p>Ada Lovelace was no doubt a woman as recorded in history, but here she is summoned as a man who is half machine. Perhaps it is an extension of her unending rebellious phase against her mother, or a reflection of her father’s bad boy image, which she always seemed to be drawn towards despite being ushered away from it for all of her life. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Nevertheless, here stands a visionary, an Enchanter of Number, an Embodiment of Poetical Science and an enforcer of the many formulae he would willingly devise in order to ensure his Master’s victory.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","otherInfo":"<p><b></b></p><p></p><p><b>Goal:</b></p><p>Despite not having seen the Analytical Engine project come to fruition, he had always been quite content with the idea that humanity would no doubt embark on an age of computational discovery beyond his time. Hence, he is quite happy with how the world has turned out and simply wants to tinker (read: play) with as many electronic devices as he can.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>Wish:\n</b></p><p>But what if his health hadn’t failed? What if he hadn’t had to keep putting off science to rebel against his mother? Ada has come to the conclusion that the enmity of his parents was the root of much of his suffering, hence he wishes for a reconciliation between them, which he believes would give him more time to complete Babbage’s machine in his time.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>Alias\n</b></p><p>Due to ‘Augustus’ being more known for the Roman emperor than his actual name (most people in present day only know him by his nickname), Ada deems it a safe alias, especially when he can throw Roman history buffs for a loop. Though he doesn’t mind being referred to as ‘Archer’. After all, names are only given meaning when they are used in associating with an existing entity.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","description":"<p><b></b></p><p>\n</p><p>Ada is mechanical from the leg down, alluding to a combination of his debilitating illnesses, many of which resulted from emotional trauma when arguing with his mother. The robotic design also pays homage to his and Babbage’s working relationship. Unlike Babbage, he chose to forego a grotesque suit of mech armor for something more elegant, perhaps as his way of conveying the elegance and romanticism he had found in emotionless numbers. In addition, he also wears gloves that are linked to his weapon and gadget, the Chicago Typewriter. His glasses are just for show despite accounts of vision impairment in his early life.<br></p>","weapon":"<p>Refer to <b>The Chicago Typewriter</b>.<br></p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","np1Description":"<p>One of Ada’s greatest exploits while working on Babbage’s machine was her articulation of what would become modern day’s variables and structs in computer science, which are used to identify and classify different data that share the same attributes. This method of abstraction makes it easier to manipulate a group of data all at once by selecting them via that shared attribute.\n</p><p><br></p><p>When deployed as a Noble Phantasm, Ada can pick a target, choose one of its attributes, and automatically lock onto everything within range that shares the same attribute. The next attack he deals to that initial target will be duplicated with the same level of intensity to all other qualifying targets. (Note: only the attack is duplicated, not its result. This means that the attacks can be countered.)\n</p><p><br></p><p>The Noble Phantasm’s mana upkeep is dependent on three things:\n</p><p><br></p><p>- The number of eligible targets within range. The more there is, the more ammunition needs to be duplicated to cover each of them.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- The strength of the ammunition Ada uses on his initial target. The more powerful it is, the more mana it costs to duplicate.\n</p><p><br></p><p>For example, while normal, non-enhanced bullets have almost negligible costs, those that have been boosted by Ada, or specially crafted by him or another mage would put significant strain on both him and his master, since they need to be duplicated in great quantity.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","np1Effect":"<p>He can pick the attribute of ‘wood’ and let loose a single round enhanced by his skill, Ethical Hacking, at a nearby tree. This would cause every object consisting of wood within 128m of that tree to be targeted by a single enhanced bullet as well.\n</p><p><br></p><p>He can also pick the attribute of ‘human’ and launch a stun grenade at someone. Every other human within 128m of the first target would also receive a stun grenade of the same build. This approach is ill-advised should his master be in the vicinity, since the Noble Phantasm cannot discriminate between targets and is prone to friendly fire.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","np2Description":"<p>A writing machine, a weapon, a mount. It’s impossible to discern the true nature of the Chicago Typewriter by its name alone. Much like the name of a variable in computation without a defining data type, it simply acts as an empty container and can be filled with any compatible object.\n</p><p><br></p><p>As of now, a total of 3 objects have taken residence under its title:\n</p><p><br></p><p>- A futuristic looking typewriter that is more akin to a modern day computer, capable of hooking up to various objects in order for Ada to enhance them via his first skill. The association comes from the popularized Infinite Monkey Theorem in the field of maths and computer science.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- A Thompson submachine gun due to being referred to by the same name. It can take normal ammo in addition to those created with Ada’s magical energy. The firearm itself is rather durable when used as a hand weapon, though Ada prefers to not let it come to that.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- A mechanical horse, paying homage to the race horse under the same name. A mobile artillery with speed on par with that of a race car. It hits like a battering ram and can fire from a single cannon located at its head. This form is rather resource intensive, requiring copious amounts of mana to maintain, similar to deploying an anti-army NP.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","np2Effect":"<p>See description.</p>","cSkill1Description":"<p>He was granted this skill due to his incredible willpower to pursue his studies and passion despite debilitating illnesses. He can stay in the world for about 2 days without a master, but usage of NP is impossible without a reliable mana source.</p>","cSkill2Description":"<p>He can operate steam powered vehicles and hack into electric powered ones to gain sufficient control. In addition, he is also a proficient horseback rider. He is out of luck on anything else, however.<b></b></p>","cSkill3Description":"<p>There was hardly any mystery from Ada’s time, so his magic resistance is naturally low. However, due to the boost from his class container and his analytical nature, he can discern the nature of simple, single-action spells with rank D and below and nullify them.</p>","pSkill1Description":"<p>Ada’s talent lies not in his ability to create, but rather to see new potential in an existing concept, improve upon it and take it to new heights. He can hook up the Chicago Typewriter (typewriter mode) with any object* and living being* and magically enhance any of their existing functionalities. For living beings, he can boost one of their parameters by at most 1 rank for a short duration (a skirmish or a ritual length spell).\n</p><p><br></p><p>*Divine constructs, servants and phantasmals excluded.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p>","pSkill1Example":"<p>- Enhance a normal bullet’s destructive power at a fraction of the cost of creating a purely magical bullet.\n<b></b></p><p><br></p><p>- Enhance the brightness of a flashlight to turn it into a flashbang.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- Enhance the maximum output of his master’s magical circuits, enabling them to spellcast at an even larger scale than normally achievable.\n</p><p><br></p>","pSkill2Description":"<p>Ada was notorious for his crippling gambling addiction and his obsession to ‘solve’ it with maths. This has manifested in his ability to use loops to mitigate the cost of his attacks.\n</p><p><br></p><p>Before using this skill, he must verbally declare a target he could visually perceive before taking his next shot. If the shot misses or gets deflected, the skill will immediately refund the material cost of that shot, letting him fire again and repeat this process indefinitely until he either strikes the target or cancels the skill.\n</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few caveats while the skill is active:\n</p><p><br></p><p>- He cannot switch targets without canceling the skill first.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- He cannot move from his current spot, making him a sitting duck.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- He cannot use this skill on his NP, since the NP consists purely of magical energy.\n</p><p><br></p><p>- If the shot strikes the target, the material cost will not be refunded.\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>","pSkill2Example":"<p>- Most modern firearms become self-sufficient in his hands with this skill. He only needs to carry a few rounds of ammo, enhance them, pick an arbitrary target, then miss the target on purpose by shooting at something/someone else entirely. The bullet will be refunded, and he only needs to expend a little mana to enhance them before shooting again. It’s cost effective, which makes him quite happy.\n<b></b></p><p><br></p><p>- Rin probably won’t go bankrupt anymore with this skill, though all the magical energy within the gems would be emptied out when the gems are refunded.\n</p><p><br></p>","pSkill3Description":"<p>Ada’s clever use of portable, punched cards to store repeated operations and variables to speed up computation on the Analytical Machine manifested as this skill. By using modern day machines capable of telecommunication, Ada can freely traverse through them as long as an <b>open connection</b> exists between two machines. \n</p><p><br></p>","pSkill3Example":"<p><b></b></p><p>A phone call that had gone through (the other person doesn’t need to pick up so long as the phone is ringing), phones tethered to the same hotspot, live bluetooth transfer, TVs on the same cable service, VoIP calls, etc.<br></p>"}
