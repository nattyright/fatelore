        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana is a nature reserve city. It is run by independent investors that are attempting to set roots in the New World, a groundbreaking concept that could potentially lead to humanity living on land once again instead of relying on nomadic cities. While this is Nirvana’s primary objective, it also doubles its purpose as a tourist spot by hosting various rare animal species that have survived the apocalypse. It is very similar to a wildlife park or zoo. 
        </p>
        <h4>Size</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana is decently large, but most of its size is dedicated to the animals and the nature reserves. Therefore, it cannot host as many inhabitants as Olympia/Delphi.
        </p>
        <h7>Writer's Note</h7>
        <p>
          For a real life reference, please look at Singapore. A horizontal trip across Singapore takes roughly 14 hours on foot. It’s small enough that most places can be covered on foot, but big enough that it’s extremely inconvenient without public transport. (Spoiler: there is no public transport.)
        </p>
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          Extremely advanced weather dome systems give rise to a wide range of weather conditions to accommodate all the flora and fauna on the island.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          All public transportation (trains and only trains) have ceased operations in Nirvana. Embrace nature (and biking), they say.
        </p>
        <h4>Power</h4>
        <p>
          Wind turbines and hydropower plants reinforced by magecraft. Some inhabitants also have their own means of power generation thanks to the varied landscape.
        </p>
        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          Both Republic and the Neo Holy Empire have little to no influence on Nirvana due to it being a nature reserve.
        </p>

          Humans:  80,000+<br>
          Due to the large focus on tourism, it can host up to 500k inhabitants, but most people don’t stay long)<br><br>

          Wildlife: 3 million+<br>
          This includes fish and insects.
        </p>
        <h4>Daily Life</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana has been subsisting on its own produce, as well as commodities that were shipped to the island prior to 2102. Some popular stores are still manned by people, while others have been abandoned. Though many restaurants are still in operation due to Nirvana’s self-sustaining ecosystem. It’s common to see ransacked buildings and bustling facilities juxtaposed against each other on the same block of street. What a bizarre sight.
        </p>

        <h4>CityNet™</h4>
        <p>
          Connections to other cities have been permanently blocked and is overseen 24/7 by engineers and Servants alike. There is no way for Nirvana to send or receive information to the outside digitally. All telecommunication remains internal.

        <p>
          Pollution: severe
          <br>
          QoL: good 
        </p>
        <p>
          The north of the island is filled with thick forests and tall mountains, the perfect climate for arboreal animals or predators who prey on the latter. One will find plenty of squirrels, birds and deers, along with foxes, wolves and bears. Naturally, they are kept in separate enclosures to avoid any tension between herbivores and carnivores.
          <br><br>
          The tallest mountain in Nirvana is man made and designed to give a clear overview of the island from the very top. While initially planned to host holding cells for animals used to high altitudes, it has become a common tourist attraction for romantic couples looking to take selfies from the top of a gigantic mountain, something that is very much lacking in other cities. Of course, there haven’t been tourists on the island for ages.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district1">Nature Reserve: Tropical Jungle</h4>
        <p>
          Pollution: severe
          <br>
          QoL: fair 
        </p>
        <p>
          A tropical jungle designed to host exotic animals, ranging from monkeys to tigers and poison frogs. Since it is one of the more dangerous reserves, a lot of protective Magecraft and surfaces have been applied to the area, stopping tourists from exploring off-limits areas while keeping the animals safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seems like the system hasn’t been maintained in a long while, leading to the barriers falling as animals started to prey on each other. It is recommended to approach this area with caution, lest an anaconda coil up to you and gobble you up.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district4">Nature Reserve: Swamp</h4>
        <p>
          Pollution: light
          <br>
          QoL: fair
        </p>
        <p>
          Right next to the jungle is the Nirvana swamp, though it is called wetlands on the official guide pamphlet. The wetlands host animals that require a mixture of ground and sea to live, such as capybaras or crocodiles. Due to the amount of cold blooded and peaceful animals that lived in this area, almost no defensive precautions were taken and tourists were freely allowed to interact with well-fed animals. However, that is no longer the case, as the animal feeders stopped showing up, resulting in animals cannibalizing each other. The swamp now serves as one of the more treacherous areas of the reserve, with predators hiding underneath the muddy water as they wait for a tasty snack to arrive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district6">Nature Reserve: Snow</h4>
        <p>
          Pollution: severe

          QoL: harsh
        </p>
        <p>
          The frozen tundra is the heart of Nirvana’s laboratories, meaning that it hosts the least amount of animals in order to give researchers peace and quiet to work on their projects. The most you will find here are penguins and seals, relatively docile animals that aren’t a threat to humans whatsoever. Unfortunately, the weather dome around the tundra seems to be in a status of permawinter, meaning that temperatures are incredibly low and that people without proper equipment will suffer from frostbite in a matter of minutes. The animals also behave rather aggressively for some reason, with penguins trying to peck at people’s eyes while seals attempt to shred their legs. Could this be related to the presence of the labs?
        </p>
        <h4 class="district5">Nature Reserve: Desert</h4>
        <p>
          Pollution: light
          <br>
          QoL: fair
        </p>
        <p>
          A sizable desert that encompasses most of Nirvana’s south. While manmade, it has a lot of attention to detail, to the point that one can find various oases scattered across the sand. Most animals that live here can only inhabit rocky or sandy terrain, such as camels or the desert cat. It is also not uncommon to find a high concentration of bugs and insects lurking in the sand. The animals in the desert seem to behave erratically, as if seeing anything around them as a potential threat. Caution is advised when travelling.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district2">Nature Reserve: Lake</h4>
        <p>
          Pollution: mild
          <br>

        </p>
        <p>
          A bountiful man made lake created after the implementation of Nirvana’s river and irrigation system. It hasn’t been maintained in ages, but the system’s self-cleaning equipment seems to be functioning to this day. The lake has a high density of fish inhabiting it, along with small woodland creatures occupying the grassy areas. Rabbits, toads and cats are very common. Unlike other animals on the island, animals residing at the lake are relatively docile and tranquil. As a result, it is somewhat of a safe haven for the investigators.

        <h4>2105-02-02</h4>
        <p>
          The third investigation team is set to arrive at Nirvana...
        </p>
        <h4>2104-11-03</h4>
        <p>
          Curiosity peaked. Investigations resumed. After putting together the information from the journal and intel from cities that have associated with Nirvana over the past few decades, it was deemed that Nirvana had been conducting dangerous research:tm:. After much preparation, a third team of investigators were dispatched. Composed of top-notch mages fully equipped with Mystic Codes and S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, they were tasked to uncover Nirvana's secrets, being authorized to use force if necessary.
        </p>
        <h4>2104-03-18</h4>
        <p>
          A barely functional automaton was captured by a team of librarians near the coast of Alexandria, recognized to belong to a librarian that had gone with the second investigation team. The automaton carried with it a waterlogged journal. The journal was later restored and deciphered to belong to a researcher on Nirvana belonging to the old guard. It revealed much detail on the origin and propagation of Nirvana (the timeline you are reading, up to the year 2060).
        </p>
        <h4>2103-01-14:</h4>
        <p>
          A second team of investigators were dispatched. They would meet the same fate as the first team and lose contact with their sponsors a few weeks into the journey. Investigations temporarily ceased.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-22</h4>
        <p>
          Communications with the team were cut. The investigators never returned.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-19</h4>
        <p>
          The team located Nirvana and prepared for docking.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-14</h4>
        <p>
          The team arrived at South Africa's coordinates.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-06-29</h4>
        <p>
          A team of investigators were dispatched to look for Nirvana according to its last known location, what used to be the Old World's South Africa.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-03-23</h4>
        <p>
          On a fateful day in the spring of 2102, Nirvana completely cut off its communications with the rest of the world. Tourists never returned from their trips. Nirvana itself has vanished from the map, with a mysterious fog remaining in its stead. Could the city still be lurking beyond that thick mist?

        <h4>2035+</h4>
        <p>
          Advertising Nirvana as a glorified zoo proved to be successful, as tourists from neighboring cities started visiting for the novelty. Word of mouth spread, eventually turning into word of CWW as the city grew in popularity for its unique niche. This attracted the attention of financial investors, who offered to 'purchase' the city and continuously fund it as long as they dedicated more resources to the nature reserve aspect of the city.
          <br><br>
          The city was flourishing...
        </p>
        <h4>2030-2035</h4>
        <p>
          Almost three decades had passed, resulting in the city’s facilities starting to show their age. Their trip to the Arctic Ocean was forever delayed, as they attempted to barter with the neighboring cities for resources.
          <br><br>
          Tensions escalated between the old guard and the new arrivals to the city. The old guard felt like they were losing sight of their honorable goal of restarting humanity, while the new arrivals thought the chances of such an ambitious plan were close to zero and that they should focus on preserving the city instead.
          <br><br>
          Eventually, both sides came to a compromise: Nirvana would advertise itself as a nature resort, using its fauna and flora as exotic setpieces to attract nomadic cities looking for entertainment. These funds would be used to maintain the city, while a portion of it would be directed towards R&D for Nirvana’s original goal.
        </p>
        <h4>2014-2030</h4>
        <p>
          After obtaining more knowledge on the new world, the Nirvana crew decided to make their newfound objective be to restore land to Earth. This meant spreading Nirvana’s roots towards the Earth’s land, which had been sealed by the ocean itself. Therefore, the city headed over to the Arctic Ocean, where the water was most shallow. However, this trip would take decades due to the distance and speed of their city.
          <br><br>
          This resulted in several detours, with the city’s original inhabitants leaving for other cities while letting newcomers stay. This resulted in Nirvana slowly losing sight of its goal, as its population grew and opinions grew more diverse.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2014</h4>
        <p>
          Initially, there was a panic due to the apocalypse, but the higher members of staff took charge and focused on the task of rebuilding humanity and the Earth’s environment and fauna.
          <br><br>
          A decade was spent on technological progress and research, with analysis dedicated towards the newly formed ocean. Attempts to communicate or track down any neighboring cities or vessels were made, resulting in Nirvana establishing contact with other nomadic cities. This allowed for the spread of information, information sharing and trading of resources.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2005</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana's purpose as humanity’s incubator would be kickstarted early as the Grail Mud apocalypse occurred. Thanks to Atlas Institute, their nomadic city was outfitted with sea runes before the flood occurred. Nirvana survived and floated somewhere around the world.
        </p>
        <h4>2002-2003</h4> 
        <p>
          Nirvana was one of the nomadic cities built before the spread of the flood, starting off as a humble Dhruva. It had close ties with the Atlas Institute and was designed as an experimental nomadic city with the purpose of ‘rebooting’ humanity if the species were to ever go extinct. A modern day Noah’s Ark.

            <p>
              The Nirvana hospitals focus more on treatment for animals than humans. Popular medications for human beings are not always in stock, while treatments for animals are in high supply. Magecraft and herbal treatments are fortunately rather plentiful, so it is relatively easy for a skilled mage to apply them to an injured or sick individual.
              <br><br>
              Currently the hospitals are barely open, with only a few islanders left to manage the place. Most likely only because they need someone to treat the injuries of their own.

Magecraft and herbal treatments are fortunately rather plentiful, so it is relatively easy for a skilled mage to apply them to an injured or sick individual.
              <br><br>
              Currently the hospitals are barely open, with only a few islanders left to manage the place. Most likely only because they need someone to treat the injuries of their own.

            <h2>Hotels</h2>
            <p>
              Hotels were once bright and extravagant in Nirvana, since the high tourist traffic made it necessary to pamper their temporary guests as much as they could. Now that the city is a ghost town, the hotels are a former shadow of themselves. In a state of disrepair and lacking basic features such as connections to potable water, they are mostly used as temporary refuge by islanders.

              Nirvana has several residential clusters, but this is the biggest one by far due to its scenic location and temperate climate. Around half of the residences are currently occupied.

            <p>
              Due to the high number of writer Servants living in Nirvana, the stationery store has never been looted once. You can find all sorts of writing materials here, ranging from books, to pens, to printers even. Despite the stationery being relatively safe, its equipment to contact neighboring cities along with its mail system has been completely destroyed.

            <p>
              Due to the merch store being the only store selling food and clothing, some of the islanders have started their own businesses in order to avoid going insane at consuming the same merch over and over again. Of course, some of the shrewder ones have taken advantage of Nirvana’s perilous situation and driven the prices up for common necessities. Bargaining with these individuals is usually a lost cause.

              A merch store that has been ransacked, but still holds huge amounts of stock due to how much Nirvana relied on tourism. Anything from synthetic animal fur coats to Pallas Cat undies can be found here, reminding people of better times where tacky merchandise was the only thing worth worrying about. Due to the high number of supplies, it has gathered the attention of Nirvana’s Servants who currently use it as their base of operations.

            <p>
              Right next to Nirvana’s beach are the city docks, which are the only docking station that it has at its disposal. Tourists will usually reach the natural paradise here, albeit it seems like the docks haven’t been looked after for quite a while. The docks are littered with abandoned ships that have traces of rust to them. Flora has started to inhabit the surface as well, with algae covering the various ship vessels that surround Nirvana. Seems like the city hasn’t received any proper tourists in a while.
