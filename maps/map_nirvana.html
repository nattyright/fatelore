          Nirvana is a nature reserve city. It is run by independent investors that are attempting to set roots in the New World, a groundbreaking concept that could potentially lead to humanity living on land once again instead of relying on nomadic cities. While this is Nirvana’s primary objective, it also doubles its purpose as a tourist spot by hosting various rare animal species that have survived the apocalypse. It is very similar to a wildlife park or zoo. 
        </p>
        <h4>Size</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana is decently large, but most of its size is dedicated to the animals and the nature reserves. Therefore, it cannot host as many inhabitants as Olympia/Delphi.
        </p>
        <h7>Writer's Note</h7>
        <p>
          For a real life reference, please look at Singapore. A horizontal trip across Singapore takes roughly 14 hours on foot. It’s small enough that most places can be covered on foot, but big enough that it’s extremely inconvenient without public transport. (Spoiler: there is no public transport.)
        </p>
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          Extremely advanced weather dome systems give rise to a wide range of weather conditions to accommodate all the flora and fauna on the island.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          All public transportation (trains and only trains) have ceased operations in Nirvana. Embrace nature (and biking), they say.
        </p>
        <h4>Power</h4>
        <p>
          Wind turbines and hydropower plants reinforced by magecraft. Some inhabitants also have their own means of power generation thanks to the varied landscape.
        </p>
        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          Both Republic and the Neo Holy Empire have little to no influence on Nirvana due to it being a nature reserve.

          Due to the large focus on tourism, it can host up to 500k inhabitants, but most people don’t stay long)<br><br>

          Wildlife: 3 million+<br>
          This includes fish and insects.
        </p>
        <h4>Daily Life</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana has been subsisting on its own produce, as well as commodities that were shipped to the island prior to 2102. Some popular stores are still manned by people, while others have been abandoned. Though many restaurants are still in operation due to Nirvana’s self-sustaining ecosystem. It’s common to see ransacked buildings and bustling facilities juxtaposed against each other on the same block of street. What a bizarre sight.

        <h4>2105-02-02</h4>
        <p>
          The third investigation team is set to arrive at Nirvana...
        </p>
        <h4>2104-11-03</h4>
        <p>
          Curiosity peaked. Investigations resumed. After putting together the information from the journal and intel from cities that have associated with Nirvana over the past few decades, it was deemed that Nirvana had been conducting dangerous research:tm:. After much preparation, a third team of investigators were dispatched. Composed of top-notch mages fully equipped with Mystic Codes and S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, they were tasked to uncover Nirvana's secrets, being authorized to use force if necessary.
        </p>
        <h4>2104-03-18</h4>
        <p>
          A barely functional automaton was captured by a team of librarians near the coast of Alexandria, recognized to belong to a librarian that had gone with the second investigation team. The automaton carried with it a waterlogged journal. The journal was later restored and deciphered to belong to a researcher on Nirvana belonging to the old guard. It revealed much detail on the origin and propagation of Nirvana (the timeline you are reading, up to the year 2060).
        </p>
        <h4>2103-01-14:</h4>
        <p>
          A second team of investigators were dispatched. They would meet the same fate as the first team and lose contact with their sponsors a few weeks into the journey. Investigations temporarily ceased.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-22</h4>
        <p>
          Communications with the team were cut. The investigators never returned.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-19</h4>
        <p>
          The team located Nirvana and prepared for docking.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-14</h4>
        <p>
          The team arrived at South Africa's coordinates.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-06-29</h4>
        <p>
          A team of investigators were dispatched to look for Nirvana according to its last known location, what used to be the Old World's South Africa.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-03-23</h4>
        <p>
          On a fateful day in the spring of 2102, Nirvana completely cut off its communications with the rest of the world. Tourists never returned from their trips. Nirvana itself has vanished from the map, with a mysterious fog remaining in its stead. Could the city still be lurking beyond that thick mist?
        </p>
        <h4>????-????</h4>
        <p>

        <h4>2035+</h4>
        <p>
          Advertising Nirvana as a glorified zoo proved to be successful, as tourists from neighboring cities started visiting for the novelty. Word of mouth spread, eventually turning into word of CWW as the city grew in popularity for its unique niche. This attracted the attention of financial investors, who offered to 'purchase' the city and continuously fund it as long as they dedicated more resources to the nature reserve aspect of the city.
          <br><br>
          The city was flourishing...
        </p>
        <h4>2030-2035</h4>
        <p>
          Almost three decades had passed, resulting in the city’s facilities starting to show their age. Their trip to the Arctic Ocean was forever delayed, as they attempted to barter with the neighboring cities for resources.
          <br><br>
          Tensions escalated between the old guard and the new arrivals to the city. The old guard felt like they were losing sight of their honorable goal of restarting humanity, while the new arrivals thought the chances of such an ambitious plan were close to zero and that they should focus on preserving the city instead.
          <br><br>
          Eventually, both sides came to a compromise: Nirvana would advertise itself as a nature resort, using its fauna and flora as exotic setpieces to attract nomadic cities looking for entertainment. These funds would be used to maintain the city, while a portion of it would be directed towards R&D for Nirvana’s original goal.
        </p>
        <h4>2014-2030</h4>
        <p>
          After obtaining more knowledge on the new world, the Nirvana crew decided to make their newfound objective be to restore land to Earth. This meant spreading Nirvana’s roots towards the Earth’s land, which had been sealed by the ocean itself. Therefore, the city headed over to the Arctic Ocean, where the water was most shallow. However, this trip would take decades due to the distance and speed of their city.
          <br><br>
          This resulted in several detours, with the city’s original inhabitants leaving for other cities while letting newcomers stay. This resulted in Nirvana slowly losing sight of its goal, as its population grew and opinions grew more diverse.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2014</h4>
        <p>
          Initially, there was a panic due to the apocalypse, but the higher members of staff took charge and focused on the task of rebuilding humanity and the Earth’s environment and fauna.
          <br><br>
          A decade was spent on technological progress and research, with analysis dedicated towards the newly formed ocean. Attempts to communicate or track down any neighboring cities or vessels were made, resulting in Nirvana establishing contact with other nomadic cities. This allowed for the spread of information, information sharing and trading of resources.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2005</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana's purpose as humanity’s incubator would be kickstarted early as the Grail Mud apocalypse occurred. Thanks to Atlas Institute, their nomadic city was outfitted with sea runes before the flood occurred. Nirvana survived and floated somewhere around the world.
        </p>
        <h4>2002-2003</h4> 
        <p>
          Nirvana was one of the nomadic cities built before the spread of the flood, starting off as a humble Dhruva. It had close ties with the Atlas Institute and was designed as an experimental nomadic city with the purpose of ‘rebooting’ humanity if the species were to ever go extinct. A modern day Noah’s Ark.

It's pretty boring compared to the other venues in the area, but for some reason, 'enter the admin building without needing a guest badge' makes it onto Delphi's annual wishing poll without fail every single year.

Both magecraft and technology are used to carefully control each floor's growth conditions in order to give maximum yields. To date, Delphi has managed to become 75% self-sufficient on these farms alone.<br><br>

              Outside of providing sustenance, the farms have also become a popular sightseeing spot for foreigners, since even the most common livestock can be a rare sight in smaller cities.

This is only one of the many large-scale shopping centers in the area! A shopaholic's heaven.

              Delphi is surrounded by harbors and ports, which lets it juggle the large number of ships looking to dock and trade with ease. Out of the 6 of its arms, 5 are used for trade, while the 6th is used for passenger ships.<br><br>

              There are 2 ways to get into the city proper from the docks. The most common, and the 'proper' way of doing things is by taking one of the elevators that lifts one directly onto Delphi's upper platform. Those feeling adventurous can try to navigate the deserted old city underneath the platform for a subway station that goes into the CBD.

              Not all of Delphi's 'underground' has been sealed with infill. Portions of the old city remain, while suitable buildings have been repurposed into warehouses. Even entire streets are reinforced and turned into large storage units when the need arises. Apart from commerce, quite a few stragglers and organizations have also taken a liking to residing in Delphi's deserted underbelly for various reasons. As such, security is always in high demand, especially for warehouses that store valuable goods.

              Fresh produce is the market square's biggest draw. Not only does Delphi source directly from its own indoor farms, it also uses its favors to strike up deals with farming-oriented cities for a variety of imports. Small businesses also set up shop here due to the cheaper rent and sell all kinds of exotic, handmade goods.

              All that is ugly, all that is unsavory, Delphi sweeps anything unfit for public display under its manmade platform. Outside of subway tunnels and heavily guarded warehouses, Delphi's underbelly has become a breeding ground for troublemakers. The Piss Valley is a black market infamous for its data brokers. While the companies 'aboveground' still largely play by the rules, there is no such thing down here. Delphi turns a blind eye to it so long as it operates solely 'underground'.

It has no lack of short-term migrants who are only here for business or sightseeing, and the number has recently skyrocketed due to the City Grail War that is soon to take place. Some of the hotels have been reserved for Delphi's own citizens, since the city is planning to seal off a few locations to use as battle grounds for the War. All residents living in affected areas will be compensated accordingly, while all damage to their property will be fixed or replaced afterwards.

            <h2>Public Schools</h2>
            <p>
              Education is an investment that fosters both intelligence and loyalty. Delphi places a lot of hope on its future generations; all schools at Delphi are heavily subsidized thanks to sponsorship from local businesses. Each school adopts one of two curricula: Gen Ed with a heavy focus on the sciences, economics and public speaking, and Vocational, which focuses on raising specific talents such as the arts and in particular, magecraft. In Delphi, magecraft is treated as a skill rather than a talent, and mages are treated no differently from a commoner.

            <h2>The Underbelly</h2>
            <strong><span style="font-size:20px">(B1F-B5F)</span></strong>
            <p>
              The old city underneath Delphi's raised platform is full of abandoned buildings and wreckage sites, not to mention that numerous areas have been filled with debris and reclaimed as new land in order to build subway tunnels. To navigate through the deserted, broken streets is a feat in and of itself. Delphi is allowing unrestricted use of its underbelly as battlegrounds for the upcoming City Grail War. No application is needed. Stay away from the designated warehouses and subway tunnels and anywhere is free game.

            <h2>Rooftop Park</h2>
            <p>
              What better way to show off one's wealth than by using one of the most expensive areas as a battleground for the City Grail War? The rooftop park that was designated as a battleground is one of Delphi's largest. Spanning the rooftops of 3 adjacent skyscrapers, the park is lush with vegetation. It's practically a mini forest in the heart of the city. Cameras have been installed at key locations for the duration of the War.

            <h2>Vacant School</h2>
            <p>
              A Vocational School specializing in magecraft has petitioned to turn itself into a battleground for the City Grail War. The reason? To inspire its students with a live demonstration of a battle between magi and their Servants. <br><br>

              The school has been vacated for the duration of the War.
