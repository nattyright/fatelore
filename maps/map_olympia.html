        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Olympia is a city of heat, usually considered to be one of the largest forges in the new world. Its entire wealth was founded on the sweat of its factories and ironworks, producing materials that were sought after by other nomadic cities. This created a stable trading network between Olympia and its business partners: Olympia produced the goods in its factories, shipped them to neighbouring cities and received back shipments of crops, perishables and commodities.<br><br>

          Its history is fairly old, since it started as a large investment from a rich magus family focused on metallurgy. They purchased two Dhruva cities and hired the citizens to work in leyline creation. For half a decade they carved the family’s ley lines on their own cities, which gradually manipulated the city’s metals and allowed the natural generation of ore underneath the city’s surface.<br><br>

          These ores were harvested, refined and smelted into products, leading to the creation of Olympia’s first factories. The family’s plan was a success, resulting in profits rising and the two Dhruva cities merging with the family’s own city, which would become the modern Olympia.<br><br>

          The wealth and success accumulated would eventually attract the Neo Holy Empire, resulting in a partnership between the Church and Olympia. This caused further progress, as the Church grafted its own leylines to Olympia and allowed the creation of modern train stations, accelerating its profits. Even now, the relationship between the two is fairly amicable.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="1">
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the sheer amount of iron melted in Olympia, it is hot all year round. A common saying amongst its citizens is ‘Winter sleeps when the fire keeps.’, mocking how Olympia hasn’t had a proper winter since the creation of its factories. Temperatures are incredibly high, to the point that clean water is seen as extremely valuable and something that the aristocracy buys in droves to keep people and machinery afloat.<br><br>

          Pollution is also very present in the factory districts, with smog and clouds invading one’s vision. As a result, the aristocracy makes it mandatory for workers to wear gas masks when working inside of their factories.<br><br>

          Weather domes exist in Olympia, but are reserved to the recreational and aristocratic districts to conserve power for the factories. However, humans are adaptable and have gotten used to Olympia’s blistering heat. Most of its residents just treat the city as an eternal summer, something that might even be considered romantic for a few.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="2">
        <h4>Residents</h4>
        <p>
          Due to being a city formed by investments and experimentations, it would be hard to call anyone in Olympia a ‘native’ besides the aristocracy. Its original citizens were merely workers hired to graft leylines to the city’s surface. What followed was immigrants and foreigners approaching the city after the aristocracy listed numerous manual labor jobs for vagabonds, along with attracting prospecting business powers who were interested in the factories’ capabilities.<br><br>

          The ratio of foreigners to natives has been completely skewed, resulting in 90% of Olympia’s citizens being immigrants from neighbouring citizens. Most of them work dead-end jobs in factories, with a few working in the entertainment district as well, but Olympia is not a place that rewards the majority of its population.<br><br>

          Were it not for the presence of the Church, some suspect that the citizens would have rebelled against the aristocracy long ago.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="3">
        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          The Church has been nothing but kind to Olympia and its citizens. A city dominated by foreigners is incredibly hard to manage due to clashing beliefs and cultures, but the Church’s openness to all forms of worship have resulted in Olympia’s inhabitants finding common ground. The workers live tiring lives, but remain strong as they obey the will of their respective Gods to find a purpose to keep living.<br><br>

          This pleases the aristocracy, who needs to barely lift a finger to keep the citizens under their control. As a result, they constantly attempt to please the Church, since the Church’s respect earns them the citizens’ praise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="4">
        <h4>CityNet™</h4>
        <p>
          Temporarily connected radio towers in S2 with Delphi for easy SIM access for tourists. Olympia’s own database is connected to the Neo Holy Empire’s global database, resulting in Olympia’s data being completely shared with the Church. Nothing to hide, nothing to find, they say.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="5">
        <h4>Leylines</h4>
        <p>
          Special metallurgic leylines have been grafted to Olympia’s foundation, resulting in the natural generation of ores and minerals under the city’s bedrock. Unique Church brand leylines have been planted in the city to support it, called ‘Railways’. These railways assist with the Olympia factories since they allow carts, trains and cargo transports to navigate via the leylines.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="6">
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Olympia has a robust train system that is rarely found in other cities, allowing quick travel routes for citizens and cargo. It utilizes the Church’s railway leylines for this particular purpose. Besides that, it has the standard leyline transportation system that is commonly used in other nomadic cities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="7">
        <h4 class="district1">Factory District</h4>
        <p>
          The factories are Olympia’s life and blood. The majority of the city’s resources are pooled into factories, which in turn produces its main exports. These range from smelted iron and ores to products built in Olympia itself. All of these materials and products are delivered to nearby cities in exchange for what the city lacks, namely food, edible crops, farm animals and so on.<br><br>

          Some of the older factories have been shut down and repurposed as battlegrounds for the upcoming Grail War. The aristocrats plan on demolishing these factories and building new ones on top of them, so letting Servants destroy them instead would save a lot of money.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district2">Downtown</h4>
        <p>
          A small sized city district with numerous locales for individuals to visit. Normally an area catered to low and middle class workers, the downtown has temporarily been made more open to tourism due the City Grail War attracting viewers and contestants alike. Quiet streets are now sprawling with tourists, enjoying the scenery of an industrial city at its peak. The downtown is connected to all of the areas that form Olympia’s structure, making it a hub of sorts where people can regroup and spread out.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district3">Recreational District</h4>
        <p>
          Perhaps the brightest place in all of Olympia is its recreational district, which has gradually been constructed by the aristocracy throughout the past few decades in a vain attempt to boast about their wealth. This district does its best to erase the feeling of ironworks, smog and factories by utilizing an artificial weather dome that encompasses only the recreational district. This dome is capable of additional features, such as air filtration that blocks the smog of the factories out, while also allowing for sunny skies and bright sunlight all day around.<br><br>

          The aristocracy wishes to boast about its wealth and lifestyle by allowing all tourists from Delphi and other cities to freely indulge in their resorts and recreational activities. They hope that this publicity will earn them good standing with other cities.

            <h2>Residential Area</h2>
            <p>
              A small sized area connected to houses and apartment blocks. The majority of Olympia’s citizens live here, due to cheap housing costs and the city having restructured its residential district to allow for more workers to live in. As a result, houses and apartments are incredibly small and have only basic necessities: One third of the apartments have only a single room, while those lucky enough to have a decent wage can afford two to three room apartments. A testament to Olympia’s ideals of being compact and efficient.

            <h2>Places of Worship</h2>
            <p>
              The Church funded the construction of temples and churches within Olympia, allowing for free worship of any religion still remembered in the world, regardless of its origin or culture. This allowed for the workers to form strong bonds and camaraderie, not only through their tough, demanding work hours, but through their similar beliefs and ideals as well. These places of worship are also considered safe havens, to the point that the small homeless and low class population of Olympia is allowed to take refuge in them if needed.

            <h2>Schools</h2>
            <p>
              Schools exist, albeit not all of Olympia’s citizens are born equal. There are two types of schools: Private ones, for aristocratic citizens, and public ones for the common class. Private schools focus on Magecraft, mathematics and economics while the public schools focus on practical tasks, such as welding, factory work and so on. Only the most promising public school students are allowed to study theoretical subjects, usually at the cost of a fee.

            <h2>Hospitals</h2>
            <p>
              Despite factory workers having dead-end jobs of manual labor, Olympia’s healthcare system is surprisingly robust. Incidents in factories are quite common and workers are given state of the art healthcare in order to recover from any incidents and get back to work immediately. Most healthcare related to injuries and incidents is free, but healthcare related to sickness or disease is a bit trickier in terms of paperwork.

            <h2>Industrial District</h2>
            <p>
              A smog infested area that is a cluster of factories and industrial complexes squished together. Due to the demands of other cities and the Church, Olympia has been forced to build numerous factories to keep the production line up to schedule. This resulted in several factories being built right next to each other, resulting in a claustrophobic environment filled with gas and pollution. It got to the point that most workers are encouraged to wear gas masks while working.

            <p>
              While there are train stations in the Downtown and Recreational Districts as well, the largest train station in Olympia is located at the factories. Trains are Olympia’s lifeline, since their speed and efficiency are unparalleled. A robust network of trains spreads throughout the entirety of Olympia. These range from transportation trains, which are utilized by citizens to navigate to different areas of the city, to cargo trains which are designed to transport cargo only.

            <h2>Beach</h2>
            <p>
              Being close to the ports, the aristocracy took advantage of the sea breeze and sea adjacent location to terraform part of the district into a wide beach. This sort of attraction has been valued highly by the elite, since Olympia very much lacks any natural habitats due to its huge amount of factories.<br><br>

              The beach allows for several activities, ranging from sand castle making, seashell collecting to even swimming and surfing.

            <p>
              Right next to the beach are the city docks, which are the second lifeline that keeps Olympia afloat. The factories deliver the materials necessary to the docks, and the docks ship the materials out to neighbouring cities. In return, the neighbouring cities send ships back with their own goods to deliver to Olympia. This trading system is the heart of the city’s commerce and what allowed the aristocracy to thrive so long, coupled with their alliance to the Church.

              This miniature district is filled with bars, clubs, restaurants and hotels. While relatively docile in the day, this district completely changes at night, allowing aristocrats to indulge in their worldly desires: The bars reveal their gambling machines, the clubs reveal their hosts and hostesses and the hotels offer their ‘love hotel’ service. The entertainment street is the closest you could get to a red-light district in Olympia, allowing aristocrats to forget about their world and melt away into a realm of pleasure.

              A notably old factory that has stood the test of time for an entire decade. Unfortunately, all good things must end as the factory was decommissioned and repurposed as a battleground in S2. There are rumors saying that the closure was due to faulty equipment, resulting in the factory breathing back to life during random parts of the day. Some spectators theorize that the factory might even spring back to life during a fight between Servants…

As a result, the demolishing companies decided to allow an old train station to be used as a battleground in the City Grail War. It is one of the wider arenas, being a lengthy railway track in an open field coupled with a dark tunnel that leads to the industrial district. The tunnel has been closed off, meaning that it has an entrance, but no exit.

As a result, the aristocrats have decided to turn it into a battleground for the upcoming City Grail War. Brobdingnagian is a giant ship which has numerous rooms, cabins and storerooms, meaning that it is an ideal location for a battle between Servants. The battle will also be conducted at open sea, far away from the city docks to minimize collateral damage.
