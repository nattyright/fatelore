        <h4>Background/Structure</h4>
        <p>
          Floating along what used to be the Mediterranean Sea is a nomadic city filled to the brim with…more water. Yes. That is Alexandria, also known as the New World’s Archive, a massive data center that was created for the sole purpose of preserving the history of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the beautiful canal cities of the Old World, Alexandria is aquatic in nature. A sprawling network of canals and rivers stretches over a historic landscape, replacing major roads as Alexandria’s lifeblood. It connects private and public spaces alike, serving as a method of transport of goods and people, as well as a venue for entertainment and commerce with floating theaters and markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the center of Alexandria - that is to say, the cultural center and not the geographical center, the confusion of which dates all the way back to 2004 when the city was constructed -  an enormous lake surrounds a white, cylindrical tower that overlooks the rest of the city. This is the Great Library of Alexandria. Housing the world’s largest collection of print material and digital databases, it is a scholar’s heaven and a popular tourist spot for Alexandria’s visitors.
        </p>

        <h4>Size/Population</h4>
        <p>
          Being a Stella Maris, Alexandria’s size is on par with some of the largest cities in the Old World. It has more than enough room to spare for open spaces filled with nature, a type of landscape that is usually considered a waste in poorer Cynosuras and extinct in many Dhruvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandria has a population of ~8 million. This includes both permanent residents and visitors.
        </p>

        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          As with all Nomadic cities, Alexandria’s weather is artificially engineered by a state of the art weather dome system. The city keeps to a temperate climate all year round.
        </p>

        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          All public transportation within Alexandria is aquatic due to its robust canal network. Magecraft powered boats and other floating devices are used extensively, though they must keep to their assigned waterways, much like how lanes work on roads. Stop numbers are also designed for the majority of these waterways, working similarly to bus or train stops on roads. One may refer to the public transport system of Venice for a real life example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roads exist, but most of them are pedestrian, with special lanes for bikes and other smaller vehicles that run on either Magecraft or electricity. The speed cap for these methods of transportation is 20 miles, or 32 kilometers, per hour. Breaching the speed limit may result in fines and lengthy lectures, so please pay attention to how fast you’re pedaling!
        </p>
        <p>
          There exists a third type of ‘road’ for those who are in a great rush, or simply enjoy traveling at breakneck speeds: Mana Rails. They are built on top of Alexandria’s leylines and resonate with specially crafted footwear, enabling the rider to hover slightly above the Rails and travel at a fixed speed, which differs by Rail and is overseen by the Mana Rail management office.
        </p> 
        <p>
          The theory for Mana Rail riding is similar to maglev trains in the real world. 
        </p>

        <h4>Power</h4>
        <p>
          Like all the other nomadic cities, Alexandria is built on a foundation kept afloat by sea runes. It possesses a generous amount of New Atlas Tokens, which enables it to generate enough power to keep its residents and facilities happy. Wind turbines are also built along the coast as a backup in case of a power deficit, but the city hasn’t had the need to use them for the past 60 years.
        </p>  

        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          Alexandria is a hodgepodge of cultures, being a neutral organization that works for, and requires the collective effort of all the other factions. It does not take sides in intercity disputes and avoids violence at all costs, preferring negotiations and bargaining instead. As a result, numerous factions and organizations have set up branches in the city, using it as a neutral zone for various affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are free to practice any kind of religion within Alexandria, so long as they are not disruptive.
        </p>

        <h4>Economy</h4>
        <p>
          Most of Alexandria’s economy depends on its neutrality and its nature as an information hub. It is the perfect place for the big academia organizations such as the Mage’s Association to sink their roots in, thanks to the allure of its gigantic library, which also doubles as a tourist attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, it also trades exotic seafood with other neighboring cities, the variety of which is quite shocking for a city that focuses on academia. Indeed, even the most experienced seaman claims to have never heard of some of those species, such as superfish™, a delicious fish that rivals salmon in taste and can only be found in the waters near Alexandria’s research facilities. Oh boy. The scholars there better not procrastinate on their theses…
        </p>

        <h4>Influence</h4>
        <p>
          Despite its neutral stance, Alexandria holds a significant amount of sway in talks between cities. Of course, no one would dare overlook its large Heroic Spirit catalyst vault, which contains artifacts and deactivated S.E.R.V.A.N.T. cores that could guarantee the summoning of incredibly powerful Servants, each of whom could bring cataclysmic results on their own. While Alexandria has no intention of using these catalysts for itself, they are no doubt one of the reasons the city has remained strong throughout the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason could be attributed to Alexandria’s sponsors, many of whom are major influencers in the world. The largest of them is the New Holy Empire, which grants the city immunity from all sorts of political sway.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="1">
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Much like how money begets power in Delphi and how lineage begets prestige in Olympia, Alexandria is a city built by librarians, for librarians. Library enthusiasts make great use of the city’s resources as well, such as historians, archaeologists, scientists, engineers, or anyone who is fascinated by the Old World’s records. All funds are spent towards the betterment of the city’s many archives. In turn, Alexandria uses knowledge as leverage to attract various talents. As a result, the libraries of Alexandria hold the utmost prestige over any other organization within the borders of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, it follows naturally that if there is any group of people that could be considered the governing body of Alexandria, it would be the librarians. They are those tasked to manage the city’s enormous library, ranging from the collection and preservation of various types of medium to the handling of different sectors of its giant library network. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, one librarian might be tasked to handle the section of the library that holds historical journals from X date to Y, while another might handle a section containing Magecraft and incantation papers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The work of a librarian requires great organization skills and diligence. Therefore, the requirements to be a librarian are rather high, since one cannot afford to allow untrained hands to ruin the world’s last remaining information hub. As a result, all applicants undergo lengthy training, complete with a rigorous exam that involves both written and practical portions in order to qualify. Some people are also grandfathered in by parents or relatives who were former librarians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only qualified librarians are allowed to work in the libraries. Though the requirement is somewhat relaxed for museums, galleries, and other heritage institutions, which oftentimes employ people in other professions as their staff. As for Servants, the majority of them serve an advisory role in the fields they are most qualified for.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Alexandria handles large amounts of information daily, many of which are confidential in nature, the librarians that work in related sectors are required to undertake an oath to never leave the city under any circumstances. A strict screening process is used to hire people in those positions. Because of this, many librarians in Alexandria come from families that have supported the city for generations. They can even be considered the ‘true’ natives of the city.
        </p>

        <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>
          Librarians working in different sectors have different responsibilities, including but not limited to:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Collecting various record storing mediums from other cities. These can range from anything from written, printed materials to digital materials. Considered to be low risk, though often requires a certain amount of tact.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recovering S.E.R.V.A.N.T. cores and dangerous artifacts from other cities for safekeeping. The deal is often prearranged, though sometimes persuasion is necessary. Staff sent on these jobs are often required to achieve a certain level of competence in Magecraft for self preservation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Translation, transcription, copywriting, and tasks related to the handling of printed materials that have become too fragile for storage. Cumbersome as the jobs are, many staff working in these sectors have become proper hermits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restoring damaged artifacts and recovering information from damaged mediums. The skill floor is quite high for staff in these sectors. They may also need to specialize in a few niches.
            </li>
            <li>
              General operations, such as working at the reception, help desk, and ensuring the smooth running of the libraries and other institutions. Depending on the location, these jobs could range from low to high risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research. Staff usually work with the various academic and research facilities in the area to foster various tools and technologies that assist with record keeping or record retrieval. Has become quite popular ever since the recovery of Nirvana’s journal in 2104.
            </li>
            <li>
              Managing the Servant Catalyst Archives and ensuring the safekeeping of the catalysts. Works in strict confidentiality. Need to have a great sense of direction. Need to be good at running, biking, and riding mana rails to chase down petty thieves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moderators of FateChan™. Quite the stressful job. Staff could often be seen complaining about spams and flame wars, most of which are caused by a certain anonymous individual who can’t stop posting bird pics and a group of the world’s most pompous literary Servants who insist on signing each post with their real names. Some of the names have become quite notorious among the moderators, who have trained their fingers to delete their posts on reflex alone.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="2">
        <h4>Citynet™</h4>
        <p>
          The CityNet at Alexandria is the closest thing to the Internet in the Old World, as the city is the host of a slew of online services and the holder of master copies of many databases that’s used by the rest of the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, one of its major responsibilities is the maintenance of the ServantPedia™ database, which includes moderating the edits made by users in other cities, then pushing the updated versions to the local databases of each nomadic city. Depending on the volume of data exchanged and the distance between Alexandria to a nomadic city, the process could take anywhere from a few minutes to an entire day. As such, smaller nomadic cities far from Alexandria only request periodic updates, such as at the end of every calendar month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to its invaluable services to the rest of the world, most nomadic cities allow direct data transmissions to and from Alexandria via proprietary networks. While this avoids the risk of the data being intercepted by other cities, it instead exposes Alexandria’s CityNet to cyber attacks. Thankfully, the city is well protected thanks to a team of competent engineers and tech savvy Servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest data breach occurred in 2085.
        </p>

        <h4>Leylines</h4>
        <p>
          Leylines have been carefully grafted onto Alexandria’s foundation. Eight major leylines shoot outwards into each arm of the city, while minor leylines radiate outwards layer by layer like the cross section of an onion. These leylines divide the city into manageable sectors.To mana rail riders, they are the city’s third mode of transport.
        </p>

        <h4>The Information Hub</h4>
        <p>
          Alexandria keeps a record of every type of data it comes across, whether it be a book, a painting, a video recording, or the database of a retired nomadic city. Once organized, most of the data is made available to the public. People are free to browse physical collections at their leisure. They can also use a library computer to access any of the public data banks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a refugee from Persepolis can easily find out why they were forced to evacuate their home during the city's 2104 Grail War. They would most likely not be pleased to learn the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, some data is withheld from the public, usually those involving proprietary knowledge or sensitive information that could lead to rumormongering and cause mass panic. Access levels differ by user.
        </p>
        <p>
          All visitor access is via membership only, which can be easily applied for at any library in the city. The membership grants them the same access level as those of an ordinary citizen. Access to classified information is typically granted on a person-by-person basis.
        </p>

        <h4>The Servant Catalyst Archives</h4>
        <p>
          The Servant Catalyst Archives is, as its name implies, a collection of catalysts that has a high chance of guaranteeing the summoning of specific Servants. It is the largest collection of its kind, thanks to the tireless, and almost obsessive efforts of Alexandria's citizens who worked to retrieve the catalysts from all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          These catalysts include artifacts that have been recovered from the flood, traded, or gifted. Ever since the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frames have been perfected, the retrieval of deactivated Servant Cores have also become a viable way to expand the collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than a single vault, the Archives is actually a dedicated network that connects to numerous locations, where they each store a portion of the catalysts. The locations can range anywhere from an actual vault, to the storeroom of a museum, to an inconspicuous flower pot filled with fake plants on the counter of a local cafe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandria is always happy to lend its collection to people who need them for a good cause. It also accepts trades of no lesser value. However, rarer catalysts need clearance from the head librarians, which almost always includes an extensive interview and a background check.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once the user has been cleared, the network will arrange for the shipment of their desired catalyst. Under no circumstances can the storage location of the catalyst be disclosed to an unauthorized individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to satisfy the public's curiosity, high quality replicas of rare artifacts are usually distributed to museums, galleries, and other institutions for public display. From time to time, thievery is attempted on these replicas, leading to amusing headlines on the newspaper in the following day.
        </p>

        <h4>FateChan™</h4>
        <p>
          Fatechan is an imageboard service hosted by Alexandria and moderated by librarians. It is the only social platform that works worldwide. Alexandria being its host gave Fatechan much credibility, as it is allowed access in every functional city’s City Wide Web. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the simplistic nature of an imageboard limits the types of data that can be posted (texts and images). This cuts down the cost of data transmission, allowing users of Fatechan to stay up to date with the latest posts even in the farthest reaches of the world.
        </p>

        <h4>ServantPedia™</h4>
        <p>
          The ServantPedia head office is located in Alexandria. It maintains the most updated version of the Servant database. A master copy, if you will. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All modifications made to Servant pages must be peer-reviewed by at least one staff member, even if said modification was made by a user in a different city. This is to prevent malicious edits.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the system is not infallible. Skilled hackers and Servants can sometimes bypass security checks to gain access to the database. Thankfully, Alexandria has its own team of technicians and Servants to set up countermeasures, aiming to keep the data loss to a minimum.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="3">
        <h4>2105-03-08</h4>
        <p>
          The tournament begins…
        </p>
        <h4>2105-03-01</h4>
        <p>
          Obtains a copy of Nirvana's database and many recordings of the city's current state. Increased pressure from Republic. Librarians go on strike near the Republic embassy. 
        </p>
        <h4>2105-02-22</h4>
        <p>
          A tournament between Republic and Alexandria is suddenly announced, to the surprise of many but the high ranking members of larger factions. It seems that Republic is intent on breaking its long-standing neutrality with Alexandria and taking control of the world’s largest information hub. The tournament is scheduled for 2 weeks later. Alexandria calls for the assistance of its allies.
        </p>
        <h4>2105-02-18</h4>
        <p>
          Further coercion by the Republic ambassadors. Turns to the Church for assistance.
        </p>
        <h4>2105-02-16</h4>
        <p>
          Librarians closely monitoring the 3rd investigation team learn about what happened to Nirvana. Arranges for the recovery of Nirvana’s database and the investigators’ testimonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Receives formal request from Republic for unobstructed access to all of Alexandria’s databases. Declines request.
        </p>
        <h4>2014, May-July</h4>
        <p>
          Extracts Persepolis’ database. Arranges the auction of Persepolis’ remains upon hearing of its demise at the hand of Holy Grail War participants.
        </p>
        <h4>2104-03-18</h4>
        <p>
          Recovers journal from Nirvana. Much concern for the elusive city. Sends out word about the journal on FateChan.
        </p>
        <h4>2085</h4>
        <p>
          Largest data breach known to Alexandria. No data is lost, but many users’ access permissions have been edited before their accounts were stolen, resulting in tens of thousands of unauthorized accesses to highly classified data. As the breach came from within Alexandria’s own networks, foreign embassies and organizations are suspected.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the unauthorized accesses were random and performed by accounts that belonged to ordinary citizens, it was impossible to assess the level of information leak. The incident prompted the summoning and employment of arts and science oriented Servants, many of whom remain in Alexandria’s services till current day.
        </p>
        <h4>2044, May</h4>
        <p>
          Starts building wind turbines to combat the occasional splurging leading to heatless winters and AC-less summers. Fortunately, these contraptions never ended up being used much.

        <p>
          Church ambassadors are freezing in their rears. Receives a donation of NATs from the church.
        </p>
        <h4>2044, February</h4>
        <p>
          Spends way too many New Atlas Tokens on the acquisition of artifacts. Cannot generate enough power for the city. Forced to power down the weather dome for 3 months to public outcry. Harshest winter and early spring in Alexandria's history. Decides to never splurge again.
        </p>
        <h4>2020</h4>

        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandria begins the development of a standardized hard drive containing databases full of important resources, such as ServantPedia™ and common Old World knowledge. These hard drives would be distributed worldwide over the next few years.
        </p>
        <h4>2018</h4>
        <p>
          Republic reaches out with a proposal of establishing a Servant database. Begins the conception of ServantPedia™.
        </p>
        <h4>2012</h4>
        <p>
          Develops FateChan™. Negotiates access to the other nomadic cities. After a few weeks’ testing, the imageboard is officially put into operation. It immediately receives an influx of spammers, causing heavy server load that results in global traffic jams. Begins hiring moderators to combat spammers, especially Servant spammers.
        </p>
        <h4>2008</h4>
        <p>
          Begins reaching out to all the other nomadic cities to advocate Alexandria’s vision.
