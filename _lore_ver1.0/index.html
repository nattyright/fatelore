              <h2>During the 5th Holy Grail War set in Fuyuki (2004), a catastrophe occurred near the end of that ritual. A Grail failed to produce a wish and there was no determined winner, resulting in the leftover energy produced by the defeated Servants to turn into thaumaturgical energy, also known as the 'Grail Mud'. This mud spread across Fuyuki, devouring the entire city as it grew in size with each landmark, building or organism it consumed. As such, it wasn't long until the rest of the world had to contend with the Grail Mud.<br><br>

                At its current rate, it was simply a matter of time until the mud consumed the entirety of the Earth. As such, Magi were forced to take the spotlight and defend themselves from this catastrophe via Magecraft and Servants of their own. This resulted in commoners finding out that Magecraft was real, gradually reducing the overall Mystery in the world and weakening Magecraft itself.<br><br>

                Unfortunately, not even the combined efforts of the Mage's Association and several other Magi organizations could halt the mud's pace. At best, it could be slowed down. Because of this, some Magi started to think about how to survive in a world completely corrupted by Grail Mud. This resulted in Magi working alongside scientists and engineers, which led to the creation of the nomadic cities. Unfortunately, their structure was deemed too weak to resist the potent curses of the mud.<br><br>

                At least, until one lone Magi appeared. They had no backing from any organization and no one knew their identity, but they had apparently been inscribing runes all around the world. Once they were done, they confronted the mud itself and activated the runes, resulting in a massive flood of purifying waters all around the globe. This dramatically stopped the advance of the mud, since the purifying waters seemed to oppose it somewhat.<br><br>

                The catch, however, was the fact that the entire world was flooded. Due to how sudden and mysterious the flood was, certain Magi organizations had no time to prepare at all and therefore, perished by the very flood that was supposed to save them. Only the Mage's Association survived, albeit its numerous branches dwindled in size as it was forced to turn the Clock Tower into a nomadic city to survive. The rest of the world followed suit, using the nomadic cities as a way to live in the flooded world.<br><br>

                A century passed and the year is now 2104. Nomadic cities have become the de facto way of life as both commoners and Magi live alongside one another. Magecraft and Servants have become commonplace, resulting in the overall death of Mystery and the gradual erasure of Magecraft's power. As such, Artificial Circuits have become commonplace, along with S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes to ensure the summoning of Heroic Spirits without a Grail. The mud still exists and is still a threat, but far less so than it was in the past. The world is slowly returning to something inhabitable...<br><br><br><br>

              <h2>Magic is considered a dead art in this setting, since all notions of Mystery died post 5th Holy Grail War. The knowledge of Heroic Spirits and Magecraft was made public, therefore erasing any form of mystery those two had and greatly weakening the Throne of Heroes and Magecraft overall. Even the Counterforce has ceased its activity altogether, being no longer present in this world.<br><br>

                Because of this, what little remains of Magecraft has been supported by technological advancements such as artificial circuits and Mystic Codes. Magecraft has been modernized and made available to the public, but as a trade off it has become much weaker.</h2>

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Mana &amp; Magic Circuits</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The mages in this world are unable to harvest atmospheric mana naturally through their own magic circuits. Instead, artificial magic circuits are installed as a way to bypass this restriction, filtering and converting atmospheric mana into something a mage can use.<br><br>

                Artificial magic circuits are unique compared to natural circuits, since magi can choose where to install them. This matters a great deal when it comes to efficiency, since the power of an artificial circuit is related to its placement. <br><br>

                Installing circuits in portions of the body that are far from vital organs will result in reduced effectiveness. However, installing circuits in riskier locations such as the spine, the neck, the jaw, the eyes and so on will raise a circuit's compatibility past a magus' natural parameters.<br><br>

                It is, of course, quite risky and puts the magus in harm's way. Overloading artificial circuits that are placed in vital locations can result in harm to the user's internal organs, the destruction of their natural circuits and in more extreme cases, death. <br><br>

                It is also incredibly risky once a Servant is involved, since rebellious Servants who purposefully sever a bond between them and their Master will result in the Master's artificial circuits being placed under severe stress, which usually results in the destruction of those circuits, along with anything else connected to them.

                Concentrated storage of mana filtered from the atmosphere through new and improved scientific methods. They resemble tiny capsules similar to multi-vitamins and are commonly drunk by <b>S.E.R.V.A.N.T.s</b>. They are sold in a variety of stores, ranging from convenience stores to supermarkets. Servants aren’t allowed to purchase them legally, unless accompanied by a master. This does not stop certain Servants from trying to obtain them illegally or without consent, of course.

              <div class="raitrackrelation1">Mages</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Due to the prevalence of artificial magic circuits, anyone can be a mage effectively. However, most people have low compatibility to the circuits and can only use the mana for menial tasks, such as enchanting a book to automatically turn a page every few minutes, or possessing a broom to clean a room on its own.<br><br>

                Because of this, artificial circuits do not automatically make you a great mage. However, they allow your body to be a container for mana, turning you into a living ‘mana battery’ for others to utilize. This is more relevant than one would think, since certain machines in the setting rely on mana input in order to function, such as the leylines present in floating cities that allow those with artificial circuits to ride them as a form of transportation. It is also useful for those who have a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. in their possession, since Servants only require a mana source to function and do not require a talented magus to be their Master.<br><br>

                Those with natural circuits aren’t uncommon, but are usually treated the same as those with only artificial circuits. However, those with both good natural circuits and good artificial circuits are a rare breed. They are usually high ranking members of whichever island they inhabit, be it aristocracy or government officials. Most of the current technological and Magecraft advancements are owed to these talented and naturally gifted people.<br><br><br><br>

                Due to how closely Magecraft and Technology have been linked ever since the cataclysm that almost destroyed the world, both of these development paths have been supporting each other ever since. This caused humanity’s technological progress to skyrocket ever since they were capable of rebuilding their environments and cities, thanks to the assistance of Magecraft which made the ‘impossible possible’.

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The majority of humans have taken to the sea ever since the cataclysm destroyed and flooded most of the habitable lands, residing in nomadic cities that have been built through a combination of technological and magical advancements.<br><br>

                The nomadic cities are not only propelled by modernized sea rune Magecraft, but high tech stabilizers and artificial soil. The railway system around nomadic cities have citizens ride mana leylines through high tech boots. <br><br>

                Each nomadic city takes on the shape of a star with either 8, 6, 4, or 2 angles. The more arms there are, the bigger and more developed the city is.<br><br>
                <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/QdEj7mB.png">
                <div class="subtitle">The 8 point star (Stella Maris)<br></div>
                These are mostly megapolises that have fully developed. They act like an average old world city, with a wide array of facilities that cater to people from different backgrounds. While they don’t specialize in anything specific, these cities tend to be the most robust in both the technological and magecraft scene, since they have become hotspots for other, lesser cities to latch onto and trade with.<br><br>

                <div class="subtitle">The 6 point star (Cynosura)<br></div>
                These cities’ developments are usually propelled by specializing in specific departments such as being the center of commerce, research, and the cultivation of various goods. While more ambitious cities set out on turning themselves into a megapolis, the majority are content with their status and are happy to remain as a lesser, albeit fully functioning city.<br><br>

                <div class="subtitle">The 4 point star (Dhruva)<br></div>
                These cities are a lot smaller and a lot more restricted in function, usually unable to fully sustain themselves and have to import various goods to keep the city running. However, this in turn makes them more focused in serving their respective purposes. In addition, their smaller size grants them the capability to migrate on water, albeit at a much slower pace that most ships.<br><br>

                <div class="subtitle">The 2 point ‘star’ aka ships (Polaris)<br></div>
                Due to resource constraints, ships make up the majority of the new world's <b>intercity</b> transportation. For simplicity’s sake, all ships are classified as 2 point stars due to them taking on the shape of a thin diamond from the bird’s-eye view. These can be as small as a boat or as large as a cruiser, serving various functions such as transportation, entertainment, cargo, or militaristic.

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">City Wide Web (CWW/Citynet)</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Like many other things in the old world, the World Wide Web has fully collapsed due to the flood. Radio and phone signals also became a thing of the past as humans were forced to restore their world without having these tools at their disposal.<br><br>

                However, once the nomadic cities finally found their footing, so did magi and network specialists. They cooperated in an attempt to revive these lost arts of humanity, and succeeded with the development of the <b>City Wide Web</b>, known as <b>CWW</b> or <b>Citynet</b> for short.<br><br>

                CWW functions similarly to the internet, except that it is tied down to a nomadic city instead of being several data centers connected through fiber networks. As such, humans can only access data from their city and nowhere else, meaning that they cannot obtain data from neighbouring nomadic cities easily. It is possible to send data to other cities and access their data, but the further away a city is, the longer it takes to receive a response.<br><br>

                Sending an email from one city to another city on the opposite of the globe, for example, would take at least 2 hours. This is because the signal would need to pass through numerous cities in order to reach its destination, due to the lack of fiber networks in a world filled with water.<br><br>

                However, some resources are shared between all cities. Important resources such as Servantpedia™ and old world data are stored inside special hard drives belonging to the network managers of each nomadic city. These drives are periodically updated with new data and constantly monitored by the city network. Every city owns at least one of these special hard drives. This allows even the average citizen to be able to access these resources through the city's own search engine.<br><br>

                But this only applies to events from the old world or news that is more than a few months old. Recent events, in comparison, are usually kept under wraps and limited to the city in which they occurred in. Most nomadic cities usually keep to themselves, unless their information is incredibly useful and needs to be accessed by another city for political or financial reasons. In these cases, an exchange of data between the two cities usually occurs, or in the worst case scenario, negotiations break down and nobody walks away with anything.<br><br>

                Cities that take smaller cities under their wing also take advantage of the CWW. When two cities form an alliance and merge into a single city, their data centers are usually merged with each other, resulting in both of them sharing the same CWW and allowing citizens from both cities to access each others’ resources. Said data centers are also constantly synced and updated with one another. Of course, this doesn’t apply to allied cities that haven’t merged into one entity.
              </h2>
              <img class="titlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/jQfDvk6.png">
              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Radio Towers and Phones</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Just like the CWW, magi and network developers united forces and managed to restore radio and mobile towers to the world. These towers are bound to nomadic cities and manage to transmit a signal that encompasses areas that go beyond the city, allowing the signal to reach even people outside of the city. This is incredibly helpful for contacting neighbouring cities or nearby travellers.<br><br>

                Every tower in a city utilizes its own network, meaning that travellers with phones will have to change SIMs at every city in order to be able to make calls. As such, some make it a habit to carry multiple SIMs on them, especially if they often travel from city to city. <br><br>

                Of course, dead zones are far more common in this world than they were in the old world. As such, phones are mostly only used in the city, and rarely used outside of it.<br><br><br><br>

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Technology now has a symbiotic relationship with Magecraft and vice versa, which is further proven by the newly developed <b>S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes</b>. <br><br>

                S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes are similar to normal Mystic Codes. They are magical artifacts that are similar to golems and automatons in design, but with modern technology serving as their structure. Their chassis and exoskeleton is entirely manmade, being a husk that is similar to a cyborg-like body merged with their properties enchanted by magecraft.
              </h2>
              <img class="titlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/jQfDvk6.png">
              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">The Core, Processor &amp; Activation</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The Magecraft portion of this Mystic Code comes into play with the core of the golem’s body. It is designed on principle to be the closest thing possible to a Spirit Origin Core, making it a pale imitation of a Heroic Spirit’s core. However, engraved in that core is a powerful processor, one strong enough to hold a mere 10% of the lost Holy Grail’s data within it. <br><br>

                These complex calculations and remnants of True Magic are normally static and inactive, but activate upon interacting with Magecraft of magical circuits. A singular command is then run through the processor, the only feasible command out of the 10% that could be obtained from the Grail: <i>‘Summon Heroic Spirit’</i>.<br><br>

                Once a Heroic Spirit is summoned, the Mystic Code’s functions gradually change. The processor goes inactive, preventing further summons while the Spirit Core becomes the Servant’s own Spirit Core.
              </h2>
              <img class="titlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/jQfDvk6.png">
              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Tracking &amp; Deactivation</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Every S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Code comes with its own unique serial number inscribed onto their core during production, meaning each servant summoned through it can be tracked and forced to shut down via a central network that monitors these Mystic Codes. This essentially works as a kill switch/command seal that lets a master disable their Mystic Code, effectively killing their servant should they disobey them.<br><br>

                The central network that monitors these Servants is usually the producer of that specific Mystic Code in the first place. The Mystic Codes are produced at different companies and facilities, meaning that various Servants can have a different central network monitoring them at all times. <br><br>

                While this might imply that there are different brands of Mystic Codes and competition between corporations that produce Servants, all of the Servant production factories so far are actually owned by a single organization. Said organization is known simply as <b>Republic</b>. <br><br>

                The average citizen doesn’t know much about them. Some don’t even know it exists, but <i>Republic</i> claims to be an organization dedicated to research, development and the betterment of humanity. They call themselves a charitable foundation dedicated to prevent abuse of Servants while utilizing them as tools to rebuild humanity. As such, they do their best to prevent Servants from being produced and sold illegally, such as at black markets or unlicensed factories. <br><br>

                A master has access to said kill switch <b>only if they have bonded with the servant and gained access to the serial on the Mystic Code’s core</b>. Otherwise, management of said servant is done via Republic’s central network, which is actually a combination of the several central networks owned by the different companies under its grasp.<br><br>

                A Servant can, however, technically escape the kill signal by leaving any city they inhabit and avoiding contact with a city’s radio waves. However, this is merely a temporary solution since cities are the only locations in the world where one can obtain mana batteries. In a sense, they would be dooming themselves to a slow death since they cannot absorb the natural mana from the atmosphere and lack a Master.
                <div class="subtitle">Serial Number Naming Scheme<br></div>

                Servant Mystic Codes are given unique serial numbers to make sure that every Servant is treated as its unique entity. This allows the central network to monitor them with increased precision, which is especially handy when it comes to shutting down rebellious units.<br><br>

                The naming scheme convention is relatively simple. Every serial number is formed by four sections.<br>
                <ol>
                  <li>Class</li>
                  <li>Origin</li>
                  <li>Death</li>
                  <li>Random Number Identifier</li>
                </ol>

                For example, the Serial Number for the prodigious Servant, <b>King Arthur</b>, would be written as SBGB050169.<br><br>

                <b>SB</b> = Saber<br>
                <b>GB</b> = Great Britain, their birthplace and origin of their legend.<br>
                <b>0501</b> = Start of 6th Century, which is Arthur’s rumoured death date.<br>
                <b>69</b> = Two random digits created by the system. Used as unique identifiers in case two Servants share the same class, origin and death.<br><br>

                Further examples are listed down below, but most serial numbers given to Servants abide by this standard. Certain Servants are given special serial codes, mostly unique identifiers that only owners of the central network can understand. They are usually given to ‘peculiar’ Servants that are worth paying special attention to.
                <div class="subtitle">Serial Number Examples<br></div>

                <b>ARUR250033</b> = Gilgamesh<br>

                <b>AS</b> = Assassin<br>
                <b>CS</b> = Caster<br>
                <b>BZ</b> = Berserker<br><br>

                <b>FI</b> = Fictional Origin (If no birthplace)<br>
                <b>MY</b> = Mythical Origin (If no birthplace)<br>

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Regardless of how much mana a Heroic Spirit obtains, they are a far cry from any version of them that could be summoned from the Counter Force or the Throne of Heroes. Due to the identical specs used by all of the mass produced S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes, it could be said that most Heroic Spirits summoned through them have the same ‘power level’ as each other.

              </h2>
              <img class="titlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/jQfDvk6.png">
              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Availability</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Due to the Mystic Code’s prevalence on the market, Heroic Spirits are far more common nowadays. However, due to the costs that go into producing a single unit of said merchandise, both legal and illegal purchases are rather expensive. Owning a unit is a hefty investment akin to owning a luxury car. As a result, Heroic Spirits are still exceptionally rare in anywhere but rich and middle class districts. A lot of lower class citizens don’t bother taking advantage of Servants in the slightest, relying on Magecraft instead.<br><br>

                In addition, due to the risks involved in bonding with or deactivating the Mystic Code, which can potentially render a Master unable to bond with a new Servant ever again, Masters are discouraged from disposing of their servants willy nilly.<br><br>

                Masters can either purchase a fresh Mystic Code to activate themselves in order to summon and bond with a Servant, or they can go to auctions and bid on ‘prebuilt’ Servants summoned by other, more competent Masters to bond with. <br><br>

                Aside from being used as fighters in more competitive environments such as Holy Grail Wars, Servant and Master pairs have fully integrated themselves into the average city life. The purpose of Servants is now less than stellar, ranging from being trophies for the wealthy to boast about at parties, to doing manual labour that keeps the city running behind the scenes.<br><br>

                Some Servants, of course, aren’t fond of their new lifestyle. Rebellious Servants are quite common due to some of them being treated worse than slaves. However, the existence of the kill switch forces most of them to be complacent.<br><br>
                <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwdOSmY.png">
                <div class="subtitle">Auctions<br></div>
                Heroic Spirit auctions have become rather common across the globe, where skilled mages summon Heroic Spirits for buyers in exchange for goods, wares or money. These buyers then put up the Heroic Spirits for sale on auctions, allowing any individual rich enough to purchase them, be it in person or online via the CWW. <br><br>

                These auctions are usually approved by Republic and a license must be purchased in order to legally hold an auction. This doesn’t stop black market auctions from happening, however.<br><br>

                Naturally, most Heroic Spirits will disapprove of being seen as commodities and sold as items. However, due to each Mystic Code’s innate kill switch on their Spirit Core, it is possible to blackmail a Heroic Spirit into obeying their buyer, since a forced shut down of their Spirit Core is tantamount to death.<br><br>

                <div class="subtitle">ServantPedia™<br></div>
                Another side effect is that the ‘enslavement’ of Heroic Spirits for the most mundane of tasks has caused humanity to devalue them and Magecraft as a whole. The air of mystery is gone and the identity of most Heroic Spirits can be deciphered from a quick online search, to the point that an entire new app has been created called ServantPedia™, which contains information of most summoned Servants to date. Because of this, bonding and compatibility between Servants and Masters has become even harder, to the point that proper communication between certain pairs is considered impossible.<br><br>

                Despite this, Heroic Spirits are still very much necessary for humanity due to the amount of threats and natural disasters that fill the current world. It is unlikely for them to ever disappear from the globe now that their existence has been massively popularized.

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The creation of this particular Mystic Code is still a mystery. While the makeshift Spirit Core is already impressive enough, the high tech processor is still under scrutiny. No one knows who created this processor containing 10% of the Holy Grail’s data, but it most likely was someone from after the cataclysm since the processor is also engraved with information on what happened to humanity after that tragic event, keeping summoned Heroic Spirits up to date with the most recent happenings.<br><br>

                However, this is most odd, since the Holy Grail is theorized to have been destroyed after the cataclysm, so it is unknown on how the Grail’s data could be stored inside a processor.<br><br>

                Regardless, <i>Republic</i> is credited as the organization that discovered it. This resulted in a huge mass production of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes, further spreading the knowledge of Magecraft and Heroic Spirits across the globe as Servants were slowly becoming part of day-to-day life.<br><br><br><br>

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Once a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Code’s core is activated by Magecraft, the core will instinctively attempt to summon a Heroic Spirit. A successful summon results in the core morphing the cybernetic body of the Mystic Code into a facsimile of the Heroic Spirit that was summoned. <br><br>

                At this point, the Mystic Code is considered more Servant than golem and it becomes impossible to treat it as a conventional machine. The summoning is permanent and the processor goes inactive, making it impossible to summon a Heroic Spirit twice while using the same mechanical body as a catalyst.<br><br>

                A Servant summoned via this method will retain all of its memories from the Throne of Heroes, along with the memories it obtained from the processor (what happened to humanity post cataclysm). A Servant will also realize the nature of its mechanical body, but most likely won’t do anything about it since it is no different than having a body purely made of Ether (in FSN) or Data (in Fate/Extra).<br><br>

                It is possible to tether specific Heroic Spirits from specific time periods by utilizing an item from that specific time period as a catalyst, such as a piece of the Round Table to summon the King of Knights.

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Command Spells, or the Lack Thereof</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                As of now, none of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. models on the market have been able to generate Command Spells upon summoning a Servant, due to their processor chips holding a mere 10% of the Grail’s data. <br><br>

                Without this safety feature, Servant summons have become even more of a double edged sword. Clear, effective communication is more vital than ever, as the Servant is no longer forced to obey their Master and could easily turn on them at the drop of a hat. As a result, the only ways to exercise some degree of control over a summoned Servant is via their mana intake and the kill switch.<br><br>

                Despite <i>Republic’s</i> various research departments pouring vast amounts of resources into the endeavor, progress has been slow and no noticeable improvements have been made. In place of Command Spells remains only a crude alternative that aims to mimic the same role at controlling a summoned Servant: <i>Bonding</i>.
              </h2>

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Bonding</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                It is possible for anyone (yes, even commoners) to reach out to a summoned Servant’s processor core and forge a connection with them, so long as the following conditions have been met:<br>

                <ol>
                  <li>The potential master has installed <b>artificial mana circuits</b> on their body, which are used to sync up to the processor core to establish an initial connection.<br><br></li>
                  <li>The Servant in question isn’t bonded to anyone else at the moment.<br></li>
                </ol>

                The bond grants the master unrestricted access to the processor core’s serial and by extension, the ‘kill switch’ that can deactivate the core and permanently shut down the Servant unit. This protocol bypasses any defensive mechanism the Servant may set up to prevent their shutdown, and overrides any command issued by the head company monitoring the Servant via their central network.<br><br>
                
                The act of bonding itself varies, depending on the traits of the Servant. Some Servants demand specific types of actions to form a connection, which is usually tied to their myth or their feats. As such, there is no universal way to perform a bond and it is a case-by-case basis. Because of this, some Masters forego bonding altogether, in case they do not fit the Servant’s criteria.<br><br>

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                There are multiple ways to sever a bond:<br>

                  <li>Deactivating the Servant via its ‘kill switch’ (initiated by the Master).<br><br></li>
                  <li>Destroying the Master’s artificial mana circuits (initiated by anyone).<br><br></li>
                  <li>Killing the Servant and/or master (initiated by anyone).</li>

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Risks of Severing the Bond</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Severing the bond with a Servant will plague the current master with memories of the Servant's previous Masters in the form of severe hallucinations. It is impossible to prevent this backflow of memories, and even more impossible to predict when the hallucinations will hit, be it while crossing the street, during a meal or through one’s dreams. Prolonged exposure to such hallucinations may make it difficult for the Master to separate them from reality. Suppressants in the form of pills can alleviate the symptoms to a degree and push the hallucinations to the edge of one’s mind for some temporary relief, but they will never truly go away.<br><br>

                In addition, severing a bond will also place great strain on the artificial mana circuits the Master has used to bond with the Servant. Depending on which part of the human body said mana circuits reside in, the damage could range anywhere from a lost limb to loss of vision and even death.<br><br>

                Therefore, Magi and Commoners are generally ill-advised to contract with a Servant via bonding <i>unless they have adequately steeled themselves for the consequences</i>. Likewise, if you see a stray Servant in a cardboard box on the side of the street begging for a new owner and/or mana batteries, please call the Servant Shelter Hotline at <b>xxx-xxxx</b> to arrange a retrieval service instead.<br><br><br><br>

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Like in the original <i>Fate/Stay Night</i>, the Holy Church is an organization that specializes in the hunting of heresy and demons. Being a subsection of the Roman Catholic Church, it works from the shadows through zealots known as Executors and agents of the Burial Agency. They have a tenuous relationship with the Mage’s Association and are also known to monitor Holy Grail Wars as impartial and unbiased judges, albeit there have been rumours of them favouring certain sides over the other.<br><br>

                Unfortunately, like any other large organization in the world, the Holy Church crumbled and split off in the face of the apocalypse. The Grail Mud destroyed its base, and its unique miracles could not save it. Numerous holy relics were lost and the pope was reported missing once the Grail Mud submerged the entirety of Rome.<br><br>

                However, some of the agents of the Holy Church saw warning signs of the impending apocalypse. Rejecting the orders of the pope, they split off the Holy Church in advance and started roaming the world once the apocalypse started. Eventually, they came across a prophet. A ‘messiah’ that would lead them to salvation...
              </h2>
              <img class="titlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/jQfDvk6.png">

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The messiah gathered more followers, and the former agents of the church assisted them in their endeavours. Eventually, the Holy Church would be reborn as the <b>‘Neo Holy Empire’</b>, an organization that calls itself the spiritual successor to the Holy Church from 100 years ago. Being founded around a few decades after the apocalypse, this new organization focused on gathering researchers, scientists and traders, but most importantly, devout people who were willing to follow the Lord. They advertised themselves as an organization seeking to archive and preserve the traditions of old, such as numerous religions ranging from Christianity to Hinduism and Buddhism.<br><br>

                While the majority of its members are still Catholic, the sheer amount of variety in Holy Scriptures has turned it into a peaceful, accepting community that has gathered almost as many members as the Roman Catholic Church in its prime. In the year 2104, the Neo Holy Empire is rumoured to control at least 3 <b>Stella Maris</b> cities, while also having several smaller cities under its protection and guidance. Its relationships with other cities is amicable at best and neutral at worst, but the organization seems to have a distaste for remnants of the Mage’s Association.
              </h2>

              <div target="_blank" class="raitrackrelation1">Magecraft & Technology</div>
              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The Neo Holy Empire, much like the Holy Church before it, abhors the use of Magecraft, considering it to be something that borders on heresy. Members of the Neo Holy Empire are forbidden from utilizing or learning Magecraft, but they are allowed to learn the Church’s own brand of magic, also known as <b>‘miracles’</b> and <b>‘baptism rites’</b>. Unlike Magecraft, which focuses on affecting the physical world, miracles focus on affecting the spiritual world. Therefore, they are incredibly effective at exorcising demons and evil spirits. They are also very effective against Servants, since their Spirit Origin cores are so fragile in a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Code that an Executor trained in the art of miracles could probably harm them far easier than any other mage. Magic Resistance skills still apply, however.<br><br>

                The Church instead places a bigger faith on technology, and one could say that most of the new world’s technological advancements are owed to the Church. Its Stella Maris cities are connected to one another via an intricate transport system that is fully powered by traditional means and devoid of Magecraft. The cities themselves are glorious technological megapolises inhabited by some of the greatest researchers of the time period. The only Magecraft present inside the cities are Sea Runes dedicated to letting them float, but the Church has kept this underwraps by claiming that it is a miracle instead.<br><br>

                The Neo Holy Empire also takes advantage of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes quite often. Due to the lack of Magecraft, most of the cities’ infrastructure was actually made with the assistance of Servants. Even now, Servants are considered to be the heart and soul of cities controlled by the Neo Holy Empire, and are given better rights due to their importance to the Church. However, they are still scorned and treated as second class citizens by most humans, causing some resentment to flow in the city’s darker areas.<br><br>

                Those who are under the Neo Holy Empire’s protection are not encouraged to utilize Magecraft either. However, the Church does not condone them for using Magecraft to survive, such as if the city they are protecting requires ley lines to allow public transport to function and so on. Its bias towards Magecraft is, however, abundantly clear.

It is not surprising that it has attracted so many people under its care as a result, since numerous researchers have joined the Neo Holy Empire because of the facilities alone. Being devout is nonessential, since the Church knows it cannot be picky.

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                The Neo Holy Empire has four main goals in its doctrine:
                    <ol>
                    <li>Retrieve the lost holy relics that were dispersed in the apocalypse.</li><br>
                    <li>Oversee all manners of potential Holy Grail Wars and act as an impartial judge if given the chance to do so.</li><br>
                    <li>Host Holy Grail Wars during specific seasons in the year.</li><br>
                    <li>Recover 100% of the Holy Grail’s data.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Due to these goals, the Neo Holy Empire is very interested in the numerous Holy Grail Wars that have erupted since the apocalypse started. It has been closely monitoring HGWs happening in minor cities via its Executors, who have now been repurposed as scouts and overseers of Holy Grail Wars.<br><br>

                    Data obtained by the Executors is then filtered back to researchers located at the Church’s capital. The Neo Holy Empire aims to use the numerous Holy Grail Wars as a way to reverse engineer the Grail’s data by seeing it in action numerous times. So far, they have monitored around a hundred or more Holy Grail Wars, each one differing in size and being located in different cities.<br><br>

                    However, the reward for such devotion has been minimal. In the span of around a hundred years since the apocalypse happened, the Church has only managed to gather around 10% of the Holy Grail’s data via monitoring alone. As such, they are currently working on an alternative method to gather data on the Holy Grail, but that relies on the assistance of <b>Republic</b>.<br><br>

                    The Neo Holy Empire is ruled by various archbishops and popes, but its main leader is an enigmatic figure known as the Pater Patriae. Not much is known about them, besides that the inner sects respect them deeply and that their orders are usually absolute.

              <h2 class="raitrackrelation2">
                Despite being an amicable organization that has helped many, the Neo Holy Empire currently has a neutral stance towards Republic. Being an organization that utilizes Servants more than Magecraft, the Church tried its best to appeal to Republic and form an alliance with them. However, attempts to contact Republic seemed futile, as the Neo Holy Empire received radio silence for the most part. Eventually, Republic gave in and replied, only to give a rather blunt message.<br><br>

                <i>“Republic are currently not interested in forming any business partnerships with the Holy Church. If you require customer assistance, please contact our Customer Service hotline instead.”</i><br><br>

                The audacity behind that message was enough to infuriate most of the higher-ups in the Church. However, the Neo Holy Empire’s leader ordered the organization to stand down and to keep an amicable relationship with Republic. Their word was enough for the others to quiet down, as they resumed their activities instead and ignored Republic.<br><br>

                However, this was a huge blow to the Church, for the reason they contacted Republic was due to them wanting to obtain the 10% Holy Grail Data that was used in the production of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes. While the Church has obtained their own 10% of data, it is a different category than what Republic obtained, and one could say that their two fragments of data serve two different purposes.<br><br><br><br>
