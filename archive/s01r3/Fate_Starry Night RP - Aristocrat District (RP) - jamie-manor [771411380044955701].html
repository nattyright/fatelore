                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was reaching midday at the Jamie residence. 

Guards shuffled to and from their stations as replacement guards came in. Gardeners were wrapping up maintenance of the grounds, and a shipment of new equipment and goods had moved in. All in all, it was a fairly typical day. This was a day where absolutely nothing could go wrong.

Auster and Lorenzo were having lunch in the dining room deep within the manor, far from prying eyes. However, that wasn&#39;t the only reason that they were hiding. Lancer had to remain hidden, especially after the spat on Mansion Lane. As long as nobody knew what he was capable of, they had the advantage.

It didn&#39;t help that was Lorenzo was grounded.

The battle between Caster, Lancer, and Assassin had angered Auster. The only thing that prevented him from going apocolyptic was the fact that Lorenzo had gotten out of the fight without as much of a scratch. It didn&#39;t help that Lancer&#39;s identity was known to both Caster and Assassin, at least in some marginal way. Granted, the information that fighting them had brought had been valuable, but not for the price.

&quot;...Irresponsible. Very irresponsible.&quot; Auster said, placing his fork on the table and wringing his hands. Lorenzo sat at the other end, looking dejected. &quot;You could&#39;ve died, Lorenzo. What then?&quot; Lorenzo didn&#39;t speak, and simply stared at his plate. Auster sighed.

&quot;Listen. I love you very much, and I don&#39;t want you to get hurt. Something happened out there, and if you want to tell me, I&#39;m here.&quot; He said carefully.  Two butlers, Rodrick and Mikael stood at attention by the door.

Lorenzo looked up. His mouth opened and closed, but no words came out. <em>Was making sure nobody got hurt wrong?</em> He wanted to ask, but couldn&#39;t. &quot;No father. I&#39;m fine.&quot; He said casually.

Meanwhile, at the guard station, a new guard sat down at his watchpost, and took out a newspaper. Hopefully nothing went wrong...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Mansion Lane had been polluted. 

Not by and trash or filth, no. The maid and butlers under the employ of the aristocracy would not allow for their way of life to be impede by dirt. In fact, most folk would not even notice any pollution at all. Yet, having accompanied Midas for some time now, and having witnessed the True Name Release of Opportunity, Szrac was now well attuned to it.

The stench of burnt mana. An odd, usually unnoticeable smell, but Szrac had fine-tuned the Iron Sarcophagus&#39;s receptors to amplify the aroma. And here? Though it had been some number of days since the conflict, the effluvium remained.

There had been a conflict of servants here. No one had come forth with any knowledge of it, but that did not mean that such knowledge didn&#39;t exist. No, these spoiled rich folk simply withheld their information, afraid of retaliation from whatever Mafioso member had caused this spat so close to their home.

They would come to regret this error.

Szrac would approach the nearest mansion to the gate - the Jamie Manor. With Midas in tow, he approached the front gate, stopping just short and glaring over at the guard station.

<strong>&quot;Under the Persepolis Public Protection Act, section two, subsection one, I have come to interrogate those within this household. Open the gate.&quot;</strong>

Why was a tin can standing in front of him, babbling about Acts and whatnot. He stood up a little straighter. Finally, he could act professional. He knew that listening to all the proper procedures would pay off!

&quot;Name. Identification. Proof of SERVANT frame registration. Reason for coming.&quot; The guard said stiffly, looking up at Szrac. The more he looked at the toaster, the more threatening he got. Despite that, the guard couldn&#39;t help but chuckle a bit. It wasn&#39;t Halloween! &quot;Public Protection Act isn&#39;t gonna cut it. Why here in particular? This is private property, sir.&quot;

A few other guards on patrol walked past the gatehouse, before standing at attention. Jamie security had been upped significantly since the break in connected to Lancer&#39;s summoning. One whispered something into a walkie talkie on his belt. They eyed Midas as if he were a deadly explosive, which he might as well be.

The gatehouse guard pulled out a clipboard and eyed it quickly, his gaze flicking between the uninvited guests and the clipboard as he did so. He was obviously waiting on a name.

The picture seemed positively ancient, with a fresh-faced looking teen with a smile on his face. Was this truly the same person as this stoic, cold-hearted tin man?

Without breaking a sweat (or the cybernetic equivalent), he ejected another ID, this one the registration card of Berserker. Placing them both down on the desk of the guard station, sliding it through an opening in the glass made for such transactions. <strong>&quot;You have heard my reasoning previously. I will not repeat myself.&quot;</strong>

He glanced over to the guards, cocking his head to the side slightly. It seemed as though they were already preparing to hinder his entrance before he even made the first step inside. Why did the residents of this manor possess such unnecessary paranoia? Curious...

I understand the reasoning that the ones closest to the conflict could be aware of the happenstances around it, but I would call it time consuming to go around to each of these spoiled children and demand answers.”

Midas hadn’t been opposed to such an outing at first. Of course he wanted to continue his crusade against the poor and working class by taxing them to their limit, but the inner part of him said that this was an opportunity to perhaps start demanding more from the ones at the same class level as he. After all, everyone must pitch in to help a city, including those with the most to give away.

Of course, he did not speak this aloud. The consequences of such intentions could be dire, if not deadly. And not just from the ones he would dare try and tax.

So he stood there next to his master with a semblance of patience. Perhaps if the stars aligned, Szrac would find what he looked for and could perhaps even encourage such acts. Or at least a man could dream.

And nothing but dreams and ambitions swum in Berserkers mind.

All he mostly did was sit in a gatehouse and read newspapers. Occasionally, the boss would come around and he&#39;d be forced to say &quot;Nothing to report!&quot;. His job was truly monotonous. At least the pay was good.

Taking the identification for both Berserker and Szrac, he scanned them and looked at them. He looked at Szrac, then back at the ID. He did this three times. The gesture was obvious. <em>&#39;This you?&#39;</em> It was almost too old to scan, but the Master slot of the Berserker&#39;s card clearly read &#39;SZRAC VAUGHN&#39;, which meant that it at least lent itself a little credibility. Eyeballing the identification number on the card, Berserker was clearly Greek.

&quot;One moment.&quot; The guard said, taking a phone off the desk and dialing a number. He turned his back on king and thug alike. Szrac could just make out a few choice words, like &#39;toaster&#39;, &#39;phony&#39;, and &#39;Yes, Rodrick&#39;.

This wasn&#39;t helping.

&quot;Sorry, Mr. Vaughn.&quot; The guard said loudly. &quot;Auster Jamie will not be available for the next week due to meetings of the utmost importance. Please allow us to escort you off the property.&quot; The guards watching Szrac and Midas stood at attention at this announcement, and hoisted up their guns. This whole thing smelled pretty suspicious...

He was fortunate that his Berserker was not so insane that they were frothing mad. It was situations like this where possessing the slightest bit of reason certainly helped.

The cyborg watched as the security guard processed his information. When he finally reached the conclusion, his glare narrowed. Was this truly how the employees of the aristocracy acted? How foolish. At least the scientists and engineers of the power plant knew to stay out of this way.

Unlike this guard. Someone who did nothing for all his days, simply chowing down on whatever trash food he could get his hands on, wasting time on Citynet while nothing happened. He would need to be reminded of his place.

The air around the cyborg suddenly took on a strange, static-like quality. The guard could feel it, as could those on patrol, with their guns raised.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The last fight had left Ajax unsatisfied in many ways. It was far from the decisive battles that he had participated but he had his share of withdrawals from fights in the past though they were much more heroic actions. Caster&#39;s irritated words rung again in his ears, he had deployed his noble phantasm and revealed its power for a boy who was in no danger at all. Thus he had given two potential enemies valuable information on himself with little in exchange from one party. 

Though what was at the core of his discontent was how governed by fear the Jaime family head was. He could understand the strong protective instincts of Auster over Lorenzo given the boy&#39;s past and general state. However Lorenzo was mentally of age to leave the house, strike out on his own and prove his worth to the world. It would do him no good to remain cooped up here. If anything, the heightened security just painted a larger target on their back and servants would sense the fear like dogs. 

He stayed out of the conversation between the two, wishing to complicate the argument or to irritate the headache he had been developing recently. If anything, it was his frame&#39;s way of reminding him trouble was right around the corner. Though it would soon be followed up by a familiar itch in his left arm that grew into an odd pulling sensation. That was new, he had never felt that before but it must mean that an enemy was nearby and somehow related to him. He was never afraid of any challenger but the thought of possibly encountering someone from his homeland did not bode well for the household. He had to warn the family.

&quot;Master, Mr. Jaime,&quot; Ajax announced himself and gave a quick bow. &quot;I would not usually interrupt but we need to get moving. I&#39;ve just detected a servant near the premises and closing. It would be best if Lorenzo were under my care until the threat passes.&quot;

Leave the premises otherwise we&#39;ll escort yo—&quot; What was this sensation? The guard felt a strong pinch in his finger as he told Szrac to book it. Who did this tin can think he was, waltzing in with a crummy license and a white collar reason? 

A ring? What about his wedding ring? It was a pretty, ornate thing. It was the whole shebang in everything. Three months salary and all! The guard turned to look at it, only to find that it wasn&#39;t there. His brow furrowed in confusion.

<strong>Drip. Drip. Drip.</strong>

Blood dripped from his finger. What was left of it, anyway. 

The guard screamed was a mix of dumb confusion, shock, and outrage. From halfway between the base of the finger and the first joint, the finger had been torn clean off. He saw it underneath the desk, glistening red, the wedding ring having been turned from a ring into a disk. It had dug into his skin and sliced the bone off.

This man was not natural.

The firing squad took aim at Szrac as the guard reached for the phone...

Head Butler Rodrick&#39;s phone rang before Auster could reply to Ajax. &quot;Sir.&quot; He said stiffly, approaching his employer. He flicked on the phone, and screams of pain from a guard, as well as the buzz of gunfire. Nothing intelligible could be heard.

The room was silent as all but Ajax turned pale. Auster began to rise, but Lorenzo beat him to it.

&quot;Aetos...&quot; He said, lip trembling. &quot;You need to...&quot; The rest of the command was obvious. <em>Go help them.</em>

However, your endeavors to waste my time are over.&quot;</strong> Szrac replied plainly, retrieving his ID cards as the guard struggled with his now-missing finger. Then he turned his eyes to the guards, and the rows of guns pointing towards him.

At that moment, a hail of bullets poured out from the weapons of the guards. However, it would be an unfortunately short shower, as they only managed a few shots each before their gun jammed. Upon closer examination, they would realize it was no simple jam, nay: their guns had <em>clogged</em>. The bullets had melted into a single congealed mass, rendering their weapons entirely useless.

<strong>&quot;Berserker, tear down this gate.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The giant man before them nodded once and instantly left their view, as if he disappeared into ether. It barely took him any time at all to exit the manor and find an ideal spot on which to intercept the interlopers.  The crack of gunfire made it easy to trace their positions. He could see the flickering lights of the barrels now and the people they sought to deny entry. 

A man in  a metal suit, how odd. He was no automaton or giant foe like that of Talos but a menacing aura surrounding him nonetheless. A fearsome master to be sure by any metric. Yet the servant beside him was what really drew his attention. The posture he held, the attire he had and the donkey ears were all eerily familiar to him, like the villain of an old bedtime story he had forgotten as he grew up. They were threatening the safety of his master and family and thus they must be stopped. 

Jumping down from the the fence, a massive man appeared before Szrac and Midas like a lightning bolt shrouded in thick blue wool. The mana signature that accompanied him was just as large as his frame and seemed to match some of the remnants from the street. He was larger than life and must have fought just when the Gods began to fade from this world

&quot;Halt, I will have you go no further, trespassers.  Turn back now or state your purpose. It will be your only chance to do so,&quot; his voice rumbled from out under his hood, droplets of rain rolling off its edge. He shifted as he gave his warning, giving a brief flash of some robust metal sheet. As it was, it was hard to discern if it was a shield, sword or lance.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Berserker had absolutely no troubles tearing the gate from its hinges, pulling at the sturdy metal until it gave way entirely. He took it in both hands and threw it <em>inside</em> the premises. Two of the guards were now trapped underneath its weight, struggling to both move their weaponry out of the way and maneuver in such a way to free themselves from it.

Or maybe that was not the correct call, as Midas soon followed after the metal. A few bullets pelted him but left only scratches, guns now jammed via metallurgy. That brief distraction was all he needed to deal with the remaining few guards.

One was sent hurtling with a backhand into the center of his chest, more than likely gaining a few broken ribs in the process. A second one received the same treatment, instead getting a nice solid punch into the gut. A third and final guard could only watch in horror as they received the final blow of this short scuffle. He was sent flying into the nearby station next to the hole left behind by a gate. They smashed into the window and went even further, colliding into the second wall and stopping short of barreling past that final barrier. Bones crunched as they ate the strongest blow dealt to any of the three, falling to the ground and remaining silent.

This all happened in the span of perhaps twenty seconds. The two guards still underneath the gate tried to free themselves still, yet groaned as Midas stepped onto the gate keeping them hostage to the ground.

“You might possess more intelligence than I gave you credit for, Master,” He said, bouncing lightly onto the metal frame. The guards received the message to simply stay put and hope he didn’t decide to hurt them further.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And there was the final security ‘guard’ at the main entrance. Cowering. Trembling. 

Midas approached the man slowly, taking his sweet time in his final act of violence. His weak attempts to stave the King off were futile as he grabbed the man by the throat and hoisted him high into the air.

The process was… terrifying. The neck slowly changed into the illustrious metal he so claimed ownership of, spreading like a disease all along his body. He would find himself unable to breath as his muscles turned metal. Whatever final thoughts he could have came and went quickly as his head was morphed. The body followed along quickly, until his very clothes were now a glimmering gold.

A shell of the former guard now hung rigid, face of fear permanently stuck as Midas tossed the new statue to the side. It clattered and bounced on the ground, a now cracked visage facing the new sight before it: a Servant. 

Midas regarded the newcomer passively. The figure was familiar, not in a sense of understanding but a sense of relative age. This man must have been from the same era, he could sense it. Or perhaps that was his madness showing.

“I will speak for my master this one time by saying we demand an audience. Whatever meetings they once held more important than ours will wait. After all, what might be more important than council with a King? You’d be smart in escorting us to wherever they reside, lest you desire a taxing of your persons. Standing motionless in my throne room would suffice for payment.”

He did not say his name, but the now golden guard probably yelled the quiet part loud.

King Midas was here to collect.

The guard&#39;s screams of terror and confusion were the first thing to go as vocal cords turned to the sparkling metal. Next came the inability to move the mouth and face as the expression hardened into pure gold. Tendrils of gold reached the brain, and it was all over. The guard simply ceased to think. 

As soon as Midas&#39;s statue was complete, it was thrown aside like mere garbage. The other guards scrambled away from it, as though it were infectious like the plague. Their expressions of fear and outrage were very much real.

They would look beautiful as statues.

&quot;HOW COULD YOU?&quot; One of the guards screamed at Midas, a younger man who couldn&#39;t be older than twenty. He and another guard kicked their automatic weapons away and pulled out pistols, before shooting at Midas. One grabbed Ajax&#39;s shoulder while another screamed into their walkie talkie. Wonderful, this would turn into a slog.

&quot;You have to help us... We can&#39;t fight a monster like that alone!&quot; He said as he looked at the petrified guard. The act of turning someone to gold and crippled morale among this first wave of guards. 

—

&quot;It&#39;s time to go, Lorenzo.&quot; Mikael said, the butler grabbing Lorenzo by the shoulder as Auster stood up. He walked to a small red lever that looked similar to a fire alarm. <em>DO NOT PRESS EXCEPT IN THREAT</em> was plastered across the handle. Auster pulled it. 

Alarms blared across the entire property as automatic doors enhanced and protected by magecraft closed and locked. Windows were shuttered and locked. Had they just created a fortress or a tomb?

&quot;We&#39;ll need to activate the bounded field. If Lancer defeats the enemy Master, this&#39;ll all be over.&quot; Lorenzo said. Auster nodded. &quot;Wise. Come, Lorenzo.&quot; Head butlers and family heads alike left the dining room, doors opening for Auster and Lorenzo specifically, before shuttering closed.

<em>Plink.</em>

A stray bullet bounced off of his armor, turning his attention towards the guards, and by proxy, the security situation of the house Judging by the blaring alarms and shuttering manor, it was evident that any this bridge was, for all intents and purposes, burnt. However, that would not stop him from walking across it is at crumbled to ash.

Suddenly, the guards would head the gate creak.

The metal bars of the gate tore themselves free, and thrust themselves towards the guards like spears. Those too slow to react found themselves impaled through the torso, their innards now hanging out through their backs.

<strong>&quot;Your offer is for us to retreat? Ridiculous. Our offer is this - tell you master to surrender and answer our questions, and we will spare this miserable mansion and the miserable lives of those within.&quot;</strong>

&quot;You know as well as I, <em>your majesty</em>, that I can not honor your request,&quot; Ajax said, addressing the title with considerable contempt.&quot;I know your curse and my master will not end up as part of your collection. So I suppose you came here not parlay but to assassinate.&quot;

&quot;And my master will never hear your offer, sellsword,&quot; Ajax said, turning to face Szarc, towering over even the metal man. &quot;It is firmly denied and I will ensure that both of you are driven off, though I care not if you die in the process. I do not honor the life of a man who would associate with a tyrant like the Golden King beside you.&quot;

Ajax threw open his cloak, revealing a mighty shield easily capable of covering the entire profile of a person strapped to his left arm while a large cross between a lance and a revolver was in his right, the light gleaming off its broad, sharpened blade. Yet what might catch Midas&#39;s eye was the deep gash in Lancer&#39;s chest that seemingly cut through where his heart should be. Was he already wounded or was it a reminder of some ancient sin? 

Regardless, Ajax readied himself in a defensive position and leveled the barrel of his lance with Midas, bracing the weapon against his shield and fired several shots towards him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas cared little for this ‘hero’ playing pretend. He cared even less for the new forces at the side of this obnoxious servant. He cared none at all for their antics.

But he did enjoy Szrac’s show of violence. One of these days these two warriors could share a drink at the same table, comrades in arms. At this point, his Master had earned such a display of camaraderie for their full support of his crusade and their ability to hold their own in combat.

First, though, they had to conquer this new rival. They clearly knew him, so they had to have been from the same era, when the whim of the gods was an everyday occurance. Or they could’ve been much like Rider, someone from a future lifetime where knowledge was much more prevalent and widespread.

Regardless, they were not aiming and taking shots at him, much like his previous opponent. Not only were they a coward, but they also were a fool. He was more than ready to evade and dodge his opponents opening volley this time around. Helped that they telegraphed their attack stupidly.


The shots came close, of course. They moved much faster than lasers and missiles. But they missed their mark all the same. Shots whizzed past and grazed his arm as he dodged back, right towards the statue of the man he had turned a minute before. The scratches stung but didn’t kill, and that was enough.

Midas bent over and grabbed hold of the statue by the ankle, swinging it up and forward to fling at his opponent.. This foolish mortal would serve a purpose after all. 

As the statue was sent flying, he wouldn’t be too far behind. His fist was at a prime position to punch the servant straight in their stupid face.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Meanwhile, inside the manor, preparations were being made. Lorenzo and Auster quickly entered the warehouse. It was easy to defend, with only one entrance, and a whole slew of catalysts to use for magecraft. It was the ideal place to set up a proverbial last stand, as activate the bounded field surrounding the property.

Lorenzo quickly drew the primer while Auster worked on the finer detail. While Jamie was no slouch, his father could do the minute details in the blink of an eye. As befitting of an Aristocrat, he was at the pinnacle of the finer workings of magecraft. He nodded at Lorenzo, who in turn took a deep breath.

&quot;Mana reserves: set! Confirming temporal boundary and anchor.&quot;

&quot;Coordinates confirmed.&quot; Auster replied solemnly.

&quot;Primer confirmed. Bounded field steady. Together, we can hold it for a while. Until authorities arrive, hopefully.&quot; Lorenzo said quickly, too scared to even stammer. If Lancer was going to fight on the front lines, he&#39;d need to at least protect himself.

Lorenzo closed his eyes. He had been made to do this. He had been enhanced to perfect magecraft such as this. Even if it failed, and he was weaker than before, he was still skilled. He would <strong>not</strong> tarnish the family name. He had not crawled his way out of desolation for this. The artificial circuit in his hand gleamed. He rubbed his hands together, and started the spell.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Outside, more guards arrived. Truly, the pockets of Aristocrats were filled to the brim with the work of the masses. Several produced guns, while a few wiser guards produced tasers. It didn&#39;t matter, a few tasers were nothing compared to the new abundance of metal that Szrac had to work with.

Suddenly, just behind Ajax, the air rippled and shined. Szrac would detect a massive surge of magical energy. It was a bounded field, obviously. What was its purpose, though? This too, would be clear.

As a few guards desperately tried to retreat, they were stabbed by Szrac&#39;s javelins. They were flung back by the force, and into this bounded field. It was as though they were moving through a progressively thicker jelly. Eventually, they stopped moving entirely. Their faces frozen in screams of pain and terror as they remained in midair, stuck in an eternal millisecond of time.

Ajax, however, seemed to remain unaffected. Was he just built different, or was there something else at play...?

Perhaps more notably, he also revealed his wound, a break in his armor that revealed the flesh underneath. Interesting...

However, that wasn&#39;t the most interesting thing to occur. Perhaps more worthy of attention was the spreading bounded field, which caused all that entered inside of it to slow down to a crawl. It was a macabre sight, the faces of the guards caught in a constant scream of pain, their blood frozen, never to touch the ground.

All was dragged to a halt, save Ajax. 

Immediately, Szrac narrowed his eyes. Whatever this was, it was safe for artificial life forms such as servants, but not living creatures such as himself. Thus, he turned his gaze to the now-shuttered walls of the manor. Using his metallurgy, the sturdy barrier effortlessly crumpled and broke, revealing a gap where the door was.

<strong>&quot;Berserker, capture the Master of Lancer.&quot;</strong> He ordered Midas, turning his gaze to Ajax once more as he took a few steps back, away from the ever-growing field of stopped time. <strong>&quot;I will ensure that their lapdog will not interfere.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Indeed Ajax found himself more eloquent than perhaps he had been in his own time but it felt good to be the hero for once, the shining star of a new world. His opening fire was a bit slower than he would have liked but a warning shot need not be the the most unpredictable thing. It may have not wounded Midas but it more than served its purpose in provoking him to come closer. It was remarkably easy to do so, his opponent must have taken the shape of a berserker. 

The golden statue bounced harmlessly off Ajax&#39;s shield, causing it to reverberate like a deep bell chime. Midas was closing the distance fast but something would seem off as Ajax stabbed his spear into the ground and took a step back, both hands open and ready

As Midas&#39;s fist closed in, Ajax stepped to the right and back, grabbing the berserker&#39;s lunging arm and letting its momentum carry him back. As if in slow motion, Midas could begin to feel himself lift off the ground at an ever growing angle as Ajax locked his arm and used it as a lever to drive him into the ground behind him, back first. With Berserker knocked prone behind him for the moment, Ajax brought his attention to Berserker&#39;s master.

&quot;I am afraid any stalling action of yours will not last long against me, Metal Man. I have fought many bold men before you and never could they draw blood.&quot; He laughed as he trudged towards Szrac, making full use of his height and mass in an attempt to intimidate him. His spear was already back in his hand.

He moved to strike the master with his spear only to have it turn into a feint so that he could swat the man aside with a casual swipe of his shield.

But it gave him a second to think. More importantly, <em>hear</em>. Hear Szrac’s commands. Understand those words. Capture a Master? Without interference? Oh, this was such a wonderful day indeed. It was time to tax these Aristocrats for all they had, punish them for their unchecked, gluttonous greed. 

And best of all, this idiot thought he could easily beat his master? Today was his lucky day. He jumped from the ground, kicking his legs up and forward. Now standing up, he scanned the house for any point of entry. It was easy to spot the gaping hole left by his master. He didn’t even bother paying attention to the forcefield nor its effects, instead dashing right for his opening and doing a graceful running dive inside. 

Time stood still, yet he did not. He narrowly avoided all the furnishings inside by inches and slid across the ground. It burned but didn’t do any actual harm to himself. One final barricade was the wall in front of him, which stopped his crash course in its tracks. 

Slowly, he rose from the ground. No one was immediately present in the room, or at least that he noticed. The sounds of battle could be heard, but they were far. Too far to threaten him. 

At last. Berserker was in.

Chronos Barrier&#39;s fatal flaw was the fact that it was an archaic, unmodified magecraft. Auster had perfected the original design, but the original design had never been designed to interact with Servants or familiars. That was the issue with magecraft revolving around time; it was finicky and annoying to properly use. The fact that it worked at all was a testament to a hundred years of research. Midas breached it with the greatest of ease.

Inside the manor, he was glad to see that this place had far better lodgings then his domain with Szrac. Plush carpets and wonderful plants gave the place a lot more life to it. Or it would, it every window and door wasn&#39;t barricaded with every piece of defensive magecraft that knowledge could buy. At least the doors themselves were a nonissue—Midas could turn them to gold and punch through them—but it was a slog. A king wasn&#39;t supposed to slog! He was supposed to march through the domain of lessers like he owned the place.

He would enjoy taxing these people to Hades and back. 

He&#39;d have to find the location of Lancer&#39;s master first, though. But how? This place didn&#39;t seem that massive, but time was not on the Greek king&#39;s side.

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot;

&quot;Shh! Be quiet!&quot;

A faint conversation could be heard behind a door to Midas&#39;s left. No, more than one. It was too faint, and too muffled... It was time for King Midas to collect.

Bingo.

He took his sweet time, brushing off all the dust and carpet hairs. A King must be perfect for their grand debut, yes? Despite the fact that there was going to be a death in the next minute, the presentation was key. All subjects deserved the royalty at their best. 

They would be terrified to hear the footsteps get closer and closer until they stopped right in front of the door they hid behind. The cowards. He pressed his ear to the door, hearing their every breath. These ears might be unsightly, but they were useful in many other ways unseen at first.

So he did the only thing royalty would do: force the door open. It tore from the hinges quite easily, given his strength. And it revealed two hidden persons. They looked to be the help for the house, or at least a few of them. They cowered and recoiled, but it was too late. It was these people that would bring him to his end goal. 

But first…</span>

He pointed to the one on the left first, making sure they knew that this was not going to be a fun experience. Then the right one, slowly going through each of the words in this childish game. Was this how he decided his victims, people to be encased in that beloved metal?

It was more time than he should’ve spent, but it mattered little to him. A King like him must be granted his sweet precious time with 

He kept going, drawing out the final few words. Oh, what great fun this was! Maybe he shouldn’t be as stuck up and serious as he always was.

“And.” Left.
“You.” Right.
“Are.” Left.
“It.” Right.
 With his pointing hand, he lunged and grabbed the one on the left by the throat. The process was the exact same as with the guard: a slow and awful process that stole away all control. It wasn’t long before they turned into another statue. A capture of their final moments in the perfect medium.

He set them down gently, making sure they stood up straight before turning to the other one.

“You will respect your new King, and you will lead me to the Master of Lancer. I must meet them in earnest, yes?”

Translation: go fast or perish.

Szrac was neither a man, nor a magi. He was a tool to be used. He had been used all his life, by his family, by the highest bidder, and now by the aristocracy. It was not a detriment to himself, nor to those that had created him - this was just a fact of life. It was simply the way that things were, as fate had dictated. He had no strong emotions about it. He likely could not even muster any, even if mocked and taunted.

A tool had one simple function - to do the job required of them, and do it right. Szrac had no intention to defy that function.

His magical circuits flared to life once more as his metallurgy took effect, tearing more of the metal bars from the gate and firing them towards the opposing force like spears. It was a bombardment that would do little to stop Lancer, but it was never designed to. No, its true purpose was as a litmus test.

How would Ajax react to his peers being put into danger?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Being a butler was hard but honest work. You didn&#39;t have to kill anybody, and you spent your working life improving the life of someone else, as well as your own. You became a reliable cornerstone of that person&#39;s life, and you got to hear their secrets. In exchange for nuggets of knowledge, you gave insight and wisdom.

A true butler became a trusted companion, and Mikael had risen to that task with grace. It was all about to come crashing down. A loud <strong>BANG</strong> was heard outside the safe room that he and and a housekeeper were staying in.

Safe room? Mikael almost laughed aloud. He certainly didn&#39;t feel safe, and neither did the housekeeper. Her name was Rachel, if he recalled. He wasn&#39;t the best with names. The head butler Roderick remembered names. He remembered faces, and he was certain that the fear on her face would be plastered in his mind for as long as he lived.

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Rachel whispered. Before she could utter another word, Roderick put a hand on her mouth, hoping that nobody would hear.

He whispered into her ear &quot;Shh! Be quiet!&quot; Maybe the monster out and about in the manor didn&#39;t hear them. No matter what, their ears were only human. They couldn&#39;t pick up anything through several iron doors.

<strong>ScREEZzzCHK...!</strong>

The terrible sound of a mix of iron and gold being torn apart reveberated through Mikael&#39;s skull. The housekeeper squeaked and Mikael tried as best as he could to soothe her. It wasn&#39;t working, and what did he expect? It was demeaning to expect anything other than pure, unadulterated terror.

The sound repeated several times as more doors were torn apart, and each closer than the last. Eventually...

<strong>SCREEEEEEEEEECHZ!</strong> The door in front of them was torn off its hinges as a Servant stepped in.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In any normal situation, Mikael would not be impressed. King Midas was not a physically imposing man. In fact, he was much more like one of the drunks that Mikael might run into while in a bar one one of his days off. Big bellied and muscular, he could probably beat up Mikael if he got a good punch in, but Mikael was fast. It was likely that any ordinary man would never touch the butler. 

However, this was a Servant, and a dangerous one at that. In a situation like this, a man as physically ordinary as King Midas could cast a very large shadow.

The man pointed at Mikael, and his blood froze. The Servant simply smiled, and said &quot;Eeny&quot;. He then turned to Rachel, and said &quot;meanie&quot;. It was obvious what was going on, and the butler didn&#39;t like it one bit. The monster was playing a game with their lives, on which one would be offed first. Mikael squeezed his eyes shut. It was too much. Midas continued his game of sadism.

&quot;It.&quot; Mikael opened his eyes, only to see that the bastard had chosen Rachel. In the blink of an eye, Midas grabbed her by the throat, and Mikael watched on in horror as she became a statue of gold, the fear in her eyes visible as they became covered in the precious metal. There was no need for the butler to remember her face any more. It was etched in gold for him to remember forever. 

Midas pointed at Mikael. &quot;You will lead me to the Master of Lancer.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This nightmare just kept getting worse. First, the manor had been assaulted. Secondly, the enemy Servant had broken in. Then his fellow partner in hiding had been turned into gold. On top of it all, this fat man wanted Mikael to lead him to Lorenzo. It was obvious what would happen there. He would die or be turned into gold. Mikael shuddered. Lorezno wouldn&#39;t even survive the process. His body would probably fail halfway through the conversion. As for Auster? Who knew? Killed and tossed aside like garbage, most likely.

He was far too loyal to the Jamie family. His life had been terrible before, and this family in particular had pulled him out of the gutter. There was no need for anyone with his skillset. Aristocrat families just made their own homunculi if they needed staff. Auster hired staff because he was wise about spending, and had the knowledge of budgeting to make it happen. Lorenzo was the only reason he had gotten hired in particular. He simply ran into Mikael at the ice cream parlor one day and had offered him a job. His logic made no sense.

Mikael couldn&#39;t have children. His wife was incapable. The closest thing that the butler had to a son was Lorenzo, and this didn&#39;t go unnoticed. He was chief of Lorenzo&#39;s staff. Mikael did his best to help Lorenzo sneak outside whenever he could. Butlers kept secrets, and so he kept them.

Midas was asking him to throw that away.

He looked towards his coworker, turned into a golden statue. He stood there awkwardly for a few moments, eyes darted rapidly. It was such a simple request. Lead this Servant to Lorenzo, and then sneak away while the Servant had his way with them. He had plenty of money, and he could probably pawn off some of the gold that this Servant had made as he fled. He could be safe for life. <strong>So why didn&#39;t he DO it?!?</strong> It was right there!

The best thing he had was a kitchen knife from lunch earlier today. It had been Auster&#39;s and he had requested a replacement. Mikael forgot to take it out of his pocket. Why didn&#39;t he remember? He could&#39;ve saved the housekeeper. He had been stupid. He pulled it out.

&quot;...I can&#39;t.&quot; Mikael said, tears spilling out of eyes and snot running down his face. He looked pathetic and repulsive with fear twisting his features.

&quot;*I can&#39;t tell you where he is. I am under orders to protect the Young Master Lorenzo and Master Auster... It would be in direct violation of my signed agreement if I were to give information to an enemy, king or otherwise. Even if I&#39;m going to die here, but you won&#39;t get anything from me. Nothing!&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas looked at the pathetic excuse of a man. He could not fault him, to be completely honest. Staff for any estate with important people must be chosen carefully, and this ‘Auster’ must have picked a good person for the job. Loyal. Honest. Willing to die for the cause.

And so, he did.

Midas caught his hand as soon as he was in range. He crushed the bone and muscle before he could even turn them to gold. The crunch was sickening, but that was just the beginning. He pulled the butler up by the now shattered wrist, bringing him eye-to-eye. Midas saw a mix of both absolute terror and a firm determination. And tears, but all those did was give Midas a blurry picture of himself through the reflection of those orbs.

“Your employer chose well. You, did not.”

Midas would watch and stare as this defiant, perfectly capable person would slowly die in his eyes. The transformation this close was not something he was able to witness every day. Sure, various household objects and knick knacks were perfectly wonderful to witness being transformed into something entirely else. Atom by atom, changed by the magic of his own into something far more worthy of existence.

But it wasn’t the same as a real living person.

Muscles became stiff, bones stronger than before. Hair would become brittle like glass. Nerves would shut off. Yes, the sight brought joy to his eyes.

Much like Mikaels. Now he could see himself clearly in the shining light. A King, tall and proud. This look suited him, much like Mikaels new look suited him. A perfect statue, full of raw emotion and expression. An artist would be put to shame by his handiwork. 

Or be terrified, whichever or.</span>

It did little to help him with his current mission, which was running short on time. Where could this ‘Auster’ and ‘Lorenzo’ be? Lots of places, which there wasn’t time to check. 

Midas left his followers and returned to the previous room. Another door stood in his way, but shattered as he put all his weight into the ‘cheap’ material. Splinters and fragments filled the air as Berserker stepped into the hall. Two main directions presented themselves, left or right. Such a hard decision, what would he possibly decide?

Fluffy ears twitched. He searched the surroundings for any odd noises. Whispers in the walls, springs waiting to be sprung, anything to indicate living humans. And he was getting something… very faint. Indescribable, but something more than any air conditioning or background static. But it was not left, nor was it right. Up? No, that wasn’t right. If it wasn’t any of those three directions, that left down.

Hiding in the basement? Silly, Midas immediately considered them more foolish than he thought. Poor butler, he had been told a complete lie right before his demise! It was okay though, his boss would be able to say so in a few minutes.

But how to get there? He looked around and saw no immediate ways of reaching below ground. Not only that, but a King was not to take the stairs unless absolutely necessary. Those new fangled ‘elevators’ were also out of the question. If even for a few brief moments, turning golden the buttons might ruin its function entirely. Which left brute force.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thankfully, Midas had plenty of that. He gathered all his strength into his legs, and lept upward. He went further than the average man, and gravity brought him down just as hard. Before landing, he returned all his weight and power back into the legs. 

Light fixtures and paintings would physically shake at the raw force put into that powerful blow. Except for the floor, which stood firm as ever. Midas rolled his eyes back into his skull as he prepared another jump.

And this would continue for a time. A slower but more forceful jackhammer was the correct comparison. Each stomp would make anyone quiver in their shoes. Surely this was a waste of time, the stairs would get him there faster than this foolish method? For a few brief moments after many jumps, Midas too considered the thought. Time was not his friend in this endeavor.

But then he felt himself <em>down</em>. The ground around him was cracked, sinking below the immense pressure and repeated force in a relatively small area. Berserker smiled wildly. Perhaps this wasn’t a waste of time afterall. 

Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down--

And he was through. Structural integrity finally caved for its King, letting him pass through the very floor. It would steal his dignity for such an act though, as he fell through messily. An unbalanced fall left him flailing around as gravity sent him plummeting to the new floor.

He crashed, falling flat on his back. His legs felt sore, his back slightly smarting. His head swam and lights shook in front of his vision as he sat up. Dust essentially caked his head, which fell around him as his ears flicked away the particles. The process left him worse for wear, but it had worked. 

The King came back to his feet slowly, dusting himself off one time too many in the last few minutes. One down, another how many to go.

Up...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With Berserker now having breached the premises, Ajax had temporarily failed in his goal to prevent harm to his master and that failure bite at the edges of his mind. Every second he spent here meant the odds of Lorenzo or his family coming into harm&#39;s way and dying. The enemy master knew it too and forced Ajax&#39;s hand by putting the lives of the guards in immediate threat. This was a stalling action and perhaps if he was summoned in a different vessel, Ajax would have just ran after Midas, but he had a role to play. 

Granted the act of defending his fellow man against a rain of arrows was something he had done many times on the beaches of Troy. Though now facing an opponent who could make course corrections did alter things but also exposed a weakness. If he could divert the man&#39;s attention, it would be a lot easier to deflect the metal spears.

As such, Ajax lept back towards the men, positioning himself to where either his shield could block the arrows or his lance could smack them down. At the same time, Ajax would provide counter-fire with his gun lance to force Szrac to dodge incoming fire himself or take the slugs and risk the decrease in accuracy that would come from the resulting trauma. 

<em>Lorenzo, I will be back to protect you soon. Just hold out for me this one time.</em>

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Lorenzo asked, clutching at his father as dust rained down from above. It was as if the manor itself was groaning in pain as combat continued above. Auster nodded, and shushed him. Was the entire warehouse going to fall on top of them? He hoped that the dust raining down from the ceiling didn&#39;t trigger any fire alarms. They were custom made to respond to any form of debris or fume. There had been many accidents down here due to the seal on a barrel being broken.

—

Midas&#39;s descent into the bowels of the Jamie base was slow, painful and a massive pain in his royal side. While the manor aboveground was nothing overly special, the massive amount of investment into underground infrastructure had to be commended. There were entire dining rooms, elevators, places for magecraft rituals, and even a few server rooms. They had truly been prepared to hold out. It would be even better if it was all gold, however...

<strong>SMASH!</strong> <strong>THUD!</strong>

This eternal song and dance seemed to go on for several more floors. The light of the manor on the surface seemed to be getting dimmer and dimmer, until suddenly...

<strong>THUD!</strong>

Midas fell down to one of the deepest floors, and saw... a boy.

—

The person before Lorenzo was absolutely a Servant. He generated the same type of authority as Aetos. The type that someone gained from fighting in a world far more cruel than the modern one. However, while Lancer&#39;s aura was far more calm and protective, this one screamed for blood. Lorenzo would&#39;ve kneeled as quickly as he could, but the impact probably would&#39;ve cracked his knees. Besides, this Servant didn&#39;t deserve his respect.

He stood firm.

Despite this, he didn&#39;t say a word. He just stared at Midas, and Midas glared right back.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas’s journey so far had been long and painful. If he were a flesh and blood human, this would’ve destroyed any and all forms of flesh and bones more than a dozen times over. If it was even possible to do this sort of thing as a human, that is. Each floor was another barrier in his way, and it wasn’t about to let him through easily despite his status.

But it was progress. Each floor was one step closer to his waypoint, and his ears confirmed such a thought process. Yes, it wouldn’t be long now…

Up.

Down.

And he broke through.

This time, he was more than prepared for what was to happen; the past few floors had given him insight on what not to do. As he crashed through the floor, he gracefully let gravity carry him down instead of merely falling in place with the remains of the materials. This allowed for a more dignified landing deserving of a King. 

And he landed onto the floor, careful to not lock his knees as to not break them. And he then rose from his bent position, standing tall and mighty over his targets. The older fellow was obviously the father of the boy, no doubt about that. They were too closely alike to infer anything else. The kid, however, did not carry the same ‘energy’ that his dad did. 

That is to say, he looked sickly. Weak. A stiff breeze threatened to break his ribs, while even a few drops of a mild poison would shut down every single organ in that small body. His body language hid a dangerous fact: he would not survive any sort of physical attack from himself, intentional or accident.</span>

A terrifying man, voice rough as gravel yet as old as gold. “My first demand: tell your Servant to stand down and discontinue his attacks, or send him back to the Throne from whence he came. It does not matter which.”

He took a few steps closer to the pair, golden orbs locked onto the eyes of the older one. He did not know which was Auster and which Lorenzo, but the odds of the Master being such a small child were <strong>impossible</strong>. How could such a sad thing do something just as grand as perform the ancient rites of summoning?

That was perhaps the greatest boon that Szrac could rely upon. Knowing that Lancer felt something foolish obligation to protect his lessers was his Achilles Heel, a chink in his armor even greater than the crack within his chestplate. The iron bars bounced off of the shield, failing to pierce through the bronze and iron and clattering against the floor.

However, it wouldn&#39;t take long for Ajax to try and counter-attack, firing his lance&#39;s gun towards him. Were he in a different scenario, he would be forced to scramble and dodge, giving his foe a moment to strike back with greater force. However, the art of metallurgy was a wide and varied one, and through summoning the great King Midas, he had gained a boon greater than any other he could know.

The metallurgy focused around the golden statue, dragging it through the air and in front of the cyborg. The once-human shield absorbed the blast, though it shattered into dozens and dozens of shards in the process. 

However, that was a vast improvement. Szrac sent the broken pieces of gold forward, spikes of precious metal aimed at the civilians, and forcing Lancer into a continued stalemate.

However, in the current situation, Ajax could not fully appreciate that cause. If anything, all he was doing was delaying the execution of hostages with himself at little risk of being harmed himself. The people behind him were nothing but means to an end to his foe. Only a king, a sociopath or a murderer would see people as tools to use and Ajax was facing one now, he knew that in his bisected heart.

His own good will was being used against him to buy time so that Lorenzo could be taken out by the cursed king, and there was nothing he could do at the moment without jeopardizing more lives. As long as he deflected the metal, it could always bounce back to Szrac and grace him with an infinite supply. Though perhaps he could limit that supply...

Dismissing his spear, Ajax began using his free hand to grab what metal came his way and began stuffing them behind his shield. Szrac would find that any of the metal now behind the shield would no longer respond to his powers, denied by some kind of rival field of sorts. It was a slow painful process that cut into the flesh of his hands and arms, but bit by bit, Ajax was attempting to starve the mercenary of precious metal.

Logic would dictate that the older one would face Midas&#39;s demands, reveal himself as the Master, and grovel at his feet, begging forgiveness.

That was not the case.

The small, sickly child who had the nerve to glare at the king of Greece stepped forward. As Midas described, he was sickly. Frail. An individual such as this didn&#39;t deserve to exist. He <strong>couldn&#39;t</strong> exist. Natural selection existed to stop people like this from living. Lorenzo Jamie was effectively a dead man walking, existing only due to his creativity and sheer force of will. Will wasn&#39;t going to save him now.

Lorenzo took a step forward. &quot;I&#39;m—&quot; He was pulled back by Auster, who clutched him close to his chest, and turned him away from Midas. 

&quot;I am the Master of Lancer!&quot; He shouted. Auster Jamie was still a fully fledged Aristocrat, and even in the crumbling remains of a safe house, he still exuded authority. He pointed at Midas. &quot;You have the gall to assault my staff, my men, and break into my home, and still have the nerve to demand something of me?&quot; He said, as if talking to a small child who had gotten into mischief. His outrage was genuine, but as was something else:

Worry.

I cannot fault you for your current actions. If I were still mortal, I would perhaps even follow the same line of thinking.”

Midas inched ever forward, “But that is also a blessing in disguise. I am no longer shackled by such trivial things like ‘family’ or perhaps even morals. At the end of the day, all will kneel before a King, and there exists no greater a King than I. Once I remove you from the equation, and the rest of the actual members of this Holy Grail War, I will claim that blessed grail and return to my previous status before all of you pathetic excuses for a race decided to turn the world into water and sink my home: A King.”

Berserker would shoot his hand forward and grab the hem of the Father’s clothing, right behind his neck. He lifted the man up, high off the ground. “I will grant you the mercy I did not show your help: a second chance. Perhaps I might even let you handle some of my more trivial matters once I am a Ruler again, if you grovel and beg hard enough.”

Auster would feel his clothes start to feel a lot colder, less comfortable. Not himself, but it was very obvious what would be turned into gold next if he did not comply with his demands.

“This would be such an awful sight for a child to witness, do you not agree?” He whispered into his ear.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Auster Jamie was an Aristocrat.

He did not feel fear. He did feel regret. If he was this city&#39;s elite, then it was his duty to help participate in its governance. He helped thwart the Mafia threat, and gave a hundred people jobs on his payroll. He was the father of the Master of Lancer, one of the three knight classes. As such, he had his pride as a father, an employer, and a leader.

He laughed, a proud, callous laugh comparable to Berserker&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t the laugh of someone who was backed in a corner, but a laugh of a gamemaster who had inserted them self into the game, had gotten cornered, lost, and had laughed at the other players for being confined to the limits of the board.

&quot;Lorenzo!&quot; He called out as his clothes turned to gold. He gestured with his head throughout the entire safe room, where barrels had been strewn about, leaking refuse onto the ground, which steamed and smoked. &quot;Don&#39;t give into this brute, this false king. He is the ruler of nothing but gold and pity. So arrogant and boorish that he shows his identity to all.&quot;

Auster turned to look back at King Midas, before spitting in his face. &quot;I&#39;m an Aristocrat, not some dog to beg for scraps. My son is strong! Strong to make his way back from death&#39;s door. Whatever you do to me, Beggar King, is nothing. Lancer will skewer you like the pig that you are, no matter what.&quot;

He spat in Midas&#39;s face. He wasn&#39;t going to let Midas see an ounce of fear. There would be no satisfaction of victory here. Nothing but superiority and scorn.

Midas might be king, but he certainly wasn&#39;t one in this little corner of the world.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The second Auster’s saliva touched his face was the second he changed his grip from his clothes to his neck. A third time doing this specific tric, but it worked out pretty well. He turned the man away from his son, directly into his own face.

“Don’t think yourself too clever. Dead men don’t have such luxuries like thoughts and emotions.”

Midas knew his game plan: piss him off before going out in a painful and terrifying way. He wasn’t inexperienced with the maneuver as a whole. Many a king and queen in the past had done so after being conquered by his own, desperate to maintain the status quo of being ‘royalty’ and above everyone else. The first one drove him up the wall, but every other time hadn’t even got him to show a single emotion. How?

Death was the greatest equalizer to have ever been created. It was the only point he’d let any and every god hold over him. Soon enough, this arrogant, greedy aristocrat would be nothing more than another drop in his pool of wealth. Much like everyone else that dared go against him.

And he watched as the man was turned into nothing more than another statue. This one truly brought a tear to his eye, which he wiped away only after the process was complete. Such a beautiful creation deserved nothing more than to be placed near the base of his throne, to be admired forever more…

Unfortunately, there were more pressing matters at hand. Specifically, the boy. He knew that Lancer would be gone in this world soon enough. Their master had been dealt with, and a Servant without a mortal to chain them down to their realm would soon find themselves back on the Throne. 

But how could he leave a Father without their son?

Midas dropped the man, letting him <strong>THUNK</strong> and <strong>CLANG</strong> on the floor while now staring holes into the defiant child. “Do not be afraid, little one. Your father will have company soon enough…”

And he approached Lorenzo.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Was being Lorenzo suffering? At this point, he himself didn&#39;t know.

His body, as frail as it was, was rarely accustomed to numbness. He felt it now. As if in a trance, he crawled towards his father. Somehow, he avoided Midas&#39;s touch. Perhaps it was Midas&#39;s luck working against him. Maybe had had used it all getting into the house, or maybe it had ran out when he managed to knock Opportunity on its side.

&quot;Father.&quot; Lorenzo said quietly as he feebly pushed at Auster Jamie. The boy&#39;s limbs were too weak to shift the heavy gold. The metal was cool to the touch. The boy wouldn&#39;t feel the warmth of his father again. Only the weight of gold remained. Gold and memories. Tears began to pool in Lorenzo&#39;s eyes. &quot;Father... You have a meeting...&quot;

Midas turned to reach for Lorenzo. The son of Lancer&#39;s Master was so tantalizing close, and he&#39;d look like a fine piece in his collection. However, something was off. There was something strange going on with Auster Jamie&#39;s statue. His left hand wasn&#39;t gold, nor was it in the process of turning into gold. That was strange. Midas was absolutely certain that he had turned the man into a statue. A specimen this fine had deserved his undivided attention. There was no way that he had made such an obvious mistake.

Lorenzo held up a small silver clock. Instead of ticking like a normal pocket watch, it seemed to be frozen. Despite that, ticking could be heard.

<strong>Tickticktickticktickticktick.</strong>

Was this boy stopping the golden touch? 

&quot;You went for the wrong one. I&#39;m the Master of Lancer.&quot; Lorenzo said grimly. The barrels that Midas had knocked over continued to steam and sizzle in contact with concrete, creating smoke. That smoke wafted up to the ceiling. Connected to the ceiling was a small device. 

The fire alarm began to beep, and then all of a sudden, water began to pour from the ceiling. Lorenzo&#39;s hair quickly became drenched, as did Midas. 

Was this fate?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas was perplexed by the sight in front of him. How had the older man not been fully turned into gold? His magics were designed to not fail, much like himself. Sure, there were always the occasional happenings when the gods stepped in and deemed him unable to be perfect. But this did not strike him as such a moment.

And such a weird clock… how did the mechanisms produce the sound despite never moving? This child must have survived through sheer magical force alone, there was no doubt about that. That would explain his claims…

“It won’t matter in a few seconds,” he said. He went to grab the child--

And that’s when chaos struck. Alarms went off, the smoke from the barrels too plentiful to be ignored for any longer. That wasn’t the problem though, the problem was what followed after:

Water.

The first drop immediately scared him. The torrent that followed after was a nightmare. He roared, both in pain and in confusion. He clutched his head, shaking all around to get all the water off of him. It did nothing, though, as there was simply too much water coming down for him to ever be free of it. But he was too focused on all the water to think about escape or ways to prevent the downpour. 

His panicking motions continued on for a few seconds longer before he fell to his knees, head buried deep in his hands. His cries fell silent, he sat motionless on the ground. Was water an actual threat to the king?

Not in the way Lorenzo might’ve hoped. Instead, he felt the King drawing magical energy from the environment and his master far away. A trickle at first, but quickly evolved into a rapid river flowing into his body and frame. Was he about to deploy a Noble Phantasm?! How the hell did a Berserker, specifically Midas, get two of those things?! What important events and abilities did such a King Possess?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And then, he spoke. “Dionysus,” he muttered. “I’ve realized… the error of my ways.”

“If only for a moment, release me from this… curse.” He was talking normally at this point, his voice slowly rising above the loud pitter patter of droplets onto the ground. He was now staring deep into the palms of his hands, entranced by the texture and creases in the skin.

“Return me to A Humbled KING!” he yelled, extending his hands and upward towards some unknown force. A prayer? Or perhaps he was begging some godly force for something to help him out here. 

And the magic drain was gone. The Noble Phantasm was over, but the effects of it were yet to be seen. He looked about the same, his stature was the same as it had been before his mental breakdown. But his eyes, something was gone. 

They were now a sky blue, instead of that dastardly gold from before. Gone was the godly arrogance, the malice, to contempt he held for others in them. Now they were full of confusion, . He looked upwards, towards the falling rain. He saw the hole in the ceiling, followed by another and another…

Midas observed his surroundings. Sat in the middle of the room was a child, clutching tight onto the golden remains of a man. It looks as if his other self had been busy before this transformation.  He dared not look at their eyes, in fear of the emotion present. Only a monster or someone of powerful will would be able to stare into such sad eyes. 

The King observed his surroundings, still in confusion as to where he was. His mouth stayed partially open the entire time, in awe at the marvels around him. The sights. The horror.

“Dear gods,” he finally spoke to Lorenzo, voice much softer than before. “What have I done?”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This Servant was a Berserker. Lorenzo Jamie was absolutely certain of that fact. Additionally, he knew the telltale signs of a Berserker class Servant. Before, Midas was brutal and unhinged enough for anyone with eyes to know that this was a Servant not worth messing with. This was different. The calm, collected insanity of a king who had turned all that he loved into gold had been substituted for a far more mellow man.

Lorenzo&#39;s hair and clothes were soaked through, sticking to his wire thin frame. He was nothing but skin and bones, with dark gray streaks coursing through his upper body. These almost looked like veins, except for their metallic, shifting nature. These were no ordinary veins, or were they even veins at all? They looked almost like snakes, biting into and poisoning their host.

&quot;You killed my father.&quot; Lorenzo said simply, looking up at him. The blows landing like hammers. There was little malice behind the statement, Lorenzo was too meek for senseless outrage, especially after Lancer&#39;s fight with Caster. That didn&#39;t stop the pain behind the words from leaking through. It wasn&#39;t an accusation, or an insult. It was a simple statement laced with pain and tears.

&quot;You killed him, and h-he&#39;s dead, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Tears began spilling freely now, or was that water from the sprinklers? &quot;Who else did you kill on your way down here? I need to know. Please, tell me. How many people died for this to happen?&quot;</span>

Was that why he needed the grail? He flashed back to a scene with Lancer several days ago, though they felt like years. Lorenzo had wished for the freedom to go wherever he wished—to fix his body. Was that what he had wanted then when compared to now? No, that wasn&#39;t right. Maybe he had always wanted this. 

Without a catalyst, mages summoned likeminded Servants. Was that why Aetos had been summoned instead of anyone else?

The damage was right in front of his face, why did he ask such a foolish question? And others? Well, his memory was a bit hazy since his transformation, but if he tried hard enough…

“I-I think there were two others. Upstairs. A maid and a butler, hidden away. And a man in the yard…” That left his count at about four he could remember, all in such a short time. How long had he been active in this world? Weeks? Months? Servants can’t recall how long they were in worlds in previous summons, but knowing himself it couldn’t have been too long. His nature didn’t allow for such a being to exist without termination or death by combat.

He looked back up, towards the sprinklers. The Grail or Throne had given him information on such technologies, but seeing it in person was much more impactful than having passive knowledge. But it wasn’t the beauty of technology that drew him to look but regret. If only these blasted things had come on sooner, then…

No, the past was just that. No point in dwelling on such matters, lest he succumb to despair and never try to fix things. He sat up and then rose, standing with the humility and age of a true King. He was slightly hunched over, hands held together behind his back. With little steps, he inched closer to the statue and son still holding on. 

“Young one…” he said. Midas stopped himself, unable to think up the right words for this situation. Apologies would get him nowhere, as would begging for forgiveness. He did not deserve as much, he knew it in his heart. And a golden statue was all that remained of those upstairs, souls now departed for whatever the Gods had in store.</span>

‘Me’ was the word he wanted, but he couldn’t even muster up the strength to spit it out. It left little to the imagination on how this personality was the one locked up inside of the more dominant, aggressive side of him. Even the Throne thought him weak to only deserve the container of Berserker. Surely a punishment from the Gods.

“Tell me,” he got down on one knee, eye level with Lorenzo, “what is your name?”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Two more upstairs? Lorenzo&#39;s heart froze momentarily, threatening to stop beating altogether. It should&#39;ve turned his blood to ice, but it didn&#39;t. Was it shock? Or perhaps he was simply getting numb to the pain. It threatened to consume him, to wash over him like a dark tide, and to drag him down to the depths of despair.

He had to remain strong for everyone. Lorenzo took a deep gasp for air, and wiped his eyes. He was an adult, not some child. He was the head of the family, now that his father was indisposed. Not dead. Auster Jamie was <strong>not</strong> dead! He wouldn&#39;t allow it. Even if this Servant had turned him to gold, he&#39;d bring him back from the brink.

All the time he had spent fixing his broken body with magecraft? That was a drop in the bucket. Nothing. Nada. Zero. It was NOT impossible. Not... impossible... He suddenly felt weak. He had overexerted himself. Was his mind&#39;s rampant racing too much for his body to take? That barely made sense.

There were no absolutes in magecraft. As such, there was a way to return Auster Jamie to his original form. Lorenzo had to believe that. As long as he fostered that hope, he could communicate with this Servant.

This Midas was obviously different from the one previous. As such, it was impossible for Lorenzo, even if he was capable of malice, to hate this Servant. He had little idea what he had done. It would be like kicking a dog. He was broken, and Lorenzo could relate. Perhaps the world was out of whack. What was he doing, empathizing with a Servant who had killed so many people?

&quot;Lorenzo. Are you the king from Greek Mythos who turned those he loved into g-g-gold?&quot; It was an obvious question. Stupid and irrelevant. Lorenzo elected to charge forward.

&quot;Is it worth it? Your wish.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax&#39;s method of countering Szrac&#39;s metallurgic assault worked, preventing the makeshift spears and knives from wreaking further havoc among the men he led, those that he protected. Soon, the barrage of metal began to thin, down to nothing more than a few sharpened scraps.

However, it had certainly worked. Minutes had passed since Midas had entered into the Jamie Manor, all but ensuring that Midas had ample time to do what needed to be done. Yet that would surely mean that Ajax was eager to strike back, to rush forth and protect his master from the brutal and bloody violence Berserker was sure to bring. As the cyborg ran out of metal to use, that inevitably grew only closer...

At least, until the Bounded Field began to fade.

The bubble that sealed everything inside in stasis suddenly began to flicker out of existence, all that was once held still beginning to shift and move once again. Bodies hit the bloody floor, spears carried on to their final destination, and the dying screams of the wounded were finally allowed to escape their throats.

That meant that Midas had succeeded in reaching Lancer&#39;s Master. He was dead, injured, or captive. That meant it was time to end this farce.

<strong>&quot;Your days here appear numbered, false guardian.&quot;</strong> Szrac stated plainly. It was not mocking, nor was their any malice in his voice - it was a simple statement of truth, based off what he had observed. <strong>&quot;I advise you choose how to spend these next moments carefully. Though it is already low, that number can go lower.&quot;</strong>

With that warning, Szrac looked over to the gaping hole within the manor, now open for human life. Using his metallurgy, the cyborg grabbed a hold of his own exoskeleton and pushed himself forward, leading inside the manor, before slamming the metal barriers closed behind him.

From their, it was a simple task of following the chaos to find his destination.

I didn’t turn all those I loved into gold though… by the time I had received my curse, I was an entirely different man. That, thing, he— me, he— I,” The King clutched his head once more, shutting his eyes tight. Not even he knew what was real and what was the other side of him.

“And which wish?” He asked quietly. “If you mean the one I spoke of before… then no, I must never gain hold of that blasted Grail. If, perhaps, you mean the one that started my miserable lifestyle, then… I can’t even say.”

Midas turned his eyes back to Lorenzo, “Cursed as this gift may be, it has given me an infinite wisdom I would’ve never received: a value of human life, an appreciation for the things I had and not what was out of reach, the values of morals… the list goes on. But the pain and suffering that goes along with it can never justify the cost. In these brief moments of clarity, I ponder to myself whether I truly hate the curse I’ve inflicted upon myself, or grateful of this gift that has given me a designation on the Throne of Heroes. A yearning to be summoned into another container…”</span>

The madness, the greed, the brief calms in the storm that make me aware of my own actions. If this side of him— me, would die off and let the aggressive side take over permanently, I would. But that would be selfish. My eternal punishment is to suffer and watch as I destroy everything around me. No, in these times of understanding, I must try and right any wrongs I have.”

“Starting with you,” He said, surprised. The King reached over and thrusted his hand into Auster’s. The palm did not transform at all, instead remaining as is. “This, this is wonderful! The lives of those turned to metal are only permanently gone if the transformation is complete. Your father… he’s still here. In the mortal realm. Whatever the cause, this brief stop in the Magecraft contains all the life left in him.”

He stands up and attempts to drag him to what looks to be a slowly building puddle off to the side. The spot where he presumably came down and ruined everything.“Here, help push!” 

Midas was easily capable of dragging the statue over, but he figured the lad could do with a pick-me-up, however small.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lorenzo didn&#39;t know what to say.

He was aware of a certain feeling blossoming in his chest. It wasn&#39;t happiness, and it still wasn&#39;t anger. No, it was... empathy. That was odd, Lorenzo Jamie and Midas shared nothing in common, except a Holy Grail War and the scars of the past. That wasn&#39;t enough to induce empathy for the man who killed his father. No, not man, person. King Midas might be the same man who killed his father, but it wasn&#39;t the same person.

What was it like? Existing as a mere whisper of a far more evil version of yourself. It was enough to drive a man mad. Yet Midas was not a man, but a king. A king took responsibility, and a king shouldered the burden of lesser men. Despite it all, nothing would ever change. Midas had already been placed in the Throne of Heroes, and nothing could change his nature.

King Midas was doomed. Forever.

&quot;The world is cruel.&quot; Lorenzo realized this in a matter of moments, and tears continued, hot and fast like molten gold. The sprinklers masked it, but Lorenzo still wiped his eyes. Being a Heroic Spirit was cruel beyond measure. Was there a way to change it? Lorenzo couldn&#39;t even begin to know. He had no way to help this Midas, no matter how he wished to. It was cruel.</span>

It has no use outside vanity and greed, but perhaps that&#39;s how it is. People suffer, and others learn from their misery, and the cycle continues. Maybe one day, that&#39;ll be it. One day, we&#39;ll learn everything there is to know. If we ever forget...&quot; He pointed at Midas. &quot;We can turn to someone who experienced it firsthand.&quot;

Midas touched Auster, and Lorenzo almost screamed in fear, before realizing that nothing was happening. He gaped in confusion. Had Midas lost the Golden Touch? He shook his head. No. It was because Midas had lost the Touch that he was able to appear before him as he was now.

&quot;Father is still alive...&quot; Lorenzo said in wonder. He had insisted upon it, and he had been willing to stake his remaining life upon healing him, but Midas had flat out told him that not only was he alive, but his magic pocketwatch—something made for keeping ice cream cold—was the reason he was still alive? Lorenzo wanted to laugh and dance about without a care, but he struggled to his feet. Now was not the time. He had a duty to uphold.

&quot;Water... Wait, I get it! If your curse can be removed by water, then shouldn&#39;t it also apply to all your statues?&quot;

Lorenzo offered next to zero help with Auster&#39;s statue. It was absurdly heavy and Lorenzo was weak. Despite that, euphroia and hope had given him an adrenaline boost. Even if logic dictated that Midas was doing all the work, sometimes a little bit of delusion worked wonders. With a final gasp and push, the statue unceremoniously fell into the puddle.

If you were, say, a master of elements or perhaps even a different branch of mastery all together, your father’s soul would be long gone.”

Midas let the statue fall into the puddle, splashing what little water inside to the side. It was pitifully deep, but it was hopefully enough to fix the ailment affecting Auster. He adjusted the man as needed until he was as deep in it as it could be.

“There. Now, you must wait. Keep him under the running water and eventually…” he cut himself off because Lorenzo was smarter than he originally thought. He would get the memo good enough. The Gods were not cruel enough to take away this one little happiness inside The King’s heart. 

The world decided otherwise.

Midas heard the faintest of sounds far up above. Either his Master had decided to join him and gloat over the spoils, or Lancer had stopped his master and was coming for him next. Or the golden people had fallen over, but that one seemed very unlikely to happen now as opposed to earlier with his makeshift entrance.

“...I’m sorry, Lorenzo.” he said. “It appears that soon I must take my leave and engage in combat once more. And once I leave this room, my Noble Phantasm will wear off. How long it will take, I do not know. Once that happens, me, him, I will be back to how my container demands I am. A brute only capable of destruction. Funny, I’m no more different than those afflicted with the likes of Dementia or Alzheimers. Staring ‘death’ in the face yet having no choice but to continue,” he laughed darkly.</span>

His eyes were constantly blinking in a vain attempt to remove the vast amount of liquid falling into them. But it was something more than he usually got. Dionysus perhaps was taunting him.

“One last thing, before I go,” he stepped away from Lorenzo, taking steps towards the elevator sitting dormant to the side. He pressed the up arrow, relieved as the button lit up and faint whirring sounds began.

“The dream that we will one day learn everything is a beautiful but surprisingly terrible one. You will certainly try, and mayhaps even get there. But pray to Mount Olympus above that man’s claim onto everything around never latches onto the path of absolute knowledge. The stars in the young&#39;s eyes, that twinkle as they look at all around and see so much wonder and potential… without that, what is man but a machine?”

My roof is broken, my staff is either dead, wounded, or turned to statues. At the risk of sounding haughty, I think this is simply the universe&#39;s way of compensating me.&quot;

Midas&#39;s statement was still true, however. Lorenzo had gotten lucky, even if it was a small island in a sea of bad luck. If he was to be honest, Lorenzo didn&#39;t even know why he used his Mystic Code. He didn&#39;t know if it were work. It was simply an irrational action performed in desperation. It didn&#39;t matter if it was luck or sheer force of will. Auster was still alive, and that was all that mattered. Lorenzo would&#39;ve gladly torn off a limb in exchange for returning his father back to life.

&quot;You&#39;re a wise king, Midas. This Grail War is unfair to people like you.&quot; Lorenzo said thoughtfully, looking up at the hole that Midas had made. A bit of gravel fell down into a puddle. 

&quot;I wonder... how is crushing the wishes of six Masters and Servants equal to two wishes for the winning Master and Servant? I thought about this a few days ago, and now I keep doubting myself.&quot; Lorenzo sighed, blinking a mix of water and tears out of his eyes. He seemed wearier, older, more weighed down by reality. It was like he had aged several decades in just a few short weeks.</span>

He&#39;ll beat your Master black and blue until he&#39;s forced to submit! Nothing can land a scratch on him!</strong>&quot; Lorenzo clasped his hands together childishly and stared at Midas. He really believed in his Servant, despite all the odds against him. It was like a child looking up at his favorite hero.

It was unlikely that Midas and Lorenzo would ever meet each other like this again, but neither of them mentioned that. The elevator dinged as it reached its destination, and its doors opened cheerily. The last thing Midas would see of the boy was a respectful bow to the king, before the boy sat vigil over his father.

Midas returned the bow, watching the boy slide out of view as metal doors slide shut. Midas selected the ground floor, gears and mechanisms coming back to life as the elevator began its ascent.

What did the young one say, joining him as an advisor with his own personal sprinkler? Oh, what an imaginative lad. He could see that in his head crystal clear, walking around while constantly being hosed by a however long hose connected to a rectangular box. Yes, that would be a life worth living.

But his double would sooner tear the child apart than he could ever get close to him.

<em>You think your sway, your control, would stick around forever?</em>

<em>...I was hoping it would stay for even a few minutes more. Pretend I did my best against Lancer but ultimately fail. Put an end to your campaign of destruction and terror.</em>

<em>In your dreams, you pathetic excuse of a Servant. You’d best go back to your kennel like a good little dog. Before I tear you limb from limb.</em>

<em>Do. It’s your body too, you bumbling oaf. Tear off your limbs and jump into the ocean, prevent your S.E.R.V.A.N.T. core from ever summoning you again.</em>

<em>That’s enough from you, imposter,</em> <s>sus</s> he thought, wrestling away control from his double. Slowly, flecks of gold returned to his iris’. Blue ate up and up until there was naught but a few crumbs left.

<em>Will you at least leave the boy alone? My one and only request?</em>

<em>... I will consider the notion</em>.

And Midas was back. He crossed his arms, staring down the sign above the doors. Two stories below ground level, one story below ground level…

He saw his master first, exiting the empty hole where a door should be. For sure to be disappointed with his efforts, but he had no say in the matter. It was the other idiot who ruined everything. Perhaps it would be a good idea to return…

No, not with those blasted water lines still running. And there was no time to go around and find the valves to turn it off. It was time to finish this battle, once and for all.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There he was. Berserker came up back into the elevator, now face to face with his master. His passionless eyes stared out at Midas, trying to derive any kind of emotion from them. Whatever had happened, he had gotten wet in the process, so evidently he had faced some trouble. However, seeing as he had suffered little damage, there was no doubt he had succeeded... right?

Something wasn&#39;t right. Why wasn&#39;t Midas smeared in copious amounts of blood, or carrying that which he had &quot;confiscated&quot;?

His eyes narrowed.

<strong>&quot;Berserker, keep Lancer busy in his last pitiful moments. I will scour the lower floors once more.&quot;</strong> Szrac simply stated, walking past Midas and entering the elevator as he exited. He provided no opportunity for dialogue or response, just action - he could not let folly interfere with this mission.

And so, to the bottom floor he went, where Lorenzo still waited.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac&#39;s taunts reverberated in Ajax&#39;s skull and competed with the worry he felt for his own master as the bounded field gave out finally. That was an ill omen for sure. Auster had likely fallen first and Lorenzo would redirect his own field to stall the clock on his father&#39;s life. He was sure of that much, seeing the bond between the two made such a course the most natural thing to do. He couldn&#39;t allow himself to think anything more pessimistic for he very well knew where that would lead him. 

Setting aside the metal from earlier, Ajax did his best to quickly stabilize those guards that were still clinging to life. If his life was indeed temporary, Ajax had to do as much good as possible before it came to a second close. Every second felt like an eternity that could result in Lorenzo&#39;s death but this compulsion delayed him against his own wishes.

Yet it was over soon enough, at least half were already on death&#39;s door and nothing could be done for them. Now the time for vengeance had arrived, Ajax thought to himself as he put his shield in front of him and charged through the gate, smashing the bars effortlessly as he barreled towards the Manor and down towards its depths to secure his master. 

Almost on cue with Szrac&#39;s words, Lancer slid around the corner, cloak billowing behind him. Shield and Spear were at the ready to break through Berserker in an instant. 

&quot;Midas, you will pay for whatever you have done to the boy and his family. And I will be the one to collect that debt,&quot; Ajax said bluntly before sprinting forward to gore the golden king&#39;s stomach.

The King smiled that golden smile, twisted with malice. Oh, he would not touch the boy himself. That was for his Master to do. Now he could sleep easily, knowing he did what was asked.

“I wish you the best of luck, Szrac.” He watched the doors swallow up his master, standing idly by as the wretched machine started once more. He was provided ample time to perform his acts of greed, and thus Szrac would be given his. As is fair with two equals.

Now, it was time. He could hear the Lancer’s obnoxiously loud crashing about as a door was broken through, thundering steps coming closer and closer. Ass ears twitched, assessing the angle of approach.

There. Down the hall. Still going on about his heroics and how he is an unstoppable force. Pathetic. Why couldn’t a man know when he’s beat and die like the rest of them?

“You’re lucky they’re still alive, fool. If it weren’t for those sprinklers--” The King stopped. Why should he share important information about his failure to an enemy? The less he knew, the better. That alter ego would be more than willing to let himself be impaled onto that lance of his. 

Which was approaching fast. There was sure to be some shenanigans with that if he tried to sidestep, so perhaps it was best to not even attempt that route. Dodging it entirely was the correct play. And perhaps arming himself would do some good. Maybe in this room right next door…</span>

Mortar and dust billowed out from the zone of impact as he sent himself through the wall, into an adjacent room. A cursory glance revealed that this was more than likely a Chef’s kitchen. Foodstuffs were scattered about, more than likely abandoned when the conflict first arose. Pots and pans were hung on racks or resting in idle pools, soaking in soapy bubbles.

The King, in a desperate measure, laid hands onto the first cooking utensil he could get his hands on: your average cooking pan. Iron quickly changed to gold as Lancer reached his point of entry, fully transformed in time to launch an attack. 

His first step of offense would have to be removing that blasted shield from his grip. Thus, he launched himself at the bulky figure with the pan coming down hard from up high.

Dionysus or his blessing will not be able to save you from the same spear that has slain 28 of Troy&#39;s finest!&quot; Ajax practically roared as he took off in pursuit of Midas, a few slugs piercing the wall beside Midas and ricocheting around the kitchen.

Though the clatter of the magical bullets was nothing compared to the deafening clang of a frying pan against a magical shield. It would have shattered mortal eardrums and likely the horrid sound would pierce Midas&#39;s skull like a sculptor&#39;s chisel.  For Ajax, it was nothing but another thing to make him focus down on the Berserker in front of him. With the hole Midas made, Ajax could easily fit through and moved to slap the King with the broad side of his lance and send him crashing into the side of the room, preferably against the oven.</span>

No, a mere frying pan would never crush the defenses of such a heroic shield. It was stupid to even attempt such a hilarously bad offense. He would pay for it as well, receiving a satisfying <strong>THWACK</strong> from his lance. Sent flying into the ovens. 

It was easy to see why. Send a few shots towards the apparati, ignite some gas and send him sky high. Did the Lancer think himself as dense to stand by and let such an attack happen? As soon as he collided with the object, he placed his hand firmly onto the front of the device. Gold crept forward, quickly swallowing glass whole. It would do little to stop slugs from piercing through, but every little advantage was helpful.

And without any further delay, he shoved himself off the cube with enough force to essentially collapse the frame in on itself. No, he didn’t turn the door to gold for protection, he did it because he wanted too. This truly was the real Midas, still focusing on his riches till the potential bitter end.

 He didn’t approach speeds rivaling light, but hopefully fast enough to catch the Lancer off guard. This time, a fist towards his… shield? What was his game plan here?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax had not intended to ignite the ovens but every little chance to make the Berserker pay for laying a hand on Lorenzo was worth it to Ajax in that moment. Likewise he fired off a few more slugs as Midas slumped against the oven. To his surprise, Midas launched himself right at them. While he would take one or two hits, that was far from enough down a king as legendary as Midas. 

Midas was quite clever in his approach, to disable the foe of his greatest strength by turning it into something extremely valuable. Unfortunately for him, that shield was valued even more high than gold to Ajax. His fist connected with the shield well enough and he could feel his golden aura begin to creep across it, causing the front to crack and begin to shed gold flakes. 

Only to be greeted by the sound of high voltage to course underneath his hand as the layer underneath caused his golden tendrils to shrink until they were non-existent. He could feel an extremely strong force running counter to his own power and if he kept his hand on there long enough, it would start to course through him too. Though that would never happen as the shield gave Lancer enough time to process what was happening and bash him with his full strength into the wall beside him, using the shield face like a hammer. It was like being hit by a semi at full speed and the shattered wall around him proved that well enough.

&quot;I am sorry, Midas, but there is no amount of riches that will force me to part with my shield. By now you should realize it is a fool&#39;s errand to try a frontal assault against the Bulwark of the Achaeans. There will be no rest from my avenging blows!&quot; Ajax yelled before moving in to spear Midas again.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Lancer let him even attempt his ploy, still acting as if he is an unstoppable force capable of combating even the gods. While he could very well go toe to toe with some of the weaker divines out there, it was arrogant to act as this one did. 

But Midas would not punish it quite just yet. No, the time was not yet right. For now, he would play along with this battle as long as needed. Once the time was right, there would be a predicament with no good answer. A decision with no outs. And when that came, he would revel in the despair.

But for now, it was time to fly into the wall. Such a powerful blow dictated that he go until he collides with a solid object, but this strike was maybe a little <em>too</em> strong. Instead of stopping there, he went above and beyond the call of physics to instead land into the next room over.

Obviously a dining hall, a long elegant table resting in the middle surrounded by perhaps dozens of chairs. It would’ve looked better had a King not just flown into the room. Specifically, the head chair. It stood no chance, disintegrating immediately upon collision. That blow did sting, along with the other strikes, but this was not nearly enough to faze him enough. He rose once more, ready as Lancer readied another charge.

This one was coming too fast to dodge. He had to admit, this Servant sure was quick. All the more reason to put him in his place. As the lance assuredly approached his core, it would find itself quickly diverted from the King. Swatted away, still grazing his skin. Good enough for him.

His counterblow? Well, he was right in his face, and his arm was extended. His chest was as exposed as it was ever going to get, perfect to launch a flurry of blows powered by Madness Enhancement. What a powerful ability indeed.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lancer continued to press his advantage, following Berserker through the hole he created. It was a great offensive so far. If he kept this up, eventually the King would find himself out of options. At the current rate, that seemed to be approaching relatively soon. Then he could beat back the Metal Mage one last time and re-unite with Lorenzo. 

He struck hard against Midas with his gun lance only to have it batted away before it could drive into his chest. Unfortunately it left him exposed. Ajax could only watch as Midas’s fist connected with his chest, sending him stumbling backwards from the blows. The dining table was pushed unceremoniously to the side as Ajax’s mass collided with it. 

He took one last blow before diving under Midas’s swinging arms to lock his own around the king’s torso and swung him backwards over his head and right onto the floor before attempting to place Midas in an arm lock.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac found Lorenzo at the bottommost floor, as expected.

The boy hadn&#39;t moved much since Midas had left him—he simply sat on a more comfortable piece of rubble, fiddling with some sort of clock absentmindedly. Szrac had never seen someone so frail. All he&#39;d need to do was fling a rock at him and bang! No more Master of Lancer.

This was obviously the Master of Lancer, there was no doubt. There was nobody else here, and this was where Berserker had come up from. This, combined with the damage to the room as well as the gold statue lying facedown in a puddle confirmed this. The boy looked up solemnly. He spread his hands graciously.

&quot;Welcome to my home. Please, sit. You came such a long way to seek an audience with me, and now you have it. I&#39;d offer you a better chair, but...&quot; He gestured under a pile of rubble. &quot;You see.&quot;

Eyeing Szrac, his eyes lit up momentarily. &quot;Even from here, I can tell that that armor is a work of genius. Medical reasons, no doubt. I considered something similar when I was...&quot; The Master of Lancer trailed off, wringing his hands nervously. &quot;Indisposed. Decided against it, though. I wanted to feel the sun on my skin.&quot;

Lorenzo&#39;s voice was quiet and professional, similar to his father. He tried his hardest to emulate his father&#39;s speaking mannerisms—sounding professional never hurt. For what it was worth, it was a passable imitation.

&quot;I met your Berserker, Midas, earlier. He&#39;s a nice man, you should try placing him under a shower every once in a while, and maybe he&#39;d teach you some manners. <strong>You know, since you broke onto my father&#39;s property and all.</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This boy was the one who had summoned Lancer? 

This pathetic, sickly child, whose body was addled by weakness. He looked as though might keel over and die at any moment. It would not take longer for Szrac to end his pitiful life, especially considering how he sat obliviously next to that golden statue. In an instant, he could turn the precious metals into a whirling vortex of slicing death, eviscerating Lorenzo and depriving Lancer of any mana.

Perhaps that was what would have been for the best.

But that was not what occurred. His magical circuits flared to life and his metallurgy gripped the golden body of Auster, ready to turn into a sweeping blade and decapitate the body. Yet when he willed for such a thing to come to pass, it did not.

Odd. Had he overexerted his metallurgy, reducing its capabilities? Or was it something else, some kind of other blocker...

Pity.

<strong>&quot;Be quiet. I did not engage in this war to take part in high class pleasantries.&quot;</strong> Szrac snarled. He instead focused his metallurgy upon only a few of the metal fingers of Auster, tearing them off and turning them to a blade, one that pressed itself against Lorenzo&#39;s neck. <strong>&quot;Berserker may have failed to execute you, but I will still attain victory over Lancer. There is more than one way to win a battle.&quot;</strong>

With that, the cyborg turned around, walking back into the elevator. The expectant hovering of the blade was a clear sign to follow.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Berserker&#39;s Master is a demon encased in steel.</em> Lorenzo thought dully as Szrac replied by spitting venom. He didn&#39;t know what to expect when he envisioned Berserker&#39;s Master, but this made perfectly logical sense. Only a man has coldhearted as this would be able to use Midas&#39;s Golden Touch to its maximum potential.

And use it to its maximum potential did Szrac, metalbending a few fingers off Auster Jamie, much to Lorenzo&#39;s shock. To make matters worse, he fashioned them into blades, before sticking them to Lorenzo&#39;s throat.

Shock turned to anger as Lorenzo processed what Szrac had done. Turning his father into gold was one thing. It was a Berserker, a bad dog let off its leash to do whatever it desired. The only one to blame was the Master who did so: Szrac Vaughn. That, Lorezno was willing to forgive out out of understanding. This was a Grail War. Casualties happened, and Auster had been saved. No harm done in the long run, even if the deaths of staff hurt Lorenzo deeply. However, this was something else entirely.

Szrac had defaced a corpse in order to make weapons for fighting a sickly child.

Lorenzo clenched his fist so hard that it threatened to break his fingers. Tears threatened to pool in his eyes. &quot;Y-you... You listen here.&quot; Lorenzo hissed at Szrac, outraged.

&quot;<strong>Put his fingers back, right now, or you can go up on your own. I don&#39;t care if I die, but that&#39;ll make sure that Lancer puts your Servant&#39;s head on a spike, and place yours right next to it. Place it back. Perfectly. Now.</strong>&quot; As annoying as it was, there was some semblance of truth to it. Independent Action gave Lancer enough time to crush Midas underfoot, putting Szrac out of the War. After that, who knew what would happen? At the very least, Lancer would give Szrac a fight to remember.

An impasse.

It was a sudden declaration, one that had emerged from nowhere, and one that was wholly unexpected. This mechanical monster, an emotionless figure who only spoke in tones of disdain, passing judgement on a man whom he had never met.

<strong>&quot;Tell me, boy: What kind of loving father allows their progeny to engage in such a brutal, merciless war? What kind of parent would risk their seed in place of themselves? None. No, your &quot;father&quot; is little more than negligent mass of scum and cruelty, clad in human skin,&quot;</strong> Szrac stated, something rising in his voice like the great Leviathan rising from the depths of the ocean. 

It was something beyond simple loathing, no - it was pure, righteous anger, flowing forth from the soul, the kindling lost to the distant past suddenly reignited with great fervour.

<strong>&quot;You father acts only for his best interest, not yours. But I will free you from the expectation of bloodline. The sins of the father shall not pass down to the sun.&quot;</strong>

The blades pointed at Lorenzo&#39;s throat suddenly shifted and changed form, wrapping themselves around his neck like a collar and dragging him towards the cyborg. As if to add insult to injury, Szrac&#39;s metallurgy tore one of Auster&#39;s eyes and a portion of face away too, turning them into a spear to point towards the back of the Jamie heir&#39;s head.

As Lorenzo was pulled into the elevator, Szrac hit the button to the top floor. completely silent and uncaring to any of Lorenzo&#39;s protests.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Another flip? Seriously? A broken record was his opponent, not some actual force to be reckoned with. How many more times would they try this move before they would grow tired of the maneuver? Never was the answer, but perhaps he didn’t need to.

It was working somewhat well. He was now on the ground, and he certainly was being manipulated into a dangerous position. An arm lock, surely to be a dangerous threat. What was the game plan, stab him after getting a rein on him? He wouldn’t allow such a thing to happen, pulling away with all his strength. If he lost the arm, fine. He would be free of the hold and able to counter attack freely. His arms were not the only weapons at his disposal. 

In the meantime, he would grab hold onto Lancer’s leg, bending it away from his back. Either more strength was devoted to that, letting him break free in time, or Midas was free to take said leg and start <strong>bashing</strong> into the ground. His Endurance was yet to be tested, but Midas was certainly not a weakling on his own. A dysfunctional leg would perhaps be a death sentence for the Lancer, limited mobility hindering his ability to stop his attacks. Much more so than a lost arm. 

And he twisted and turned and resisted, adding to the struggle. Legs either attempted to kick his would be subduer or simply slammed into the ground. He had shown his capability for destruction with such a creative method of breaching before, but if given just the right amount of time there would be another hole in the floor.

All was precious time for Szrac. It would soon be time...

I wanted to tear out the metal man&#39;s throat, but my body was frail, weak. Paper for skin and glass for bones, the best I could do was stall him for a second, before being dragged away from my father like a dog. The collar broke my skin, and I bled viciously. I cried and howled and screamed bloody murder for the first time in my life.

This man deserved to die. I thought this for the first time in my eighteen years alive. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have the ability to give it to him. That didn&#39;t matter, though. Lancer would. Lancer could tear this man apart with his bare hands. He was absolutely invincible. Something as slight as a hostage would never stop him.

Lancer would...

—

The elevator took forever. It took twenty seconds for the door to shut, and several minutes to rise up into the air to where Berserker and Lancer fought. It seemed as if time itself refused to let Szrac get to his goal. Behind him, dragged by a collar, was Lorenzo. Hidden from view, he clutched a pocket watch. Any delay to this man was worth the sacrifice.

The only thing that Lorenzo said before being dragged off was quiet and almost impossible to hear: &quot;<strong>Someone as heartless as you can&#39;t understand anything, nor is it expected. Why else would you partner with a Berserker? You never wanted to understand anything from the word go.&quot;</strong>

The elevator doors opened, and Szrac marched forward with his prize.

He was not the first petulant child that the cyborg had encountered in his profession. This was not the first tantrum that he had been made to witness. The words of this child meant nothing.

<strong>&quot;Heartless? What an idiotic notion.&quot;</strong> The cyborg scoffed, shaking his head as the elevator doors slowly pulled themselves open. <strong>&quot;You still possess such misguided notions driven by your innocence. Cherish them while they last. You will miss them sorely when they abandon you. You will be numbed when a wish to understand escapes you.&quot;</strong>

As the lift fully opened, Szrac strode outside, using his metallurgy to pull Lorenzo along like a savage, untrained dog. It didn&#39;t take long for him to find where Ajax and Midas were having their bout. The cyborg cleared his throat as he entered inside, the hovering spear pressing its sharp end against the back of the boy&#39;s head as an implicit threat.

<strong>&quot;Lancer! Your master is in checkmate. Kill yourself, and I will spare his life, and you may die with dignity. Continue to struggle hopelessly, and I will execute him, and you may spend the last few minutes of your existence in farce.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax almost had this demonic king where he wanted him. A lock would spell certain doom for Midas and give him the death he deserved. At the very least, no one else would get hurt. To end it here provide an easy path to save his master and advance onward.  The pain from Midas&#39;s attempts to break his leg was something he could endure for as long as necessary if it meant saving the Jamies. All told, Midas would not be able to break Lancer&#39;s bones, even with his madness enhancement. If he twisted himself in the right way, he could escape from that break. Victory was so close he could easily grab it.

However, the appearance of Szrac with a blade to Lorenzo&#39;s neck and a spear to his skull nearly broke his heart . Nononono. He couldn&#39;t let this happen. Lorenzo wouldn&#39;t be another set of Achilles armor, denied to him by the cold-hearted kings so similar to Midas. He&#39;d kill them all if he had to. He&#39;d tear limb from limb and render them into pieces so fine no surgeon or god could revive them. They would be nothing but cows awaiting their slaughter to him. 

He shoot to his feet immediately, pulling up Midas with him in a burst of strength and speed that seemed to only be granted by those with a similar affliction as Midas. Lorenzo could see purple splotches starting to surface and grow across Lancer&#39;s skin. Was the curse returning to him and would none of them survive the deranged rampage of the great warrior of Salamis?  Midas would feel the onset of this with his being visciously thrown to the side of the room.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax took a step towards the pair of masters, his lance once more levied on Szrac, ready to blow him away. He took another plodding step forward, the hate and anguish within reddening his eyes.  Another step, the floor underneath shattered from its force. He took one last look at the pair, only to by chance glance down at Lorenzo&#39;s eyes, full of fear, desperation and hope.  His shield then chimed as it recognized the gold spear pointed at Lorenzo was made of the same material as Auster. The father was being used as a weapon against his own son

His own son... own son... son...  Eurysaces... how it had been so long...

Ajax made one more step forwards yet it would not be followed by any attack. Instead, his shield fell to the side with a clang and his spear implanted into the ground handle first. The blotches on his skin and redness in his eyes faded away He knelt in front of Lorenzo and gave him a smile, the type of warm fatherly smile that could only be associated with a goodbye.

&quot;Lorenzo, there is little I can say to you in this  moment but I want you to know that you have overcome much to be here and your bravery in spite of everything put against you would put many boys from my time to shame. I just want to let you know that I am proud of you and that I would call you my son. Do not worry about comes next for I shall protect you all the same,&quot; he said before standing up again. He hated what he was about to do but he would rather die to protect his master than go on fighting, filled with a mindless rage. He had to be the hero and that meant ultimately giving up one&#39;s life so that another may live</span>

From it sprang flowers of white marked with red splotches. It began to feel more and more like a spring day. 

&quot; To thee whom I mark my son, my shield will forever safeguard you from those of ill-will and hate. Go now in peace, Eurysaces and remember the legend of Ajax the Great, the unscored guardian of Achaea..&quot; Ajax&#39;s shield rotated towards Lorenzo and it too began to become covered in flowers. Ajax sighed one final time before falling onto his blade.

 The ground beneath him became a veritable meadow of flowers now and Ajax but also Lorenzo became bathed in a golden glow as the servant before them peacefully distingrated into silver dust and flower petals blown away in the breeze. The wind picked up suddenly and all the petals from the meadow and shield took up in flight and drifted towards Lorenzo, soon covering him in a floral aegis that would protect him from any blows in the immediate time. This was Ajax&#39;s last gift to Lorenzo, one he hoped would let him be his guardian one last time.

The collar wrapped around the boy&#39;s neck suddenly loosened, and the spear of gold clattered down to the ground. With the &quot;supports&quot; that held him up now gone, Lorenzo would collapse down to the ground.

Victory. One step closer to the Grail. How delightful.

<strong>&quot;You have lost, and we are victorious. You are aware of the Illiad, I assume? I am Greece, and you are Troy. All that you once had now belongs to the aristocracy.&quot;</strong> Szrac stated simply, before looking over to Midas. <strong>&quot;Come, Berserker. Our work here is finished. We must return to the power plant.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas rose from his new position across the room, brushing off the stray dust and tossing a fragment of stone to the side. As he approached his master, Lancer was finally no more. Impaled on his own lance. Such a beautiful sight. It had all paid off in the end. 

“I’m glad you were able to finish what I could not. Perhaps I will fill you in on what exactly occurred down there, but for now you must trust me when I say something prohibited me from completing your task.”

And he looked at the now collapsed boy. This dog was the one who summoned Lancer? Such a powerful servant brought forth by such a weak child. The world worked in mysterious ways. Here he was, strong as an ox at least with a master coming up as a close second. Victory was guaranteed at this point, all obstacles being removed one by one.

“Hmm,” The King looked around. Such a glorious building this was. Sure, now it was stained with the blemishes of battle and it would cost a small fortune to repair all the damages. But…

“I think, I will make this my own palace. Not that I dislike our current housings, but this grand facility is much better suited for royalty. Wouldn’t you agree?”

He got closer to the boy, regarding him as he would a fly, “I’m sure that the current owner will not mind such a transfer of possessions, isn’t that right? Perhaps we can even work out a deal. Say, is forty-eight hours enough time to evacuate half the staff and your broken father? This is the best deal you’re going to receive, so I hope you see it for what it is and consider the ramifications of a ‘no’.”

He sure didn’t leave much up to the imagination.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was truly an unjust and scummy move, yet it was perfectly rational. By forcing one of the strongest Servants to kill itself, lives could be saved by avoiding the fight. However, this was no longer the case. A hostage situation wasn&#39;t going to save lives, nor was it a display of force. That train of logic had been abandoned by Lorenzo, whose bloody neck and various bruises had distorted.

&quot;Lancer...&quot; He croaked. &quot;You have to stop them! You still can. Even if I die, you&#39;ll remain for at least a day! Please, you have to kill Berserker. Kill him! Please. I ORDER YOU TO FORGET ME. <strong>KILL THEM BOTH!</strong>&quot; Lorenzo howled as Szrac pressed the knife to his throat. Tears spilled as innocence was abandoned in exchange for bloody murder. Ajax the Great picked up his lance. Lorenzo&#39;s eyes widened. Yes! Lancer was listening to Lorenzo. Even if he died here, it wasn&#39;t the end. Lancer could find a new Master and keep fighting in the Holy Grail War.

That wasn&#39;t the case. Blood began to spill from the Knight Class. Lorenzo&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;NO, NOT YOU! NOT YOU! YOU&#39;RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT TO THEM! LANCER, PLEASE!&quot; Lorenzo sobbed as he fell to his knees, feeling joints crack.

As Lancer died gracefully and departed from the world, his Master sobbed as a mix of anger and sadness spilled onto the floor. Lorenzo Jamie and Lancer were no longer participants in this Holy Grail War. Berserker had won, and Lorenzo had lost. That was simply how it was.

It was a tantrum that lasted several minutes. Lorenzo cried and wept and stamped his feet, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that he had lost. After everything had flowed out of him, he stood up, picking up the golden collar that Szrac had used to confine him.

&quot;&quot;<strong>That&#39;s it, then. I concede to you, Master of Berserker. The manor is yours. Allow me to move my staff off the property. Do whatever you desire, afterwards. The loser bows to the winner, after all.</strong>&quot; Lorenzo said dully as he walked away, and into the elevator.</span>

Lorenzo reached the bottom floor, as well as his father. The reversion was taking a while—Golden Touch wouldn&#39;t reach Auster&#39;s face for a while. Lorenzo crossed over to a phone at the wall. He dialed a number, and a response immediately came through.

&quot;Is the attack over?&quot; Roderick&#39;s voice came in over the phone. So he had survived, good. &quot;We&#39;ve lost in more ways than one. Father is a statue, though that&#39;s fixable. We&#39;ve lost the property, unfortunately. Cancel all our shipments of materials related to magecraft. Scratch that, cancel everything. We&#39;re low on most material here, but there&#39;s plenty of stuff for them to use.&quot; Lorenzo tried to sound as official as possible, to middling success. His voice trembled and cracked, but he still tried.

&quot;Please get down here, and bring some men. Get them to move all the statues of people. Have them buried. Go to mine and father&#39;s room and get all of our personal belongings. Oh, and Roderick?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Lorenzo fingered the golden collar absentmindedly. &quot;<strong>Find me a goldsmith.</strong>&quot;</span>
