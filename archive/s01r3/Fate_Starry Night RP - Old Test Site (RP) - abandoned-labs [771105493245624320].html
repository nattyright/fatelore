                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ada lagged behind Kari by quite a bit. &#39;I don&#39;t do well with hard labor.&#39; He said with a frown as he navigated through heaps of broken S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames. It was frankly a chore to move around all this trash, not to mention the artificial weather system was cruel enough to give him an abundance of icy slush that was bound to dirty his legs no matter how carefully he treaded. 

As such, he decided to let Kari go ahead as he starting going <em>back</em> to the abandoned labs. He had no intention to lead the fight there, but the buildings provided an excellent vantage point. It would be a while until their target arrived; what better way to cut him off than to finish him off before he could so much as touch the perimeters of the old test site?

A direct clash with the likes of Saber was an exhilarating experience, but nothing can compare with the rush of dopamine when he took his time to prepare firing a shot. The rain and snow did little to affect his perception; all he needed were mana and heat signatures to locate a target from afar, and this Coal Thompson flared up like a hot air balloon on his radar. He was keeping himself quite warm, it seemed.

Ada summoned the Chicago Typewriter in its sleek firearm mode and took aim at an empty spot a little ways ahead of the other group. It was an estimate point of arrival after taking human fatigue from running into account. Unless Coal did the unthinkable and slipped like an idiot - in which case he&#39;d get a good chuckle out of it either way - chances of him making it to that exact spot was quite high. There was no reason not to fire. And so Archer manifested a single bullet from his mana reserves and fired.

Archer almost laughed himself off the window frame he&#39;d been sitting on at the sight of Caster&#39;s latest creation. Out of all the things Aratron could&#39;ve created, they settled with a mere replica of the junk around them. A giant box fan! A potent magus of the bygone era, taking a fancy to modern day appliances! It was blasphemous! 

But also extremely amusing.

This wouldn&#39;t be the first time for a heroic spirit to take up crafts unbefitting of their own legend. However, there was such a thing as biting off more than one can chew. 

&#39;Say, Caster, have you ever taken up electrical engineering?&#39; Ada wiped tears from his eyes. &#39;I hope modern day tech is to your liking, but perhaps you should have stuck to your roots instead of playing with our fragile toys. Even a mockup of the Iron Fan Princess&#39; prized possession would fare better than an automaton with a weakness right in the center of its head!&#39;

The golem was stationary. He couldn&#39;t ask for an easier target than this. Archer took aim at its rotating motor and delivered the very thing Caster had asked for.

&#39;How many more shots until you give up playing toymaker, Caster?&#39;

But this jet pack exceeded expectations. It looked ridiculous, yet he had covered quite a distance in just a few seconds. No doubt, that device was burning fuel at an extremely fast rate. It wouldn&#39;t last the whole trip.

Indeed, it ran out near the end. Aratron grunted as the jet pack stopped functioning, its fuel tank empty as he was now free falling.

&quot;Tch. Limitations of the modern age.&quot; Aratron sighed, dismantling the jet pack in mid air as he instead terraformed his own landing. The hard concrete below morphed into soft sand. He landed on it, wiped some sand off and kept walking. He was now approaching a gigantic lab structure. An abandoned building that was decaying. No doubt the ideal spot for a sniper.

&quot;Servant, Archer, I presume?&quot; Aratron asked out loud, waiting a few seconds for a reply.

&quot;You have caused quite a lot of trouble for me and my student. I hope that you are ready to face the consequences.&quot; He said while crossing his arms. &quot;Are you going to reveal yourself? Or shall I drag your corpse out of that stone prison? The choice is yours. Either way, <strong>you will die.</strong>&quot;

It was official at this point that Archer wouldn&#39;t be spared. Aratron would deliver the full brunt of his rage.

Caster took his first steps outside the abandoned lab. He was headed for the building&#39;s main entrance. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Ada sat in a window frame on the third floor of the building, letting his legs dangle freely outside the window. They stirred up the dust that had been collecting on the walls for god knows how long as they drifted from above and landed on Aratron&#39;s head. He wasn&#39;t even making an effort to hide himself!

&#39;Seeing Servants like you makes me all the more glad that I managed to avoid the Caster container myself. I wouldn&#39;t want to be caught mingling with stiff folks like you, you know?&#39; Archer shrugged. &#39;If you want my corpse, I suggest you head north and dig up some graves.&#39; 

Ada raised his thumb and pointed in a random direction that may not even be true north. Was it a distraction? Did he even need a distraction? All this time, his weapon of choice had been dutifully locked onto Caster&#39;s heart, where the Spirit Core resided: a modded Thompson submachine gun that looked like it had been lifted straight out of some science fiction, with a black coat and green circuits running along its exceedingly long barrel. It almost looked more machine than gun. 

&#39;Well? Let&#39;s not pretend that we have been given a second life here. I am merely doing contract work, and so are you. So, no hard feelings?&#39;

Caster saw the muzzle of the gun flash an eerie green before his vision was obscured by a hail of bullets, each just as potent as the shots that had taken apart his ice golem with ease!

&quot;I can&#39;t blame you, Archer. It would be humiliating for you to lose to a fellow Caster, since I already know that I am the best Caster of them all. At least now you have the novelty of being a different class to assuage your defeat.&quot; Aratron said with a light smile. He was utterly confident in his victory.

That confidence turned into a frown once Ada revealed his modded submachine gun.

&quot;Interesting tool. Is it perhaps the one that shot at us from afar, or do you use multiple weapons? I suppose I shall see for myself...&quot; Aratron muttered, before Ada proceeded to open fire.

It was a clean hit. A clean 30 hits, actually. Ada had completely emptied his magazine, and just like an efficient robot, he had reloaded it in 0.3 seconds. He was ready to fire again, but decided to let the smoke from nuzzle fire and rapid fire bullets dissolve first. Maybe Caster had already died?

That would be too easy.

&quot;...Do you plan on killing me with smoke, Archer? I suppose getting me to cough and sneeze to death is a rather inventive strategy.&quot; Aratron chuckled, wiping the smoke away with a sleight of his hand. When the smoke dissolved, Ada would narrow his eyes at what he was seeing.

Three rings surrounded Caster, like gigantic hula hoops. One made of fire, one made of ice and the other made of rock. They rotated around him, like the rings of an atom.</span>

If Ada were to observe carefully, he would notice that his bullets had all been caught by the rings of ice and rock. They were stuck inside of them.

&quot;You can have these back.&quot; Aratron said, launching the gigantic rock ring at Ada&#39;s window. It was spinning at the same time. He was aiming to bisect him! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

How thoughtful!

He hopped down from the window before Caster&#39;s hula hoop of death could collide with the building. A bundle of cables extended from within his sleeves; they looped themselves around the ring and attached their ports to its rocky exterior, giving Archer something to hold on to as it chopped through the wall with ease. Glass and dust and rubble flew in every direction, but luckily not onto him: the flat surface of the ring made for an excellent umbrella and shielded him as he dangled below it by the cables.

&#39;Hmm, hmm. This is just ordinary stone.&#39; Ada muttered to himself as the cables fed him readings from Caster&#39;s rocky construct. &#39;A bit more sturdy than usual, but nothing out of this world. Come on now, this is your Noble Phantasm?&#39; 

That question was directed at Caster.

&#39;If this is the basis of your claim to be the very best, then I have unfortunate news for you. By the books quotes like yours appear most frequently across Servant profiles on ServantPedia. Your attachment to titles and names is also nothing unique. Might I interest you in a profile makeover?&#39; Archer smiled innocently and negotiated even as he pointed his gun at the ring overhead. &#39;It&#39;ll only come at the cost of your retirement from this Holy Grail War.&#39;

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

Archer pulled the trigger and unloaded another slug into the ring. The shot failed to go through, but then cracks started spreading from its point of impact like spiderwebs. 

All this, just from a single bullet?

&#39;Five. Six...&#39; He steadily kept count.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;You&#39;re astute, but I don&#39;t mind praise of my own name. It just further shows how outmatched you are.&quot; Aratron smirked, watching as Ada was forced to leave his vantage point to avoid the spinning hulahoop of doom. Archer not taking any actual damage from the impact was far from concerning. The two were just getting started to know each other.

&quot;Cables. An affinity for analysis. I assume you are quite the modern Servant.&quot; Aratron theorized out loud, most likely getting a sigh from Ada. It felt nice to probe, but not so much the other way around. Therefore, Archer focused on his own things, analyzing the entirety of Aratron&#39;s hoop. The results were...underwhelming.

Since the hoop had no purpose besides to hurt him, it was best to get rid of it. Archer started filling bullets, as his namesake implied, to destroy Caster&#39;s flimsy Noble Phantasm.

He could hear Aratron laughing.

&quot;...Forgive me. It is just hard to not laugh at your utmost ignorance.&quot; Aratron said with a scheming grin. &quot;Ordinary stone? Nothing out of this world? Please. I was just being considerate. <strong>It would be rude of me to end your life so quickly.</strong>&quot;

Ada&#39;s cables were still plugged inside the ring, feeding him data. He noticed an inconsistency: Despite firing six shots, the ring&#39;s structural integrity hadn&#39;t decreased at all. It only looked cracked from the outside, but the insides were perfectly fine. Strange.

&quot;...Come on now. Fire your shot. It was the <strong>seventh.</strong> Correct?&quot; Aratron said, amused. &quot;Keep going. It&#39;s a fine number to end on.&quot;</span>

Out of curiosity, or out of spite, Ada fired the seventh shot. It collided with the ring and pierced through it, just like the rest, but something had changed.

Ada started to notice that the rubble that he had avoided never landed. Same for the glass shards. And the dust. He paid it no mind at first, just being glad that he was able to use Caster&#39;s weapon against him. But once his cables warned him of the ring no longer being made of &#39;only stone&#39;, his inner alarms started ringing.

The ring hadn&#39;t shielded him. <strong>It had absorbed those materials.</strong>

The hoop no longer resembled a hoop. Its stone texture had been replaced by glass scales, similar to scales on a crocodile or lizard. Arms, legs, claws and teeth started to emerge from its surface. It was then that Ada noticed the mouth and tail, united together, like an Ouroboros. Eventually, the mouth released the tail.

<strong>screee</strong>

The creature cried out, flapping its wings of glass and concrete as it slashed at Ada&#39;s cables and severed their connection. The last bit of data he got was:

<strong>Olympian Spirit Rank A</strong>

&quot;Bear witness to my creation-shaking power. It is beyond the petty tricks of the modern era!&quot; Aratron gloated as his ring had transformed into a miniature dragon. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t fighting just me, Archer. You are fighting the entire world. The earth itself bends to my command!&quot;

While Caster did his dramatic speech, he started letting the remaining two rings spin around him like hoops. Meanwhile, the dragonic familiar took its sights on Ada. It opened its mouth, firing needles of glass and rubble at the Archer&#39;s general direction. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

You are quite the curious one yourself.&#39; Ada bowed in mid air after firing his seventh shot, exactly as Caster had prescribed. Even without Caster&#39;s hint, the data feed from the cable had changed. New materials wormed their way into the ring. Glass, concrete...Archer surveyed the ground, and found it unusually clean. The rubbles from the collision were nowhere to be seen.

And then the ring was no more. A half-serpentine, half-draconic creature screeched on the wall, the materials it had absorbed became its scales and wings, and the creature lashed out at the Servant hanging onto its tail, sending a hail of half-digested rubble his way!

Archer let go of the cables, letting them disintegrate into glitch flakes as he took his swift descent.

&#39;My dear Celestial, perhaps you ought to do some research before leaving your home turf next time.&#39; He jested, twisting in midair to throw his gun up against the rain of rubble. The machine morphed, expanded, grew. A maned neck emerged from its barrel and strong, hoofed legs replaced its handle. A silver, mechanical horse galloped along the trajectory Archer had thrown its old form and rammed its head into the rocky dragon, sending the projectiles flying everywhere but at him. 

Ada landed on the ground Caster had so graciously converted, kicking up a cloud of sand in his wake. 

&#39;An animated lizard is your idea of world ending power? Quite the fancy term for a recycling machine fashioned out of stone of glass.&#39; He flicked away a few pieces of rubble that had fallen out of the sky, now rendered harmless without only the force of the earth&#39;s own gravity pulling them down.

If you still believe in its superiority, then I shall simply have to take it apart with us modern Servants&#39; own brand of magecraft.&#39;

The snow around them sizzled. Droplets of hot, molten glass poured from the sky as Caster&#39;s familiar circled overhead, screeching in discomfort. Archer&#39;s equine machine had lodged itself firmly in the coils of the draconic familiar, and its head had cracked open to reveal the muzzle of a cannon. However, instead of firing into the creature at point-blank range, it held up and simply let itself burn white hot under the intense concentration of mana, using the heat to soften and melt down the glass that had so sufficiently integrated itself into the familiar.

&#39;Care for an umbrella, or is that too advanced for you?&#39; Archer crouched down and dug his hands into the soft sand under his feet, unfazed by Aratron&#39;s showcase of hula hooping skills with the double rings of fire and ice. &#39;What is it with you fossil Servants and your attachment to these archaic elements? Care to enlighten me?&#39; He kept feeling around the sand.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron raised an eyebrow to Archer&#39;s response. His gun wasn&#39;t a gun at all! Instead, it morphed into a creature, not unlike Aratron&#39;s own familiar. The weapon morphed into a horse-like figure, to the point it was even capable of neighing as it collided with his winged serpent. Huge amounts of mana build up could be felt from the horse, as it threatened to roast the snake with its burning chassis. Molten glass and concrete started to litter the area.

&quot;...You are one to talk. Yet here we are, both of us using familiars to dictate this fight. Despite how advanced you humans might try to seem, you can do nothing to escape nature&#39;s grasp. You can only imitate it.&quot; Aratron said with a frown. 

&quot;Of course, you aren&#39;t human anymore, are you? You are just a ghost. A mere fragment of the past. If I&#39;m a fossil, then so are you. The world has long since moved on from you, phantasmal Servant.&quot; Aratron said rather bluntly, most likely eliciting a reaction from Ada. Despite Caster&#39;s arrogant demeanor, he was technically right. Ada too wished that he had more time to explore the modern world, instead of being forced to participate in such a middling Grail War.

&quot;Your services are no longer required. You lost your right to remain here the moment you tried to take down a fellow human.&quot; A murderous glint could be felt in Aratron&#39;s eyes. His hips stopped moving as Archer realized that the man&#39;s hulahoops had changed. The more Caster spun, the bigger they got. The rings of fire and ice that were around him were now gigantic, in both width and length. It was like staring at a giant chakram.</span>

If your great deeds in life led you to harming other humans as a Servant, <strong>then you shall receive no mercy from me.</strong> Take your so-called modernity and perish with it. This world has no need for ghosts, Archer!&quot; Aratron snarled, as he placed the fire disc on the ground and proceeded to kick it forward. A spinning wheel of flames was now headed straight for Archer!

But what about the ice disk? Aratron instead launched that towards the mechanical horse, having it squeeze and restrain the beast as it started melting. The cold frost of the gigantic ring was counteracting the heat of the Chicago Typewriter. As a result, the flying snake could now move with more freedom.

It shrilled before firing weaponized glass and rubble right inside the horse&#39;s mouth, where its primary cannon was located. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Humans know their limitations, and that is precisely why we adapt, improvise and surpass. It&#39;s an enjoyment that spirits like you, whose talents have been granted by the heavens and whose fate has been preordained from birth, will never hope to understand.&#39;

The ring of fire blazed towards Archer like the sun itself, razing anything in its way to the ground. Aratron was alone once again when it circled back to him. Was that it? Had they finished their job?

Wrong!

Having come from the very graveyard that housed decommissioned S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, Aratron should know better than anyone that no Servants would perish without a trace. Some battered remains of the mystic code would be left behind as evidence, but the ground in front of him was absolutely spotless. Archer had escaped!

Meanwhile, the horse morphed back into a gun and slipped through the ice ring&#39;s grasp. It clattered to the ground and dissolved into a vortex of glitch flakes, leaving both the draconic familiar and the ice ring stranded in midair.

Where did Archer go?

&#39;Move aside, little spirit.&#39;

Ada pulled himself out next, even as half of his body was still in the middle of reconstructing pixel by pixel. A few cables extended from his sleeves; they seemed to be connected to something underground.

&#39;Having fun sticking your nose where it doesn&#39;t belong, Celestial?&#39; Ada smiled humorlessly. &#39;Your creator may have taught you a thing or two about humans, and now here you are, playing dictator to the very beings that conceived you. Your Master must be a saint to have tolerated you all this time.&#39; 

It wasn&#39;t as if Ada had been a model Servant himself, but hypocrisy was a trait universal to mankind. He too had once been human. And that was precisely why Aratron bothered him immensely.

&#39;An outsider like you has no right to disrupt the flow of natural selection. Mages summon Servants, then it&#39;s only natural for us to carry out their wishes. The weak has no place on this planet. Your outdated way of thinking is the reason figures like you only exist in fairy tales, while our legacies will go on to become the cornerstones of the new world!&#39;

Ada manifested the Chicago Typewriter as soon as his hand stabilized and drove it into Caster&#39;s frame. Who said firearms were only good for shooting?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron scoffed at Ada&#39;s obstinate reply. The two intellectuals could not see eye to eye, especially during the heated environment of a battle to the death. Their time periods were just too different, with one coming from a period where science was linked to occultism and arcane arts, while the other believed in logic, mathematics and understanding. Two different colored peas in the same pod.

&quot;It is exactly your own hubris that will be humanity&#39;s undoing. Surely, you do not expect me to believe that humanity knows its own limitations? They don&#39;t. They adapt and overcome, like you said. This turns them overconfident. Arrogant. Maniacal. A path headed straight towards destruction.&quot;

Aratron would have continued, the Ada not disappeared upon colliding with the ring of fire. He had a smirk on his face, initially thinking that Archer had been disposed of. It turned into a frown once he realized that there was no body.

Instead, he received a very rude kick to the bum, flooring him to the ground.

&quot;Ugh.&quot; He grunted rather weakly. For him, it was an uncommon occurrence to be hit. An even more rare occurrence was his opponent sounding like a smart aleck. He could confidently deal with brutes and savages, but someone with a trained mind? They were rather annoying to deal with.

Especially if they talked too much.

&quot;...Leave my creator, and my Master, out of this.&quot; Aratron snarled. He placed his arms on the floor and slowly lifted himself up. His deadpan expression gave away that Archer had touched a nerve.

&quot;What do you even know about natural selection? &#39;Purging the weak&#39; is fine and dandy as long as your Master survives, correct? You&#39;re a bad joke, Archer.&quot; Caster glared at him from afar. 

While Aratron was busy running his mouth, Ada decided to instead finish the job. He lunged forward, Chicago Typewriter in hand as he attempted to pierce Aratron&#39;s frame with it.</span>

It was a success, as sand dripped from Aratron&#39;s chest. He had a wound in his torso now, but Ada wasn&#39;t satisfied. If anything, he Ada would be puzzled. He could have sworn that his impact was supposed to contain more power than this. He didn&#39;t realize why until he stared at his own arm.

It had turned to stone. His gun was centimeters away from piercing Aratron&#39;s heart, but his arm had stopped before it could. Petrification?

&quot;...What do you even know about &#39;the weak&#39;, Archer? Were you born poor? Were you abused in your youth? Were you denied hopes, aspirations and dreams?&quot; Aratron inquisitively asked while glaring at him, ignoring the pain of his bodily shell. Archer&#39;s mana sensors were off the charts. Caster was emitting mana that a million, no, a billion, no...a trillion larger than Kari&#39;s?! He couldn&#39;t tell if his sense was defective or not.

&quot;Clearly, if you&#39;re standing in front of me, then you were born blessed. The Throne chose you for a reason, because you were unique amongst humans. Likewise, I was chosen as well...<strong>But not only by the Throne.</strong>&quot; Aratron said with a heavy expression on his face.

&quot;Just how many times have you been summoned? Have you ever witnessed people summoning you out of envy? Out of greed? Out of lust? Out of anger? Sometimes, they even summon you just because <strong>they can.</strong> This is what happens when your beloved &#39;spirit of progress&#39; is given full reins. You become beasts with no limitations. People willing to ditch ethics, morals and principles just to fulfill their own selfish desires. You are all rotten at the core.&quot;

His voice was spewing hatred. It was acidic, but there were long pauses in-between, as if Aratron were masking some sort of sadness.</span>

&quot;<strong>But I love you.</strong> I love all of humanity. Which is why I will preserve them, even if I have to kill their ideals. Tell me, would you rather let humanity burn itself out, or would you rather snuff out their ideals and preserve them for eternity? I know what I&#39;ve chosen.&quot;

The magical levels reached an all time high. Caster was ready to blow.

Archer noticed that the area around him had begun to be segmented into tiles. Mathematically perfect tiles. While this was pleasing to the eye, it worried him greatly. He had to get out of the--

Too late.

The tile underneath his feet had turned into tar, causing him and his cables to be stuck underneath. He was a pig at a butchery, waiting for his turn on the chopping block.

&quot;When the planets move, Earth follows. I hold the keys to the galaxy. Behold, <strong>Arbatel Saturn: The Kingdom of 49 Provinces!</strong>&quot; Aratron declared. Saturn appeared in the sky as Ada would be mesmerized by the beauty of the planet above him. If only it weren&#39;t signaling his eventual demise...

Aratron then raised his arm upward as various grids around him started to dissolve. He was morphing their materials and then transferring them over to his palm. Soon, 28 grids of material had been completely assimilated into his palm. A gigantic ball of rock, magma and fire was now hovering above his hand.

&quot;Out of numerous kingdoms, twenty-eight called for your death. We have witnessed the viciousness of humanity&#39;s progress for too long, Archer. Look around you. Look at this dead world ran by nomadic cities and empty oceans. Is this <em>human</em> to you?&quot;

Archer knew that if that gigantic meteor hit him, then it would be over. It was a one-shot kill.

&quot;...This lesson is finished. There will be no additional coursework. Take my ideals to your icy grave and die, Archer! Begone, to the Throne of Heroes!&quot; Aratron shouted, tossing the gigantic meteor towards his target. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ada had never considered himself a great fighter, which spoke volumes of how ill-suited Aratron was at combat. A kick without an ounce of finesse sent them tumbling to the ground. It was almost like watching a catfight between two amateurs if one didn&#39;t know any better.

Though without the aid of familiars, Aratron was only as good as his frame was durable. Ada was more than happy to capitalize on this brief advantage, but that was when everything went wrong.

The Chicago Typewriter pierced Aratron&#39;s frame, then stopped. It stayed lodged halfway through where their heart should&#39;ve been, when Ada realized that he had lost all sensation in his arm. 

He glanced down and saw stone.

Petrification? 

Of course, Caster took this chance to shovel even more drivel his way. Well isn&#39;t that dandy. Not only was this Caster trying to herd humans like cattle, but they had come to do so with a vengeance. Just what kind of twisted personality could summon a being who was so screwed up in the head?

&#39;So what!&#39; Ada bit back. &#39;Hubris is only human nature. No civilization has withstood the test of time without stumbling every step of the way, but they always come back smarter, stronger, and more independent than you could ever imagine. Your idea of protection is nothing short of poison. Greenhouse plants that have lived their whole life under shelter will never hold a candle to the tenacity of wildflowers that have withstood rain and hail. You, a spirit with an affinity to earth, should know this better than anyone.&#39; 

Even as he entertained Caster in their delusions, Ada tried to work up the remaining circuits in his petrified arm to analyze its condition. But even that had failed when he realized the petrification seemed to be spreading. Was it possible to neutralize it?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;You know, for a moment there, I <em>almost</em> bought it. There are plenty of overprotective Servants around, you wouldn&#39;t be the last. But now you just sound - excuse me for saying this - butthurt. You think heroic spirits have it easy? Blessed?&#39; Ada scoffed. &#39;Had you died without regrets, you would never have been summoned as a Servant in the first place. Beggars can&#39;t be choosers, Caster!&#39; 

Ada tried to pump mana through his arm. Was it possible to delay the petrification? He just needed to pull the trigger once and finish the job. 

But then the earth started shifting, splitting into tiles of tar that trapped his feet and cables underneath. Caster started a series of chants that almost rivaled Sabers&#39; in length and grandeur. Those two would hit off well, thought Archer. Didn&#39;t they know that short and sweet was key?

Speaking of short and sweet.

His pocket buzzed with the frantic yet familiar voice of his employer. She had shouted his name, exposing his identity and cluing Caster in on his skills. Not that it would make much of a difference, however, since they were already in the middle of releasing their Noble Phantasm. With his legs trapped and his firing arm turned to stone, Archer was practically a sitting duck against their meteor!

Ada reached into his pocket and withdrew a small radio with his good hand.

&#39;What you see as despair, I see as potential. That is the difference between you and me.&#39; He spun the radio on a finger as more cables manifested themselves around the gadget. &#39;Humans messed up! It&#39;s not the first time they&#39;ve done so! And now you are going to turn them into specimens and play god?&#39; He frowned in disapproval. &#39;Well. <em>That</em> is typically what I would call &quot;inhuman&quot;.&#39;

Back to work with me.&#39; He said cryptically, then his form started digitizing under Caster&#39;s unobstructed view. Archer disintegrated into pixels, which fed themselves into the radio through the cables.

Caster was alone once again.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It seemed like Caster had Archer in checkmate, preemptively activating his Noble Phantasm in order to settle things. There was no use in delaying this fight any longer, especially since Aratron&#39;s amusement had turned into irritation at this point. Servants like Archer, who were smart with their words and ardent believers in logic, were his worst enemy.

&quot;...To what end has humanity&#39;s cycle of self-destruction kept going?! How much longer will I have to keep seeing humans repeat their own sins? For all eternity? <strong>To hell with that!</strong>&quot; Caster had become increasingly agitated through words alone. One could say that Archer&#39;s mouth did more damage to him than the entirety of his own arsenal.

Not that it helped him, since Aratron knew how to react to people who were a threat to him: Complete and utter destruction. He would wipe out every trace of Ada from the Earth.

Keyword: <em>Would.</em>

&quot;Drown in your ideals and die, Arch--&quot; Aratron dropped the meteor on his target, but before it could hit, Archer quipped another line and disappeared. A small burst of electricity could be seen before the Servant poofed out of existence.

The meteor collided, of course, destroying the ground and the nearby area. The lab building was totaled, leaving only an abandoned ruin in its place. Dust and smoke covered the area as even people from the <span class="mention">#mass-grave</span> could feel it. A few seconds later, everything went quiet again.

Aratron stared around, dumbfounded. The smoke cleared out, and he saw that Archer had already left. The fact that he had left once his Master muttered the name &#39;Ada&#39; would clue Caster in on the Servant&#39;s name. Not that he knew of their identity, of course.

And he didn&#39;t care. Instead, he started clenching his fists.</span>

&quot;...Come back here. I said, <strong>come back here, Archer!</strong>&quot; Aratron shouted while veins popped on his forehead.

&quot;<strong>You shall be killed by me.</strong> Do you understand?&quot; Caster snarled as he terraformed the earth to slide back to the <span class="mention">#mass-grave</span>. It was slower than the jet pack, but he had to make do.

It was then that he heard a loud sound coming from the graves. It was the same sound as Ada&#39;s Chicage Typewriter. Aratron&#39;s eyes widened. Had Archer gone after his student?

&quot;Don&#39;t you <strong>dare</strong>, Archer!&quot; Aratron accelerated his pace. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
