By the time Archer, Saber and the mysterious aristocrat had left the restaurant, Pascal and Armstrong had already gotten into another shouting match. They were lucky that they received no customers on that day.

&quot;...Don&#39;t <strong>you</strong> start lecturing me about brothers and sisters. You don&#39;t even know these people! They are strangers! Yet you want to play hero and save the day like the good old American you are? What are you, Rambo?!&quot; Pascal snarled, showing that pop culture had still survived even the harshest of apocalyptic scenarios. Armstrong would take that comparison as a compliment, if he weren&#39;t already brimming with rage at Pascal&#39;s cowardice.

Regardless, what happened afterwards wasn&#39;t pretty: The two got into a scuffle. Tables were turned, glasses were broken, wine was spilled. Thankfully, they managed to clean it up before the owner arrived, but they did so in utmost silence. They no longer saw eye to eye. Speaking terms were a dream of the past.

Pascal, as petty as he was, decided that wasn&#39;t enough.

He headed to the docks, determined to leave this city, with or without his Servant. He would just ask the ferryman to speed up his departure a bit. Monday evening? Make that Monday morning.

&quot;I&#39;m here! Are we all set to go?&quot; Pascal asked, standing next to the ferryman who was inspecting the last boat remaining at the docks. It was his ride to yet another chance in life.</span>

What good was a Grail if it involved risking his neck out in life or death battles? He was no mage! He was just a commoner! If someone as great as his...

If someone as great as <strong>him</strong> could die, then what chance did he have?! It was hopeless. Completely hopeless. The aristocracy already had Persepolis under their thumb.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider had not said a single word since their argument from yesterday. Not one.

The typically rambunctious and blunt Armstrong had donned his armor, and had turned as cold as the vacuum of space. He stood behind Pascal like a shadow. This, combined with the suit and visor that covered his face, made him extremely unnerving. 

Rider expressed silent outrage at the idea that their departure would be sped up by an entire day, but Pascal had forgone reason for fear and crawling his way out of Perespolis, Servant in tow. His outrage increased further at Pascal&#39;s inability to care about others. Despite his arguments with Pascal, he was his Master. That meant he followed orders, like the good Servant he was.

It gave him great satisfaction to see the docks shut down.

&quot;Houston.&quot; Armstrong said, visor gleaming. It was the first thing he had said in a while. &quot;What is our next course of action? What&#39;s stopping us from allying with the Aristocracy? We may have fought one of their men, but we survived. That gives us value. We aren&#39;t associated with the Mafia, so they have no reason to spite us. If you&#39;re choosing to turn tail and flee, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d leap at the chance to get a possible adversary out of the picture.&quot;

There was no real reason for Armstrong to feed Pascal&#39;s desire for flight, but Armstrong himself had become increasingly inconsistent as the Holy Grail War went on. From the boisterous pioneer of science and bravery to the scientist interested in engineering to the military man.

&quot;Houston?&quot; Armstrong asked yet again. &quot;Your orders.&quot;

Sinmara walked down the docks, once again returned to her more dignified, less horny attire. After a brief pit stop, she had refreshed her mana batteries and recovered her wounds, and was back at tip-top shape!

Which meant it was time to get back to business. Her encounter with Archer had set her on the straight and narrow, and in doing so, taught her a valuable lesson - this Grail War wasn&#39;t a game. She had to be careful, or she would die.

And if she died, she wouldn&#39;t get to witness the end.

So, she had dedicated herself to a new path - kill all the other servants before they could kill her! It was a rather ingenious plan, if she did say so herself. There was just one problem...

<strong>&quot;How hard can it be to find a single servant in this shithole? I&#39;ve been looking for HOURS!&quot;</strong>

He made his way to the docks, one of the only places he hadn&#39;t looked at more than once. Sandro’s eyes had dark circles under them and his hair was messy as if he was pulling it. His lips were chapped from the amount he had been smoking and his undershirt was stained with coffee… he was stressed to say the least 

It seemed there was however some hope at last. He heard his servants cry for battle giving away her location. He quickly jolted to a state of awareness and followed the yells. “Saber! Come over here now!” Sandro yelled at Sinmara almost as if she were a child running away, after all she may as well be just that.

Maybe you&#39;ll actually catch some fish that way!&quot; Right when two others were already shouting, Pascal started his own tantrums. Armstrong didn&#39;t even give him the privilege of venting alone.

&quot;As if the aristocracy will let us in. They would probably hand us over to that tin can and let him indulge his sick revenge fantasies. You have no idea how sick royalty can be.&quot; He spat venom at his own Servant. &quot;And the mafia? They couldn&#39;t care less about some low income cook. Don&#39;t you see? <strong>There&#39;s no place for people like us!</strong> Vagrants, are what we are! We will <em>never</em> make a name for ourselves. Others will <em>never</em> acknowledge us. And you know what?&quot;

&quot;...<em>that&#39;s fine.</em>&quot;

&quot;Because really, is there any other role that suits me? I&#39;m no Master. I&#39;m no mage. My dishes aren&#39;t even that good! We&#39;re out of our league, last week should have told you that. Can&#39;t your Noble Phantasm get us out of this city or something? You&#39;re a Rider, for God&#39;s sake!&quot; He whined and complained and cursed, but one could not blame him. It was worse than impostor syndrome (sus). It was a man who had been constantly undervaluing himself. One surrounded only by people who had dwarfed him his entire life. That sort of low esteem couldn&#39;t be healed in a few weeks. Perhaps not even in a Holy Grail War...

Thankfully, Pascal&#39;s tantrum would be interrupted by two faces: One familiar, and one strange. Armstrong witnessed Sinmara in the distance, complaining about a lack of Servants. Meanwhile, a man was approaching her and calling her by her class name. Saber&#39;s Master, perhaps? <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Hm. It is true. Your dishes are fairly hit or miss.&quot; Armstrong agreed, bobbing his head in tandem with Pascal&#39;s barrage of self doubt.

&quot;<strong>We</strong> acknowledge you. The tin can Gagarin acknowledges you. If he&#39;s after you with such intensity that it&#39;s causing you to jump at corners, then I think you&#39;re doing better than most.&quot; Armstrong said thoughtfully. &quot;When I bring you the grail, everyone will be looking your way. Chin up, unless you&#39;d like me to kick you into the sea.&quot;

Yawning, Armstrong peered out over the ocean. Opportunity wasn&#39;t a seafairing vessel, and it was unlikely that Armstrong himself could make a ramp large enough to fly off of, and even if he could, coordinating a landing with other cities would be impossible. Still, that seemed to be an easier task than getting Pascal&#39;s self esteem to a functional level. Pascal was the type of person to punish himself for doing well, while berating himself for doing poorly. He corned himself off in mediocrity as a result. All Armstrong could do was nudge him in the right direction.

And he was failing.

&quot;Hou—&quot; He sensed it before he saw it. That mana signature. &quot;Enemy Servant. It&#39;s Saber. Get behind me.&quot; Armstrong manifested his laser gun and hailed his fellow Servant.

&quot;Good morning to you, Saber.&quot; Armstrong&#39;s voice was enhanced by a speaker hidden within his suit. It echoed powerfully throughout the docks. &quot;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get the luxury of running into you before I was forced to depart. To what do I own this <strong>giant</strong> pleasure?&quot;

Not only was his ferry ride canceled, but he also ran into Saber! Truly, Luck EX was a real thing.

Because he wasn&#39;t the only familiar face at the docks. There was that strange Rider who had assisted in her harassment, accompanied by the lousy chef who worked at the fetish restaurant! The giantess stopped in her tracks, narrowing her eyes at the pair as she tightly gripped the hilt of Laevateinn.

This was exactly what she was looking for.

<strong>&quot;Shut the fuck up, nerd. You&#39;re a giant pain in my ass, and I&#39;m about to split you in half. Got a problem with that, shithead?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Oh boy, those were fighting words. Saber evidently wasn&#39;t messing around, and had no desire for a peaceful talk. Good. Armstrong had never desired a peaceful conclusion to this in the first place. This was a Holy Grail War. He and the six other Servants would slaughter each other for an elusive wish. That was their purpose.

Mutual cooperation was impossible.

&quot;I have many issues with you, Saber. Too many to count! The needless destruction, for one. Why do you destroy? Is it fun? Have you tried sewing? Astrophysics, perhaps?&quot; Armstrong said, pointing a finger (and gun) towards his enemy. His eyes flitted to Laevateinn as Sinmara&#39;s hands grabbed the hilt.

&quot;I guess not. Draw your sword, Saber. Fight for your wish upon the Grail, if it matters to you!&quot; Armstrong bellowed as Opportunity appeared before him. It gleamed brightly in the morning light, repaired from its fight against Midas and Szrac. &quot;Hop in, Houston. This might kill, otherwise. Make sure the doors are closed.&quot;

Something in Rider&#39;s voice would push Pascal to believe him. A mix of force, genuine concern, and anger towards Sinmara mixed together into a choir of emotion.</span>

A massive outpour of mana began billowing from Armstrong, infinitely more massive than anything else he had used since his Summoning. His armor began to envelop in light.

<strong>&quot;Though I am young compared to most Heroic Spirits, I am able to trade blows with kings and gods alike. Why is that?&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;Simple! I am not just Neil Armstrong. I&#39;m a thousand people mixed together to form the perfect vessel, all in the sake of the future. I don&#39;t just ride through the sea of stars, but the wave of progress. As long as someone stands up to brave the unknown, as long as we keep marching forward, mankind will never falter.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;For their sake, I take the next step: APOLLO 11!&quot;</strong>

Armstrong took the next step, and reality crumbled.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The docks were gone. Not just the docks, but Perespolis itself. As had the ocean. Instead of a sea of water, the world had become a sea of gray. Craters peppered the landscape, and meteor marks. In her long years of existence, Sinmara had never seen anything like it. This was not any of the Nine Worlds. It was an impossible experience. There was nothing like it on Earth.

On Earth...

In the sky above, there was not just a sun floating above. A planet, blue and green, floated above. It was not the blue ball that the world had devolved to a hundred years ago. That was Earth in its prime, and it was beautiful.

It would be a prime target for destruction.

Sandro was finding it hard to breathe, as well as freezing. His entire body was rejecting the experience. This was no place for a mere human. Despite that, his reaction was minute compared to Sinmara. It was as if several thousand ton weights had been placed on her back. Flames sputtered and died. It was as if everything that had made her... <em>her</em> had been dampened. This was no place for a fire giant.

Armstrong stood there, taking it all in. He sighed contentedly. &quot;There were people, long ago, who worshiped the moon. They believed it was a paradise, a utopia. They thought that spirits made their homes here. As you can see. That&#39;s not the case. There&#39;s nothing magical about this place, and there&#39;s nothing magical about you.&quot;

With that, NASA fired its gun, manifested its drill, and lunged towards Sinmara.

As if the Grail would be delivered to me in a gift wrap.&quot; Pascal replied to Neil&#39;s approval, still dismissing their own strength. Regardless, he couldn&#39;t deny that he felt a slight amount of comfort, knowing that someone was still rooting for him, even if that someone was more of a lunatic than anything.

Speaking of lunatics, Saber was getting dangerously close to one. Pascal had no idea what had gotten into her: Was it the horrid outfit? Archer&#39;s advances? The stress of a Holy Grail War getting to her? All he knew was that the Saber from now felt very different compared to the one he had seen back at the restaurant. Her words were dry and expressed killing intent. She wanted to destroy, and she wasn&#39;t kidding about it. But why? For what purpose?

Armstrong didn&#39;t even give him time to speak back, as he took charge and shoved Pascal inside of Opportunity.

&quot;Wait, <em>what?!</em> Don&#39;t be so hasty! We can reason with them...Maybe! Things went smoothly yesterday after al--&quot; Before he could indulge in such naive thoughts, Armstrong had already activated his second Noble Phantasm, along with dropping a bombshell that would have probably hit a lot harder if Pascal had any idea who or what NASA was.

All he knew, was that his Servant wasn&#39;t just a single loony. No charlatan could summon the Moon itself right in front of his eyes, as he stared at Earth&#39;s orbit from Opportunity&#39;s inside. He dared not to leave the vehicle after witnessing Sinmara&#39;s reaction to the cold environment that was outer space.

Was it happening? Was he really going to witness the death of Saber, one of the Knight class Servants, at the hands of Rider?

His Servant had already instigated the wrath of the Astronaut before them. Something was off, everything was changing, becoming alien. Sandro tensed up as he grew short of breath, he shriveled up in his coat feeling the intense cold.

Looking out everything was gray and barren, holes littered the floor, Sandro looked up to see an unfamiliar body in the sky… is that the earth? “A-are we on the fucking moon!” He yelled exhausting what little breath he had 

Sandro pulled out his Candelabra feeding it moon rocks as fast as he could to generate a large flame in an attempt to keep himself warm. Due to the properties of the Candle it wouldn&#39;t have any problem staying lit in the current atmosphere . 

“Come one this is c-crazy, W-w-we gotta find a way to retreat Saber &#39;&#39; Sandro stuttered from the cold whilst trying to talk sense into Sinmara, however, it seemed that ship sailed a long time ago.

The world around them seemed to peel itself away, making room for the new reality that had forced itself upon them. It was one unlike any she had ever seen, high up in the stars that she had only ever gazed at from the ground below. Now? They were everything, surrounding her from every angle. The moon, once the far-off domain of Mani, was now underneath their feet.

Sinmara&#39;s legs seemed to go limp as she suddenly doubled over, keeling down onto her knees. It was as if all her power had suddenly left her body, as though her strength had simply... vanished. An especially devastating event, one carefully planned by Armstrong - A Noble Phantasm that stripped away Mystery, used against a Phantasmal Species, from the Age of Gods, using a Sword of Myth. It was a perfect plan!

Such a Heroic Spirit stood no chance in this exact moment in time, a bold step for man, a giant leap for mankind, the moment of entering into a new era.

The moment of entering into a new era.

Entering into a new era.

<em><strong>A NEW ERA</strong></em>

<strong>&quot;Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu.... hehe... hehehehehehehehehe... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</strong> The giantess cackled madly, throwing her head back as her wide eyes glared at the earth above. Something wasn&#39;t right. Why was she laughing right now, when she was in total checkmate?

It was at this moment that Armstrong would notice something very, very wrong.

<strong>Sinmara&#39;s magical energy is skyrocketing even higher than his own.</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Armstrong felt extremely confident in his ability to dispatch the strongest class, given what he knew about Saber thanks to Archer&#39;s assistance. His Noble Phantasm was perfect for dealing with both gods and heroes of old alike. 

So of course, the plan fell apart almost instantly.

Roaring. Armstrong thrust the drill into Sinmara&#39;s chest, taking advantage of this moment of weakness. The drill tore mercilessly into Saber, enchanced by Rider&#39;s reserves of magical energy, though they were already threatening to run low. He was absolutely confident that Saber would fall in a few seconds.

She didn&#39;t.

&quot;What&#39;re you laughing at, Saber? Don&#39;t tell me the pressure&#39;s already gotten to you!&quot; Armstrong said. his voice barely heard above the drill&#39;s whirring. Despite Armstrong&#39;s efforts, he could barely crack Sinmara&#39;s outer shell. Archer hadn&#39;t been joking. She was a tough nut to crack!

Sinmara&#39;s energy output began to quickly spike as her laughter increased. Armstrong&#39;s arm furrowed as he attempted to force the drill deeper into her chest (<img class="emoji " alt="👀" title="👀" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f440.jpg">). Suddenly, it sparked up and exploded. <strong>&quot;What...?&quot;</strong> NASA gasped as Sinmara&#39;s energy output spiked further and further.

Everything that peculiar Archer had said was coming true. He should&#39;ve paid closer attention, instead of just writing it off. He was a fool. He simply took a few steps back, thunderstruck. 

He didn&#39;t even think to return back to Opportunity.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Maybe Pascal should stop thinking altogether. His pessimism was so great that it was starting to jinx his chances at success. Just when he thought that it was too good to be true to have Rider defeat Saber with just one blow, his premonition became reality. Sinmara was laughing, laughing at Armstrong&#39;s attacks. Pascal was no mage, but even he could sense the fluctuations of mana in the air. A huge payload of energy was being generated...and it wasn&#39;t coming from Rider, that much was sure.

&quot;That&#39;s why I told you that we should <strong>get the fuck out of here!</strong> There&#39;s something weird about that Servant, she&#39;s been weird ever since she dressed up in some wild fetish wear for god&#39;s sake!&quot; Pascal shouted. He couldn&#39;t explain it well, but something about Saber felt &#39;off&#39;. By all means, she shouldn&#39;t have been a threat. Wearing maid clothes? Talking in a weird Nordic accent? Getting flustered and slapping other Servants like a teenage girl? She seemed more of a nuisance than an actual opponent.

And yet, that&#39;s what made her sinister: <strong>That she was still putting up a fight despite her behavior.</strong> It got Pascal worried. No sensible Servant would act like this in a life-or-death scenario, unless they were complete idiots.

Saber seemed like a <em>dangerous</em> idiot.

&quot;Rider, retreat at once! We&#39;re leaving, right now!&quot; Pascal ordered, turning on the Opportunity as he finally mastered the concept behind pedals and a steering wheel. He had only learned to drive forward so far, but that was enough. He drove and drove and drove...

...and crashed right into Sinmara, attempting to run her over. He doubted that the impact would kill, but he wanted to stun her and buy time for Armstrong to join him. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sensing that they were in grievous danger, both Rider and Pascal attacked with all they could muster. The drill bored into her chest, slowly but surely piercing through her outer shell. Yet that was exactly the problem - <strong>slowly</strong> but surely. There was no way it would be able to finish her off before her power reached it&#39;s peak!

So, Pascal slammed the Opportunity into her. It was a more substantial attack, further damaging her protections. Yet the giantess was abnormally strong, and even at top speed, the rover did not cause her to budge an inch.

<strong>&quot;FUHAHAHAHAHAHA! He&#39;s coming! He&#39;s coming back to me! I&#39;ve waited and waited and waited and waited AND WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED! Finally, here and now, it&#39;s happening!&quot;</strong> Sinmara screamed in glee. Her magical energy continued to skyrocket, higher than when she made use of Laevateinn, even higher than her last-ditch effort against Archer. Worst of all, it showed no signs of stopping.

Slowly, Saber raised up her cursed blade, and jammed it down into the stone surface of the Moon.

The moment the tip of the sword pierced the ground, the ground around her cracked and shattered, as though they were experiencing an earthquake! Being at the epicenter, Pascal and the Opportunity received the worse of it, being wildly tossed around as shards of moon rock slammed into the vehicle. The hope of humanity&#39;s progress had just turned into a glorified coffin!

Yet things were getting even worse with every passing second. Laevateinn was <em>growing</em>. The blade that once fit comfortably in Sinmara&#39;s palm had now expanded in length and girth, larger than Saber herself! It continued to grow and grow, as though it seemed to be feeding off the destruction...

<em><strong>&quot;Awaken. Awaken. It&#39;s been so long, my dear. Let us reunite in this beautiful moment. Let us finish what you started...&quot;</strong></em>

Afterall what was he supposed to do? He was useless, pitiful, and weak. How, how was supposed to ever think he could be of any use in this war. These thoughts circled his mind as he accepted his inability to ever form a bond with is Servant.

Watching as Saber shrugged off the enemy attacks with ease it seemed that maybe there was still a chance to have victory. Something was happening, Sandro didn&#39;t understand it but it seemed to be in his favor. Maybe he didn&#39;t need Saber to listen to him, rather she could just win the whole thing for him. 

Maybe Sandros chances were even greater than he anticipated, who was Saber waiting for? Was she only showing a fraction of her power at this moment. Sandro stood back up, candelabra in hand. Wobbling at his knees from the shaking ground, a smile crossed his face, he didn&#39;t need to be strong, no he just needed Saber to be stronger than everyone else, he didn&#39;t matter he never did.

“Hahaha” A short but maniacal laugh left Sandros lips. “S-see im gonna win, go ahead Saber show them!” Sandro yelled across the battlefield, he wasn&#39;t so much ordering Saber to do anything. Instead he was announcing his confidence in his Servant.

Opportunity had successfully collided with Sinmara, the kinetic force ringing through her body like a vibrating bell. Surprisingly, she felt no pain. Her tough exterior had been damaged, yet she showed no signs of stopping her advance. She was <em>laughing.</em>

Various measurements and meters within Opportunity started to skyrocket. Temperature was rising. Chassis was melting. Pascal couldn&#39;t understand all of that information, but he could tell that Sinmara&#39;s presence alone was driving the machine into a tilt.

<strong>PLANET DEEMED UNINHABITABLE FOR THIS VEHICLE. PLEASE EVACUATE!</strong>

An error message flashed on a high tech screen next to the steering wheel. Planet? Uninhabitable? Could it be that the raw energy Saber was emitting was enough to <strong>rival an entire planet?</strong>

&quot;Rider. Rider! <strong>RIDER!</strong> Get us out of here! Saber is bad ne--&quot; Before he could finish, Sinmara started cackling before raising her blade and stabbing the Moon. The satellite was severed in half, causing a tremendous, fiery earthquake that sent Opportunity, and Pascal, flying.

Pascal didn&#39;t even have the time to scream. He bumped on the walls of the vehicle as it spun around like a shooting star. It eventually crashed in a piece of moon rubble, lying upside down with rocks on top of it. Pascal would be uncomfortably lying upside down on the vehicle&#39;s windscreen. Bruises surrounded his head and hands, but they were minor. Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm was quite sturdy.

He could only stare in despair at Sinmara&#39;s sword growing bigger and bigger. It felt like the apocalypse had come. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Armstrong took a tentative step away from Sinmara, unnerved by her reaction as his reaction turned from surprise to some sort of coldness in his chest. What was this? This wasn&#39;t anger or outrage or shock. Was this... <strong>fear</strong>? Absurd! Neil Armstrong did not feel fear. NASA did not tremble in its boots! His existence was a response to fear. He existed because the United States feared giving the new frontier to the Soviets!

Despite this, he was afraid.

&quot;Aaaah... Ahh....&quot; Armstrong gawked like a fool as Sinmara grew to eclipse the atmosphere of his inner world. Suddenly, Pascal appeared out of nowhere, crashing into Sinmara with the full weight of Opportunity! Was his Master actually fighting? Spineless little Pascal? No. It was unfair to call someone spineless when you yourself were shaking in your boots.

However, Pascal&#39;s moment of bravery and self preservation would be turned against him as Saber&#39;s blade struck the moon, blasting him back. 

&quot;<strong>PASCAL!</strong>&quot; Rider&#39;s voice became replaced with a massive blast of static as he screamed at his Master and Opportunity. However, the same strike that had sent Pascal and his mount flying had also done the same to Armstrong. Luckily, he was in a lot more control of himself. Being blasted up and away gave him a few benefits as well, such as a larger view of Apollo 11.

The Reality Marble was falling apart as cracks of fire spread from Laevateinn&#39;s impact point across the moonscape. Suddenly, cracks began appearing in reality itself, like glass. It wouldn&#39;t last long. Running towards Pascal, Armstrong took long, floaty hops to reach his destination. Thanks to lower gravity, it was a literal hop, skip, and a jump.</span>

Come on, son, get up.&quot; Armstrong murmured as he took his helmet off temporarily, tossing it into cabin. His eyes were flecked with a mix of concern and fear. He looked over at Saber, before shaking his head. &quot;Actually, change of plans, Houston. Stay in the rover.&quot; He said, flicking a switch on the dashboard. The inside of Opportunity turned a pleasant green color. Suddenly, everything became lighter. So <em>that&#39;s</em> how you turned down the gravity. Pascal would remember that.

Armstrong shut the door to the cabin as he left Pascal inside. He took a deep breath, before getting a good grip on Opportunity. He took a deep breath.

&quot;Heave.... Ho!&quot; 

It took several seconds for Armstrong to flip Opportunity back on its wheels, and Sinmara&#39;s sword was growing larger and larger by the second. Armstrong hopped inside Opportunity, and reset the gravity.

He looked at Pascal gravely, who was sprawled awkwardly in the corner due to being flipped around. Rider licked his lips nervously. I don&#39;t think I can beat Saber now. He looked over at Sandro, who was having a complete mental collapse at the situation. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m going to floor the Master.</strong>&quot; Armstrong squeezed his eyes shut. <em>I&#39;m sorry, kid.</em> There was nothing else he could do to stop Saber. It was either one Master, or who knew how many civilians. Leaving Sinmara unchecked could destroy the entire city. 

&quot;For the sake of progress.&quot; 
He floored the accelerator, and rushed down Sandro.

This was not an ordinary Noble Phantasm.

It was a being from the Age of Gods, reborn into the modern era.

<em><strong>SURTR ROMANTIA</strong></em>

Sinmara looked up at the skies, eyes filled with childlike wonder as she watched the sun turn into an inky void. She was distracted, which was the one boon that Rider and Pascal had going for them. They could strike Sandro and kill him, in doing so severing her connection and denying her any mana. Considering the absolutely colossal amount of magical energy this thing was outputting, that was sure to starve her in seconds!

Moments before the impact, it seemed that the Ashen Giantess finally noticed what was occurring. Her master, in mortal danger, singled out in an attempt to stop her before she brought an end to the world. A noble sacrifice for the good of mankind. The last-ditch effort to stop this abomination from fully manifesting. 

Sinmara smirked, doing her best to stifle her laughter, and waved goodbye to Sandro, as one would say farewell to an acquaintance as they walked by on the street.

<em>Something was wrong.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro continued to doddle in his own crazy world cheering on for his servant to bring an end to the Astronaut. His excitement soon came to an end as he saw Armstrong’s rover headed straight for him.

“H-huh?” He said his eyes narrowing before realizing his life was in grave danger. What could he do? He couldn&#39;t outrun something like that, the enemy was going straight for him, Sandro was facing death in the eyes.

Sandro held his hands out trying to gather a current around his body, it wouldn&#39;t work, he could only get small drafts to form around him. “Stupid moon!” He cursed to himself. He couldn&#39;t let himself become roadkill. He looked over to Sinmara trying to ask for help, but a cold glare pierced his heart, she was going to let him die...

It was clear Sandro was alone abandoned by his servant, but he couldn&#39;t die so pitifully. The rover was metal, maybe a composition of alloys he had never seen before but Sandro’s alchemical knowledge was great. If he could get his hands on the rover maybe he could live, the only problem was his fire. What could he set on fire when there was no air.

Sandro would look crazy as his own hands burst into flames, the heat around his hands was strong as the flame from his candle had been fed a tremendous amount of fuel. Sandro leaped in the air gaining height just as the Rover hit him with a smack. 

Suddenly Pascal and Armstrong would here a voice below them. “W-wait!” in front of them was a small molten hole enough to fit Sandros head and torso through. He was gripping onto the floor trying not to slide out. His hands were scorched and his arms mangled. The Rover had shattered his arms before he could melt through the hull, his legs were still outside flailing as the rover sped.</span>

Despite everything, <em>he was not fine.</em> How could anyone feel fine after seeing <em><strong>that?!</strong></em> The unassuming Saber was actually a menace, her sword growing larger with every passing second as Pascal regretted that they hadn&#39;t acted earlier.

&quot;We should have dealt with her at the restaurant. Maybe we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess now.&quot; Pascal cursed, before witnessing something....something not from this world emerge from the sky. It was surreal. Far more surreal than any other Servant he had witnessed in his lifetime. Forget talking fox cats or Archers capable of handling multiple chef knives: Sinmara looked like a monster. One ready to swallow up the entire world, not just Persepolis.

He couldn&#39;t run from this problem. He had to face it head on.

But not in the way Armstrong wanted to.

&quot;Are you <em>insane?!</em> That&#39;s a human being you&#39;re trying to run over right now!&quot; Pascal screamed, almost kicking Rider away from the wheels. Sandro kept pleading in the meanwhile.

&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, but this isn&#39;t right. Nothing is stopping Saber from just stealing mana batteries from stores in her current state, either. Killing her Master isn&#39;t the way, especially since she doesn&#39;t seem to have any interest in him!&quot; He specified that last bit. He definitely had no idea that a Servant could be so independent from their Master, not even through Independent Action. It was perfect. <em>Too perfect.</em> No Servant was without weakness, and Sinmara most definitely had one. It was just a matter of finding it.</span>

&quot;Rider. That sword gives me a bad feeling. It&#39;s been growing non stop ever since the fight started. You don&#39;t think...&quot; Pascal paused, inspecting the scene more. Destroyed moon and bleeding sun aside, Sinmara was the main spectacle of the day. She was growing every second, yet she didn&#39;t seem to be siphoning mana from her Master. What was the trick behind that?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sometimes the hardest sacrifices required the strongest of wills. 

It was unlikely that anything Pascal could do to Armstrong would be capable of stopping him. Armstrong was a tough nut to crack, and if he was committed to something, he would absolutely do it. Who knew how many people were shot up into space during his time, and who knew how many of them had died in the name of progress? What was one more Master on the proverbial pile of corpses?

Even if this Master wasn&#39;t connected to Saber any more, there was still a chance, right? There was no other way to stop Saber. This had to be done! This was all for progress.

Progress...

...

Sandro&#39;s life would flash before his eyes as Opportunity barreled towards him at a ridiculous speed. There was absolutely no way for him to dodge this. He was going to die. It was over. He closed his eyes. Why did he have to summon Sinmara in particular?

<strong>SCREEEEEEECH!</strong>

Opportunity swerved and braked,  the driver&#39;s side stopping just inches in front of Sandro. He had survived by the skin of his teeth. Inside the cockpit, Armstrong sighed. &quot;Damn. You&#39;re probably right, Houston. There&#39;s no need to snuff his life out yet, anyways. Opportunity&#39;s door opened, almost hitting Sandro square in the forehead. Armstrong looked down at him with a mix of pity and disgust.

&quot;Get in.&quot; He said, grabbing Sandro by his shirt and tossing him into the cockpit with Pascal. It was a lot more cramped now, as Opportunity was only meant for two people, but Sandro was small, and could be counted as luggage. At least Armstrong wouldn&#39;t need to clean the blood off his tires. Opportunity began its turn towards Sinmara. 

Rider turned to look at Sandro. &quot;Welcome aboard, Master of Saber! True Name of your Servant, your name, and everything you can tell us about Saber, please. Fail to comply and I&#39;ll leave you out to die at the hands of your Servant.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It seemed that today was Sandros lucky day. His life and his body were still intact. He flopped to the floor of the opportunity with an ‘oof’ as he rubbed the forming lump on his forehead. He looked around with a sigh. The enemy now seemed like an ally, especially after Saber was about to let him die

“Y-you want me to sell out my own Servant” Sandro asked, his voice shaking from confusion. There was a lot going on, and it was hard for Sandro to process. His whole life was dedicated to completing his fathers goals, to be a vicarious vessel of life for Salvatore. Now he was being asked to betray his fathers trust and purposely lose. 

The question in Sandros mind was one of deep seeded anguish. If he lost on purpose he would be a failure to his father, the only way to succeed in Salvatore’s eyes was to lay down and die here. It seemed either way Sandro would die, either in mind or body.

In the heat of the moment a new thought struck Sandro’s mind, maybe if he failed his father… he could lead a life of his own… maybe it would be the best thing Sandro could hope for. “My name is Sandro Moretti, and my Servant is…” Sandro was choking on his words, he couldn&#39;t let it out. 

Sandro glanced away from the two people next to him staring at the ground barely able to get the words past his lips. “Her name is Sinmara” He spoke in a whisper making his words almost inaudible. “A-and I dont know whats wrong with her but she&#39;s been drawing power since our last fight… that’s all I know”

With its prison no more, the infernal being trapped within was free. It floated for a moment, suspended by the utter lack of gravity, before it began to descend. Two fiery arms stretched out - one wrapping itself around the hilt of the extended Laevateinn, while the other straightened itself out and scooped up Sinmara, raising her upwards.

The smoke and cinder that surrounded the creature began to fade. If there had been any doubt about its identity, they were now dispelled.

Surtr was not only exuding a tremendous amount of mana, but it was also acting as an anchor. Past the scorching flame and underneath the shell was a heart akin to a mana generator, pumping out enough magical energy to not only sustain itself, but also Sinmara. 

That meant that Saber didn&#39;t need a master to provide mana anymore. Hell, they didn&#39;t even need to stop and steal mana batteries! So long as she was perched on that abomination from the Age of Gods, she and her grotesque Noble Phantasm would be able to continue on unabated, without the need for even the briefest of pauses. 

Ragnarok had well and truly come for a second time.

<strong>&quot;Come, my dear!&quot;</strong> Sinmara screamed in glee, <strong>&quot;Let us be free of the false space, and start some TRUE chaos!&quot;</strong>

Silently, the giant obliged. Raising up the enlarged Laevateinn, it aimed for the weakest part of the already-crumbling Reality Marble - the space that once held the sun, now nothing more than shattered blackness floating within the void.

&quot;So, we finally meet. Seriously, can&#39;t you even handle your own damned Servant? You&#39;re supposed to be aristocracy!&quot; Pascal shrilled, berating Sandro for his negligence. He had never met the man before, but the fact that their own Servant wasn&#39;t even bothering to protect them was a sign that they had no control at all.

&quot;Great. Thanks for the name. Maybe I&#39;ll hit her up on Cinder™️ after this.&quot; Pascal replied with a very sarcastic snarl. &quot;But really, <em><strong>anything else?!</strong></em> How do we beat her? Does she have any weak spots? She&#39;s your Servant, surely you know a way to keep her in che--&quot;

His frustration was very apparent, but what came next was even more terrifying. Surtr emerged from his spherical prison, descending from the heavens as he carried his wife on his hands. The mana density in the air was tremendous, to the point Pascal was starting to feel feverish. He held on, using his current anger to remain conscious.

&quot;You didn&#39;t tell me you had <strong>TWO SERVANTS!</strong> What the hell is going on?!&quot; Pascal had absolutely lost it, punching his seat in frustration. 

&quot;And Rider, what even <em>is</em> your Noble Phantasm? Are we really on the Moon? Can those two break it?&quot; There were simply too many things to address and not enough time to get all the answers. It was a hopeless situation, one that could not be solved with strategy or tactics. They knew too little of Sinmara and her husband, and Sandro wasn&#39;t helping things.

The only thing they could do...<strong>was retreat.</strong>

&quot;...Rider. Get us out of here. <strong>NOW!</strong>&quot; A cowardly tactic, one that Armstrong would have refused...had he not seen the delirious fire in Pascal&#39;s eyes. Perhaps it was due to the fiery sickness he felt from Surtr&#39;s mana, or perhaps he knew that he had no way to flee Persepolis. They weren&#39;t running away. They were running away to <em>form a plan.</em> Sinmara would either die, or Persepolis would sink with her.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Armstrong rolled his eyes at Sandro. The boy had been next to useless. Knowing that Saber was Sinmara confirmed the nature of the Servant, but ultimately, he would&#39;ve figured it out as soon as soon as Sinmara began to babble on about Surtr. Maybe if he had cornered Saber&#39;s Master before things had gotten out of hand, they could&#39;ve minimized casualties.

As Surtr swung Laevateinn, Apollo 11 vanished like a wink of stars, fading away into Armstrong&#39;s inner world. Rider looked up at Saber&#39;s little friend, and hope was dashed. He took one look at Pascal, and nodded. They were in agreement. Flee to fight another day. Perhaps fleeing to fight another minute was more accurate. Armstrong floored the accelerator, dodging collapsing debris.

&quot;My Noble Phantasm is a Reality Marble. It&#39;s like an inner world given form in the real one. If it were the real moon, Sandro would&#39;ve popped like a balloon. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a fairly faithful recreation.&quot; Armstrong drove over a ramp on the docks, used for unloading cargo, and the dynamic trio became airborne as Opportunity soared.

&quot;The moon is a symbol of mystery and intrigue in the magical and unknown. When we—I stepped on it, that intrigue in magic and fairies living there became null and void. My Noble Phantasm is an Anti-Mystery Noble Phantasm, specialized in slaying gods and demons and magecraft users.&quot; Armstrong gestured out Opportunity&#39;s back window, where Surtr and Sinmara&#39;s unholy union was still going on.

&quot;As you can see, it&#39;s failed.&quot;

“No, I&#39;m really not sure what weaknesses she could have, I tried to talk to her but she never cared to bond with me-- holy shit!” Sandro exclaimed seeing Surtr rise in all his glory was more than a shock to the young man, what in the world was going on. Sandro only felt more conflicted watching the events unfold, clearly whatever he summoned was never meant to be his ally. Had Sinmara always intended to be his enemy?

Sandro squirmed around repositioning himself so his head was between Pascal and Riders letting him get a good view outside of the vehicle. “I&#39;m just as much in the dark as you! I have no idea what&#39;s going on”

The one thing that Sandro did know in all of this chaos, was that Pascal’s plan seemed like the proper move. He wanted nothing more than to get out of there. “Well it may not have been real but it sure as hell didn&#39;t feel good to stand on” Sandro could only imagine how terrifying the real moon would be, good thing he would never go there.

As Apollo 11 dissipated and Opportunity started driving away from the docks, Sinmara would find herself at sea. Thankfully, Surtr was still holding her by his hands, now standing in knee deep sea as the water around him boiled. Vapor filled the air as he could hear the delightful screams of nearby citizens who had noticed the towering behemoth in front of them.

&quot;Your Noble Phantasm does all that, yet you couldn&#39;t even get rid of Saber? If anything, it&#39;s like you made her <em>stronger.</em> What the hell is up with that?&quot; Pascal exclaimed in disbelief at Armstrong&#39;s explanation. Their trump card was useless? That didn&#39;t make any sense! Either Saber was a far more modern Servant than he had anticipated, or there was something else going on.

He quickly took out his phone and started browsing ServantPedi--

<strong>SORRY OUR SERVERS ARE CURRENTLY DOWN!</strong>

<strong>ETA: 3 DAYS</strong>

&quot;Are you <em>fucking kidding me.</em>&quot; Pascal cursed, slamming the car window. Well, there was his number one source of Servant knowledge. Time to rely on a far more unreliable source...

&quot;You&#39;re telling me you knew her name, yet you didn&#39;t bother to do any research on her? What time period is she from? Is she famous? Obscure? Is she even <em>real?</em> Like, an actual human person, or did you just summon a Heroic Spirit from Hell?!&quot; He barraged Sandro with questions while their ride slowly took them to the <span class="mention">#restaurant-district</span>... <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

Not due to the force of Surtr&#39;s strike. Instead, Armstrong simply dismissed it. All things considered, it was probably a smart move, to conserve as much mana as possible. However, there was now a new problem, one that extended beyond Pascal. Hell, it extended far beyond this petty Grail War.

There was now an entity of pure apocalypse standing within Persepolis. It stood forty feet tall, towering over the civilian populace, though still smaller than many of the skyscrapers further inland.

It was time to fix that. After all, her time spent learning about this world had taught her well. Now, she knew that boats exploded good.

As the Opportunity Rover drove away, they would see Surtr raise up Laevateinn in the rear view mirror, before bringing it down in a series of slashes, slices and stabs. Each one was followed by a violent explosion, bathing the docks in a cascade of burning flames and shrapnel as it hacked and cleaved away.

It was a horrible situation, one that would certainly result in untold massacre, but it also provided them precious time to plan ahead...

Complete annihilation. The docks had been reduced to smoldering metal, clouded by a thick black smog. All that had come to stop them had died. S.E.R.V.A.N.T exoskeletons lay half-melted, feet away from the piles of ash that were once their master. Automata and golems suffered a similar fate, as did the police force and security guards that had arrived to the scene.

The docks were, simply put, gone. 

It was time to move on, but to where? Sinmara&#39;s mind immediately went to the scrapyard, with its giant piles of wood and cloth. Or perhaps to the tropical paradise where she had been summoned, with the swaying forest of palm trees? 

Both good options, but no. First she had some unfinished business. The world was about to end, and she was going to cull those unworthy to witness it.

Cull those who had humiliated her.

Thus, the great giant began to move through the terrified city, towards the <span class="mention">#restaurant-district</span>...
