                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Spring 2104, <strong>Persepolis</strong>. A Dhruva type city wandering across an empty sea for the majority of its lifetime. Due to its small size and lack of resources, it has been unable to sustain itself over the past decade. Contact with other cities has been scarce as well, as if this city and its inhabitants have been abandoned in some lonely corner of the world. 

The New World is barely a century old and Persepolis is already becoming a relic of the past.

Such is the fate of every Dhruva type nomadic city created for the sole purpose of being a testing ground for S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes. Once upon a time, major research cities around the world frequented the likes of Persepolis, renting their precious space to test their S.E.R.V.A.N.T. units under the guise of fake Holy Grail Wars. But now, with the tech nearly perfected, Persepolis found itself robbed of a reliable source of income. Without any noteworthy trade of its own, the city was cast aside by its donors and left to shut down on its own.</span>

<strong>-Season 0-</strong>

The ruling <strong>aristocrats</strong> mostly kept to themselves. Believing that Servants were the solution to all problems, they used spare S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes left behind by research cities to summon Servants willy-nilly, which only aggravated the situation by bleeding the city’s resources dry. 

Infuriated, some commoners managed to get their hands on a few sets of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes of their own. Jealousy and hatred towards the ruling class fueled them to form an underground <strong>mafia</strong> with the aid of Servants at their side, but they too were corrupted by greed and trampled over the poor and middle class to line their own pockets.

A gang war eventually broke out between the aristocrats and the mafia and panic ravaged Persepolis’ citizens. Caught in the crossfire, the rest of the populace were forced to side with either faction or left to fend for themselves. Inspired by the mafia, a few brave souls sought to obtain their own S.E.R.V.A.N.T. suits in the name of self defense, but such acts only provoked the two factions even more, as the mere thought of <strong>commoners</strong> rebelling against them was unthinkable in the first place.

In addition, <strong>visitors</strong> from afar, be it for business or other purposes, were forced to get involved as well. Anyone without a Servant lived in fear of never seeing another day, while anyone with a Servant would be immediately targeted by faction members of Servant-less citizens looking to contract with a Servant of their own.

The city is in utter chaos…</span>

Persepolis is at its breaking point.

The lack of foresight led the aristocrats and the mafia to a standoff that resulted in incessant fights, but the lack of resources on this barren island finally managed to douse the flame of war, if only a little. Realizing that they were condemning their own city to an even quicker death, the leaders of the aristocrats sought to buy off some key members of the mafia to dissolve the organization from within. The mafia retaliated likewise, using their own resources to blackmail and coerce a few high ranking aristocrats into joining them instead. To further sweeten the deal, they even dealt those aristocrats a hand that was simply too good to refuse…

<strong>A Holy Grail.</strong>

Among the ruins within the old S.E.R.V.A.N.T. test sites, a member of the mafia had managed to uncover this incredible piece of relic inside an ornate box, perhaps buried and left behind by a research city that had used to rent the city for their experiments. An imitation of the real thing, but nevertheless an artifact with unlimited potential...as far as the saying goes.

Rumors swept through the city like a storm and suddenly, everyone turned their gaze upon this alleged wish granting device. The leaders of the aristocrats offered obscene amounts of riches from their hidden stash in exchange for the Grail, but the mafia had terms of their own:

A Holy Grail War.

The aristocrats accepted the proposal readily, the tantalizing amount of magical energy leaking from the Grail’s container no doubt playing a huge factor in their change of attitude. 

Two teams of Master-Servant pairs fight to the death, until one side comes out on top. Being the host to several mock Holy Grail Wars, neither factions were strangers to the rules. Soon, recruitment notices and advertisements flooded the city’s networks and broadcasted to neighboring cities who were lucky enough to receive its signals. For once in its life, Persepolis managed to make its presence known in the New World as a host to an official Holy Grail War. 

In just a few weeks, participants have been cherry-picked. Those who were too poor to afford S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes have also been treated to the latest models. The city has gone back to a false pretense of peace as it anxiously awaited the day that would mark the beginning of their salvation...</span>

Spring 2104, Persepolis.

Two weeks passed by in a flash since the discovery of the Holy Grail. Both the <strong>aristocrats</strong> and the <strong>mafia</strong> had their hands full during this momentary truce: recruiting prospective Masters, procuring fresh S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, and broadcasting news of the upcoming Holy Grail War to its neighboring cities. 

Aside from esteemed members with a proven track record in magecraft or Servant handling, both factions have also resorted to open recruitment via posters, recommendations, and even scouting people with capable-looking Servants off the streets regardless of their citizenship. Soon, all seven spots were filled, and each Servant-less Master would receive a brand new S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame as a courtesy for their contribution.

Word travels fast. In the span of just a few days, <span class="mention">#ruined-city-docks</span> has already seen more activity than the past year combined. Visitors came in all sizes and forms, some from neighboring cities, others from farther ends of the earth, judging by their foreign attire and accents. 

Were they all here for the spectacles of a bona fide Holy Grail War, or did them come with their own agendas? Either way, local businesses have received a slight boon much to the citizens&#39; delight. The aristocrats and the mafia have also ceased going at each other&#39;s throats for the time being, finally restoring some much needed order to Persepolis.

Under the delicate fa&#231;ade of peace, the mysterious figure clad in black continues to observe the city, an eyesore to both factions alike. He hops from one sensitive location to another, sticking his nose where it doesn&#39;t belong, yet still no orders came from above to evict him from the city...</span>

The curtains quietly raised on the Holy Grail War as the recruited Masters geared up and secured their own S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames. There was no official announcement, but the maintenance workers of Persepolis suddenly found their workload increased tenfold. The #city-dock has also ceased operations for the time being, as all ships are banned from leaving the docks or coming in after a mysterious explosion had gone off there at the dead of night.

Despite the Holy Grail War participants being split into two factions, the seven recruited Masters have only received word on the Servant Classes their potential allies have summoned, perhaps as a measure to protect the identity of the Masters. However, this isn&#39;t as helpful as one might think, as the city is still swarmed with other contracted Servants summoned for the general operations of the city...

The number of damage reports skyrocketed in the last few days. The worst among them all came from the <span class="mention">#restaurant-district</span>, which was sufficiently torn up during the battle between two Masters that it has been placed under strict surveillance by the local authorities until now. Repairs have been slow, but the affected restaurant owners were quick to receive compensation. In the end, no one filed any formal complains, and the incident was quickly swept under the rug.

Meanwhile, the aristocrats living on <span class="mention">#mansion-lane</span> reported a disturbance in the area some time during the week. Some of them attributed it to a particularly nasty ocean wave bypassing the stabilization runes installed at the base of Persepolis. Others were curious enough to investigate, but by the time they had dressed and gone out, the quake in the ground had long since subsided. The neighborhood looked same as always, and they went back home empty-handed. 

The most curious, however, is the report of a mysterious fire at the city&#39;s garbage dump. Persepolis, like many other Dhruva sized nomadic cities, lacks the space to facilitate waste burning as opposed to directly dumping them into the ocean. To have the entirety of the <span class="mention">#scrapyard</span> burning for hours at once was simply unheard of. Unfortunately, witnesses were sparse, and the ones who did witness were too spooked and confused to string together anything coherent to the investigators.

Speaking of investigators...

The figure in black is once again prowling the streets. Word has it that they are now surveying every damaged location, chasing after every rumor and interviewing any witness of a scuffle that they could get their hands on. They even started poking around the old test site again, where the Grail was uncovered and allegedly guarded in some secret base.

From this round and onwards, elimination will be enforced. What this means is that if two or more parties are involved in a fight, at the end of the round, at least 1 (one) character from that fight will be eliminated, either by losing or forfeiting the match. Whether you do it via improv or via preplanning is up to you.

If elimination results in character deaths, then the characters who died will no longer be able to to post IRP. 

If elimination only results in 1 (one) character death from a team, then the surviving character will still be able to post IRP, but their role of a HGW participant will be stripped unless they can find another Master (if the suvivor is a Servant) or a Servant (if the suvivor is a Master) to team up with. Do note that only characters from #master-servant-pairs are eligible candidates for a second team up.

In addition, failure to complete a fight before the deadline will also result in elimination, usually to the person(s) responsible for stalling the thread for no good reason. Ruling details are explained in the season schedule a few posts above.</div></span>

The Holy Grail War has progressed beyond anyone&#39;s expectations. Perhaps, a bit too much. The Persepolis docks no longer exist, having been replaced by the <span class="mention">#ruined-city-docks</span> after an enormous, hulking figure emerged from the ocean itself. The creature proceeded to destroy much of the already damaged <span class="mention">#restaurant-district</span>, along with blowing up any remaining ships that were parked at the docks. It then vanished in a gigantic explosion, filling the sky with ash as Persepolis&#39; citizens were at a loss on what happened. Not even the aristocracy was capable of keeping this incident under wraps. The leading theory so far is that this horrific battle was caused by two Servants.

Needless to say, the populace was displeased, especially the Mafia side of town. Reports of a fight occurring at the <span class="mention">#mass-grave</span> have started to spread like wildfire, with people reporting the sounds of gunshots and earthquakes near the abandoned test site. The commoners of Persepolis saw that as an affront to their kind, since the graves of the victims of the mafia and aristocracy feud were desecrated by the recent violence.

But the aristocracy cared not for the common folk, for they had problems of their own: Szrac Vaughn, a notorious aristocrat, had raised his hand against his own faction. His Servant, Berserker, managed to overpower Lancer&#39;s Master at the latter&#39;s own base. Their manor was soon converted into Berserker&#39;s new home, morphing into a gigantic golden manor called the <span class="mention">#midas-manor</span>.</span>

Berserker demanded offerings from the aristocracy, lest they feel his wrath. They reluctantly complied, offering him golds and riches and greatly increasing his power as a result. It is clear that Szrac and his Servant have become the main threat of this Holy Grail War, to the point that the aristocracy is offering a bounty to anyone capable of eliminating Berserker and their Master. Even the Mafia fears them and has considered an all-out attack on the manor in order to eliminate this rogue threat from the face of Persepolis.</span>

From this round and onwards, elimination will be enforced. What this means is that if two or more parties are involved in a fight, at the end of the round, at least 1 (one) character from that fight will be eliminated, either by losing or forfeiting the match. Whether you do it via improv or via preplanning is up to you.

If elimination results in character deaths, then the characters who died will no longer be able to to post IRP. 

If elimination only results in 1 (one) character death from a team, then the surviving character will still be able to post IRP, but their role of a HGW participant will be stripped unless they can find another Master (if the suvivor is a Servant) or a Servant (if the suvivor is a Master) to team up with. Do note that only characters from #master-servant-pairs are eligible candidates for a second team up.

In addition, failure to complete a fight before the deadline will also result in elimination, usually to the person(s) responsible for stalling the thread for no good reason. Ruling details are explained in the season schedule a few posts above.</div></span>

A few citizens reported to have witnessed hoards of mafia members heading towards the <span class="mention">#mass-grave</span>, equipped with weapons and even a Servant. Fearing for their lives, the citizens quickly fled the area, but a few hours later an explosion sounded across the entire test site. 

Granted, Persepolis was not a large city; the test site was at best comparable to a Stella Maris grade city&#39;s downtown. Though it was precisely its small size that had allowed everything to spread like wildfire. News, rumors, and now, a tremor fanned out from the graveyard and shook up a few neighboring districts like a mini earthquake.

Once again, the peaceful sky over Persepolis had been breached by clouds of smoke. Two giant chasms in the shape of a cross split the graveyard into four symmetrical pieces, incinerating everything in their paths. It was only thanks to the layers of decommissioned S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames cushioning the actual ground that Persepolis had managed to avoid damaging one of its arms.

Meanwhile, a few dozen mafia members, beaten black and blue and scared out of their wits had been piled up neatly near the graveyard&#39;s entrance. Their weapons were nowhere to be seen, as was the Servant they had brought...</span>

The end of all things is inevitable. Even great events such as Holy Grail Wars must eventually end, but their true value is determined by their successes and failures.

It could not be any more apparent that the Persepolis Grail War was a complete <strong>failure.</strong> The city&#39;s state has worsened with wanton death and destruction. Even the aristocracy has been unable to escape unscathed, as the majority of the aristocratic district has been damaged in a gigantic explosion of raw Magecraft. The golden manor of the terrifying Szrac has fallen, leaving only a melted pile of goo and metal in its wake.

Aristocrats have immediately evacuated to the commoners&#39; district, cursing the mafia throughout their trek, cursing the plebeians for having them endure such humiliation. Likewise, the mafia cursed the aristocracy for allowing a Servant to rampage through the <span class="mention">#ruined-city-docks</span>, cutting the populace any chance to request foreign aid.

Enemies were stranded together, even more bloodthirsty than usual as they realized that the Grail War would soon reach its conclusion. At this point, there were only two contestants left in the war: One aristocrat, one commoner.

The fate of the city rested in their hands.</span>
