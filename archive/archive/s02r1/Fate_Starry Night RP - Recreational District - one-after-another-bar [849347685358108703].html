                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Are you even attempting, Lark?! Lift with your arms, not your back!” she said, lifting her end of the object even higher.

“I’m so sorry, miss! I hadn’t even considered the idea, let me WORK ON THAT!” Lark retorted. He tried to lift the torso of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. so the feet wouldn’t be scratching the hardwood floors, but to no avail. An awful chorus, the sound of perfectly lacquered wood being tarnished, filled the hallway as they kept moving forward. 

It’s certainly not that Lark wasn’t <em>trying</em> per say. Every single muscle in his body was straining, singing out in a symphony of pain and exertion of having to lift such a heavy hunk of metal and machinery. Sweat rained down his face, threatening to flood his eyes with a new salty pain. They would’ve done so on many occasions, had it not been for Geeves standing off to the side of this debacle with a rag in hand. 

“Geeves, another cleansing please,” Lark forced out, which prompted the sharply dressed older man to act in response. He stepped alongside their jagged movements, using the article to sweep away the liquid from his forehead. Once that was achieved, a quick swat to his locks right above and he was out of the way once more. 

“Oh, quit being such a needy brat! We’re almost there!” The lady in front groaned. Now she was starting to sweat, the physical labor taking some toll on her. Rosy Red hair darkened with perspiration as beads started to form. However, her actually being dressed for the occasion (and temperature) and not being as weak as her brother helped much for the circumstances. 
“Such unladylike language, my dear Rose. Maybe you should reign it in a little more in public.” Lark said.

“Maybe <em>you</em> shouldn’t dress like a complete fool! Seriously, you’ve lived here for how long and you still insist on pants and long-sleeved shirts?” she fired back.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Here, give me that!” She turned around on a dime, adjusting her grip on the frame to make sure she didn’t drop it. After that, she hoisted the entirety of the torso onto her back. Arms dangled oddly over her shoulders, head lulled and swinging as wild as it wanted to. 

This meant that Larks grip was all but meaningless, so he let go. Wrong decision.

“LARK! GIVE ME THE LEGS!”

He realized why that was the case, and scrambled for the appendages. Left leg to left hand, right leg to right hand. Simple enough, which left Rose bearing the entire weight of the metal body. At least he wasn’t carrying now!
With the changes in arrangement, it only took a few more seconds before they made it to the front door of the bar. Lark fished for the keys and stuck the correct one inside the lock. He opened the door for his sister, backing out of the way--

And she slammed herself into the wooden frame. Her weight combined with the frame meant that the door now had some scratches and a crack in the wood before it crashed into the wall. Once the knob collided with the walnut inside, things were over. He flinched at the sound of expensive upholstery cracking and the splinter flying from its place on the wall.

Rose had no time to care, as she was nearing her limit. A few more steps inside the bar and she collapsed on her knees. The metal body splayed itself onto the carpeted floor, limbs bent at unholy angles to better resemble a demon from the pits of hell rather than an actual person. At least it was inside. 

Lark rushed to close the door, beckoning Geeves inside the room before shutting and locking the door again. Finally, the trek was over! Assessing the damages her sister caused could come later (he ignored his own mistakes for now, as the owner of the building would surely bill him in the coming days). For now the warm feeling in his chest of the day finally being here would carry away any and all worries in his head. Not the usual warm feeling, the other one.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His sister, on the other hand, was slowly starting to recover from the workout. Heavily breathing, she pulled herself up to an upright position as she glared Lark down. That anger, that raw emotion... 
She immediately stopped after realizing the look in <em>his</em> eyes. 

“Even now you can’t be normal for even a few seconds? Have you no restraint?”

Lark remained silent on the matter, knowing that they both knew the answer already. Instead, he walked closer to the mess of limbs that would soon enough be a breathing ‘person’. He stooped down, poking at one of the feet. Sure felt durable. Probably would do nothing in terms of defense once the frame held a spirit, but the base material was solid enough. 

It was still hard to imagine this hunk of materials walking and talking like a normal person. He had seen his very fair share of Servants, a few employed by his Father and the dozens that had accompanied many a soul inside these very walls. A select one or two he would even call an acquaintance whenever they stopped by with their Masters. So how were they such a common yet foreign concept to his mind? 

“Sir,” Geeves called out, “I assure you that whatever tactics you employ, the frame within your grasp will bear fruit of a wonderful Servant. Do not worry so much about the technicalities of the whole endeavor.”

Lark exhaled, giving the foot one last flick before rising back up. “Oh, Geeves. If only I could.”

“You caaaaaaaannnn,” Rose said, “you choose not to.”

“No, it’s not that,” Lark said. He went over to the bar, raising the hatch and examining the stuff behind it.

“The intricacies of Magecraft require a complete understanding of the arts being performed. Much like a… a musical performance.”

“Oh dear,” Geeves said.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“A performance,” he started while rummaging behind the bar, “requires the utmost precision, practice, timing, everything needs to be perfect in order to perform to the best of your capabilities. One wrong note, one stutter, even one misplaced step can send the whole thing crashing down. You’ll be a laughing stock of all the audience in their stuck up mentality. From their own perceived thrones of perfection they will mock you for being anything but, for the society we live in-- Ah, found it!”

“Oh thank the heavens,” Rose muttered, sending a prayer to whatever god was listening. 

“What did you find, Lark?” Geeves asked. Lark respond by holding up a white stubby stick. Chalk.

“I needed this for drawing the proper summoning circle. Now all I need is that cardboard slab I put together…”

Rose, now sitting on one knee, raised her hand. “Don’t you think you should do this, oh, I don’t know, somewhere a little more private? Perhaps in your living quarters upstairs? Where there is the actual floor to draw on?”

Lark waved her down, “Nonsense! My makeshift floor will suffice greatly! Besides, you’d have to carry that impossibly heavy lump of metal even further!” He delved into the depths of the back, where all the backup liquor was held.

“I’d be willing if it meant you weren’t in front of so many windows! Do you have any idea how easy it would be to shoot into here from an adjacent building?” She called to him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Geeves set the rag onto the bar top, taking a seat in one of the comfortable red chairs. “I agree with your sister. I understand your predisposition towards accidents and... other, such matters. But your family will be both devastated and socially ruined if their prestigious young Master were taken out of the battle before it even had a chance to start!”

Lark reemerged from the back with a large mat of cardboard. Made from broken down boxes, it looked surprisingly sturdy. Multiple layers had been glued together, at least four boxes thick. Along with that, it was large enough to easily hold a servant frame with extra room to spare. Nothing had been drawn on it yet, but that would soon change as he left the bar and returned to the sitting spot of his soon-to-be best performance yet. Hopefully. He set the large mantle down carefully before beginning the process of summoning. Chalk moved with a mind of its own as the runes were etched into the dense material.

“Smokes, you’re serious about this…” Rose said. She got up and walked over to the windows, drawing the curtains in the vain attempt to prevent any attempted assassinations. Midnight black curtains blocked out the light, making the spacious bar even darker than before. Perfect lighting for the witchery being attempted.

By the time she was done, Lark himself was making good progress on the symbols. His focus was in an entirely different place from the rest of the world. Even more jarring was the very neat circle that was being formed. It seemed almost perfect. Too perfect.

“How many times has he practiced this?” Rose asked the butler, entranced in the work happening in front of him.

“Is that a question you really desire the answer to?” he asked back.

She opened her mouth to respond, but didn’t get any words out. Slowly, she closed her jaw and watched the spectacle on show.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It wasn’t much longer before Lark rested on his legs, wiping the accumulated sweat from his hair. Eyeing his work, each rune was drawn to the best of his abilities. The overall form of the circle was near tip-top shape minus the few spots where it dipped too outward. Knowing the quality needed for such matters, though, it was perfectly fine for what he needed and would suffice in every way. All that was needed now was the frame in the circle and the incantation.

He threw the chalk to the wayside, the stub bouncing underneath one of the few tables present to be swept up later. “Here, help me with this,” he said before grabbing hold of a limb. Rose was quick to follow up, as was Geeves. Together, they were able to drag and push the frame into the circle. With a little elbow grease and much swearing, the frame stood upright against a column, inside the circle. Well, barely inside the circle. 

It was time. 

Lark motioned the other two back, “I’m not sure how this will end, so I would advise you two to maybe hide behind something. Like the bar! The bar would do.” 

Rose crossed her arms, “I’m sure it’ll be fine. Well, relatively fine. If you decided not to move the furniture, it can’t be that bad, right?”

“Yea, decided! Let’s roll with that. Sounds better.”

“Wait, what?!”

“Sir, aren’t you forgetting something?” Geeves asked, holding something out from behind the bar. It was an ornate case, beautifully etched lines that wove into each other from all sorts of directions made it mesmerizing at best. 

“How’d you get back there so fast?!” Rose said. 

“How silly of me, of course I need that!” Lark said, hopping over to where Geeves held the case. The latches were popped, and top swung open. Inside was a violin as remarkable as the case that held it. Polished to a shine, nice bright wood, perfect strings, and its own set of runes carved into the wood. To call it a piece of art would be an understatement.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark took hold of the instrument, grabbing the bow also stored in there before returning to his previous standing position. “And now, behold!”

Bow met strings, and soon enough a note began to ring out inside the room. Followed by another, and then another, and before long there was a melody. A constant stream of music flooded the ears of all around as the musician performed for the hollow man before him. Wonderfully bright and brilliant, a stark contrast to the entire aesthetic of the room which he performed. 

He was sure that if his sister was still watching she’d be in awe at his performance. But that was no concern right now, it was time for the chant!

“<strong>Silver and be the essence.</strong>”

Faint magical energy started to accompany the violin, causing the sigils to glow faintly with a sickly green light. 

“<strong>Let stone and the archduke of contracts be the foundation. Raise a wall, against the wind that shall fall.</strong>”

Even more energy was starting to gather in the area. The two inside could feel the power starting to gather, although oblivious due to the wondrous song being played in meter with the chanting. 

“<strong>Let the four cardinal gates close, and let the forked road of three from the crown reaching unto the Kingdom rotate.</strong>”

“<strong>More.</strong>”

“<strong>More.</strong>”

Each repeating of the word, five times in total, spiked the magic inside dramatically. Each forte, fortissimo, even the frenzied pitch and speed he now played at, fitting in just right with the chaos taking hold. The dark brown walls were now painted in that light green, of a Spring to never come. Some strange hope just outside of reach. If only they could reach and--

“<strong>Da Capo al Coda five times more. Once filled, break under the pressure of fulfilled time. To be declared here, I shall make an oath. Your body shall serve me. All virtues deemed worthy for Heaven I shall attain, whilst all evils I shall hold control of all of Hell.”</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The frame itself was being swallowed up by the whirling energy. Furniture rocked, lights above flickered. Geeves crouched behind the bar, old back aching. Rose stood firm, vowing to see this ritual to the end. Lark continued with his song, slowly but surely reaching the climax of the piece. Eyes closed in concentration, skin turning even whiter than normal. His body wished for a moment&#39;s respite, but none he granted. 

“<strong> From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by the three great words of power, come forth from the ring of restraint, Protector of all deemed Holy!</strong>” 

Energy collapsed upon itself, centered on the frame. A cocoon of light engulfed the metal, as Lark held the highest note for all he was worth. The climax to signal a beginning. 

Unfortunately, the furniture did not appreciate the chaos going on. At the high point, the closest articles were sent backwards. Colliding with other chairs or coffee tables, a few even took grudge with the window. None decided to attack the people, fortunately. 

What holy creation decided to be beckoned by the music played?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The cocoon of white light remained for a few more moments and despite the drawing of violin strings ceasing, there was still a melodic hum filling the parlor. It emanated from inside the aura and it was almost akin to the ringing of church bells or the signature sound of salvation, most likely produced by the residual energy running across the metal frame. 

Suddenly a metallic grieve shot outwards seemingly trying to grasp at something that wasn’t there. Then in a burst of blinding light the energy dispersed in all directions knocking over any nearby furniture, decorations, or people that were properly affixed down. Following there was a unified sound of breaking glass as all of the surrounding winds shattered from the sheer force. 

As Lark and his associates would eventually come to they’d see standing before them in the center of the room was a rather tall blonde man in fully ornate metallic armor with blue and gold trining across the breast plate, grieves, and kick guards. Around his neck fell a large blue cape with white fur around the edges. The expression on the man’s was stoic and stern. After glancing around the area for a moment he caught sight of Lark. With a slight tilt of the head, the servant approached the man. There was an uncomfortable silence between them for several seconds before the servant crossed his arms and spoke out in a deep authoritative tone. “Are you the one who summoned me?” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Well that was a minor problem. The cocoon exploding meant that all the furniture that <em>almost</em> didn’t fly out the window very much did. All the windows blew outward, raining glass on an unknowing populace down on the streets below. Lark himself faired no better, sent flying backwards against the bar. It caught him, but not without giving way and creating a sizable dent in the side. 

The servant would see that the man that probably summoned him was probably dressed terribly for the weather that came pouring in from the outside, a deep heat that had no limits on how high it could go. With that purple button up shirt and long dress pants, it was a wonder how he lived in such a hot city. 

Geeves, meanwhile, rushed to the other side of the bar, pushing past all the strewn furniture that had the decency to stay inside. Dressed as any other person of service would be in the full suit and tie combination, they completely ignored the Servant as they bent down to aid the person currently in a daze. 

Rose, dressed the most appropriately for the weather in a simple blue shirt-and-shorts combination, would simply stand where she stood further back, eyes concentrated on the figure before her. 

“Lark, are you hurt?! Where does it hurt the most?” Geeves demanded, poking and prodding the man all over. 

The man in question looked over to their Violin, critically examining the equipment in their confused state. No apparent cracks, no chips or dents, only one string snapped. He sighed, setting the instrument down carefully before putting the bow on top. A problem for another time.

“I’m fine, Geeves!” Lark said, pushing himself off the bar. “I’ll be fine, worry not!”

“<em>Are you the one who summoned me?</em>” the figure asked.</span>

Dressed head to toe in full combat equipment, strong yet filled with an air of dignity. A perfect head of golden hair, a face unlike any other. Confidence rang out with their words, more an order than a question. 

Perfect.

“Yes sir, I am the one who called you forth,” Lark said, pushing himself off the ground and rising up quickly. The vertigo rushed to his head, causing his already forming headache to get even worse. “Ooph, too fast… Anyway. Sorry for the state of the room, I did not expect your appearance to cause quite a mess. Or any mess, for that matter. Nice cape, by the way. Tacky but you make it work well enough.”</span>

He did not show any sort of sign of satisfaction or displeasure in his surroundings nor the people around him yet. However, he did carry a perplexed air about him as he stared down at his palm, both closing and opening it repeatedly. “I appear to not be as strong as I should be, Are you a mediocre mage? Was there a complication with my summoning? Why do I feel limited?” It was apparent the rules and level of mystery had not reached the servant just yet. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark scratched his head, “Oh, uh… I thought you would just, know. Like, how the world got flooded and all the Mystery in the world just vanished, up in smoke,” He signified this with a hand gesture resembling an explosion, as well as blowing air out his mouth with puffed up cheeks. 

Geeves cleared his throat, “What I think Lark means to say is that the power level of <em>all</em> servants has been reduced, due to the Mystery within the world disappearing, as well as the ability to convert mana from the atmosphere naturally. Technology is the main reason Magecraft as a whole hasn’t died yet. Your own body is hosted within a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame due to that as well. While that may mean you are weaker yourself, the competition is weaker as well.”

Lark stared dumbfounded at his butler, “When did you learn all that? How much attention were you paying to my studies?”

“Enough to explain it properly. I do not think your summarization of events was on par with what was needed,” he said. 

“If that makes you happy,” Lark clutched his head as it started to throb, “yes, what Geeves over here said is true. It has nothing to do with my ability as a mage that makes you ‘weak’. I could be a Watermelon with magical circuits and still summon any servant that decides to heed my call. If you were not informed of that, then that may mean <em>something</em> went wrong during your summoning. So far, most if not all servants summoned are given succinct information about the time periods they are called to.” 

The musician reached down and grabbed the violin resting on the ground, placing it on the bar. After that a chair was raised and he took a seat, all of his weight pressed into the back. He looked a few years older, worn out by the magical energy being drained from his circuits. “Well, we might as well start with the basics. Do you have any idea what is going on in the current time? What floating city you find yourself in?”</span>

It did not remarking immediately to what his new master was saying merely taking it all in. As he did his mind began to process and collect all the necessary information he required for this world and its current situation. “We are presently on the floating city of Olympia, one of the more well off residences of this broken down world. This establishment is highly connected to the church and they both utilize the leylines that across the area.” A smirk appeared upon his face. “So it seems I have been brought about in the higher tier of prominence.

He was seemingly unaffected by this new servant’s soul gaze, while Geeves shuddered for only a moment before reigning in his emotions. Rose, on the other hand, glared right back at the man, not ready to back down by any means.

“Long story short, there’s a broken down city, Persepolis, that’s up for grabs between us, Olympia, and Delphi. To figure out who gets the rights to the hunk of junk, there is to be a war of sorts. A Holy Grail War. Each city fields their desired candidates and their servants and battles it out with the other city. Since I am a contestant of said war, you are as well. If you so desire a time of peace, happiness, and sunshine, then you are only guaranteed that last one.”

 The musician examined his violin idly, not sparing a second glance to the servant in front of him. “As for me, I’m Lark. Just some guy with a violin. There are dozens of people who would absolutely <em>love</em> to sing my wondrous fiddling to the high heavens, but they aren’t here to do so.” 

“Forgive me for my lack of enthusiasm, but my energy is spent for the moment. They warned me about something like this, but I didn’t think it’d be quite this draining. If you have a raging bloodlust you’d like to please, then you’ll either have to wait til tomorrow or start with yours truly,” he said.

“Lark,” Rose spoke up finally, “could you please not say things like that so casually? To reveal such a… weakness, is unbecoming of a Holy Grail War Participant. And they <em>certainly</em> do not need to know any further about your eccentricities!” She charged forward, attempting to place herself between the iron-clad warrior and the mostly helpless magus.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“I see.” The servant marched forward and placed a hand upon Rose’s shoulder and gave her a half smirk. “You my dear are wise beyond your years, and seemingly have far more sense of self preservation than this one.” He’d give a cold side glance to his master. “It is not wise to threaten someone when you have no earthly idea what they are capable of. That is a sure fire way of getting your throat slit.” He’d move even closer to the point that he was now hovering over Lark. The servant was not exceedingly massive standing at 6’4”, however, the way he held himself when compared to the loose nature of the other three made him appear like a giant looking down upon them. “I do not favor a master or knight under me that carries suicidal tendencies. If you have any intentions on winning this conflict, I’m going to have to insist you keep your head on a swivel and not put it out unnecessarily where it doesn’t belong.” There was a deep sternness to his voice, less like a father figure and more like a drill sergeant. 

Suddenly he’d give a hard pat to the side of Lark’s arm and shined and his cold stare turned into a soft grin. “If you can manage to do all that, as well as offer me the support I need on the battle field than we shall surely win. After all you are fortunate, you have brought forth one of the Greatest Leaders known to man. I am Uther Pendragon, High King of Britain and one of the greatest war generals of all time. I serve under the Lacer class. You may tell your superiors this, outside of these walls my name is to never be spoken unless we are certain privacy and away of prying ears. I assume these two here are your advisors, so they shall have the privilege of knowing as well. However…” Uther quickly turned over his shoulder to shoot visual daggers at Rose and Geeves. “If neither of them wishes to have they innards removed and replaced with rocks and dropped to the bottom of the ocean, they shall know to bide their tongue and not speak of this to anyone.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Aye aye, Father,” Lark said, giving a half-hearted mock salute to the Lancer. “And they aren’t necessarily my advisors. This fine gentleman is Geeves, my persona butler. The lass is Rose, my eldest sister. Not a word of your true name should reach the prying ears of whoever you’re worried about.”

Geeves shuddered at his finishing words, while Rose stood head strong. “My mouth know when to stay <em>shut</em>, thank you very much! You don’t become an heiress by—“

“By spilling secrets.” Lark interrupted. He got up close to Lancer and put a hand next to his mouth, “you get that position by being the first born of the family.”

“I can hear you!”

He holds up his hands, “I jest, I jest! It’s not important, what’s important is that you’ve got nothing to fear in that department.”

Geeves cleared his throat, “If you don’t mind me asking, Lancer, where perhaps is your weapon? Is it one you materialize from your own Saint Graph, or are you hiding it with illusions at the moment, or?”

Lark started moving in a circle around Lancer, poking and prodding the armor and cape. “A question I myself am wondering. I’m by no means an expert on your background and legend, but if there is a type of servant to keep their weapon hidden it would be the royal kind. Besides, I wish see the ‘big pointy stick’, as the kids would put it.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lancer only let Lark poke and prod for a little bit before he grabbed his master by the collar and hoisted off of his feet. “Listen her you slime, I do not know who you believe you are or what sort of entitlement you think you have but regardless of my connection to you or the goal of this war, not for a second will I undermine my own pride and standing for anything or anyone. If you ever talk back to me in a mocking tone again, I will end your claim of victory to this war early and end you myself and I assure you it will be quick and without warning. No glory, no grand exit, just you ending. From now on you will speak to me to the level of my station, which is King. This is your one warning, you can act the role of a jester and a fool all you want, but as sure as my claim to Camelot I will put you 6 feet under if you make me the subject of your mockery again.” He’d then toss Lark over the counter and returned to face Rose and Greeves. “It is not an unfair question at all sir, I do indeed have my weapon upon my person, I merely keep it hidden through magecraft. Although I do not necessarily require it as so, it does assist in keeping my identity secret. For the time being I’m going to keep it shrouded until, it’s prominence is required. Additionally Maiden Rose, do not for a second feel shake for inheriting wealth or power from family. Sometimes family is all we have in this world and it is oftentimes the only ones we can rely on. If family can not prop each other up, then they are indeed destined fir destruction. Do you have any other questions?” Throughout that whole exchange Uther showed a deep range. He can go from ruthless and unwaveringly bloodthirsty to a complete respectful gentleman. This man clearly had his own issues going on. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It’s not like Lark <em>didn’t</em> deserve to be thrown over the bar like a sack of potatoes. It’s also not like he <em>didn’t</em> see this line of action happening. So far this servant seemed to be the royally serious type. For a person like himself, that was more like a royal pain in the bum. The threat to put him in an unwakeable sleep, though, was… exciting, in a sense.

These thoughts and more went through his head as he landed. It hurt. Of course it did, he landed straight on his back and bonked his head on the floor. Drove the breath straight out of him, knocked his senses loose. Caused a sense of danger inside that rapidly beating heart. Epinephrine started pumping through his veins as he tried to catch his breath, eyes wide open at the ceiling.

 To casually toss someone in such a way was concerning, which left Geeves and Rose in both shock and awe. As Lancer continued on, they shared a look. Rose stole a glance at Larks landing position, then the Lancer and blinked. Geeves nodded. In a relatively short time, they had an entire conversation: they were both a little too unhinged to be with anyone else. 

A perfect pairing.

“N-no, no more questions,” Geeves said, chuckling to clear the stressful tone while taking one step backwards out of precaution.

“Nope, I’ll keep that in mind, sir--King! King, sorry.” Rose said. “But, actually, I do have one such question. Perhaps not that, more of a request. It’s a little weird, but…” she trailed off, staring deep into space somewhere in the background. 

“Please don’t, uh, do that. What you just did. The thing where you threatened him and then threw him. Or anything along those lines. Ever. I know, strange! There’s a good reason for it--very good reason. Now, you’ll never believe this, but--”

“He likes that sort of thing,” The Butler finished. “A ‘Thrill-Seeker’, if you would. There are less nice ways to put it, if you are feeling creative.”</span>

Both the people standing in front of Lancer would now turn their attention to the line of shattered windows, some remnants dusting the floor. Dim lights reflected and lit up the room, shifting with the slight breeze that blew the curtains inward. The hot air coming in reminded everyone that yes, indeed, there was a problem.

The butler sighed, turning away from the pair and walking around the bar. “I’ll notify the staff that we will be closed for the week, with <em>paid</em> time off. The landlord will surely throw a fit as soon as word gets to them.”

The master, meanwhile, had finally gotten back onto his feet. Lips pressed together, as the damage dashed any hopes of having an exciting night against the metaphorical rocks. So much for testing out the capabilities of his servant. “Well, this <em>would</em> be the part where I suggest we scout the town and look for some ruffians to warm up our combat capabilities, but this… throws a wrench into things. I guess...ugh, we’ll… clean up. And for tomorrow… window shopping. I can show you around the city while we’re out. Does that sound fine enough for a plan of events?” he asked Lancer. At least he was being nicer towards the king, instead of his earlier obnoxious attitude.</span>

For a moment all present may think that Uther simply left, but in moments after looking around the room they’d notice that all the glass upon the floor had been picked up and several of the furniture was set back up straight. That was when Lancer appeared once more in front of his master, seemingly holding a large ball of shattered glass in his gauntlets. “I hope this has sped up your recovery process. How would you like to dispose of the debris? May I suggest saving it for potential offensive traps later for our enemies.”</span>

Rose, on the other hand, was left mouth agape. “How the-- you know what? Nevermind. It’s way past the time I should be awake. I’m glad that your servant is… here. But this is too much excitement for me. If you need Father to help you with anything, you know how to reach me,” she turned away, waving goodbye to the two men present.

“Adieu, sweet Rose! And make sure Father knows of the great news!” 

Without a response, she was gone. Leaving just the two for the moment. “So… any music you like?”</span>
