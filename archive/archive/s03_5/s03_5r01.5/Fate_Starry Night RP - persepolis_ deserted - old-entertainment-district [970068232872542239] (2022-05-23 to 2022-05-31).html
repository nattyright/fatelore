Those were Caster&#39;s thoughts, anyway. It was easier than accepting that an entire generation of showbiz had come and gone in the floating city. If the magician accepted that, he would have a migraine the side of Kentucky.

Not that most people even knew what Kentucky was. If he pulled a random Servant off the sidewalk and asked them if they knew about the great US of A, a good chunk would look at him blankly, before attempting to turn him to gold or attempt to pummel him with a giant flaming sword.

It was fairly humbling.

&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Caster wept tears as he stood next to a decrepit stage that once hosted many magic shows. &quot;How could this happen? How could they do this! How could...&quot;

The crocodile tears stopped. 

&quot;How could they make it so easy for me to wow the crowds? It&#39;s embarrassing. I could pull rabbits out of hats and it would be the best show in the city! For shame, Persepolis! For shame!&quot; 

The Servant mangled the pronunciation, saying the word like Pier-see-poo-list. Any observing technicians would grimace at the brutalization of the English language.

Unfortunately, the Caster&#39;s lament was loud enough to scare the birds from the rooftops, and it that were the case, then there was bound to be somebody close behind...

Pier-see-poo-list. . . He wasn’t quite the brightest crayon in the box of crayons. That word didn’t even roll of the tongue well! But, his fake cries and grandeur emotion had been entertaining to watch. Or well, listen to. When the man had finished his grandiose lamenting, a slow clap could be heard from the back row.</em>

<em>Clap. Clap. Clap.</em>

“Bravo, bravo my good man, truly a piece of work you are! Take a bow, take a bow quickly, you should savor it when you please a crowd like this!”

<em>The voice had been one mixed of sarcasm and genuine happiness, hard to discern which was which, but it had to be the former as there was no one there. . . Until there was. It would have been hard to make out the figure had it been someone who. . . Fit the era. His heavy crown have him away first, something he carried with him everywhere though he himself wasn’t a king. Then came the clothes, how his coat had dragged against the dusty carpet floor. Filthy. No no, he was right, those planners should have been executed immediately. The architecture was god awful!</em>

<em>But how had his performance attracted such person so quickly? To say that Daedalus had sat about wouldn’t have exactly been right, but rather when he had left the poet at his main base and ventured to see the other places they had been given access to, it would have been best to see where the city and museums had been. He had work to study, to examine. How had humans evolved from their huts, his temples, and his labyrinth. They hadn’t regressed, but from the shit work he could see in the entertainment district, they hadn’t exactly. . . Progressed. When he had tried to  slip himself into the slightly ajar door of it, the birds who had been startled and made their swift exit also drew his attention. . . That and the Oscar worthy performance had been loud enough to make him take notice of someone’s voice.</em>

Grinning under his mask, he took a short bow as he sized up the new Servant.

He was tall. Taller than Caster. Additionally, he reeked of tobacco, as if he were constantly choking on a cigar. Additionally, he had a stupid hat. Caster had a gut feeling about this guy. He was an artist on the stage, and could recognize another showman.

&quot;If only me and another Servant qualify as unique, than the quality of Servants summoned must be borderline zero, like that fraud Nico Pecoraro! Nonetheless, if you find me half as impressive as that hat resting atop your noggin, I am one very happy Caster, yes sir!&quot;

Caster didn&#39;t bother trying to figure out how the king had appeared. There were so many Servants that his internal compass for Servants had been acting haywire. Unless this man was an Assassin, but that was extremely unlikely.

&quot;My friend, we are likeminded. Yes, likeminded!&quot; Caster said, bobbing his masked head, causing the feather in his cap to threaten to escape and fly away. &quot;I do believe we could make with a bit of pizzazz!&quot;

With the snap of his fingers, Caster manifested several spotlights and even a miniature revolving disco ball, which brightened the dreary hall ever so slightly.

It did nothing for the dust, however.

<em>Daedalus couldn’t help but laugh, giving him the small compliment as this person tried to reach a bit too high. His masked and fanciful appearance looked much like entertainment, a clown, but his style contrasted it. The caster’s compliment of being likeminded made Daedalus’ ears burn a bit. Another “likeminded” individual? Was he doomed to find hacks among hacks? It was like being purged by a flock of Perdix, all trying to caw and screech to grab his attention.</em>

“A gentleman of the arts, huh? You must be good if you’re performance was that well! Ha, you must be revolutionary, did you help paint? Invent? Draw? For such a snazzy man like yourself your work must have been beautiful! And to say that the servants I’ve seen are borderline zero, I have to say, they can be quite the bore. . .”

<em>His enthusiasm was more as a means to put pressure on the man. He didn’t know what he was, but those who did them were quite special. Why be a painter when you could have built a ship? Why invent when you could sculpt? The man had been snazzy, but unlike the Caster of Greece himself, he walked and talked the same!</em>

<em>The spotlights that had been made only enhanced his features, the disco ball showing its brightly strobe like lighting trying to illuminate the dust about them. It was a fun thing to see, but that was what it was. Fun. Not eye opening, not draw dropping, it was fun. The caster looked at the masked enigma. His smile not faltering, but his eyes lost their interest, almost like a pirate find that his trip buried treasure was but fake.</em>

Goodness, this man&#39;s ego was massive. Caster was a clown. Everything from his garments to his attitude was designed to amuse and befuddle. A court jester who danced to make his king laugh.

Except for the mask.  As Daedalus locked eyes with his fellow Caster, the mask struck out. It was unnerving. There was nothing behind it. A void. As they locked eyes, two pinholes of light appeared in the void, before blinking out.

Eerie.

&quot;I inspire people.&quot; Caster said, shrugging theatrically, as if he was going to do The Wave. &quot;People need a bit of joy in their lives! An <em>escape</em> from their worldly constraints and fears. Compared to great heroes like Theseus and Arjuna, I am a nobody. Compared to the great artists of the times, I escape the notice of few!&quot; Caster said, bobbing his head. 

&quot;Splendor, showmanship, and suspense! The three Ss of us mere familiars. In that regard, I am SSS tier!&quot; 

The Caster Daedalus was thinking held himself in such high esteem. It was almost infuriating. How could he compare to the great Daedalus? Most importantly, he seemed to dodge the question Daedalus put forward. What was his great talent? How could Daedalus reign supreme over someone if he didn&#39;t know what field to crush them in?

&quot;Ah, but I babble. Do you like shows, my fidus Achates?&quot;

And speaking of it, the two holes that had been approximately, were emptied only after a flicker of light had been shown. . . A small abyss of black the forward. Daedalus could feel a small tingle in his spine. Maybe he was getting old, but that definitely was strange.</em>

<em>While the caster went on about his purpose, and his purpose on the ladder of great artists, Daedalus couldn’t help but be amused by it. He had been modest, much like the poet he had met before, not having much of influence on what he did, which made the Architect quietly chuckle. A nobody! And this was what artists called themselves? When he was about to comment on it, the masked gentleman had gotten past his first amount of prattle, he gotten quite to his confidence, making Daedalus’ eyes widen. Ah, so he had thought he was a master of these things. Splendor, Suspense, and Showmanship? Could there had been someone who could have rivaled him? He was sure that he could do it, but not many had the confidence and the gall to say it but him. Now that, that deserved a clap even if he hadn’t agreed with it.</em>

“To think I’d had met someone who thought they were better than the others! You’re quite much better than my old friend, my Masked Servant!  Had we been back when I was, I’m sure that <em>she</em> would have been quick to war with you on it! But I enjoy this mindset nonetheless!”

*But who was this ‘she’? What woman could have hated when one boasted themselves over this woman? Why had this woman been quick to war. . .

With a flash, a large hoop appeared in Caster&#39;s hands, as if pulled from behind a sheet. Despite that, it was impossible to discern <em>when</em> the hoop had first appeared. One second, it wasn&#39;t there. The next, it was.

&quot;Well, what is worthy of a king as grand as yourself? I doubt you&#39;d want me to bring the place down, so I suppose we shall do something tame. Magicians pull these out of hats, if I recall.&quot;

Caster shook the ring with fervor as Daedalus watched with muted interest, waiting for the flamboyantly dressed buffoon to do something special. Nothing happened. Was the magician a fraud?

&quot;That&#39;s a bit odd.&quot; Caster looked through the ring. Much to Daedalus&#39;s surprise, the Servant&#39;s head didn&#39;t appear out the other end. &quot;Maybe that was too much of a stretch? I never used them myself, but they&#39;re as attached to magicians as Greek heroes are to killing themselves. Oh! Wait!&quot;

Caster pulled his head out right as a slew of rabbits began pouring out of the hoop. Two became four, four became eight, and the mass of floppy fiends multiplied like, you know...

Rabbits.

Soon, Caster and Daedalus were figures in a sea of various rabbit breeds. &quot;Eh?&quot; Caster said, waving his nonexistent eyebrows towards Daedalus? &quot;<strong>Eh???</strong>&quot;

Taking a small patch of cloth from his magnificent cape, he tied it around one of the rabbits, a black one with floppy ears, and snapped his fingers. Suddenly, it began to fly.

&quot;A few humble tricks, but they are mere shadows of what are to come!&quot; Caster said spectacularly. &quot;If you want to come see my show, you can use that ticket behind your ear.

Suddenly, Daedalus felt a piece of paper in the place mentioned by Caster.

Was he going to show him a magic trick? Some as childish as this? He settled back against the frame of the wall.</em>

“Something nice and special, like a king one can give me something to remember, that is all.”

<em>He graced the man with a smile, and it had lasted for two reasons, first was because it had seemed that he immediately failed, but then, to see how his head was no longer shown as he stuck his neck through the ring, it turned from a smug and confident smirk to amusement. So, this was what he had showed him, he couldn’t lie and say it wasn’t surprising. His joke elicited a chuckle from him.</em>

“So you’re a magician?”

<em>His question was drowned out by the performer’s exclamation, and soon a small thud hit the floor. And then another. . . And another. Soon, the stage had those critters, how they had multiplied by the double had been beyond him, but to see how they spilled from that loop, it was quite nice to see. But the show had not ended there, with the dramatic’s performance going on, he caused one to fly, raising above its earthly brothers and sisters. Daedalus looked at them, wondering if these critters were but familiars. There had to be a reason there were here, no? He was quick willing to pick one up himself, raising its pudgy body to examine it, trying to see if it were even real. And to see it was, Daedalus let out a laugh, a hearty one at that.</em>

An unnerving glance, a well placed word, a whisper of a greater meaning. In the end, however, the magician was what Daedalus expected: a clown. 

The rabbits continued to hop around, ears flopping about as they decided to nibble on Caster&#39;s flowing clothes. 

&quot;No! No! Stop it! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...!&quot; The Servant screamed as the critters dragged him into their midst, causing the Caster to disappear from sight. For a moment, it was Daedalus surrounded by a slew of animals, still bemused.

&quot;Yes, I do believe it is time for them to go.&quot; Caster sighed, floating behind Daedalus. How had he gotten there? With a wave of his hoop, the rabbits were sucked up. As the flying one was sucked in, Caster plucked the piece of cloth from it, and it melded back into the magician&#39;s cape.

&quot;My friend, I do all sorts of tricks. Birthday parties, weddings, fun events. The real knocker is my rates. Trust me, you&#39;d need a Holy Grail to fund a single showing.&quot; Caster joked, spinning his hat.

&quot;That ticket shall duplicate if you give it to another Servant. Hand it to them, and another will appear behind your ear. Spread the word! If I&#39;m going to win this little war our sponsors are so willing to provide, bread and circuses must be provided before I grind my foes into the dust under the weight of true <strong>pizzazz</strong>!&quot;

Rabbits? He couldn’t exactly see how that was to be so deadly, especially against those fools in the Holy Grail War. . . The poor clown would have lost so many rabbits, it almost made Daedalus feel bad. But the more he looked at the rabbit in front of him, the quieter the man had gotten u til when it was silent snd Caster’s voice had died down, he looked from the critter before him.</em>

<em>No One. Just him and the Rabbits.</em>

<em>His ear rang with the sound of someone familiar, causing Daedalus to quickly try to mask his surprise. He hadn’t done that. He had to have disappeared and done that. . . Strange. Maybe he had been wrong. Rabbits were useless, but this little amusement could have gotten an idiot to not see what was happening about him. He had let his guard down for a bit. With that same hoop, the rabbits were almost vacuumed inside it, clearing the dusty floors, even taking the special floating one with the others.</em>

“Ah, so you’re a clown for all occasions. Well, people must always make nothing into something. . .”

<em>Daedalus rose an eyebrow with how he proclaimed how he planned to won’t be war, the Architect not going to combat it. He wouldn’t argue with those convictions, rather he’d watch it to see if it were true. But, in the Clownish caster’s eyes, it seemed possible.</em>

“Well then my friend, I’ll help spread this word of this show. . . Though, I do find this plan of you winning the war quite interesting. To say such a thing, I can only hope you’re able to stay your course.”

<em>His lies had been disguised as easy truths, but, now wasn’t the time to develop enemies. He already had a poet under his watchful eye. To keep from fighting idiots so early would have been best.</em>

There will always be a seat in my shows for you! Casters are always welcome!&quot; Caster agreed, inclining his head. How did he know Daedalus&#39;s class? Daedalus hadn&#39;t done anything besides alternate between mocking grace and occasional delight.

Spectacle always knew a fellow Caster. Spectacle recognizes spectacle.

Could he win a war? Possibly. However, that was the case with every summoned Servant. A bit of luck, a touch of imagination, and a daring plan could take a Servant anywhere he wanted to go.

&quot;Ah, but I must prepare. The show is about to start. Spread the word! Spread it, and be merry. If this little trick is enough to cause you great surprise, than I suspect you will find my show a true class in both annihilation and amazement! An AAwesome show, one might even say.&quot;

Caster flew in front of Daedalus, before taking a mock bow.

&quot;However, once the show is over, even the most arrogant person on the stage will bow before the wishes of the crowd. Good day, my fellow Caster. Watch out for ferrets, celery, and bowling balls!&quot;

Suddenly, Spectacle disappeared into a slew of sparkles, before vanishing, his laughter echoing through the room and Daedalus&#39;s eardrums.

“You do that my friend, I’ll be there. Though I can only hope that the one there is able to be wow’d.”

<em>Finally, the Caster had said his goodbyes, those weird superstitions that made Daedalus roll his eyes, and his ears ring from his laughs, before leaving him alone in the entertainment district.</em>

“Strange. . . A magician, I can’t help but wonder what this show will one day be. . . I guess I’ll be giving out these tickets then.”
