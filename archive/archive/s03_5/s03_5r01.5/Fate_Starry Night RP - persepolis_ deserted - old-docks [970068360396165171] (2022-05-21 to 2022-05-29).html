The golden rays of the sun shone brightly on his face, enveloping his loosely-clad body in a gentle heat while the sea breeze pushed his long hair slightly. Staring towards the horizon with unimpressed eyes, he was momentarily absorbed in the simplicity of it all. Spacing out, lazily watching the waves rock back and forth without a care. If not for this whole mock War business, he might&#39;ve stayed here for a little while. This was nice.

Not thinking was a blessing, the man paradoxically thought. Not doing anything, not worrying about anything. Just enjoying the passage of time, relishing in one&#39;s own breathing and heartbeat without deeper meaning or insight. Merely surviving.

&quot;...I could get used to this,&quot; He whispered to no one, his eyes following the hypnotizing movement of the tide.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The familiar aura awakens memories from his first awakening in this mock war, as Olga steps behind and greets him the only way she knows how. &quot;Yo.&quot;

The arid stink from her previous encounter left behind a sense of embarrassment and glowering loathing, all of it masked behind the faux bravado that he had come to be familiar with. It was doubtful whether he would feel relief at a familiar face, or possibly disgust at the disruption of his peace.

Suppressing a scream, the man unconsciously raised a hand to his chest as he turned around, as if checking if it was still beating or not. Fortunately, the voice didn&#39;t come from an enemy. Quite the contrary, in fact, for the words belonged to the brazen woman he had come to meet soon after his summoning. The ill-mouthed monarch.

&quot;...god,&quot; He suppressed a sigh, his tranquil face now soured beyond recognition. &quot;It&#39;s just you... It&#39;s quite dangerous to startle people like that, you know. You might scare others dead, should they not have a Servant&#39;s formidable constitution to keep their hearts from stopping...&quot;

The initial shock wearing off, his expression quickly turned back to its usual gloomy state. A brief feeling of sadness washed over him as he looked back to the waters below, not a hint of his previous peacefulness remaining. What a pity. Though he was far from displeased to see a familiar, friendly face, he&#39;d be lying if he said he didn&#39;t feel the littlest bit annoyed at the moment. Really, could the princess not have picked her moment more carefully…

&quot;...anyway, I&#39;ve been holding on well,&quot; He eventually answered, taking on the sun&#39;s rays as he stared long into the distance. &quot;I met a fellow artist who was kind enough to let me share his roof, and I&#39;ve had two or three flashes of inspiration for my poems. Though I’ve somehow been able to stay out of trouble until now, I’ve a nagging feeling that this momentary peace won’t last for long.”

Turning to her, Olga would be surprised to find that a soft smile had found its way to his lips.

&quot;And you, how have you been? Was it fun spying on me unbeknownst to my knowledge? I didn’t take you for one with such free time, friend.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever it was, she couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of guilt. Guilt that she tore him away from a moment of peace. 

&quot;Well, isn&#39;t that nice. You actually made friends? I&#39;d believe that when I see it; it&#39;s a shame to find them in thr midst of a war though. Maybe you are just unlucky.&quot; She responds, taking tired and heavy steps forward, joining the Lancer in a seat by the quiet solace of the docks. &quot;...It is beautiful here,&quot; she whispers, before turning back to the question at hand. 

&quot;I could definitely be better. While you were rubbing shoulders with artists and getting buddy buddy, I had to get my hands dirty...and beaten. Mercilessly. Ugh, how embarrassing,&quot; she says, folding her head in her lap, hiding the blush sweeping across her face. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m a queen Regent! And that bastard, Lancer, he didn&#39;t even break a sweat against me. Said he needed me alive to provide data for our &quot;Masters,&quot; those nerds in the lab coats.

As such, it isn&#39;t <em>that</em> strange for me to make friends, even in the midst of a war such as this one.&quot;

He then raised a hand to her side, compassionately patting her back as if doing so would split her embarrassment amongst the two of them.

&quot;And I&#39;m sorry to hear about that brawl,&quot; More sorry about the brawl itself than her defeat, Olga could easily guess... &quot;That Lancer fellow must&#39;ve been quite the formidable opponent to brush you off, huh. Personally, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any shame in losing to the truly strong. There&#39;s more to life than just fighting and winning, you know?&quot;

That statement would&#39;ve held more weight if not for their current predicament, that of being summoned in a mock Holy Grail War for the <em>sole purpose</em> of fighting and winning, but the poet stuck true to his ideals nonetheless. Despising all forms of violence, inflicted or received, even when others around him took it for granted.

&quot;Besides, if you <em>truly</em> wish to see him dead, <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">and just as a side-note, I think that&#39;s a little messed up</span>, then you should remember he&#39;s the same as us. Bound to eventually <em>bite</em> it. Perhaps tonight, perhaps tomorrow. As a friend, I&#39;d suggest you find solace in this inevitability, and move on.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Princess wrings an imaginary neck in front of her, practically frothing at the mouth as she vents her frustrations before falling on her back. Strands of hair lay across her face, the woman only pathetically blowing them away. &quot;Same as us, I get it, but I&#39;m not like you, man. You&#39;ve got so much chill, and...I just wasn&#39;t built that way. It wasn&#39;t easy to just live and let live...if you did, you were liable to lose everything. I had to be vengeful for my people...&quot; 

She rolls over, looking up at Yorimasa, observing just how the wind caught gently against his hair. Even nature seemed to calm itself around him...

&quot;...I never really had time to experience life outside of winning.&quot; She tries looking back to any one moment where she had a quiet moment with her grandchildren, with her own son...there weren&#39;t too many moments of rest she could afford.  Had they hated her for that? 

&quot;Well, if you&#39;re such an expert, what is there beyond fighting? I don&#39;t know many Heroic Spirits that get to the throne without it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You don&#39;t hear stories about talented farmers spreading their names, nor about skillful builders attaining fame through their craft. Yet, they&#39;re the ones that allow us to live, to eat and to sleep... it’s quite unfair, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

That faint smile again. Those pitiful eyes he harbored on their first meeting, as if he was carrying the world&#39;s misery on his shoulders. This look only lasted a split second as he turned to the queen Regent, shrugging his shoulders.

&quot;I know you&#39;re not like me, friend, but does that matter? Is winning really that important <em>now</em>? You might&#39;ve felt a sense of duty when you ruled, you might’ve used spite to protect your people. But now that you are free as a Servant, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just… let go of that royal pride of yours?&quot;

But really, the poet knew as he spoke, people could rarely ever be changed easily with words. Be it violence or pride, there were things humans were painfully attached to even as they served no practical purpose to them or to those around them. A sigh left his lips as he limped backwards, falling onto his back much like the queen Regent did. It seemed his chill was slowly returning to him as his expression turned mellow, putting his hands beneath his head as he took in the full glory of the orange sky above.

Spiteful and grudge-bearing to the extreme, never taking the slightest attack on her person laying down. Yes... this sounds just like you, <em>Nue</em>.&quot;

Nostalgia flooded him as he reminisced about those times spent together, a smile extending throughout his face on the same occasion, perhaps the brightest he had ever shown thus far into the war. Those times spent with Nue felt so distant now that he laid in an abandoned dock, god knows how far away from home. Oh, how he wished he could talk to her again…

<em>Wait a second.</em>

The man suddenly scrambled on his feet, looking at his hands in disbelief...!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I am fine,&quot; He managed as he pulled himself together, inspecting hands as if he was rediscovering his own body. &quot;Do not make fun of me for saying this, but as odd as it sounds, a realization just dawned on me...&quot;

Sitting upright, he closed his eyes and focused. Instinct took over, and he felt the energy stir inside him. Something was building inside him, infinitely welling so long as he kept his focus intact. He had never gone through this motion before, yet it felt as natural as breathing once he put his mind into it. His hands joined in prayer, his entire body started twinkling. An energy unlike any he had ever felt coalesced in his body, bending to his will as he visualized the shape of a familiar friend.

&quot;...that I am... <em>a Servant</em>.&quot;

Because only a Servant could manifest such miracles upon the earth. The twinkling accelerated as the energy rose. A continuous stream of light erupted from the poet&#39;s body until finally, the sentence was spoken.

The former fell to the ground, panting heavily as he fought to keep his body from sinking any lower. His sense of balance was swept, and sweat accumulated everywhere on his body. Whatever he had done, it had cost him more energy than he anticipated.

Out of the white smoke came a creature. The limbs of a tiger, the head of a monkey, the front half of a snake as a tail. Animalistic eyes devoid of all emotion, pristine white fur enveloping its upper body, a dignified and serene posture. Everything about it felt surreal, mystical, <em>magical</em>. This was no ordinary beast, Olga could tell with ease.

Silently, the creature moved. Its paws tapped lightly on the smooth concrete as it crawled towards Yorimasa, eventually finding itself right beneath the poet. Was that the dear friend he spoke about? Was that creature... <em>Nue</em>?</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20persepolis_%20deserted%20-%20old-docks%20%5B970068360396165171%5D%20%282022-05-21%20to%202022-05-29%29.html_Files/unknown-ADE26.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20persepolis_%20deserted%20-%20old-docks%20%5B970068360396165171%5D%20%282022-05-21%20to%202022-05-29%29.html_Files/unknown-ADE26.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: unknown.png (451.38 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

It was an unusual beast, that much she could gather. There wasn&#39;t anything quite like it in all of Russia, even within their vast library of creatures that populate their stories. 

It&#39;s fine fur that underlines the varying contradictions of its body. A magical creature indeed...but one...very far...from her own beauty...

&quot;...That...is Nue?&quot; She asks, her arms shaking as she looks from the creature to the Servant, her own brow darkening as she slowly rises to her own feet. Her head swivels, sharply, and captures Yorimasa in a deep, cutting glare...

&quot;THAT THING REMINDS YOU OF ME?! TAKE THAT BACK, YOU BACKWATER BASTARD!&quot; She screeches, catching Yorimasa by his collar and shaking the man back and forth, mouth frothing as she points back at the Noble creature. &quot;What the fuck is your problem, do you need glasses or something, how the hell does THAT compare to me?! Do you not see this beauty, do you not see this rockin&#39; bod?! Take it back, you son of a bitch, take it back now!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The space he was allowed to maneuver in shrunk as the beast gained in on him, until the poet was completely trapped beneath its tiger-esque body. He abandoned the idea of standing up, limping back to the ground with a thump...

Only, Olga was having none of that. As soon as he hit the ground, the poet was yanked away, then made to sit through an earful from the loud monarch. It seemed she was displeased with the poet&#39;s previous portrayal, that of comparing her to the newly-summoned beast.

&quot;W–&quot; Yorimasa gasped, stopping mid-sentence as he was violently shaken. &quot;Wait a–&quot; Again. &quot;Just a se–&quot; Again. &quot;A seco–&quot; And again. There was no stopping her. No matter what he tried saying, the words just wouldn&#39;t come out of his chest. And he suspected that, even if they did, it would do little to ease the woman&#39;s frustration. After all, to be compared to a patchwork of animals, no matter how dignified and smooth their fur was, would surely anger any woman with the tiniest bit of self-worth...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mid flight, another boom accompanied by white smoke sounded, similarly to how the beast was first summoned. That thing that flew through the air was no longer an animal, but a…

A little girl emerged from the white cloud, her loud voice carrying throughout the empty docks with a thundering boom. She collided headfirst with Yorimasa, sending the pair tumbling for a few meters away from the queen Regent. Mimicking its first appearance, Nue once again stood on top of Yorimasa, this time with a devilish smile on its face. 

The child wore a kimono similar in style to the poet&#39;s, with flamboyant motifs etched everywhere on its cloth. Her short, messy hair flew with each hit of the ocean breeze, periodically hiding her faintly made-up eyes beneath her dark bangs. While the majority of her body looked human, Olga could see a few spots where the initial form still lingered, most notably at the hands and feet.

&quot;Missed me? Cuz I sure as hell didn&#39;t miss your sorry ass, stupid!! Gahahaha!!&quot;

Resuming the Olga&#39;s work, Nue grabbed the poet&#39;s collar and shook him violently a few times, mimicking the queen&#39;s previous gesture by pointing to her with an index that still retained the colors of a tiger&#39;s fur.

&quot;Now you tell me, who&#39;s that babe you were mingling with? Are you looking for a replacement for lady <em>Ayane</em> this soon after being summoned?!

&quot;Weeeell, I got really bored one day so I left the forest and started messing with this <em>Konoe</em> guy.

Nue lowered her head, nodding towards the poet she was laying on top of with a wicked yet carefree grin.

&quot;That is, until that gloomy guy finally stepped in!! You remember, <em>Yorimasa</em>?&quot;

But the poet wasn&#39;t responding. On further notice, it seemed the man might&#39;ve <em>fainted</em> a little. It seemed the toll of summoning Nue was great indeed, and the back-to-back shocks of getting thrown, shaken around, taking a headbutt and getting shaken some more might&#39;ve done a number on him, too. He simply laid on the ground, eyes closed, a complex expression on his face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No reaction. &quot;I think we broke him. Well, moving on. He was working as a bodyguard for that Emperor at that time, and he was also pretty good with a bow. Naturally, the Emperor eventually ordered him to shoot me down. That was when we first met.&quot;

&quot;I had met a bunch of humans by that point. Most of them looked at my regular form and reacted just like you did. With disgust, hatred and aversion... oh, and just for the record, I <em>did</em> mess with humans quite often, so it made sense for them to hate me and to start hunting me down. I wasn&#39;t mad about that, and the hate was mutual. No offense, but fuck you guys.&quot;

She grinned again, turning the poet&#39;s haed with her paws so it faced Olga.

&quot;So this guy comes in while I&#39;m having my fun, he strings his bow and... bam! Right into my chest, clean as fuck. This was a first, no one was able to hit me before him.

Olga looks down at Yorimasa, the clearly dazed Servant reeling from the combined annoying efforts of herself and this Nue. Who would have expected someone like him partaking in such violence...

&quot;And believe me, I understand...sorry about that though, it&#39;s just...well, like, look at me?&quot; Olga says, gesturing to herself and even cocking a hip to drive the point home, framing herself entirely for the young girl. &quot;You seem young, so I imagine you may have one day reached some...mmm, let&#39;s say half, of all this I got going on. But, besides the point...sorry. I know how bad humans can truly be...&quot; 

The words hang as she thinks back to the state she found her own husband in, his body mangled beyond recognition...

&quot;Anyway, what then? I can&#39;t imagine one arrow was all it took? And if that&#39;s the case, why are you all buddy with this dude?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll give you that.&quot; Nue shrugged, carelessly feeding the queen Regent&#39;s narcissism through her blunt remarks. &quot;But other than that, bzzzzzzt! Calling me young&#39;s a big mistake. I&#39;m a shapeshifter, what I look like is completely irrelevant to my age.&quot;

&quot;But moving on,&quot; She continued. &quot;As I said, this guy was clean with a bow. I&#39;m not sure how, but he managed to bring me down with a single shot. And I mean <em>down</em>, past the point where I could ever hope to escape.&quot;

She walked over to the queen Regent, making herself comfortable at her side as she examined Yorimasa&#39;s sleeping, or rather fainting face with a curious look. Her playful expression slowly left as she reminisced, leaving room for one that was much heavier. Much more serious.

&quot;I&#39;m on the ground, a complete mess. My wound is hurting like a bitch. Time slows to a crawl. My vision&#39;s blurry, and I see him walking over to me. I grit my teeth, because I know what is coming next. He&#39;s gonna finish me off while I&#39;m on the ground, still weakened by the shot he previously took...&quot;

Bringing her legs to her chest, she took a pause, quietly reliving that fateful scene in her head. For such a loud, feral child to turn so quiet. It was eerie.

…

…

Long seconds passed before Nue continued, her voice so quiet it was barely above a whisper.

&quot;...and this guy. This hopeless guy. <em>He looks at me with the most sour expression I had ever seen a human make before</em>. He apologizes profusely for shooting me down, carefully breaks the arrow and takes it out of my body, orders his retainer to bandage me and offers to let me go with a slap on the wrist as long as I stop bothering the Emperor. Keep in mind that, as he did all that, I looked nothing like a human. I was as beastly as they came, the whole patchwork shebang. And yet, he reacted as if he had just shot an innocent kid down.”

“...that&#39;s what he told me before walking off. I was speechless. I couldn&#39;t believe he had actually said that without feeling the slightest bit embarrassed. Like dude, what a fucking poser you are, Yorimasa.&quot;

She kicked the poet with her foot a few times, only for her grin to slowly return to her face. Not a malicious grin, but one that was most sincere. Compassionate, even.

&quot;<em>But he was the kindest poser I had ever met</em>. From that point forward, I stopped messing with the Emperor and I started visiting him whenever I was bored. We eventually became friends, and now I&#39;m part of his Saint Graph I guess.”

Nue’s head turned to the monarch, displaying her sharp teeth with a big, proud grin. 

“Here you go! That’s basically how I became all buddy buddy with that guy. Crazy shit, right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga takes in all of Nue&#39;s words, praises and asides in full view of Yorimasa&#39;s prone form. His kind nature was something she figured he had to have been known for, but the extent by which he conducted that kindness...this was how he was a legend. Not for his brute force...but his compassion. 

&quot;I have this sickening feeling, Nue, that...I don&#39;t deserve to be his friend.&quot; Olga whispers, standing to her full height as she gazes back across the lapping, calm waters. &quot;I hear that story, and all i can think of is how I would have killed you in that position. I wouldn&#39;t have even given you time to consider your position...in fact, I would have made sure you suffered, agonizingly, knowing full well that I killed you...&quot;

&quot;Ugh, you&#39;re right...he&#39;s a poser...and I can&#39;t help but feel less than him every time he talks. That&#39;s no way for a queen...in fact, I could <em>kill him right now after hearing that story.</em>&quot; 

Her eyes turn back to Nue, the steely gaze of a monarch crashing down as she considers how to turn the creature inside out and force Yorimasa to watch. How she could simply tear down his facade and show him how foolish he was to let his guard down around her...

&quot;...But I can&#39;t. Not, like, I couldn&#39;t...I totally could...but I can&#39;t bear to take someone like him out of this. Who knows what the end of this war can bring, if you can even call it that. But I just...I don&#39;t want him gone before the end.&quot;

&quot;...Nue, it&#39;s probably super cheap to ask, so, like, please don&#39;t judge me...but...do you think he makes you a better person?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To claim so frankly that she would&#39;ve killed her if she was in the poet&#39;s shoes, completely disregarding the consequences of her words as if she was some kind of untouchable deity. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, proceeding to tell how she could&#39;ve <em>killed him</em> right here and now just because she felt belittled by the story she was told. How bold. <em>How fucking bold</em>. What the fuck was that woman thinking, threatening her only friend right to her face? Nue&#39;s eyes briefly turned animalistic as the regent Queen spoke her piece, her jaw clenching and her muscles flexing in anticipation for what was to come.

...only, Olga&#39;s very next words knocked the tension right out of her body. She stopped, taken aback, peering intently at the monarch through her bangs.

&quot;...what?&quot; She blurted, scratching her head in confusion. &quot;What the hell did I just listen to? Okay, hold on, one second. You said a lot of things, and I don&#39;t think I understood everything correctly. Just let me process all of this for a second...&quot;

Standing up, Nue hesitantly pointed to Olga, then to Yorimasa, mumbling to herself as she tried making sense of what was just spoken.

&quot;Okay... so you just said you could&#39;ve killed him, which, by the way, real fucking nice of a &#39;friend&#39; to say, but then you don&#39;t want to anymore? <em>You want to protect him now?</em> What the hell are you trying to say, girl. I don&#39;t follow.&quot;

Humming as she thought aloud, Nue paced back and forth for a few seconds, a complex expression on her face.

I never asked myself that question before. From what I gather, it just seems to me like you&#39;ve got a few insecurities to sort out. I can&#39;t help you with that, you&#39;re gonna need to sort that shit yourself.&quot;

A mixed, barely helpful take. Unsurprising, considering who delivered it. A beast in human form, lacking a little awareness when it came to human feelings. Probably not the best person to ask these kinds of questions in hindsight.

&quot;Finally, does he make me a better person... yeah... I don&#39;t know either. That thought never crossed my mind. It&#39;s not like I hung out with him because of ulterior motives, you know? I was just doing what I wanted. But now that I think about it carefully, if he made me a better person...&quot;

She furrowed her brow as she tried recalling those memories spent together, mumbling to herself again with her arms crossed, deep in contemplation

&quot;...eh, I guess so. I stopped messing with that Emperor guy after he shot me, that&#39;s gotta count for something. But other than that, I don&#39;t know what to tell you.

I dunno about all of that. Would I have done anything differently? Hell no. From what I can gather, I can handle almost any Servant&#39;s story way more tactfully. What I&#39;m trying to say...is that maybe this war isn&#39;t worth putting all this effort into. Maybe I can throw the guy a bone...maybe take him to the end. I imagine both of you wouldn&#39;t mind spending a little longer in this world. And...well, I&#39;m a queen, not a tyrant. I do good by people. And yall can be my people. That&#39;s free shots and all, girl.&quot; 

Olga&#39;s bravado had slipped. Even Nue saw through it, able to pierce through to the heart of the problem. Everything always had to have an underlying motive, didn&#39;t it? Why couldn&#39;t she just be nice? Well, you don&#39;t get anywhere just by being nice, dammit. That&#39;s what got her own killed...her poor Igor...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-978783316486541372 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=978783316486541372><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-May-22 08:15 AM">08:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...I wouldn&#39;t have done anything differently. But I also can&#39;t help but wonder what this dork would have done,&quot; she says, gesturing to Yorimasa as she crosses her arms. &quot;I lost someone...very close to me. I didn&#39;t weep. I didn&#39;t cower. I just took that frustration and used it. I took it and forced those that took that person away to <em>suffer.</em> Yeah, it was boss. I even enjoyed it a little...but that didn&#39;t really change much by the end...I just had to live for that person rather than with them...&quot;

&quot;And...well...he&#39;s cool, in his own dorky way. So I&#39;d rather win <em>with</em> him, you know? Not for him. I can&#39;t do that shit again.&quot; 

She turns back to Nue, rolling her eyes as she sits next to the creature once more, reaching into her shirt to pull out a mana battery, the bright blue liquid casting an eerie glow on the strange party. She grimaces before popping the sucker in her mouth, shuddering at the flow of mana that started permeating her Core. &quot;Don&#39;t tell him I used one,&quot; she says, lying on her back and riding out the brief nausea. &quot;I don&#39;t know if he does worry, but I&#39;d rather not trouble him with it. So yeah, I&#39;ll stick around. Someone has to look over this pacifist...oh God, it&#39;s gonna be hard isn&#39;t it, keeping him safe...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pretty fucking expensive for what you&#39;re getting, if you ask me. I’m not sure he’s worth the hassle.&quot;

…Nue didn&#39;t fully comprehend it. The queen Regent&#39;s awkward fascination with the poet. In Nue&#39;s case, Yorimasa had shown mercy. He was the reason she was able to continue living, both back then and now through his Saint Graph. She owed him her life in more ways than one, and he did her justice by fully accepting her despite her dubious background. That was a big deal for Nue. Realistically, few people would have accomplished the same outrageous feats as the poet. Even fewer would&#39;ve done them through their values alone, without any ulterior motives.

Taking all of that into account, it made sense why Nue would follow and trust the poet to this extent. But to Olga, <em>what had he done that compared to all that</em>? Just what had gotten her so invested in such a peace-loving idiot, to the point where she would risk her life just to further his? Did his funny antics really justify going to such lengths? Did she feel driven to place her faith in something else because of regrets from her past life? There was no way to tell for sure, and Nue couldn&#39;t fully comprehend the logic behind it all. Maybe there wasn&#39;t one to begin with. 

&quot;...there&#39;s no growing up for me to do,&quot; Nue eventually broke the silence. &quot;We&#39;re different, you and me. I just don&#39;t dwell on shit as much as you do, it ain&#39;t my style.&quot;

She looked at the Princess, jokingly punching her thigh as her usual grin found its way back to her face.

I can at least respect someone&#39;s wish to extend his, and in turn, <em>my</em> life... though, with one Mana battery down, it isn&#39;t you who should be doing the protecting. I won&#39;t tell you what to do, but like, if I were you, I&#39;d keep a low profile for a day or two.&quot;

Collapsing on the floor next to her, she watched as the last remaining rays of the sun made their way to Persepolis. Night would soon fall, marking a day since the Servants&#39; summoning. Already a day had passed, and maybe a couple more were left before she would inevitably vanish, depending on how quickly Yorimasa exhausted his stock of Mana batteries. Quite the depressive thought, all things considered. For her life to end so quickly when, how to say this... as he put it, she could’ve gotten used to this.

&quot;...knowing him, he does worry,&quot; Nue eventually added, turning on her side to face the monarch with a casual expression. &quot;I won&#39;t tell, because I don&#39;t care nearly as much. But like, if you hang on for long enough, I might start worrying too. You wouldn&#39;t disappoint a little girl by biting it early, would you? That kind of childhood trauma is what turns kids to monsters when they grow up, you know?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lie low? Keep her head down? She may be in this Assassin container, but have the words &quot;Queen&quot; and &quot;Regent&quot; meant nothing to this...very annoying and very brutally honest...

<em>Friend.</em>

&quot;Like I said, I&#39;m a queen, Nue. And as a Queen, I have work to do. Can&#39;t afford to take it easy. You know how many of these lap dogs are gonna drink up the chance to slice a poet in half? Hell, I would. So I&#39;ve gotta do my part, soooo...let&#39;s work together then.&quot; 

Olga follows Nue&#39;s gaze, looking out across the glittering water, watching the blood orange rays slowly diffuse into slathers of violet. Night...her time to make her move. Another day where they both might stay alive. 

&quot;Sorry, pint size. I&#39;m the queen of disappointment...and it&#39;s time I get going. <em>Dasvidaniya.</em>&quot; 

She recedes into the shadows, the silvers of her garment and cloak the last speck of light that slowly dwindled and faded among the spreading blanket of twilight stars overhead. All of this for a poet...

<em>She used to love poetry. Back when Sviatoslav would write them for his dear, queen mother.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nue lazily waved her arm goodbye as the Assassin made her exit, purposefully looking to the other side.

Getting up, Nue walked over to the poet&#39;s unconscious body, using it as a chair as she watched the stars fall on the shore with a meaningful face. Humans were nasty creatures. Egotistical, profiteering, malignant creatures that Nue had no remorse feeling disgusted over.

...but maybe some of them were decent, after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
