Whoever had put it there had placed it there ham-fistedly, as if there were a dozen more to be placed and wanted to get it done as quickly as possible, before their lunch got cold. Whatever was the case, the frame was already covered in a thin coat of dust.

The circle glowed to life, and the blank slate of a frame began to change, the <em>wash me</em> vanishing as well, a tragic end to the last bit of human contact this Servant would have for a while.

<strong>Class Designation: Rider, proposed.</strong>

A mysterious... gentleman.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02-May-22 03:42 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20persepolis_%20test%20site%20-%20dummy-labs%20%5B970068279165079592%5D%20%282022-04-29%20to%202022-05-20%29.html_Files/unknown-F5139.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20persepolis_%20test%20site%20-%20dummy-labs%20%5B970068279165079592%5D%20%282022-04-29%20to%202022-05-20%29.html_Files/unknown-F5139.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: unknown.png (606.4 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME TO INTROUDCE THE GREATEST SHOWMAN WHO HAS EVER LIVED!&quot; Caster spread his arms as far as they would go despite the cuffs, expecting the sound of uproarious applause to assault his eardrums.

Instead, a rat squeaked at him.

&quot;Hm?&quot; Caster said, inclining his head and looking around the confined room. The only things that could remotely be considered an audience were the rat and a few empty milk cartons.

This was not a grand stage, either. Was that <em>dust</em> on the ground? Caster hiked up his clothes of <em>spectacle</em> nervously. He had just had these laundered. They were not going to become glorified dust magnets.

&quot;Now this isn&#39;t the opening I anticipated I desired, either!&quot; Caster protested towards the rat, which hissed and ran off. His only audience member had barely given him the time of day!

&quot;This is—&quot; Caster began, before tilting his head like he had received a transmission. A frown formed behind his mask. This information... what? This wasn&#39;t right, was it?

&quot;I see. A Holy Grail War, huh? I would rather pass. I am an entertainer, not a fighter! However...&quot; Caster scratched his chin slightly. &quot;The winner probably receives something spectacular. How does that saying go? &#39;Winner winner, chicken dinner?&#39; Well, I am quite hungry. All the others will dine on <strong>spectacle</strong> and I will dine on the greatest <strong>chicken dinner</strong> the world has ever seen!&quot;

Suddenly, the handcuffs on his arms collapsed off, and Caster huffed. &quot;Phooey, I could&#39;ve gotten out of them myself. No fun allowed, I suppose.&quot;

Caster looked around to survey his surroundings. It looked as if he had been haphazardly stuffed into a broom closet. When he manifested, the door had been flung off, and Caster was now in what seemed to be a generator room. He looked around, and sniffed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-970377661329326100 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=970377661329326100><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-May-22 03:34 AM">03:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Well, phooey!

Caster snapped his fingers, and all of a sudden, a massive sign appeared above the dummy labs.

<em><strong>The Most Spectacular Magic Show in Persepolis! (Help Wanted)</strong></em>

&quot;That should do it!&quot; Caster clapped, before waving his arms around, altering the building around him.

&quot;<strong>I understand that victory comes first, but it&#39;s all about the bread and circuses. My fellow Servants should get a smidge of entertainment, first!</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At first the claps where a quiet echo, but every second they would get closer. The sound of light footsteps would soon accompany the growing claps. If caster followed the sound with his eyes he&#39;d see an old sickly man repeatedly smacking his hands together. It seemed that the magician had his first customer already. 

&quot;Rumor has it there&#39;s a show happening here.&quot; The old man spoke, his voice comically high pitched and certainly unfit for his decreped appearance. 

&quot;I too arrived only a moment ago. Oh you didn&#39;t miss much tho&quot; the man said with a giggle. &quot;How bizzare it is to walk, but it is a blessing. With these new legs of mine I walked all the way to this show of yours, now isn&#39;t that really something.&quot; The servant laughed to himself once more. What was so amusing about having working legs? Only Mimir could understand what he found amusing, afterall his burden of knowledge made the oddest things entertaining. 

Mimir would grab a dusty chair from the corner of the lab as he spoke, planting it firmly in front of caster. Mimir would take his seat holding his hands to the floor, two large sunflowers would sprout from the concrete looking the magician in the face as if the plants where grinning. An audience was needed for a good show afterall.

&quot;Oh please greatest showman, would you put on a show for this old man?&quot; Mimir looked patiently at the servant before him. His spectacular flair had caught the Aesir&#39;s attention. If Mimir loved one thing it was a good show.

As expected, Caster was as brilliant of a businessman as he was back when he was alive! Within mere seconds of being open for business, he had already attracted the grubbiest old man in all the land. Instinctively, Caster lurched back slightly, before leaning forward towards Mimir.

Ah, the fated old man smell! Mothballs and chicken soup. A dastardly Noble Phantasm, perhaps? How was a Servant <em>just</em> summoned and already reeking slightly? Did <em>he</em> smell like that? 

&quot;Of course, old one! My shows are meant to be observed by one and all. Yet that beard...&quot; Caster leaned forward towards Mimir, mask obscuring Spectacle&#39;s face, and producing a simple pair of handcuffs.

Was this the trick? Was he going to <em>arrest</em> Mimir?

&quot;One.... Two... Three...&quot; As Caster spoke, extra chain links were added to the cuffs, increasing their length to comical proportions.

&quot;Sixty-nine chain links! That&#39;s quite impressive, old timer! You must relay your beard-grooming techniques to me! Since your beard is longer than thirty links, your show will be on the house!&quot;

That would have been far more enticing if Spectacle&#39;s territory had been established, but oh well. Couldn&#39;t win them all. Maybe he should have put up the sign last...

&quot;And of course, that house is <strong>PIZZAZ!</strong>&quot;

Caster snapped his fingers, before vanishing in a flurry of sparkles. Suddenly, he appeared next to Mimir, wrapped up in the old man&#39;s astonishing beard hair. Even Mimir could see that it was elegantly tied into a slew of various interlocking knots, preventing anybody from escaping. A Servant&#39;s beard hair was very potent.

Caster waggled his nonexistent eyebrows towards Mimir, before slowly untying the god&#39;s beard. With each knot that was untied, a slew of sparkles erupted.

&quot;Pizzaz...!&quot; Caster whispered, untying the last knot.

What a magnificent trick.  The chain links where an amateurish trick, surely Mimir could do that one himself. However, Casters slight of hand was truly impressive. To tie Mimirs massive beard so quick and without Mimir even noticing. 

&quot;A truly impressive trick youngin. Keep practicing and you just might rival the great Houdini himself, ho ho ho hoo&quot; 

Mimir grappled at his beard pulling it closer to inspect the hairs. All of the knots had really been untied. &quot;For that extra pazzaz and putting the show on the house, you have earned my facial hair grooming secrets.&quot; Mimir dropped his beard letting it fall back onto the dusty old floor. 

&quot;The secret to my beard is simple young magician, and that secret is nothing&quot; Did caster hear Mimir right? How could someone grow such a long beard while doing nothing. Surely they would trip and fall. &quot;Sit with your head upon a kings throne for a thousand years, and then you just might have such luxurious hair!&quot; 

&quot;Ah but in return for my secret, please feel free to tell me one of your own. I am collector of secrets and to hear them is always a delight.&quot;

Ha ha.&quot; Caster said drily, sparkles flying between his fingers. This old man was smart, but also a complete and utter wise guy.

It grated on him, slightly.

&quot;I see. I see. So your secret technique is to get locked in a retirement home for decades! Truly, that is commendable! Even better, it is <em>spectacular</em>!&quot;

Caster vanished into a slew of sparkles, before appearing behind Mimir. He poked the god&#39;s body. He teleported in front of Mimir, before staring at him. Caster&#39;s mask was alluring, not even showing an inch of skin. His eyes glowed brightly for a moment, and suddenly Caster began to chuckle.

&quot;I have no secrets, sadly. I am just your average street magician, building my brand name and making ends meat. You know how it is! Ahaha!&quot; Caster chuckled, wagging a finger.

&quot;However... You on the other hand. That&#39;s quite the interesting body you have there. That&#39;s not an illusory trick, nor is it the real article. What interesting Magecraft! How <em>spectacular!</em>&quot;

If the body was fake, at least Mimir&#39;s beard was genuine. Thank goodness. Caster could rest easy.

Perhaps the magician was not such a huge fan of being compared to Houdini. 

&quot;Oh, dear magician, everyone has secrets. The difference is whether or not they tell me themselves. No matter how good of an escape artist one may be, they can never truly escape this head of mine... Well except for my body I suppose hoo hoo&quot; 

The chuckling old man would then grab his head, twisting and pulling until it popped clean off his body. The head rested between his two hands. Despite being ripped straight from his neck there was no blood, the head had been removed with no damage to the body. 

&quot;This body is fake, but worry not the beard is real. I suppose my situation is quite... spectacular&quot; Mimir giggled once again taking the word spectacular as his own. Something about the magician had made Mimir overly giddy today. Perhaps it was also the excitement of being able to walk again. 

&quot;Ah magician you have made this old man laugh a good bit.&quot; Mimir spoke as he reattached his head. &quot;I would like to repay you with a great gift. Either now, tomorrow, or whenever you wish, ask me a question. I will give you only one. But ask me any question you desire an answer to, and I shall give it.&quot;

Marvelous!&quot; Caster chuckled at his own wit, before deflating at Mimir&#39;s gift.

Any question? Any? Immediately, Caster&#39;s thoughts rushed at the thought of knowing this week&#39;s lottery numbers. Oh, there was so much for Caster to ask! What was behind door number three? What was in the box? What was the answer to The $64,000 Question? Why had he manifested as a Caster, instead of a Rider?

Options, options, options! Assuming, of course, that this was correct. Caster shrugged. even if it wasn&#39;t, it was no biggie. This was simply an extra bonus, though he did wonder why this old geezer was willing to play so fast and loose with his wisdom. Maybe there were a few screws loose in his decapitated floating head.

&quot;I see! That is quite a wonderful thing to hear I will be sure to word things as statements whenever you&#39;re around, then. I wouldn&#39;t want to waste such a boon on something meaningless, haha!&quot;

Maybe, but those winning lottery numbers were beginning to look very appealing.

&quot;Ah, it is truly a shame, old man. If you had been a bit slower, I could have showed you true <em>spectacle</em>!&quot; Caster beamed, delighted that Mimir was beginning to see the wonders of pizzazz and spectacle. 

&quot;I was no magus in life, sadly. It takes me a while to construct a stage capable of showing off a true magic show... If I must be frank, I am surprised you did not attempt to stab me in the back.&quot;

&quot;However...&quot; Caster&#39;s mask gleamed. &quot;<strong>That would not be very interesting.</strong>&quot;

Mimir was an odd fellow, amused by trivialities and displays of magic, yet he was clearly a powerful entity with lots of power.  He laughed at odd things. Yes, if there was one thing Caster could say for certain, it was that Mimir was a strange one.

It would not be interesting in the slightest. A man such as myself has no interest in the serious paltrys of life.&quot; Mimir stood up form his chair stretching out and cracking his back on each vertebrae. For a fake body it definitely looked and sounded like a real one. 

&quot;Oh and do not worry about your question, it is only the least I can do. There was a time when my wisdom was the most sought after thing in all of the realms. But one question is not so much, infinite knowledge is temptation, no one is satisfied with just one! oh ho ho ho hooo!&quot; Mimir chuckled violently as he reminisced on his past. He was as eager to talk about his life as an old man telling war stories. Most notably Mimir unlike the caster before him, cared little about concealing his true self. Was this an act of self confidence, or a stupid lack of concern? Possibly it was something more. 

&quot;And do not worry Magician. You have talent, an eye for entertainment, you do so all on your own hard work. That is much more impressive then any magus whipping up a few fancy runes&quot; the old god would approach one of the two flowers he had previously grown placing his hand on it&#39;s center. The plant would twist and contourt, it&#39;s leaves growing large and vines sprouting behind him. 

&quot;If you&#39;d like I could build you a stage. Show me an even greater trick, and I can offer you something better then I did before. It must be truly spectacular though.&quot;

Hmm... Caster weighed the pros and cons. His stage was fairly spectacular, assuming he could finish it, but judging from how quickly this old geezer had found him, it was beginning to look like he would be caught with his cape down multiple times.

Besides, he could always retool whatever Mimir made if it did not suit his tastes. Caster nodded to himself, it was a deal!

&quot;You&#39;ve got it, Mister Floating Head. I have a trick so dazzling, so spectacular, that it&#39;ll win every prize you&#39;ve got rattling around in that bobblehead of yours. One second...&quot; Caster cupped his hands, and a pair of fluffy pink earmuffs appeared in his hands. 

&quot;May I?&quot; Without waiting for an answer, he fixed the fluffy earmuffs over the God of Wisdom&#39;s head. If he was saying anything, Mimir couldn&#39;t hear. There were no lips for him to read.

However, suddenly Mimir felt a sentence of power spill forth from Caster.

&quot;▅▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅&quot;

Then everything vanished. Suddenly, Mimir was standing in a pool of spring water. Immediately, it was clear what he was standing in. This was a spring of water that the famed tree Yggdrasil drank from. The same well of wisdom that Odin had once drank from.

Mimir&#39;s well.

It was an extremely faithful recreation, and was perfect to Mimir&#39;s flawless storage of knowledge. Whatever Caster was, it was as if he had been there alongside Mimir, floating about in that well for an eternity.

Suddenly, a voice boomed:

&quot;<strong>What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three at night?</strong>&quot;

It would seem that the magician had a truly spectacular trick up his sleeve.

&quot;Oh how magnificent!&quot; Mimir exclaimed. He circled around for a moment looking at the scenery. It was a perfect recreation of old memories. &quot;Oh what simple times it was my dear M&#237;misbrunnr. To think my nephew would give an eye for an ounce of your succulent waters&quot; Mimir giddily clapped as he reminisced on the days of old.

Mimir stepped back from his warm memories to once again become enveloped in the show. The god scratched his head. Such an old riddle, surely every highschooler would be able to answer that one. &quot;I hope you do not intend to trick me with a riddle as simple as the Sphinx&#39;s hoo hoo. Why the answer is of course &#39;a man&#39;!&quot;

Did Caster know Mimir&#39;s true name? It wasn&#39;t like it was much of a secret, given that he was just a head. Yet did he know enough about Mimir&#39;s past to create such a high quality reproduction?

Heck, did he even <em>know</em> any riddles? Caster seemed more like the type of guy to throw a pie in your face while you think of the answer to one.

&quot;So this is what Yggdrasil is like? Hm. Thought it would have been bigger.&quot; Caster said, suddenly appearing behind Mimir. It was clear he was smiling behind the mask, extremely self-satisfied with his work.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, this place won&#39;t bite. It&#39;s based on your past. Your perception. Your dreams. The best shows are the ones the audience makes for themselves!&quot; Caster beamed, before looking pointedly at Mimir.

Suddenly, the Servant was floating, inspecting the walls, and the water itself. &quot;M&#237;misbrunnr? Oh, I see. I see. You&#39;re that old windbag from Norse mythology. Mimir, right? That has a nice ring to it! You could have your very own magic show: The Magnificent Mimir! You&#39;re quite famous among northern magi, I&#39;ve heard.&quot;

Caster floated down to Mimir&#39;s level, hiking up his clothes so they didn&#39;t get soggy in Mimir&#39;s wisdom juice.

The Aesir strokes his beard pondering his potential mistake. 

&quot;Oh ho ho. Even if it&#39;s just a memory it is still very impressive. You&#39;ve shown this old man a good memory. You should&#39;ve seen me in my prime. People would give an arm and leg to even try and drink from here!&quot; Mimir laughed with a much more sadistic tone then usual. The strange old man would appear even stranger. Did he find suffering funny or the was it the reasons people chose to suffer? 

&quot;Oh no need to speak so highly of me Magician.&quot; The god replied waving his hand towards caster&#39;s face. &quot;I did at one point put on magic shows for the children. Oh Odin was a cute little rascal I tell you.&quot; 

Mimir bit his lip for a moment. His friendliness was true and he had no intentions on harming caster. However, Mimir was the observant kind. He scratched his head at the realization that the voice speaking riddles must have been different then Caster himself. Afterall the voice knew Mimirs identity before the magician. 

&quot;Although, I must ask... Is there more to this trick?&quot; Mimir gave a cold stare at Caster. Was Mimir not impressed?

The tail end of his cape drooped slightly into the water, though he didn&#39;t seem to notice.

Mimir&#39;s serious tone seemed to spark worry in his fellow Caster&#39;s attitude. He looked around the tree, as if self-conscious. Was it really that bad? It wasn&#39;t his greatest trick, and he preferred classic shows, but this was a pretty neat ability!

&quot;Um... No. It&#39;s normally a lot more... What&#39;s the word?&quot; Caster snapped his fingers. &quot;<strong>Murder-stabby.</strong> If I weren&#39;t here with you, it&#39;s extremely likely that this Reality Marble would be a lot more aggressive. Even then, it won&#39;t kill you, but even then...&quot;

Caster held up a slew of fingers, counting off the syllables. &quot;That would be very bad. It&#39;s much better to simply use this place as a stage. It has other uses, of course, but I digress.&quot;

Was this water really that valuable? Caster had an interest in Mimir&#39;s Wisdom Water (Only 3.99 a pop!), but this couldn&#39;t recreate the water&#39;s ability to bestow wisdom. Yet the taste should still be intact...

Dipping a finger into the water, Caster&#39;s finger phased through his mask. Minty! With a hint of cloves. He didn&#39;t want to know where Mimir got his ingredients, but this water tasted pretty swell.

&quot;Shame I can&#39;t take this water with me when I leave. It&#39;d make an excellent refreshment to offer Servants as their eyes and ears are assaulted by the razzle dazzle and flair. What say you, old man?&quot;

Truth be told he thought the trick was pretty neat. It seemed to be deeper then smoke and mirrors, a noble phantasm was possibly at work. This docked a few points in the God&#39;s mind, however, the recreation of M&#237;misbrunnr was one to one. It was better then any of the infinite memories and wisdom the servant carried in his head. 

&quot;Hoo hoo hoo!&quot; Mimir let out an abrasive chuckle. &quot;Do not be so down my magical friend. I&#39;m only pulling your leg. The trick is magnificent! Although I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t want to see the &#39;stabby stabby part&#39; hoo hoo. But that&#39;s best saved for another time I suppose.&quot; Mimir had a large grin on his face, seeing the abilities of other servants first hand was exhilarating. Mimir would always choose to see something first hand then to search it out in his infinite knowledge. 

&quot;Oh a refreshment not so much friend. The burden of these waters is great. With the wisdom of this well the finer aspects of life become muddled. There is no joy in learning the finer parts of living, you already know the all of the truths to be had afterall. I&#39;d prefer this wisdom to be only my burden for the rest of time. Oh but please if someone is willing to sell an arm and a leg, or a fancy magic trick, I&#39;m willing to share just a little bit of my insight!&quot; Mimir replied to Caster&#39;s passing joke with a rather serious response. Perhaps this was a subject that Mimir had thought on for quite some time. Afterall being just a head allowed for a great deal of reflection.

As fun as bedazzling audiences with wonderful parlor tricks and flashy lights was, the magician&#39;s primary mission as a summoned Servant was to win this false Holy Grail War, or experiment by the Republic. Logically speaking, it was best to let Mimir perish within this Reality Marble, and go on with his day, and yet...

There was no value to be had. Murdering an audience went against Caster&#39;s entire foundation as a magician. He was shrewd, both in life and now, but meaningless assault was pointless. Mimir wasn&#39;t attacking, and maybe the two could divide and conquer. 

Assuming Mimir was interested in winning, at least. Caster wasn&#39;t quite sure. Maybe he was just in it for the ride?

&quot;You&#39;re a smart guy, magic man.&quot; Caster said, wiping his covered forehead. &quot;I am going to deactivate this Reality Marble now, in order to avoid the strain. If I start to sweat, than the illusion is tarnished.&quot;

With that, Mimir&#39;s well faded, and the two were back in a very dusty laboratory. Caster took a deep sigh of relief, glad that his reserves of magical energy were still fairly full.

&quot;If you want more tricks, you&#39;ll have to wait in line, my good god! Tricks are fun and opulent, but an overdose of pizzazz hurts the spectacle in the long run. Don&#39;t want those dopamine sensors to get overloaded!&quot; Do gods even have dopamine hits? Caster wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to find out.

&quot;So...&quot; Caster waggled his nonexistent eyebrows towards Mimir. &quot;You satisfied, Mister Mimir? I&#39;m willing to trade a secret for some wisdom. Maybe a <strong>True Name</strong>, hmmmmm?&quot;

Goodness, what was he doing? Did he get caught up in the mood of the conversation?

If he lost a leg or an arm, it&#39;d be fairly difficult to perform a few tricks. Item Construction didn&#39;t cover entirely new limbs in the face of dismemberment. He&#39;d need to petition the Throne for a larger variety of items.

Did he seriously want to go through with this, though? Revealing his True Name almost felt like a massive show-stopper. If Mimir blabbed, that would not be ideal. Yet if the Caster was loose-lipped, maybe it would build brand awareness. Besides, wisdom for something that would get revealed eventually anyway?

What a bargain!

&quot;Alright, Magic Man. Allow me to state the obvious:&quot; Caster said, floating conspiratorially close to the old man.

&quot;▅▅ ▅▅▅▅ ▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅.&quot;

Silence, before a storm of confetti burst from the ceiling, along with some party horns. Caster beamed. 

&quot;Tada! What a twist! A spectacle for one and all!&quot; Caster danced slightly, before snapping his finger. &quot;Tell me, God of Wisdom. <strong>Does my greatest show have yet to come?</strong>&quot;

His first day here and things where already interesting. Mimir took a moment of silence to absorb the servants name. &quot;No wonder you have such skill!&quot; Mimir excalimed his hands clapping together. 

&quot;Do not worry, your secret is safe with me. Afterall I&#39;m not in the business of giving out information for free hoo hoo&quot;.

 Mimir once again paused in thought, it was time for him to deliver on the deal. His eyes closed as he dug deep into the depths of his mind. To see the future was out of Mimirs sight, however, wisdom was not to know the future but to apply ones knowledge and experience to it. The god ran through everything in his head to answer the magicians vague question. After a minute of silence Mimirs eyes would flick open

&quot;I cannot see the future for certain, but listen close when I say my wisdom is the best in all of the realms. For you there is certainly great things to come. I suspect the trials you encounter here will become and opportunity for the greatest of shows&quot;

&quot;Hehehe...&quot; A laugh rang out, quiet yet menacing. &quot;Hehehehahahahahaha! How spectacular! What a delicious dream of dreadful delight! Thank you, Mimir. Being summoned is a strange feeling. Your words gladden me!&quot;

Truth be told, he did not need Mimir&#39;s guidance. It was not required.  Even if the God of Wisdm declared that it was not possible to create a show grander than the ones from his time of life, Caster would have to try.

Confirmation, however, was always nice.

&quot;You&#39;ve given this masked magician dancing on a tightrope a bit of joy. I am feeling a bit drained from the release of my Noble Phantasm, however.&quot; Caster&#39;s lifeless mask gleamed. 

&quot;Could you...&quot;

&quot;<strong>Help me with my grand stage, as promised?</strong>&quot;

The magician had truly appreciated Mimirs wisdom. Such joyus reactions was one of the things the Aesir looked forward to. 

&quot;Please, no thanks are needed, to dispense wisdom is just my job&quot; Mimir replied with a laugh. &quot;And yes I can&#39;t forget about that stage I promised!&quot; 

Mimir would bend down grasping the plants that he had created beforehand. The roots of the plants would crawl out of the ground, squirming their way past Caster. The roots would grow thick and woody, coiling around each other to build a wooden stage. The stage was of normal size but that was pretty much all that was normal about it. The wood was dark and smelt like pine, each board of wood was constructed from a tube like wooden vine. Each end of the stage was lined with cloudberry bushes. The Norse influence in the design was clear. 

&quot;I hope that will be a good foundation. If there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like added or any renovations, please let me know. I always make good on a promise afterall hoo hoo&quot;

Roots fused together in a form of artistic symphony. Caster was not an architect in life. He was no artist. He wasn&#39;t even a creatively driven person. He was a simple showman. 

As a result, he could tell that this was of excellent quality. Mimir did not go back on his word.

Breathing in deeply, Caster took in the smell of pine and nature, a breath of fresh air compared to a lab of dust and manmade contraptions. This wasn&#39;t an issue—Caster was acclimated to urban sprawl—but a rustic stage sounded fairly interesting. Plus he could modify it for himself, hopefully.

What did Mimir think of the modern world? He had a few screws loose, and probably thought that Seven Flags™️ was the greatest thing since Wonder Bread.

&quot;Magnificent! Marvelous! Mimirtastic~!&quot; Caster cried, so excited that sparkles burst from various parts of his clothing. He turned to the Norse god.

&quot;This is truly an excellent start. Thank you, old man. You&#39;ve given this humble stage performer something magical. I understand you did it as part of our arrangement, but I must thank you! Hold on...&quot;

Caster made a grand show of checking his pockets, pulling out various joker cards to Ymir themed scarves to meters of handcuffs. &quot;Where is it...? Oh!&quot; 

His arm elongated, plucking a card from the Norse God&#39;s beard. No, not a card—a <em>ticket</em>.

The magician passed it to the god. 

&quot;With that special <strong>Show Pass™️</strong>, you won&#39;t have to take the same routes as everyone else. Front row seats, of course. A gift, and a testament to our mutual friendship. Until we&#39;re forced to slaughter each other, but hopefully it will never come to that!&quot;

How reassuring.

The god was glad that his new friend had appreciated his mystical craftsmanship. Somewhere in all of that wisdom was also some woodworking knowledge. 

&quot;Mimirtastic indeed!&quot; The god remarked with a laugh. That was a catchphrase that he could get behind. 

Mimir stroked his beard watching the card appear from the unkept hairs. Casters sleight of hand was truly impressive, even the most common of tricks amused Mimir. &quot;I am honored to receive such a gift. You put on a good show for me today, I&#39;ll make sure to spread the word and come many times in the near future.&quot; Mimir took the card from caster tucking it into the waist of his robe 

&quot;Oh ho ho hoo, I almost forgot this was a competition of strength... Yes I suppose we just might have to fight one day, but let&#39;s enjoy the journey. Speaking of the journey, I should leave you to prepare for your next show, this old man can&#39;t hog all of the fun afterall.&quot; Mimir let off a friendly laugh, a far less mischievous laugh then usual.

This was still a Holy Grail War, even if it was nothing more than a glorified testing ground. They were &#39;friends&#39; now, but in a day? Two? They would have to slaughter one another.

Caster quite liked Mimir, but that friendship was irrelevant. He would have to die. Unfortunately, Caster was also a showman. He needed an audience, so the simple solution was to give his audience front row seats to annihilation.

As one of the greatest magicians of the modern age, it was his duty to provide shows that would leave his onlookers cheering as they vanished to the Throne.

&quot;Of course, God of the Aesir. It was a pleasure, of course. Shoo! Begone! I have much work to do.&quot; Caster said, waving the bearded man out of the room. As soon as Mimir was left in the hallway leading outside, a sign was placed on the door that lead to Caster&#39;s lair.

<strong>The show cannot start yet! Come back later!</strong>

With that, the curtain fell on the two Casters from vastly different eras. What fate would await them? Was there something beyond simple amusement for Mimir? Who even <em>was</em> Caster? Would he win his much-awaited chicken dinner?

Only time would tell.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
