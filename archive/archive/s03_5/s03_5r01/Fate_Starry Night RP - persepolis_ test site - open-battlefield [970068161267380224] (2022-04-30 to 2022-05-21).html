Fifty eight minutes since he had received his briefing. Fifty-five minutes since he had been given his supply of two mana batteries. Thirty minutes since he first scouted his immediate surroundings. Twenty-two minutes since he received his first vision of this wide, empty sprawl. Fifteen minutes since he had arrived. Nine minutes since he had started to piece together the timeline of events, and seven seconds since he had finished.

A concrete and conclusive summary of what had occurred. One might accuse it of being a barebones retelling, but rather, Lancer would say that he had cut out all the fat. There was no flair, no intrigue, no excitement, for none of it was necessary. He had not been summoned to tell a story, especially not his own.

No, he had been summoned to wage war.

A war with no kingdoms, no lords, no generals, nothing to elevate it to more than a squabble. To furnish it with such a lofty title as &quot;war&quot; seemed excessive, but given the circumstances, it nevertheless felt apt. A war, not literal, but metaphorical - a war upon the despair of the future, fighting for a better tomorrow.

He had stolen that one from a motivational poster he had spied on the long trek over here. A3 size, plastered on a crumbling wall, once inspiring, now torn and tattered. Still, the sentiment seemed a good enough banner to plant behind his army of one.

Standing tall in the middle of this battleground-to-be, Lancer looked up at the glow of the sun through the gloom. How atmospheric. A fitting backdrop, if nothing else.

<em><strong>&quot;Sun rise breaks the hill,</strong></em>
<em><strong>heralds another battle,</strong></em>
<em><strong>draw your sword and charge&quot;</strong></em>

All said, all done, all that remained was to meet his first opponent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The good news was that her scouting was resourceful; Olga had managed to get at least a decent headcount on the number of Servants she&#39;d be contending with after talking with the snooze fest Yorimasa in the heap of trash. Unfortunately, they were all paired up or in the midst of a clash already, something she didn&#39;t need to bother herself with right now. Seems her group was already a little trigger happy. Well, that would be no skin off her bones; if anything, it would make things a little easier. But, the lone figure standing in the middle of a field? That was definitely worth investigating.

Or so she thought. 

&quot;Like, seriously, what does he think is gonna happen?&quot; She mutters, her Presence Concealment suppressing her existence whole she monitors the Servant carefully. Tall, armor clad, glowing eye. The picture of gaudy, in her eyes. &quot;...Really, you&#39;re not even gonna walk around? You&#39;re just gonna stare ahead?! Gawwwd, alright whatever, I&#39;ll walk in, if it&#39;ll get you to do <em>something.</em>&quot; 

~ ~ ~

Silence is the story of space. Many take it as the absence of sound, but it gives the chance for the Earth to speak to you. A chance to hear the stories of your surroundings, to hear the tales of what has been and what will be. If the Lancer could only listen...what would it tell him of what&#39;s to come? 

&quot;Heeeeey~&quot; She made sure to hang on the call, making it as annoying as possible. Retribution for the boring watch party...

&quot;Are you okay? Like, you&#39;re alive, right? Do you need to be turned on or something, like a wind up toy? <em>Gasp</em>...do you have one of those windy thingies on your back, is that why you can&#39;t move? Hellooooo?&quot; 

A woman had started to approach, and by the looks of her outfit, this was the opponent he waited for. 

&quot;Or maybe you need a latte or something? I know, talk about inconsiderate, they didn&#39;t even offer me a neck rub or anything when I woke up. <em>Sigh</em> people, what can you do?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was not, in fact, perfect timing. Much the opposite, Lancer had been standing there for an additional one hour and twenty-two minutes before another servant had arrived. In fact, he hadn&#39;t seen much of anything before that, save for the occasionally bird in the sky or the rare insect buzzing across the empty sprawl.

So rare he&#39;d only heard one. A dragonfly. Not a bee or a wasp, and definitely not a regular fly. It was certainly a dragonfly. But now was not the time for that.

<strong>&quot;I did not sense your approach. So, you are an Assassin, then?&quot;</strong> He spoke, turning slightly to look Olga in the eye. What a strange choice of greeting. One might even view it as being rude. Still, he continued. <strong>&quot;Nevertheless, it is fortunate that we have met here. I confess, I was worried nobody would arrive, but now that you have...&quot;</strong>

With a single fluid movement, Lancer reached to their back, pulling their spear free and pointing it in the direction of Assassin. Even through the murk in the sky, the sun shined brightly upon the gleaming metal. Truly, it was a masterwork, but one would be hard pressed to appreciate it when the sharp end was pointed towards oneself.

<strong>&quot;On my honour as a servant, a warrior, and a daimyo,</strong> <em><strong>fight me,</strong></em> <strong>for the sake of this experiment, mankind, and their future. Such is the nature of this Grail War.&quot;</strong>

Despite the importance of the content of his declaration, his tone seemed rather nonchalant, almost matter of fact. Odd.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-971477788467036170 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=971477788467036170><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-May-22 04:25 AM">04:25</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Grail War? Dude, please, we&#39;re Action figures being smashed against each other...in your case literally. And I&#39;m not <em>suuuuuper</em> into the whole fighting thing? Like, I woke up just an hour or two ago, can&#39;t even shake the cobwebs out with a drink or anything.&quot; 

She paces slowly, walking in a circle while babbling incessantly to herself. Lancer&#39;s first opponent...<strong>was annoying.</strong>

&quot;Aaaaanyway, I&#39;d rather not chip a nail or anything first thing out of bed, so why don&#39;t you tone down the machismo? You really want to fight someone like me, when there&#39;s plenty of other ripe for the picking hunks out there right now? What&#39;s your type, Sabers with bristling pecs?&quot;

Lancer had to admit, this was not his ideal visage of an opponent. Less of a Nagamasa, more of a Kitsuno. There was no crisp drink of water to chase down this bitter pill. That is to say, he would not be crossing blades with a warrior, but a princess. Worse still, it was not a noble duel with one of the Knight class, but instead, a confrontation with one who was an Assassin.

Yes, he had managed to see through her masterful attempt at a deflection. After all, nothing could get past him. Though his body had been still, his senses were nevertheless sharp, as... The cutting edge of a sword? The cry of a hawk? The ringing of a bell? 

...As a spear. As the pointed edge of a legendary spear. Yes, just like that, pointed at a prospective foe.

<strong>&quot;I am in no position to be picky about my opponent.&quot;</strong> Lancer stated plainly, eye narrowing ever-so-slightly at Olga. <strong>&quot;I shall ask only once: Will you fight, or will you retreat?

There&#39;s always going to be fools like this, but they were the most infuriating. They couldn&#39;t be reasoned with, couldn&#39;t be positioned or played around. If they were equating this to a chess game, this Lancer would be a rook. Single minded, one track...and only one directive. Take out whatever is in their single path.

&quot;<strong>Sigh</strong>...I guess there&#39;s no use dragging it out. Fiiiiiiiine. I ain&#39;t a runner, so I guess we just have to do this the boring way. Just try not to knick the clothes, I don&#39;t wanna give those creeps watching us a peep show too soon.&quot; 

The Servant locks eyes with Lancer before bringing her hands together, whispering something softly beneath her breath. &quot;<em>Nebesnyy Otets, Bog prezhde vsekh drugikh bogov, daruy mne silu tvoyey lyubvi i yarosti...</em>&quot; 

She didn&#39;t move, but the words sounded like prayer...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was nothing left to do, except play.

<strong>&quot;Very well! Then let us do away with the pleasantries and the distractions. On my honour as a warrior, I shall write a tale of hard-fought conflict upon this Saint Graph!&quot;</strong> 

A brief pause. One that lasted only a second, but felt longer. No movement, no action, nothing but the blowing of the winds.

And then, it began.

With a great leap, Lancer bounded forward, sprinting across the open ground as a stone skipping across a lake. He had no awareness of this Assassin, no awareness of their true capabilities, but there would only be one way to find that out, wouldn&#39;t there? Yes, all lessons learned the hard way were lessons worth learning. Thus, he charged in blindly.

As he neared Olga, he made one last surging rush forward, aiming to skewer the princess on the end of his spear.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-972178131119136849 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=972178131119136849><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-May-22 02:48 AM">02:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His spear lunges, slicing through the open air to pierce her stomach and hold her aloft as a trophy of victory and a crown of his power...but the hot splash of blood spattering against his armor never came. The sound of flesh giving way to steel didn&#39;t either. In fact...his spear had just gone through her completely...

&quot;Yeah, like I&#39;m just gonna stand here and pray with you barreling towards me. Talk about dumb, LOL!&quot; 

The Mirage smirks, sticking its tongue out before vanishing in a plume of sparks, leaving Lancer alone...

&quot;Go!&quot; 

It would not be for long, however, as the orange glow from behind gives way to a surge of heat. A fireball descends sharply, digging itself into Lancer&#39;s back as flame spreads and licks across his armor. &quot;<em>SKEEEWAK!</em>&quot; It cries, rolling along his body, aiming for his face. How foolish...a battle with an assassin would be nothing but one built on subterfuge...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Indeed, he had managed to pierce the woman standing in front of him, but it seemed that &quot;woman&quot; was nothing but a phantom, an illusion, a grim ghost meant to deceive. Like the shadow puppets dancing upon an illuminated screen, his foe was revealed to be naught but a trick of the light.

But of course, an ambush was not made of surprise alone - it was taking advantage of that surprise that was most essential. Lancer knew this well, and turned on his heels, ready to intercept an oncoming attack...

...Only to be faced by a burning bird, an inferno upon wings. Like a savage <em>akuma</em>, it sought to reduce him to ash, to burn his flesh and bone into naught but cinders. He had been expecting a blade, a dagger or a shortsword, but to be fought with fire? 

Unable to deflect the strike, unable to parry it, the flames struck his head. A direct hit.

And then, as though nothing had occurred, Lancer twisted and flicked his spear, effortlessly cleaving the bird in half. As charred feathers and boiling blood fell from the end of his spear, Olga would get a glance at the damage she had done.

Or rather, the lack thereof. Upon his face, there appeared to be no damage, no cuts or bruises, no sign of pain, not even so much as the slightest charring. It was as though the attack hadn&#39;t landed at all.

There&#39;s a reason the Assassin class has the bad rep. There&#39;s a reason no one ever suspects them of being able to win a Grail War, much less a fake one...

&quot;Of cooooourse you&#39;re fire proof, you look like you come with action grip,&quot; Olga mutters, desperately peeking from behind one of the few straggling mounds of cover provided by the wastes and debris of Persepolis. Yeah, it was a battlefield fit for a fight...which only put the odds less in her favor. Ugh, why did she even bother to try and show up this guy...maybe there&#39;s some sort of Charisma going on that&#39;s getting her into this brain dead fighting spirit. Well, needless to say, she was on the ropes here. Two birds down...and if fire wasn&#39;t enough, she doubted getting pecked to death would do much...

Which means, it&#39;s time for momma to play her hand a bit. 

&quot;Okay, fine, yeah I don&#39;t have the best skill set one on one against a lunk,&quot; she calls out, two birds flying up in the sky, circling the air before rushing for Lancer. She sought to throw more birds at him? When he could so easily cut them down to size...

&quot;But, that&#39;s also where I feel pretty confident. I&#39;m not so great in one on one, but I am pretty good at setting the stage so I don&#39;t have to.&quot; As they dive, their beaks stretched in a scratching battle cry, their talons ready to clang off of the armor covering her opponent...they fade away. A violet smog envelopes their forms, dissipating in a cloud that soon overtakes Lancer. It curls and whips about him, but there&#39;s almost a weight to its presence, as if it was attaching itself to his very core...

Nothing. Beyond the whisps swirling around his form, the attack...was meaningless. Was he truly immune to all of Assassin&#39;s tricks? How unlucky, to be saddles with such a poor excuse for a-

A hub cap slams into his helmet, the metal whining as it bends and crumples to get closer to his body, almost forming around his face. Ridiculous, they were throwing things n-

<strong>SLAM</strong>

A dilapidated, half rotted telephone pole slams into the Servant, bursting into slivers that instantly fly back to his frame, quivering as they stand on end against his metallic hull. Oh...<em>oh.</em>

&quot;Let&#39;s make it rain, bitch!&quot; Olga calls out, as a pair of cinder blocks shoot from behind her cover, the assassin darting away and heading for another pile of trash...one holding the structural, disheveled remains of a small office building. 

<em>That&#39;s not going to hold him back, I need something stronger to keep him down until I get my babies back. Maybe then I can sap his mana and blow this stand.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I suppose that is one way to look at it.&quot;</strong> Lancer mused aloud. He stood completely still, unmoving, as though wholly unbothered by the notion that Assassin was already planning her next attack. He did not even bother to scan his surroundings, did not make an effort to find where Olga hid. He simply stood there, speaking. <strong>&quot;However, it is only a single glimpse of a sprawling battlefield. You see--&quot;</strong>

The birds came rushing down towards him, and that was enough to stir him, swinging his spear to cleave them both out of the air. However, before it could make contact, the avian familiars vanished, reducing to nothing but a violet smog. He seemed unbothered by this.

<strong>&quot;--Your birds cannot hurt me--&quot;</strong>

He paused, not because of any verbal flow or manner of speaking, but because a hubcap slammed into his face. Still, he did not flinch, and it took only a moment for him to carry on.

<strong>&quot;--Your weapons cannot hurt me--&quot;</strong>

<em>CRASH!</em> The telephone pole smashed into him, but even as the splinters danced across his armour, he did not appear to care.

<strong>&quot;--You cannot hurt me--&quot;</strong>

<em>SLAM!</em> The cinderblocks slammed directly into his head, each one of them enough to concuss a human. But his neck did not even budge under the pressure. In fact, had he even taken a single wound from any of these projectiles?

<strong>&quot;--For I am invincible. I am one who has surpassed death, who has never suffer a wound upon his flesh, not in life, and not in death. It is for that reason that you will lose!&quot;</strong>

Then, with his declaration made, Lancer started to sprint directly towards Olga, spear at the ready to skewer her. It was time to prove his worth, as a samurai and a servant alike.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-973672722251022426 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=973672722251022426><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-May-22 05:47 AM">05:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga sprints away, taking one look back to see the Lancer hot on her trail, all while the objects from before smashed to smithereens against him. While each left crumbs that still followed in his wake, he was like a terminator coming to kill her Arnie style! 

&quot;Jesus H. Christ, what the fuck am I supposed to do?!?&quot; She says, frantically touching trash in her wake as she rushes for the abandoned construction left in some disaster&#39;s wake. Something has to slow him down, enough to at least give her another set of birds. 

&quot;Okay, babies, momma needs you to put in a little goddamn work and DISTRACT HIM!&quot; She screeches, two more birds bursting away and flitting about, hiding behind the debris launching itself at Lancer as she approaches the beginning of the site. Rusted rebar, concrete slabs. All likely pointless. No, her real prize she saw a mile away...construction equipment. <strong>Wrecking ball.</strong> 

&quot;If this doesn&#39;t stop this motherfucker, I might as well just get on my knees and offer to blow him, cause I&#39;m fresh out,&quot; she mutters, putting on a burst of speed as she races. 

Her hands light on makeshift skewers of rebar, the material slowly dragging along the ground before launching at Lancer, 4 in total. How long before he&#39;d be too heavy to move? Who knows at this point. 

The birds meanwhile duck and dive behind the scraps of trash and concrete, giving a scratch here or a peck there, even momentarily lighting on Lancer&#39;s spear before diving off again. If a battle of annoyance were in order, Olga might have won. But Lancer of Sengoku...<strong>had nerves of steel.</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Four pieces of rebar were launched towards him, four makeshift spears seeking to pierce his body. All four struck him, aiming to leave deep wounds within his body. All four bounced off, and ended up limply hanging off his body instead.

The birds mobbed him, their talons clawing at his skin, beaks pecking at his flesh. Every hit was true, enough landed that their feathers surely should have been stained red with blood. Instead, not a single drop of crimson could be seen across his body.

Eventually, he grew tired of their assault, and with two swings of his lance, they were felled.

Perhaps he could not be worn down by damage. He could not be killed by a thousand cuts. But what about one singular weighty blow?

She makes it, eyes set on the wrecking ball resting atop a pile of foundation and wreckage. She&#39;d need to make it up there without incident. Two of her birds would be popping back in any moment, but until then, the name of the game was now to survive. Taking another look back, she catches sight of Lancer, with debris stuck to and trailing along his body as he slowly makes his way forward. That was confidence. Something she was quite adept at destroying. 

&quot;Lancer. I&#39;m going to give you a chance to take the easy way out,&quot; she says, inching backwards towards the construction debris, her eyes catching broken pieces of equipment which could work to her advantage. Suitable, she thinks, as her hands light on a construction drill, the machinery slowly moving for its target, rubble moving out of the way while she makes her way farther up. &quot;Surrender now and I will spare your Saint graph; a being of your stature and one with my cunning.

As she says this, her hands light on more and more debris and tools, as treads begin whining as they pull themselves forward, along with pelting rubble and even a Crane neck with its back hoe.

Hm. An odd way to look at it, though Lancer had never considered it such. Confidence inevitably led to overconfidence, and overconfidence inevitably led to arrogance, and arrogance inevitably ended in mistakes. He had seen it twice, two leaders that had risen to the highest high, then fell tumbling down to the lowest low. He had no intention to repeat folly he had already witnessed. Such was the true strength of man, the animal of learning.

Still, as Assassin delivered her ultimatum, Lancer would pause his advance, planting his feet firmly in the dirt as the woman spoke. A tactical disadvantage, yes, but he paid that no heed. After all, the ideal of honour was paramount to a samurai, and it must be maintained, even when dealing with a dishonourable one.

<strong>&quot;It is you who does not know who you are dealing with, Assassin.&quot;</strong> The warrior spoke plainly, entirely unbothered as the whirring drill surged forth, gouging into his chest, only to have nothing to show for it. <strong>&quot;You believe yourself to somehow be my superior, if not through skill, if not through knowledge, then through leadership. But, I am afraid that is simply not true.&quot;</strong>

Hammers, screwdrivers, loose nails and shards of debris, all of them threw themselves at Lancer, all of them impacting hard against his body, all of them failing to leave so much as a bruise behind. 

<strong>&quot;You are not my Master. You are not even your own Master. Whatever right to rule you believe yourself to have, whatever claim to superiority you think you possess, it is imperfect.&quot;</strong>

The mighty arm of the crane surges forth, catching Lancer head-on. Is he thrown back, beaten and bloodied, unable to stand from such a mighty blow? No, much the opposite, he remains entirely unaffected, as per usual. Even the mightiest servant would show some sign of wear and tear, and yet, Lancer remains intact. Unsurprising, but nevertheless irritating.

<strong>&quot;You are the one who should surrender, Assassin. For your own sake.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-975759748584595527 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=975759748584595527><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-May-22 12:00 AM">00:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Didn&#39;t they also consider her weak when they sent an envoy to ask her hand in marriage...to the man that killed Igor? Did they not see her as just a weeping widow when they decided to throw her wedding in front of her husband&#39;s corpse? Did they not think she was some bloodthirsty hound that could do more than pillage? In every case...<strong>they were wrong.</strong>

&quot;<em>Sigh</em> Dude, please, I thought I was theatrical. Very well, Lancer. Let&#39;s party!&quot; She announces, finally reaching her hand back, lighting it down on...a stray piece of rubble.

<strong>RRRRMBL</strong>

The ground before Lancer shifts, debris and equipment sliding around his ankles as he came to the bottom of the worksite, finally noticing the shadow of the building overhead stretching across his frame. 

&quot;I just needed to get some of that shit out of the way, thanks for holding onto it for me! So helpful. Alright, well, I doubt this is gonna hurt, but I also hope you don&#39;t got one of those buried alive phobia things? Oomphie, that would suck.&quot; 

The mock concern clues Lancer in on the true plan. She wasn&#39;t trying to hurt him, she was using her power to make the worksite unstable...and now a building was set to crash on top of him. With the way this power works, the force would weigh down on him through the pile, keeping him buried!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-976148574192664646 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=976148574192664646><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-May-22 01:45 AM">01:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>( <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> )</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Very well.

From his standstill, Lancer once again broke into a full sprint, quickly making up the distance he had lost during his momentary pause. From here, it would only be a few seconds before his spear plunged into the chest of his foe, a few seconds before he earned his decisive victory...

But of course, when one routed the enemy arm, the commanders grew desperate, and those who were desperate were the most likely to lash out, to sacrifice all common sense, to play all their trump cards at once in a vainglorious attempt to gain snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, no matter how pyrrhic a victory it may be. 

Thus, like the monasteries of Mount Hiei collapsing, he now faced down a mighty wall of stone, threatening to crush him. But, when had he ever allowed himself to be frightened by words? Thus, he carried on, and the threats became promises as tons of brick and debris smashed into him head-on.

<em>Every bone in the body broken. Flesh battered to the point where the mere act of existing is painful. At least, it would be, had the spine not been so thoroughly mangled that all feeling was lost. But of course, the falling building itself would not kill him. No, that would be the crushing weight of the rubble weighing down upon him, keeping him pinned until he starved, suffocated, or worse. Yes, even for a servant, it would be a most gruesome and undignified way to die.</em>

<em>Except for the fact that</em> <em><strong>the falling building himself would not kill him.</strong></em>

<em>CRASH!</em> Out from the veritable mountain of twisted iron and broken stone came Lancer, still without as much as a wound on his body. Worse still, Assassin had tipped her hand, and Lancer still had a card to play. With a mighty leap, he bounded forth, the head of his spear pointed towards Olga--

<strong>&quot;IT IS OVER!&quot;</strong>

--before proceeding to twist it around at the last moment, leading only for her to get bopped on the head by the other end of the weapon.

<strong>&quot;I win.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-976578373772013628 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=976578373772013628><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-May-22 06:13 AM">06:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Well, perhaps Lancer had never been that good at cards in the first place.

It happened in a quick flash, the Lancer surging forth to Lance her through the middle, the assassin thoroughly outplayed at every angle by the one thing that she couldn&#39;t combat. The one thing that left her at a loss...how does one tackle an enemy that doesn&#39;t feel pain? That does not have anything to lose? As such, the taste of defeat would have been a fresh and bitter pill to swallow, capstoned properly only by her untimely death. It would be the proper way to truly experience loss...

But she lost, and all she had to show for it was a crummy bop on the head. Her dimmed eyes follow after Lancer, empty and void of life as she contemplates what just happened...the insult she just received. 

&quot;...HEY,&quot; she says, breaking through her stunned state and addressing the Lancer, rushing after the obelisk. &quot;Hey, hey, hey! What the hell was that?! You prick, just who do you think you are?! You&#39;re talking big talk and you just bop me?!

Lancer stopped, turning back to face Olga once again. Though the helm upon his face was as static and unmoving as ever, one would be forgiven if they heard a hint of confusion in his grunt. It was as though he thought that his actions had all made perfect sense, and that they did not need elaboration. However, though he did not think it required it, he was not one to fight on uneven terrain.

<strong>&quot;I tell you again, Assassin. You are not my Master. You are not your own Master. No, our Masters are those who summoned us, those scientists, those who have called upon us to fight, so that they may observe. I do not claim to understand the important of such, but if the Masters wish for it, then I would see it done.&quot;</strong>

His spear thrust out towards Olga, this time with the pointed end facing towards her. His eye met hers, and narrowed.

<strong>&quot;Make no mistake: Had they wished me to slay you, you would be dead where you stand. However, to kill you here and now, while you still have aught to provide for them, would be pointless. We still both have many more fights ahead of us, and it would be a shame to leave them unfought.&quot;</strong>

With that said, Lancer once again turned on the spot, beginning his march once more. Onto his next fight, his next conflict. But, as he made his exit, he would leave Olga with one last piece of advice.

<strong>&quot;Next time, I would advise that you fight someone more familiar with the idea of Death, rather than one who has surpassed it.&quot;</strong>
