The <em>Uji Byodoin Temple</em>&#39;s floorboards weren&#39;t made to support such violent steps, as conveyed by the creaking and the skidding that permeated the <em>Taira</em> army&#39;s every move. The Samurai shamelessly flooded the Temple, killing every man they came across with little to no hesitation. It seemed there was no place for mercy, not even within the Enlighten One&#39;s sacred grounds.

An old man with long graying hair sat in the middle of a room, one farthest from the Temple&#39;s entrance. He wore priest robes, yet carried swords on his belt. An old soldier turned man of the cloth. The enemy hadn&#39;t gotten this far into the Temple yet, but the old man knew. He knew that fleeing from these many men was a fruitless endeavor, a senseless struggle. No matter the course of action, this old man&#39;s days were coming to an end.

&quot;...so this is how I die,&quot; The old man spoke, resigned. &quot;Surrounded by enemies, left gasping for air, by my lonesome. Oh, how truly depressing.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-970378508842991697 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=970378508842991697><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-May-22 03:37 AM">03:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In the man&#39;s hands, an empty scroll and a Yatate. Ink and paper that he kept on his person at all times, finding them convenient for when inspiration struck. Even as he knew his fate was sealed, he would keep true to his art till the bitter end. Surrounded by enemies or on the verge of death, inspiration struck without discrimination and at the randomest of times. Sure enough, the man took his brush.

<i>Like a fossil tree,</i>


His hands moved slowly, casually brushing the scroll with the jet-black ink, delicately caressing the paper with each stroke.

<i>From which we gather no flowers.</i>

The Taira soldiers rampaged. Men screamed, the Temple&#39;s serenity teinted. The man&#39;s chest felt tight, but his hands kept working...

<i>Sad has been my life,</i>

...while he reminisced about the long, long life he had been cursed with. Bearing witness to pointless conflicts, bloody political struggles and absurd amounts of violence. His only silver lining, his loving family, dying at the hands of the Taira, leaving him to wander the earth without purpose. Frankly, he was surprised he even made it this far into the Temple in the first place.

A trickle of blood erupted from his mouth, yet the pain did little to erase the man&#39;s sadness. Even with cold steel rummaging his insides, the man could only think of his pathetic life, and his even more pathetic demise. Grabbing the handle with both hands, the sharp blade traveled horizontally through his belly. All at once, the man&#39;s insides sloshed to the ground. His hot blood showered his arms, the texture of his wobbly guts permeated his sense of touch, the fumes of his organs assaulted his nostrils. Pain beyond imagination finally silenced his every thought, and the man was momentarily free from his sadness.

All that was left was to stab the throat. Pushing his guts aside, the man struggled to grip his blade, only succeeding in plunging it deeper into himself. His vision split, the pain magnified tenfold. He would&#39;ve surely vomited and defecated himself, had he not fasted for three days prior to this. With more effort, the old man reached for the knife&#39;s handle and plucked it away from his half-empty stomach. Blood splattered across the walls, part of his desiccated guts flew across the room. The blade almost slipped out of his hands again, but the man grabbed it with more intent. This was it, the man thought, this is my last moment on this sad earth. Covered by my own blood and guts, surrounded by the enemy, sad and alone.

Truly, what a way to go out.

The knife jumped to his throat, and the old man closed his eyes for the final time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once again, he was cursed to live. How truly, truly sad.

On his arms and legs, restraints that kept him in place. Puzzled, the man observed his surroundings.

“A junkyard…” The long-haired man spoke as he looked around him, to the waste land that surrounded. “How fitting. A place worthy of trash such as I.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her vision is fading. The chill of death is seeping through her very bones, its icy claws digging into her aching body and pulling her down into its embrace. The faces...her family, her people, they were all here. Their tears and sobs fading as she focuses on the hand of her dear Sviatoslav. What a wonderful life her son led...what a beautiful family he&#39;s prospered. Oh, this death is not a grave one. It&#39;s not even remotely close. The warmth in her cheeks became the final sensation she could focus on as even her own son&#39;s tight grip faded from her. They all were, ever so slightly, pulling away into a fog. This is death. This is to embrace it after such a long life of fortitude. No, this death isn&#39;t bad...but one thing could have made it better.

&quot;Ooooh...jeeze, what a killer headache.&quot; 

Her body adjusted, slowly, to the cold steel wrapped around her wrists and legs, subduing her completely and trapping her Spirit Origin tightly. &quot;Great, I got summoned by a perv. FML.&quot; She utters the phrase, immediately recognizing what container she had been summoned into and feeling a slight disappointment at the thought. Assassin...well, it could be worse. 

The screech from the intercom system jolts her back into the present, Olga cringing as the feedback jostles her thoughts before laying it all on the table. A test? So there wasn&#39;t even a wish involved?! Of course, the nature of the world came flooding into her mind a moment later, not unlike the water that flooded the very earth. Ha. Zinger score. 

The restraints fell away, letting the Assassin drop to the ground while massaging her wrists, pouting slightly at the researcher approaching her. &quot;Gaaaaaaaawd, you practically bruised me, jerk!&quot; She exclaims, arms crossed as she looks to the mana batteries. She takes one in her hands, examining the bright blue capsule steadily, eyebrow cocked in confusion. &quot;So...this is it? Laaaame. I guess this really is just a test...so, tell me, when I win, is the big voice in the sky just gonna like, what, kill me too?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-970408855559344159 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=970408855559344159><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-May-22 05:38 AM">05:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em> 
The researcher pauses, not entirely sure how to respond to a Servant directly inquiring him about the nature of the test; they didn&#39;t say they would try to engage them in conversation! How much is he allowed to say? 

&quot;Yo, dude, I&#39;m talking to you! Am I just scrap metal after this, come on, pipe up!&quot; 

&quot;Uh,&quot; the researcher stammers, gazing around to check if there were any monitors closely monitoring them. He remembered the one time that someone got a little too personal with one of the testing Servants...and it didn&#39;t particularly end well for him. &quot;I-I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just supposed to  monitor the results. They didn&#39;t really tell us about the end results or what to expect.&quot; 

&quot;Pfff, whatever. I guess it makes sense, don&#39;t tell the stooges squat.&quot; <em>Ouch.</em>

Suddenly, Assassin tilts her head. The quizzical set of her eyes almost looks through the researcher, who right now was starting to feel a little uneasy. The higher ups obviously had things under control...surely, if this Servant decided to...help herself to a little early bloodshed, they would press the kill switch...right? 

&quot;Uhhhh-&quot;

&quot;Shh, dude, shut up, I&#39;m concentrating. So, like, these other Servants? The ones I&#39;m supposed to be goring or whatever, how far apart should they be?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, well, there&#39;s no telling. The drops were kind of random, so-&quot;

&quot;So, theoretically, there could be one real close? Like...same area close?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot;

The Servant huffs indignantly, snatching the other mana battery and storing both in the safest place she could think of: her bosom. &quot;Ugh, lucky me. Alright, chop chop, move it, dude. Don&#39;t need to worry about you getting in the way in case shit goes south. So go tell the big voice (if he cares) that he&#39;s got a deal. Peace!&quot; She says, throwing up a sign before dashing off, leaving behind a plume of feathers draped over the researcher&#39;s body. 

&quot;...I&#39;m allergic to feathers...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-970409253321986079 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=970409253321986079><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-May-22 05:39 AM">05:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
She spent all of 3 minutes scouting for that other signature, mildly annoyed by how short it really took considering he was RIGHT FRICKIN THERE! What kind of experiment was this, did they want them to brawl the moment they shook the cobwebs out! At least buy her a drink first before royally fucking her right off the bat! Well, at least she could take the moment to really study this guy. The sunken eyes and messy hair gave her the immediate impression of...well, depression. Talk about a downer right at the start. At the very least, she figured she could take her chances and gauge how &quot;motivated&quot; this dude might be. Reconnaisance...always the important first step...

&quot;Yo.&quot;

The poet heard the greeting, uttered by an approaching figure with a little less than no enthusiasm plastered on her face, arms crossed as she took the time to scan the still imprisoned Servant. Lazily, she took in the whole figure, almost summing up exactly what she was working with. Dear lord, had another Servant already come to kill him. 

&quot;Aren&#39;t those things unlocked yet? Or do you just, like, have the shittiest Luck known on the Throne? Oh my god, I&#39;d be frickin embarrassed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From what the poet gathered, a researcher bearing two &#39;Mana Batteries&#39; should&#39;ve come to his side. Neither the restraints nor the researcher ever came. It seemed as, even reincarnated as a perfect Servant, the man was a failure. An outcast. How truly saddening.

But eventually, the universe took pity on this pathetic excuse of a Servant. One of his own, a red-haired woman wearing a crown, finally stumbled across his embarrassing figure.

&quot;...yo.&quot; The man reciprocated her greetings, with less than a tenth of her enthusiasm and energy. &quot;You&#39;d be in your rights to be embarrassed. To pity me, even. I would expect nothing less from those who would gaze at this poor excuse of a Servant that I am. What is even Heroic about me, I can hardly say…&quot;

Despite wearing a black kimono, the only color the poet managed to convey was <em>blue</em>. His lack of motivation and self-esteem was enough to make even the coldest of Servants feel pity for him. Olga felt like she stood across a blackhole, sucking any enthusiasm or joie de vivre she might’ve felt post-summoning.

The insults she threw, although rightfully deserved, came from a place without a filter as well. Could a monarch really act as such?

&quot;...In any case, these things are not yet unlocked. Frankly, I wouldn&#39;t mind if those restraints <em>never came off</em>. As it stands right now, I don&#39;t have the slightest motivation to go through these so-called tests... I&#39;m tired, low on energy, and I&#39;m not in the mood to do anything for at least an hour or so—&quot;

As he spoke those words, the restraints finally moved. The man slumped forward, falling face-first onto the treacherous and trash-heavy junkyard ground. Maybe he <em>did</em> truly possess the Throne&#39;s shittiest luck.

&quot;...damn.&quot; Was all the poet managed to blurt, not even bothering to stand up from his disgraceful fall. How embarrassing, <em>how truly saddening</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sighing, Olga walks over and helps the Servant up, doing her best to get the dust and rust out of his clothes with a pat down. &quot;Okay, look, you can do the whole &#39;woe is me&#39; routine all damn day, but I gotta be honest with ya, I&#39;m not here for it. Like...look, it&#39;s obviously not a good idea to reveal True Names, so I&#39;m only gonna assume you&#39;ve been through some shit, right? Welcome to the club, bruh.&quot; 

Callous, but it&#39;s not like she wasn&#39;t being genuine. After all, if they were gonna have to tear each other&#39;s throats apart, she&#39;d rather this guy be on his A game...that way she could use him against the other Servants. No telling what kind of Servant he was. If he was another Assassin, she was screwed at the start, but beggars can&#39;t really be choosers right now. 

&quot;Look, obviously your dude is a little late in handing over the goods,&quot; she says, reaching into her shirt to pull out one of the mana batteries, holding it out to the Spirit with a limp gesture, &quot;so how about you hold onto this until he gets here? That way you&#39;re not left up shits creek without a paddle...sorry, do you get that reference, I dunno where you&#39;re from, dude.&quot; 

Sew some trust. Get on his good side, make him think that they&#39;re in this together. Important first steps.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In my case, it takes a little getting used to before I can breathe easily.&quot;

The man curiously eyed the object she held on, a glowing vial of blue. The man&#39;s yet frail mind took a second to process what it was: <em>A Mana Battery</em>. His eyes widened a fraction.

His dejected expression turned somber. He looked at the tube in vexation, then shot a sympathetic look at the woman. One filled with pity. She was one of <em>them</em>, it seemed. How saddening.

&quot;<em>...I have no desire to fight.</em>&quot; He spoke as he politely pushed the vial away. &quot;This... is the height of foolishness. Right as we&#39;ve been blessed with a second chance at life, we are expected to kill one another. What, in order to further advance humanity&#39;s technology? Is this how we’re supposed to protect humanity? If this is a farce, I am <em>not</em> laughing.&quot;

This marked the first hint of emotion (other than sadness) the man had coated his words with. His posture shifted at the same time, less indecisive, more assertive. He was absolute about this no-battle business.

&quot;...and know that I do get that reference, for I&#39;ve been imbued with the same knowledge from the Processor as you have.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s not like she hasn&#39;t been visited by the downs, but she had an ultimately...<em>different</em> way of dealing with her depressive episodes. 

&quot;Alright, look...for what it&#39;s worth, I agree with you.&quot; She says, slowly, leaning against the contraption that previously held the Servant, rubbing at her temple as she pieces together the best way to get this sorry sack off his ass. Should she cut her losses? Just leave this dude to get his head blown off or whatever those Republic douches were thinking? Well...realistically she should, but who knows what options she really has right now? At least this way she might altruistically lift someone&#39;s spirits...

Yeah right.

&quot;I mean, believe me, I could be doing anything else right now...literally ANYTHING. I&#39;m hella annoyed by it too, but...look, your second life, you only get so many shots at it.

The brash woman&#39;s words reminded him of his untimely demise, that night on the 20th of June. How he died a painful death, old and alone, surrounded not by his loved ones but by men wanting his head. He had gotten his bearings, but the mention was enough to shake him a little. He definitely did not want to repeat those events, if he could help it. The Assassin tugged at the right string as she made her proposal with more insistence.

The man started reaching out for the blue vial...

&quot;Such youthful exuberance. To go from my eventual death on my lonesome to drinking... <em>Oh!</em>&quot;

...only for his hand to abruptly change course, reaching inside the sleeve of his Kimono.

&quot;<em>Inspiration strikes!</em>&quot;

Out of it came a brush and ink set, along with a scroll of pristine white parchment paper. The man swept the ground with his feet, making some space to put his writing equipment down.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-970720506770780210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=970720506770780210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-May-22 02:16 AM">02:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>
<i>"While I see it yet,</i>
<i>I cannot recall its like."</i>

Each stroke was filled with intent, with intense emotion. The man forgot his surroundings for a moment, for he and his brush were the only two things in existence at this moment. His words perfectly synched with their apparition on paper, chanting his poem as if entranced to his audience of one.
<i>
"On a moonlight night,
I have become weak and old.
How I wish to be carefree..."
</i>
The poem ended, and the man looked content. <em>Happy</em>, even. A stark contrast to the depressing words he wrote. His writing set crumbled to a sparkling dust, and he was free to stand up. He took the woman&#39;s hand, the one holding the vial, shaking it gently. This was how they showed gratitude in the regions of the West, right?

&quot;I thank you for so intently offering one of your previous assets, for if you hadn&#39;t done so, inspiration would&#39;ve never struck to this extent! While I still do not condemn the act of fighting others, I shall take you up on your offer of a Mana Battery, for you seem determined to make me live for longer than I rightfully deserve—&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A distance voice was heard throughout the junkyard. A researcher, the same Olga had met on her summoning, was running towards the pair with intent. He coughed and sneezed multiple times, interrupting his running each time to regain footing, before finally arriving at his destination, almost tumbling besides the pair.

&quot;Here you go, sir...&quot; The researcher gasped between each word, hardly capable of regaining his breath. &quot;Take these... Mana Batteries... I apologize… Huff…&quot;

The researcher fumbled in his bag, taking out a small storage box, completely empty except for two vials. He almost pushed them onto the poet&#39;s hands, wishing to get out of the fray as quickly as possible. Being in the middle of two Servants must’ve taken a toll on his mental well-being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...as I said, I don&#39;t intend to...&quot; He sighed, noticing the hopeless stare the researcher gave him, almost like a puppy&#39;s. Forgetting to bring a Servant their Mana Batteries would surely earn the researcher an earful from his higher ups, perhaps worse. In a way, walking up to two Servants was the sentence he was stuck with for not doing his job properly.

Grudgingly, the Servant accepted the storage box.

The researcher sighed in relief, thanking the two for their patience and apologizing once more for his lateness. He ran off in the direction he came from, leaving the storage box between the poet&#39;s hands.

&quot;...I guess I won’t be needing yours.” The man said, begrudgingly hiding the two vials in his sleeves. In a way, he had accepted to go through with this nonsense. How pitiable, <em>how saddening</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga frowns harshly as Yorimasa pulls out his writing equipment, part of her worried that even she might have been outplayed and rused...before he just started writing with it. 

&quot;Oh...poetry is your thing...mmkay,&quot; She remarks, the bite in her words and the roll of her eyes evident as to what she thought. Normally. But...this poetry was beautiful. In all her years serving her people, she&#39;d never heard anything quite so flowing, full of inspiration. It was utterly devoid of malice, being made up only of the soothing airs of one that truly longed to see what they wrote. 

&quot;...Was okay, I guess,&quot; she pipes up, just in time for that researcher to come in and offer the other Servant their batteries at last. Well, at least they both had two now...and who could ever forget the inspiration to write such beautiful words? She made some progress, she had to believe that much. 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, and hey, what&#39;d I say about the long face? It&#39;s making me sick, and you don&#39;t wanna alienate the inspiration for such lovely words earlier, do you?&quot; The Aura of dejection lingers around this guy like a lame-o at a bar without a fake ID. At least she might get more of that poetry out of this if they have each other&#39;s backs. &quot;So, how about you stick the long face up your ass and suck it up...ew, nevermind, that sounded way better in my head. But anyway, I wanna hear more about how I&#39;m such a <em>lovely</em> inspiration! So, we&#39;re sort of allies, which means, we can check up on each other every now and then.

As much as Olga tried to cheer him up, it seemed the man went back to his depressive persona almost immediately. This joyous phase certainly was short-lived, enough to make the Russian Saint wonder if she was dealing with a lunatic here. Or at the very least, a total weirdo.

In any case, he extended a hand in her direction.

&quot;Sort-of-allies doesn&#39;t quite cut it, I say we skip the formalities and become <em>friends</em> instead. You may have my back, and I shall have yours. But know that, if I can help it, that I shall have <em>everyone</em> else&#39;s back too, and that I shan&#39;t raise a weapon against anyone lightly either.&quot;

...so he agreed to an alliance, yet insisted that he did not wish to battle anyone? What… an atrocious deal! What was the point of forming an alliance with a Servant that wouldn&#39;t fight. Hell, what was he even good for besides stringing pretty words together, Olga might’ve wondered!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga stares at the offered hand, truly in a spot to consider her next move. Did she ally herself with the poet wimp that didn&#39;t want to even fight?! Bad allegiances...contrary to what some of her other regents and rulers on the throne may have  thought, Olga always saw the potential for problems in any alliance.

What if...she could use him to get rid of some of the others? Worst comes to worst, she can let him die in some battle and stay in the shadows. Win win. If no one knows there&#39;s an assassin, then there&#39;s no reason to expect one...

&quot;...Suuuuuure, dude. Friends.&quot; she says, limply taking his hands and giving it a shake. Hopefully she wouldn&#39;t regret it...after all, this dude had total creep weirdo plastered all over him. 

&quot;As long as we&#39;re being on good terms, then i have one condition. If anyone asks, you do NOT tell them about me. The best option for me is to stay off of people&#39;s radars, so I don&#39;t need you writing and sharing my illustrious beauty.&quot;

He probably didn&#39;t remember ever mentioning her looks to begin with, but he&#39;d be a fool not to notice! She was drop dead gorgeous, dammit!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03-May-22 09:10 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What was he, incredibly dense or incredibly patient? It was difficult to tell.

&quot;I understand, friend. I shan&#39;t disclose your... &quot;

The man&#39;s brow creased in confusion. Now that he thought about it, <em>what was there even to talk about this woman anyway</em>? It wasn&#39;t as if she had disclosed her <em>true name</em> to him, nor did she reveal any details that might bite her later on.

&quot;...existence? To anyone, I guess?&quot;

Or... was she afraid that ill-mannered men would track her down due to her curvaceous assets? <em>Were her looks that dangerous</em>? The man could hardly tell, for he had eyes for his <em>beloved wife</em> only. The charm of other women, though he could casually appreciate, failed to capture him beyond poetry. Perhaps was it Olga&#39;s luck that was the <em>poorest in the Throne</em>, to meet with an ally that didn&#39;t fight nor succumb to her deadly charms.

&quot;...in any case, it seems like we&#39;re set up to fail,&quot; The poet spoke, looking out in the distance. &quot;Regardless of the course of action, death awaits us at the end of the test. Victor or not, the outcome is the same.&quot;

There was something to the poet&#39;s words, Olga could tell. A <em>finality</em> beyond the sadness and the dejection he had shown thus far, as he had already accepted his death mere moments after being summoned.

&quot;I can see you&#39;re planning to survive for as long as you can, <em>even laying the groundwork for future interactions by making alliances with other Servants</em>. That is fine, you may use your time as you see fit, friend...”

The man shot her a look of pity, the same he showed when she was about to give him one of her Mana Batteries.

“...but ultimately, it is unlikely you will keep your life at the end of this, regardless of your struggles. Keep it in mind as you go forward, for that might lessen the burden on your shoulders should it become unbearable.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, at least he was smart, despite it all. He knew the truth behind what was going on here...she knows it too. After all, the researchers had said as much. They were just lab rats. Spinning in place on a stationary wheel, dancing for the &quot;advancement&quot; of humanity. It did seem depressing, after all, just thinking about it. No one could really blame someone for laying down and accepting the harsh reality. 

&quot;...Tell me, Servant. Does the certainty of death truly take away from the splendor of living?&quot; 

For once, the callousness fell away. She had been an air of contradiction before, and the crown merely a pleasant oxymoron to a ditzy airhead. But now, here she was...standing tall as a Regent might. As a true ruler. &quot;I&#39;ve known all my life I was fated to die without the one person I would have loved to lie down beside. It was cruel...living to that moment without them. Even when I felt they were properly remembered and avenged...it never took away the fact that they were gone.&quot; 

She stands still, statuesque. An idol of marble amidst a sea of trash, much like they all were destined to become when history grants you worth remembering. &quot;And yet...I bore that pain. I used it to live. Even when I knew death would come eventually and leave me with what I feared most. The strength to forge ahead...to love every moment of living granted to me...it was because I knew to do otherwise would disgrace life itself.&quot;

She turns to Yorimasa now, eyes sunken and dimmed from their usual jubiliance. She wasn&#39;t just looking to him. She was looking <em>into</em> his core. &quot;To take every moment to survive...even when death comes...I think, even for us, there&#39;s a beauty in that. A chance to breathe the air and feel the sun on our cheeks. A chance to feel pain and sorrow, rage and joy all over again...even if it&#39;s short lived. I&#39;ll fight for that, I think.&quot;

Yorimasa patiently watched as the brazen Servant made a complete 180, from overflowing vitality and exuberance to composed greatness, making abundantly clear the crown atop her head wasn&#39;t just for show. Her thoughts were deliberate, carefully crafted, the outcome of a lifetime of thinking and opposing one&#39;s ideas to others. They had the kind of unshakeable confidence one would expect to find in a Heroic Spirit, the individuality one could hardly strip away with their own ideas.

&quot;Your respect for life is truly a thing of beauty, and while the conclusion at which I personally came to made me lose much taste in life, I respect the conclusion at which <em>you</em> came at... no, even before that, I respect that you’ve come to a conclusion <em>at all</em>, for so many of us have long wandered the earth without sparing as little as a thought to their existence. If you are able to find hope and pleasure in life, then by all means, please survive for as long as you see fit.&quot;

The pity he displayed on his face carefully left as the conversation unfolded, her soul-piercing gaze met with an adequate, polite smile. Acceptance, or perhaps consideration.

&quot;I like the you you&#39;ve just now displayed, friend. As brief as it was, letting go of your <em>vicious, vulgar and unladylike</em> facade was a refreshing sight to behold. I had my doubts at first, but you’ve convinced me. Your wisdom truly feels Sovereign-like.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And just like that, it was gone. 

&quot;I pour my freakin soul out to you, dude, and you, like, totally rip me to shreds?! The hell kind of friend does that?! Do you even know how to have friends?! I bet you just chase them all off with that downer attitude, you poser!&quot; 

She quickly walks back on the brief unveiling of her true self, comfortably retreating back into the <em>facade</em> that this weirdo so thoroughly picked apart. He was smart at least...or was patient enough not to judge. &quot;Besides, if you know that I&#39;m just acting friendly to save my own skin, why even bother allying yourself in the first place? Are you that desperate to keep talking to me? Well, doesn&#39;t matter, cause it&#39;s done! No backsies! We&#39;re in it together now.&quot; 

Finally, she takes the moment to turn, pouting outwardly as she crosses her arms and begins walking away. She needed to get some reconnaissance done...and she was truly tired of being brought down constantly by this dudes attitude...

&quot;...By the by...you said it yourself. There&#39;s some wisdom in what I said. So, and this is honest to gosh truth...I do want you to realize jt for yourself. TTYL.&quot; With that, she left, bounding away from the trash heap to get a good look at her surroundings, and to begin a thorough research into her opponents.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While the poet&#39;s words could&#39;ve been chosen more carefully, to double-down this hard on her &#39;facade&#39; was almost worthy of a whistle. Yorimasa could only watch with a patient smile as she lashed down on him, verbally tearing him apart as payback for his previous harsh description. God, women were scary.

As to the reason why had the man accepted this alliance, knowing well that she sought to use him as a tool for her own survival… Even he wasn&#39;t completely sure. But her curious and sympathetic words suggested he made the right call in seeing this through. Was this what they called &#39;instinct&#39;?

Ultimately, the woman left the heap of trash, no doubt sick of the man&#39;s depressive ramblings. Though, she didn&#39;t fail to leave a final piece of advice before leaving. Without her bombastic chatter, the junkyard quickly fell into oppressive, oppressive silence.

To accept the wisdom behind her words, she had asked.

&quot;...I&#39;ll think about it.&quot; Empty words were whispered to the wind, the Assassin no longer here to catch them.

And thus, <em>Inspiration struck</em>.

Sitting on his knees, the man reached out with both arms. Paper and ink manifested in his hands, which the man deposited quietly on the floor to write. 
<i>
"Western red descends,
Impossible to pass by.
Carefree as may be,
On a withered tree, blossom.
Oh, how I envy them so!"
</i>
Content, the man contemplated the scroll for long minutes. Truly, what an abundant source of inspiration that woman was. He should most definitely check on her, should fate allow them to cross paths again.

Perhaps then, he will have renewed his outlook on life.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
