<em>Something from within the bowels the labs and let out an exaggerated sigh, throwing his hands into the air as it heard the debriefing go about. So, that was why he was summoned, to be apart of this battle Royal. To say he was much interested in it would have been an overstatement. Rather he simply looked around the labs, hoping to find something to work on, or at least a space for him to work on.</em>

“Ah, the place is filthy! Jeez. . . You expect me to work in these conditions? Man, for a tournament to the death you could have at least been a bit more accommodating. What if I wanted to die in a home-esque place. At least clean it up a little~”

<em>The Caster gave himself a moment to size the room up, and then, with a snap, a block of marble had been created from the air, crashing into the linoleum floors with a heavy thud. And with his other hand, a chisel had appeared. Daedalus sized the marble up with a look of almost inquisition, all while muttering to himself on how well it’d work.</em>

“Ah, this should do well. Now. . . A simple tap should make it—“

<em>The Caster tapped his blank canvas, and soon a light had engulfed the room as well, only for the marble slab to take shape and writhe, almost like a snake. . . Until a figure was made. A man with his Trojan helmet still on, on his back a large great sword, his face as unreadable as a blank text. Daedalus clapped madly at the remarkable piece.</em>

“Ah! Once again I’ve done it, I’ve created something so beautiful even Athena couldn’t help but be jealous at it. How do you enjoy my piece now? Better than Arachne, more beautiful than Medusa, more beautiful than you, gods who could really be better at this than me?”

Not a man&#39;s steps, but a <em>Servant&#39;s</em> no doubt.

&quot;This is nice. It&#39;s pretty quiet around here...&quot; The voice said, growing closer and closer. &quot;This one’s inhabited, there seems to be a discussion between two people... this one&#39;s locked... perhaps that one?&quot;

The doors of the Lab opened from the outside as the words were spoken. A man with long hair dressed in loose Asian clothing stood on the other side, looking a little... dejected? Sad? Disappointed? Getting a read on that man&#39;s expressionless face was hard.

&quot;Oh dear.&quot; He exclaimed, freezing upon entry inside the Lab.

His eyes glanced at the marble figure sweeping the floor, then at the man of the hour: Daedalus himself.

&quot;It seems... I&#39;ve made a mistake, I thought this Lab was empty. Excuse my sudden intrusion.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>In the brief moment the doors had opened, Daedalus had set his sculpture ready for its own battle, breaking the broom in half and allowing it to use the ruptured broom for its weapon. The statue’s silent look awaiting the command from the caster. The figure’s look had made Daedalus raise an eyebrow. He wasn’t adorned like a Greek, none that he’d seen at least, and the more flow like clothing had only depicted he had been of a different origin, but it mattered not what he wore, but how he looked. The Father of the Arts’ eyes glanced at the stranger’s expression, the unreadable and unclear look he had returned. Even with his surprise was almost odd, unrelated from his look.</em>

A broom broken in two made for an interesting weapon choice, the poet noted, but ultimately inconsequential as a threat to a Servant. It felt more like a vague threat in the lines of &#39;I will attack should you try something funny&#39; rather than an actual attempt at intimidation.

&quot;...yes,&quot; The poet answered the man&#39;s sarcastic words, earnestly. &quot;It is as you say, this place is indeed inhabited. But fear not, for I do not wish to fight. Not you, nor your automaton, nor <em>anyone else</em>.&quot;

...what&#39;s that? A Servant that didn&#39;t want to fight? How odd. This whole ordeal was supposed to be a Grail War where each Servant would try to best the others and eventually emerge as the one and only victor. To not wish to fight meant, whoever that odd long-haired fella was, that he cared <em>little for his life</em>.

&quot;I was merely looking for refuge, a place to stay. As you might&#39;ve heard from the sounds of battle, the outsides have grown increasingly more violent as the war advanced. I wish not to partake in their senseless violence, and as such, I have chosen to hide amongst the unoccupied Labs. At least for now.&quot;

Dodging Deadalus&#39; intense examination of him, the poet took a good look at the broom-holding figure of marble. As an artist himself, Yorimasa naturally had an eye for art. Although the mediums differed, it was easy to see the experience and the effort behind an artistry when you had put similar efforts into your own craft. The poet momentarily enjoyed the marble figure, before sneaking a glance at the easy-going architect.

&quot;A fine piece,&quot; He said, nodding towards the sculpture. &quot;I&#39;ve respect for men of art, for I know how dreadfully tedious it is to reach the peak of your method. Your figure tells me you&#39;ve honed your art for quite a while, friend.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Ah, so you’re going to sit out? Make a strike? Unionize? Such a bold thing for you.“

<em>Daedalus had been returning his attention towards the statue when he heard the comment about his newest piece, making a slight sour taste flood his senses. So another artist had gone and been summoned? He tried to swallow the feeling, quiet himself before he had gone and sank a boat that easily could have kept him surviving.</em>

“An artist! And one not from home either, to think we’d be able to meet. Yes, yes, I have honed myself quite a bit on these things, but as any good artist, we can only grow better. I must ask, what is it you’ve produced? What is it that you have? I’m curious!”

*A smile had hid the bitter scowl he had, knowing that whatever the man produced was to be lower than his worst sculpture. It was only natural. Natural Artists were born and envied. . .

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m going to sit out.

I can&#39;t take that away from them, but it doesn&#39;t mean I have to partake myself.&quot;

The poet visibly looked troubled by his own words, as if only realizing the foolishness of his fellow Servants after speaking it out loud.  Momentarily lost in thought, he was suddenly made very aware of the two blue vials contained within his robes. Tokens for the coming fights he would inevitably get pulled into. In a twisted, indirect way, he too shared the same foolishness as his fellow Servants, having held onto the two Mana Batteries even after boldly declaring his non-intent to fight.

&quot;...moving on, I&#39;m a poet,&quot; He answered the inventor&#39;s inquiry, replacing his troubled expression with a smile so subtle it could&#39;ve been mistaken for a frown. &quot;Similarly to how you&#39;d string shapes and volumes together to create an art piece, I string together words and let my feelings seep into them.

That, and <em>another unfortunate detail of his life</em>. He decided not to bring it up in this talk, partly to keep his identity secret, mostly because he was already depressed just thinking about it. Bringing it up explicitly would surely worsen his mood even further, a pity considering he was feeling better than usual after his talk with that red-haired monarch. Better ride that high for as long as possible, right until the wave peacefully dies on the shore.

&quot;In any case, wish you to fight as the others?&quot; He asked, curiously eyeing both the broom-wielding figure and its sculptor. &quot;You&#39;re not making a move to engage me in combat, but you don&#39;t seem completely harmless either.

“A respectable profession. . . I truly don’t think I’d have the means for it. . . Sigh, to think others were just so well with the arts as well. Well, I guess that’s a different topic, the world is expansive, knowing that the world during the Gods reign would one day be over, I could only guess that art like this would soon no longer dominate the art world.”

<em>Daedalus mused himself a bit longer, his over dramatic expression playing about with such a small concern for his actual words. But, he refused to let the bridge he’d built burn.

“No no, I don’t think it’d be smart to go against these things especially now. Imagine it, a lone artist like me going against some Brutish berserker? I’d be killed and thrown back into the throne of heroes! It’d be a waste of time! Nope, so I’ll sit back and watch. At least, I plan to.”

<em>Of course Daedalus had heard his comment about how he seemed to be both non agressive but not harmless either. That wasn’t something he wished to indulge in much, especially if he could have found a servant that would be hopefully a future ally.</em>

“Of course, even animals all put up a fight at least when worried. But, you sir, you are completely laxed! I can see you’re quite serious about this strike of yours. . .

Yorimasa picked up on this verbal clue immediately. It seemed to indicate that this Servant had a better time fighting if given time to prepare. He did not wish <em>not</em> to fight, he simply couldn&#39;t at the moment. The poet asked about the Servant&#39;s wish to fight with lingering hope, longing to perhaps meet a like-minded individual amongst these hopeless grounds. Unfortunately, it turned out the sculptor wasn&#39;t that kind of individual.

A little dejected, the poet gestured &#39;no&#39; with his hand.

&quot;Trust me friend, what you mistake for composure is simply <em>acceptance</em>. After all, what is there to fear once you know your end is inevitable? It&#39;s not the first time I feel as such, and considering I shall be summoned again and again from the Throne of Heroes, it certainly won&#39;t be the last either. Stressing out about life when it is doomed to end is foolish.&quot;

...man, what a downer! This poet fellow sure knew how to suck the colors out of life. To speak of death so lightly, as if it didn&#39;t even matter how long one lived. It was like he had no respect for life! For <em>existence, even!</em> Would he even be of any use as an ally in this state, Daedalus could only guess.

&quot;...in any case, I&#39;d be delighted to take you up on your offer,&quot; The poet eventually answered, his lack of enthusiasm clashing with his heartfelt words. &quot;Having a place to stay will ease my burden by a great deal, and for that, I sincerely thank you.&quot;

In tandem with his words, the poet bowed deeply. Well, he might’ve been depressing to listen to, but he was grateful at least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Were all the artists after him such let me downs? Did suffering stop them from working, if an artist were to accept their death, did the art stop with that? He could feel a acidic bile raise in his mouth. Distaste. Disgust. Daedalus yawned as he heard his explanation, showing his little amusement.</em>

“You know my <em>friend</em>, to be this down, you’ll never find someone to read these poems. Had your friends in life known such a depressing sack of skin? I’d hope you were as vibrant as your clothing, and not as dull as your ideals.”

<em>He didn’t seem to be much help in the idea Daedalus had, but he’d work with this. To say he was useless was to say he didn’t have a purpose at all. A body shield. A double. A dummy. A tool. He built many of what he thought wouldn’t be used, and found with just the amount of heat, with enough pressure, they worked.</em>

“But great, doesn’t matter if you’re against fighting, I have but one rule of being here. While we are to have these critics, we do not kill each other. That couldn’t be bad, no? Not at all for a man like you. You wish to not fight, so I can’t say it’d be fun if you fought on my behalf. So, that is something simple enough. . .”

<em>The statue, as if it had had a mind that was truly sentient, heard the rule and dropped the broom that was weaponized before it went to find another to sweep with. Meanwhile the Artist waited for his answer. Of course he hadn’t gotten close to shake or to hug or anything that could have solidified anything for his suspicion, but he clearly was serious on his idea of this rule.</em>

He was right, not killing one another was a condition the poet could easily agree with. If the freeloader didn&#39;t serve any use in combat, Daedalus could at least rest easy knowing he wouldn&#39;t be stabbed in the back. A little peace of mind amongst the madness this mock Holy Grail War erupted forth.

And thus, the snickering, smug artist was willing to let him be. Whether it was kindness or due to ulterior motives, Yorimasa cared little. He had a place to stay, perhaps a new friend too. Even if that new friend was unlikely to consider him as such, it was a pleasant thought to imagine having comrades, even amidst a free-for-all.

Suddenly, the poet&#39;s blas&#233; eyes <em>sharpened</em>. In his hands, scroll and ink materialized. Yes, there was no mistaking it. The fire that burned inside, this welling urge to let loose, that undeniable want to express himself...

<em>It was inspiration that struck!</em>
<i>
Like this I wonder,
Friend or foe, quite uncertain.
Little a blunder,
Even so, fall shall the curtain.
And the end awaits us all.
</i>
The words were spoken and written at the same time, in a tone that made him seem possessed, entranced! The scroll dematerialized and the poet sat down, looking content. Turning to <em>Daedalus</em> while looking content, even.

A fortunate meeting for sure, Yorimasa happily reflected while Daedalus agonizingly sighed...</span></div></div></div></div></div>
