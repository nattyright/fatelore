Staying on the move was the right choice. The pair had yet to see another Servant make a move on them. Not since their encounter with the Frenchman, at least. It was miraculous in a way, to be able to go through this war without having fought once. The poet couldn&#39;t help but thank the gods for the fortune they had bestowed upon him. He had but a simple wish, to go through this experience without causing anyone pain, and it was somehow granted. After all, he would sooner die than do the thing he hates the most. 

...but even without going that far, he was gonna die soon. It was inevitable. A suspicion he had had ever since the words spoken by that scientist right after his summoning. If they couldn&#39;t sample battle data from his fights due to his stubbornness, then he wasn&#39;t of any use to Republic. And this, in turn, meant that <em>deactivation via kill switch</em> was looming over him. It only made sense after all. As is right now, Yorimasa was a literal waste of space. He, as well as every other Servant, had been called in order to test and further humanity&#39;s technological limits. If he was unable to provide for this purpose, then he was no better than the trash at his feet... no, that was wrong. The trash at his feet didn&#39;t consume highly sought for mana batteries to further its own existence, didn&#39;t make a pity of itself each time it encountered one of its brethren and didn&#39;t strike disgust at the mention of hating violence. <em>He was beneath trash</em>.

Once again, he contemplated ending his own life. He had done it once, after all. Perhaps in this new mechanical body, the pain would be dulled.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The two completed one another. Yin and yang, the peace-loving samurai and the aggressively spiteful yokai. Perhaps her existence was the Throne of Heroes&#39; way of making Yorimasa a worthy Servant. Alone, there was little he could do to prevail in battle. He needed a <em>push</em> to fight, and he needed mental stability to properly work. She provided him with both, some much-needed power and with the back of a friend he could fall back to. 

But, if she was truly meant to be a defense mechanism, then how come she couldn&#39;t lift his spirits up? The two were friends. Close friends. They chatted endlessly as they evaded enemy Servants and her shenanigans never failed to take his mind off of things. They hit the shit often, even had a few laughs. Then, why did he still feel sad? She didn&#39;t understand. She <em>couldn&#39;t</em> understand. She lacked human feelings, after all. The best she could do to help was to provide a distraction, in an effort to ease his burden ever so slightly.

But this wasn&#39;t enough right now. She knew he was on the brink. She couldn&#39;t handle him alone. She was unable to. Not anymore. She needed help... something, anything!

Excruciatingly so. The Queen Regent&#39;s body was working to mend her wounds, but something from those beams must have been especially toxic and potent, because as it stood, she was finding it hard to keep going. 

Like her friend not too far off from her current hiding spot, she had tried to stay on the move. Her presence in the war had not been especially eventful. She was more impactful on her feet, and less on her skill, but with the way things had been working out, it might not be long before those scientists figured she just wasn&#39;t worth the trouble and gave her the execution. 

Maybe that wouldn&#39;t be so bad, but what if Yorimasa was left on his own? The girl, Nue; she could maybe protect him, but how much data would that provide in full? How long before she was considered just another faulty tool? Mimir and Lovecraft likely gave plenty of data...same for that Lancer that Spectacle had told her about. But how valuable was she? 

&quot;God, I&#39;d even savor a fuckin bullet to my head right now, the hell did that Caster do to me?&quot; She whines, lightly touching her wound and recoiling from the sting, whimpering slightly, but just loud enough to be heard by someone too close.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nue&#39;s ears picked the voice first, twitching on reflex as she turned her head towards the general direction of their surprise guest. Yorimasa&#39;s reaction was slower. He was barely able to recognize the crude words when Nue was already running full speed towards Olga&#39;s whereabouts.

&quot;<strong>I got attached!</strong>&quot; The yokai screamed as she found the bloody remnants of the regent queen, barely glancing at the wound on her leg as she jumped into a hug. &quot;Fuck, you can&#39;t believe how happy I am to see you right now. Like <em>really</em> happy.&quot;

The speed and ferocity of such affection might have made Olga briefly show a flutter of her own, if not for the absolute pain that Nue&#39;s advances brought, as her paws dug into the bloodied and scratched up remnants of her frame. 

&quot;Oomph, okay, alright, I&#39;m glad to see you too but-urk-okay, I need a bit of space, girl, scooch the butt.&quot; 

She leans back against her pile of rubbish, noting the look on Yorimasa&#39;s face and the look of worry. Or maybe it was disapproval. Disgust? Eh, who has time to check. 

&quot;You should see the other two,&quot; she remarks, chuckling a bit before grimacing from the effort it took to show a small amount of joy. &quot;Oh, that hurts, shit...&quot;

But at least they were okay. They didn&#39;t seem the worse for wear, which was good. At the very least Honda hadn&#39;t found them before biting the bullet, though that only made her worried about their future safety if they ran into the bastards who did him in. 

&quot;So, I guess maybe you were in the right all along. That pacifist and poetry&#39;s been keeping you trucking, while violence...breeds violence. Fuck, can&#39;t believe I said that, only 30 seconds I&#39;ve seen you and you&#39;ve got me waxing poetically myself.

&quot;But even still,&quot; she remarks, tilting her head slightly to hold Yorimasa in her gaze, eyes flashing as she thinks about faces from a long time past, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t run into what I did...&quot;</span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCttg6ZddZwfsKmMjyJnbcyw><div class=chatlog__embed-author>LegalSaiga</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aalI-pmhgb4"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Silent Hill 2 OST - Alone In The Town</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aalI-pmhgb4 width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Squatting in front of them so the two could be on eye level, Nue clutched her legs together and observed the wounds more closely. Yikes. And the &#39;other two&#39; had been worse off than this? She couldn&#39;t help but whistle at the thought.

&quot;Tell us what happened?&quot; She asked with expectancy, the curiosity almost oozing out of her eyes. &quot;How long ago did that happen? Who&#39;s the guy who was strong enough to do you dirty like that? And most importantly, <em>did you win?</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga absently brushes a hand through Nue&#39;s hair, repositioning herself to maintain at least a semblance of her regality. It wasn&#39;t much, but she was making the effort, it still counts. Was better than just lounging like some form of potato with a busted skin. &quot;Anyway, two Casters...some Aesir, I can&#39;t imagine who honestly, but the other one...I stared a God or Being in the eyes and saw the very edge of sanity melt away. And do you wanna know what I said? I said &quot;Fuck you.&quot; Right to a giant monster and tree beard&#39;s face. Even went so far as to blow them both up. I imagine they survived, but that pile of meat shot me before I got the deed done. Must&#39;ve been something nasty, &#39;cause this leg ain&#39;t getting any prettier.&quot; 

She racks her thoughts, focusing intently on Yorimasa&#39;s words. The most pessimistic angle to take, of course. She would survive...and he would die. That mat very well be true...or, she might exist longer than him at least...

&quot;...heh, you know...killing the Queen that took on two towering monsters would earn you a few points with those researchers, don&#39;t you think? I mean...I&#39;m good for maybe one more brawl. Maybe.

&quot;Who do you take me for?&quot;

The two spoke at the same time, talking on top of one another in an intelligible mess of words. After that exchange, Nue was the first to take over.

&quot;Do you seriously expect this guy,&quot; She said as she pointed to Yorimasa. &quot;To not only fight, but <em>kill</em> one of his <em>friends</em>? And for what purpose, to <em>further his own life?</em> That&#39;s gotta be the stupidest thing I&#39;ve heard in my entire life. Oh my god.

My record is dry, I haven&#39;t taken up arms against anyone thus far. And even if it did provide, surviving would basically mean living to fight another day. <em>Why would I ever want that?</em>&quot;

Nue looked at Yorimasa, shrugging her shoulders in answer to his question. The queen&#39;s deal clearly didn&#39;t make sense to them, to the extent where they almost felt <em>insulted</em>, no matter how good her intentions were when she made it.

&quot;But on the subject of deals,&quot; The poet said as he approached the pair, reaching for something inside his sleeve. &quot;This was your second fight, wasn&#39;t it? It means you&#39;re probably close, or have already exhausted the two mana batteries provided to you by the researchers...&quot;

Out of his sleeve came two blue vials. <em>Mana batteries</em>. The ones he had been entrusted with at the very beginning of the war, the lifelines he was supposed to hold onto to survive. They looked pristine, full, completely and utterly new. Unsurprising since it was no secret the poet didn&#39;t intend to use them. He said as much when the researcher first proposed to take them, after all.

The poet tossed them at Olga, but it was Nue who suddenly stood up and grabbed them with both hands.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were a few times when Yorimasa had been privvy to the true nature of the Queen Regent. Soft whispers that leak through an otherwise iron clad facade of vulgarity and scattered brain knowledge. 

This was not the case here. This was force, plain and simple, of a queen exercising her authority over subjects. 

&quot;Even if I wanted to extend this painfully boring existence, why would it be through your batteries? Do I strike you as the kind of girl who takes charity? I give charity. I take what I desire. If I wanted them, I would already have them.&quot; 

Her glare sharpened at Nue&#39;s advances, though a look at the girl made Olga soften, shrinking back while bringing a temple to her head. 

&quot;Listen...I just...I&#39;m tired. This whole charade is exactly what you called it, dude: a facade. It&#39;s not at all what I figured it might be...it&#39;s just pointless. I only have one goal, and from what I see, there&#39;s no use in me even being around because...you don&#39;t need me.&quot; 

She turns away from them both, pondering the past few days, the past few battles, the personalities she clashed against in her pursuit of one purpose. 

&quot;I wanted you to see the value of life, dude. No matter the cost. And look at me. I&#39;m like an example of how NOT to do it. I wanted you to see more in your time, like...my son. My husband. Both who I wish I could&#39;ve given my own life for so that they could smile as a summer breeze passes through their hair. My son...I don&#39;t know if he was happy after I died, but I wanted to give that chance to you...who knows if they&#39;ll let us live. But I just wanted the chance to be there...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cease, she ordered. Right as she was about to help her heal. 

What the fuck was her problem? Nue was so angry, a vein threatened to burst around her temple. She stomped once, taking a decisive step towards the monarch. In her hands, the blue vials threatened to crack open due to her strong clenching. She was clearly having none of this.

&quot;The fuck you mean, you could&#39;ve taken them if you wanted to? Can you please cut the fucking queen bit for one second while we work on saving your ungrateful ass?

She kept her mouth shut, but still pouted as she looked away from the queen.

&quot;...so that&#39;s how it is.&quot; 

Is this what she saw in him? A substitute for her family, a means to rectify a mistake from her past life, a way of clearing her doubts and regrets? This was wrong. This <em>felt</em> wrong. He had to say something, and so, he spoke.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about your family,&quot; He whispered, pulling Nue back a step. &quot;But... I am not them. I commend you for trying to make me see the good in life, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to.&quot;

&quot;I once lived a long life, and I have experienced many things in it. In the end, the conclusion I came at is that life wasn&#39;t worth making a fuss about. It&#39;s gonna be painful more often than joyful, it&#39;s gonna be boring a hell of a lot more than interesting. Some people are fine with that. Some people can find goals and meaning to their lives. Good for them, <em>but I&#39;m just not the same</em>.&quot;

A sick and tired smile came to him as the things he so often chose to ignore came rushing to his head like a flood. This was almost unbearable, how truly sad this all was. No amount of distractions would make him forget now, this second chance at life was so messed up. Life was so messed up in general. So messed up he couldn&#39;t believe how messed up it was. His grip tightened on Nue&#39;s shoulder as he continued, almost quivering .

&quot;I&#39;m not cut out for life... heh, I am so inept at life that even as a Servant I need a little monster to keep me company, or else I might end my own days I&#39;m so damned inept...&quot;

He let the words hang for a few seconds, staring the monarch right in the eyes. He wasn’t about to tear up, but there was no lack of strong emotions in his eyes. 

“Which is why I <strong>need</strong> a friend, or else I’m afraid I won’t make it. Do you understand, friend?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Have you written anything recently?

She made her choice. Despite his obvious hinting at needing her by his side, she remained unchanged in her resolve. Perhaps he was being too vague with his words, or perhaps she took the hint but steeled herself to not do this. Either way, the poet was fine with the outcome. He already made peace with whatever awaited him after this little exchange.

&quot;I have two pieces,&quot; He admitted as he pulled a scroll out of his sleeve, kneeling on his knees. &quot;The first one came to me as I witnessed the last moments of an elderly on the battlefield. It is still unnamed.&quot;

Pointing his palms to the sky, the scroll laying open in-between them, the poet slowly chanted the verses.
<i>
"Alas, the old drops,
And succumbs to the blackness.
Feasting in ugly pain,
Such is the way of this life.
...may you find the way to bliss."

Stroke after stroke, the poet carefully laid the black liquid on the paper. This was gonna be his last piece, one he felt good about. So good in fact, he softly smiled as he spoke it.
<i>
"With the twilight near,
Reaching makes no difference.
Though my wish unheard,
I find solace as I lay."
</i>
As he approached the end of the poem, Yorimasa pushed his writing equipment aside and knelt deeply towards the queen regent, his hands joined and his forehead in contact with the ground. Absolute gratitude.

"...thank you for the time we spent."

To have him kneeling before her. To have Nue crying from the abject truth that neither of them would make it. It wasn&#39;t self-preservation so much as hopelessness...they would both die like this. Both being so far apart, yet so grateful to each other, all because Olga chose to keep herself high on a pedestal, desperate not to make the mistakes she made in life, and desperate for someone else to live in her place. 

She takes the words, pressing a hand to her chest lovingly as she absorbs it all, hoping that this would be something she takes with her to the Throne. This feeling of regret, and this feeling of love that goes beyond a family or partner. This love that forms between two people from such different backgrounds, separate lives that culminate in this moment of gratitude. 

But that can&#39;t be how it ends. 

With great effort and a gasp of pain, she rolls onto her knees, the queen Regent sucking at her teeth as her muscles flex and remind her of what was missing. But she fights through it. Because a queen is fine with disappointing her subjects. But she couldn&#39;t be okay with this. Not when it was her...<strong>friends.</strong>

She lowers her own head, a wave of nausea coming over her as she mimics Yorimasa&#39;s pose. This wasn&#39;t a bow, she came to realize. It was an extension of feelings. Deep feelings that could only be expressed should one let them pass through. 

<em>&quot;A fool is brought low,
By words so dear and foreign.
I do...I do not accept
This painful and bitter end.&quot;</em>

She looks back up, her own eyes glassy but a soft smile spreading across her face before looking to Nue. 

&quot;One. Give me one, because I don&#39;t even know if 2 will make me explode, and I need something or else I&#39;m going to scream from kneeling like this. Is this customary where you&#39;re both from, because I may think you&#39;re nothing but sadists...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Never in a billion, even.

As such, he could only watch as the words failed to leave his mouth. It was as if his throat was crushed, unable to produce the faintest of sounds, unable to reciprocate the queen&#39;s feelings. But, he too was smiling now, and not in a sad way.

Somehow, they were able to get through to her. Right as he thought he accepted her fate, he was surprised to find a wave of relief wash over him when she took back her previous command. As it turned out, the poet wasn’t completely honest with himself…

A deafening scream, uncaring to the current mood.

&quot;You guys are morons! You&#39;re fucking morons!&quot; Nue lashed out, getting up with difficulty from the ground. &quot;We have... we have enough batteries for you... why did you not accept them at first! Why&#39;d you have to be so damn difficult, god dammit! God <em>dammit!</em>&quot;

Hiccups followed every word of the yokai, her brow now creased more deeply than ever before. The stupidity of the two humans in front of her brought within her a rage that almost overwhelmed the crying and the relief. Why did they have to make it so difficult? Wasn&#39;t this whole ordeal <em>simple</em>? Why bring up family and friends and life and stupid poems when <em>no one had to die</em>! This was simple, so simple! An onslaught of tears ran down her reddened cheeks as she pointed to Yorimasa with an index.

&quot;And you, why didn&#39;t you try persuading her otherwise?! You&#39;re her fucking <strong>friend</strong>, aren&#39;t you?! Why don&#39;t you act like one instead of bathing in your own misery at each opportunity you get! You guys make me so fucking angry, I can&#39;t believe it!&quot;

I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE IT! Nue screamed again, bursting open the cap of a mana battery with her finger. This time, she jumped straight to Olga&#39;s side and shoved it in her mouth, appearances be damned. There was no taking back what she said, she would either drink it or choke on it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They were going to die regardless. Definitely. But the certainty of dying is what made those moments special. To enjoy one&#39;s time with like-minded individuals, to find comfort and relief in other people. Perhaps this was the meaning Yorimasa longed for in life... or perhaps this was just a way for him to feel good about himself in his last moments. No matter. This felt good. This situation felt <em>right</em>. This was as far as he was going to think about it. No more overthinking, 

While Olga and Nue wrestled one another, Yorimasa comfortably laid beside them, hands beneath his head, watching over the dusk that was starting to settle in the skies.

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to that,&quot; He whispered, calmly closing his eyes as he relaxed. &quot;I&#39;ll need to relearn how to deal with these kinds of arguments. Please teach me well...&quot;

As his mind worked, he was surprising to realize a crucial detail: <em>he had yet to learn the woman&#39;s name</em>. And she had yet to learn his, didn&#39;t she? This wouldn&#39;t do. He opened his eyes, turning to look at the pair with what seemed to be a mix of confusion and amusement.

&quot;That&#39;s right... I&#39;m Yorimasa, son of Nakamoto, of the Minamoto clan. I know it is a little late for that, but... may I hear your name, friend?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Olga,&quot; she says without hesitation, her cheek nestling against Nue&#39;s wild hair as she runs a hand through it, allowing herself to embrace the moment fully. &quot;I am Olga of Kiev, Queen Regent of Kievan-Rus. But Olga is fine, &#39;cause let&#39;s be real, there&#39;s not much else I can be a queen of at the moment...I&#39;m just a girl, chilling with a poet and a monster. And I kind of want to keep it that way right now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Yorimasa said, turning back to look at the skies. &quot;Be whatever you want, Olga. You&#39;ve spent an eventful few days. This is your well-deserved break.&quot;

And thus, the three friends stuck together atop the grassy field. Forgetting all about the war and the experiments for an instant, relishing in a fleeting yet beautiful moment of silence and satisfaction.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
