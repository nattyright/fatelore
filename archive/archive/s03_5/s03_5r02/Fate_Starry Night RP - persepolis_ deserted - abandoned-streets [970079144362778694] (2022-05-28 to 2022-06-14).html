A faint, violet, nebula-esque haze shimmered in the area. As one expected, there was nobody to be seen or heard from in these parts. You would have to be confident in your abilities, or a fool, to willing confront a Caster in their territory, especially one so brazenly shown off to anyone nearby. 

Either that, or it was the environment itself that drove people away.

Flesh that had no start nor end, lined in a thin layer of what could only be described as a viscous slime.

Mouths that were constantly agape, pleading for help but with no voice to carry their thoughts out.

Eyes that scanned the area around them sporadically for a way out, only to find no escape in this hellish prison of theirs. 

Teeth that gnawed and snapped at anything close enough to wander too close, even if all they bit down on was air.

 Tendrils swayed to the whims of an invisible wind current. Small hooks poked out and lined the sides, with either an eye or a claw adorning the end.

All of things erupted forth from various spots of the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#abandoned-streets</span> which remained in Caster&#39;s Territory. Like small pockets of a hellish nightmare that was pouring into the world thanks to the <strong>Territory Creation</strong> skill of this Caster. 

If one stayed long enough, one could swear that they could feel scratches and whispers inside the deepest corners of their mind. But surely that was simply the jitters getting to them...right?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-980545097907204127 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=980545097907204127><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-May-22 04:56 AM">04:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Horrors were always just horrors, forever locked away in her mind, deep within her subconscious. Deep within her own thoughts, to be locked away behind her own imagination. 

And here...her mind was on full display. Every terror that she&#39;s witnessed etched onto the very world around her. All she can say was...

&quot;Ugh, edge lords. Just what I needed...&quot; 

Presence Concealment does wonders, even deep within a Caster&#39;s territory. So long as the old fart could take pressure off her, she could be free to explore and make her way to the source of this madness...and talk sweet nothings into that ear. 

The guy seemed nice, he really did. But what she witnessed brought one thing to her mind; this was a battle between Casters, pools of Mana being used against each other. And while she could totally, <em>totally</em> take care of both...well, that was just it, she was. She had enough resources to help both Casters in this fight, and enough know how to stay two steps ahead. If both survived, hell, she had two allies to aid her. If one died, even better, she had a secure alliance. If they both died, that was two potentially dangerous figures off of the chess board. She had to play her cards right to make this work in her favor...and a certain poet&#39;s favor. 

<em>I&#39;ll be watching from the shadows. If he thinks it&#39;s only you, that gives us an advantage. Keep me a secret,</em> she had told the old bastard, herself currently dashing across the eldritch rooftops for a particular vantage point, Scouting for whatever Caster was behind this.

Olga had a reasonable reaction of disgust at the horrors surrounding them. Mimir on the other hand looked like a kid in a candy store. He took note of each clamping mouth and wandering eye. The tendrils took an intense amount of willpower for Mimir to not reach out and grab them. 

&quot;How wonderful a mind this Caster must have. I cannot wait to come face to face with them. Do you suppose they&#39;re a fan of wine? I&#39;d love to chat over some cloudberry wine... Oh yes I am &#39;alone&#39; hoo hoo&quot; Mimir giggled as he spoke out loud, remembering Olga was supposed to be hiding. No matter, he&#39;d just pretend to be a crazy man talking to himself.

&quot;Caster are you around. I&#39;ve brought fine Asgardian cloudberry wine!&quot; Mimir would call out to caster as he wondered his territory, all while trying to keep note of Olga&#39;s movements.

Olga, fortunately, did not have any of these issues. Her <strong>Presence Concealment</strong> did the job well with keeping her hidden.

The lack of any signs of struggle or battle left it up in the air on whether or not Caster was the one who disposed of this mysterious Servant or not. All they simply did was stare at the remains in contemplation. Their featureless mask robbed any amount of emotions one could glean from them. 

It was a perfect opportunity to attack! One that was ruined however when Caster perked their head up upon hearing the loud voice of Mimir approaching them. 

&quot;Oh? Another guest so soon?&quot; The peculiar sight of Mimir caught Caster off guard a little, as if he didn&#39;t have an odd get-up himself. He turned to face them, arms still being their back, as a malicious, nightly, aura seeped out of them. One that appeared to warp the very area around them. The distance between them meant neither had to raise their voice to talk, but always allowed for a blanket of security to be had as well.

&quot;Asgardian Cloudberry wine? Why, I can&#39;t say that I ever had anything of the sort before.

Grimacing and seething internally at Mimir&#39;s lack of tact, Olga figures this might be the perfect spot to rest and survey for a moment. Especially considering that the enemy Caster was none too shy about revealing themselves. She had been expecting a castle or a palace, but it seems like this hellscape <em>was</em> the palace. So maybe she had been right before: some kind of bounded field? Either way, she&#39;d wait to see who struck first, though the worst case scenario would be if they...ugh...were friendly...

Mimir would bite down on his lip, watching the violet whisps permeate the air. He could tell that this Servant was considerably strong. Not only was he strong but Mimir had walked right into his territory, how exciting! 

&quot;Why yes! A good guest always brings a gift to thank their host!&quot; Mimir put his arms behind his back pulling the bottle of wine seemingly out of thin air. His right hand remind behind his back flashing an &#39;ok&#39; symbol at Olga as if he were saying &#39;trust me&#39;. 

Mimir moved his right hand back in front of his body now bearing two wooden cups. He tilted the bottle of wine pouring a drink for each caster. &quot;Come get it before it spoils, this old man means no harm.&quot; As Mimir spoke he held out a cup for Caster to come take.

Perhaps it was folly to think that there would be willing participants out there. If there were then what purpose did his existence truly serve? 

&quot;<em>hehehehe</em>...&quot;

No. There would be no point in his existence if there were already others willing to accept the truth out there without the need of his intervention.

Lancer proved it. That foolish corpse showed it. Mimir all but confirmed it. Caster would get nowhere by simply offering it to them. The answer was simple, really.

I promise you that you won&#39;t be leaving here without being granted the truth you came here looking for!&quot; The aura around Caster pulsed and began to reach out in unpredictable flares, as if something on the other side attempted to use Caster as an anchor point to crawl through. 

He knew not of what Mimir&#39;s runes had in store for him. Not that it was of any worry to Caster; for he held the homefield advantage.

&quot;Here! Allow me to grant you a glimpse into my Truth! <strong>Cosmic Horrors from Beyond! Feast once more, Hound of Tindalos!</strong>&quot; Caster&#39;s skill activated and he raised his hand into the air. A mound of flesh as black as night formed on from his hand until a monstrous maw of a malformed creature, nearly as large as Caster himself, tore itself into existence. In a bloodcurdling howl, the beast opened its jaws and spewed out a mass of starry projectiles into the air. These orbs created a false night sky before each one suddenly flew towards Mimir; each carrying an explosive payload.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-982158809273352212 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=982158809273352212><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Jun-22 03:48 PM">15:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga nods at Caster&#39;s move, stretching slightly before darting across the rooftops for a better vantage point. So, this was a powerhouse they were dealing with. The plan seemed pretty simple: neither Caster knew her abilities. Only Mimir knew she was there, meaning, any support she provided could easily be mistaken as Mimir&#39;s own abilities. Meanwhile, she needed to find a way to get on Horror&#39;s good side. First things first, get some info. 

&quot;I kind of doubt that&#39;s gonna be enough to take you out, geezer. Show me a little of what you got in that tank, THEN I can start working some magic...&quot;

Step 1: Lock down Horror. If his magic starts off THIS big, odds are his Noble Phantasms would be no joke. It might be easier to lock those from the start if Mimir proves tougher than he looked. If not...well, at least a fireworks show would be in order.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seemed he too was a man who found joy In his work. Yes, Mimir could tell just by Caster&#39;s territory. Not only was Caster strong, but his mind was a menace in its own right. Often times the two attributes complimented each other. 

&quot;That is a fascinating trick Caster!&quot; Mimir rejoiced as the mound of flesh grew and animated, a creature of horror being birthed right in front of him. &quot;Do not disappoint me! I expect to leave here a newly educated man! Hoo hoo!&quot;

Mimir taunted his opponent as the explosive stars flew his way. Enamoured by the hounds and stars beauty, he almost wanted to let them make contact. 

Just as the stars approached a wall of stone erected through the floor pushing through the fleshy mounds on the floor. The stone curved inward meeting at a single point encasing Mimir in a dome of solid rock. The defensive spell was quick and efficient. 

As soon as the payload would make contact with the rocks, two large roots about four feet in width at the base would extend from the ground, twisting into wooden lances as they extended rapidly at Caster. 

Mimir did not know if the payloads would make it through his rocky shield, however, he hoped to use Caster&#39;s own explosion as a distraction to strike with his roots. 

As for Olga, now that the fight had begun he had no way to be on watch for her. Mimir could only hope that she stuck to his side.

Caster tore their arm from the wet fleshy mound of his summoned hound as they faded into same haze that cursed the air. &quot;I am more than welcome to enlighten you, should you surv-!&quot; The celestial dust that the explosions produced created the perfect cover for Mimir&#39;s roots to launch their assault through. It caught Caster off guard. A quick application of Magecraft allowed Caster to leap away from the incoming lances. 

Of course they had to be resemble lances. Even now he&#39;s reminded of that accursed Lancer. 

<em>Drip</em>

Caster felt his hand against his side. A warm oozing liquid came forth of it and onto his gloves. &quot;Tsk..&quot; One of the lances struck true against him. 

&quot;It appears both of us have some learning to do...&quot; The lack of any combat experience clearly placed Caster at a disadvantage in these situations. Fortunately, he was getting used to this strange new body he was given. 

Caster amassed Mana into his palm before launching five Gandr-like projectiles towards the dome to draw out Mimir. While they weren&#39;t tracking, nor powerful as his last spell, they provided a simple tool to use. Even if Caster wasn&#39;t a proper Magi, <strong>Forbidden Knowledge (Eldritch)</strong> gave Caster the tools of an experienced Magi at his fingertips.

A blur of feathers plume around Horror as a bird dances through the air around the Caster. Where had this come from? Of course, this wasn&#39;t the main intent; it was a brief flurry of power before the bird lands comfortably in the nook of Caster&#39;s broken armor...<strong>and ignites.</strong>

Mimirs palms would illuminate a brighter shade of green, a gust of wind pushing the smoke and debris out of his way. Fighting blind would be hard without his song of wisdom. The smoke clearing out brought the projectiles to Mimirs attention. Caster was taking a blind shot at him. 

&quot;No matter&quot; Mimir mumbled pushing himself up in the air. The projectiles where to close to properly dodge, flying over them was much easier. 

The god peered down at Caster, the wounds on Mimir now visible from the air. A red fluid soaked into his robes. If Caster payed attention he would see berry bushes where Mimir had been standing. What where they for? 

&quot;That monster of yours was very enticing, I haven&#39;t seen creatures of that sort since the age of gods. You are very interesting!&quot; Mimir rejoiced at the abilities of his foe, surely more amazing things where to come.

Wind. Stone. Fire. And, erm, Berries?. 

His Magecraft was formidable. A True Magi from the Age of Gods. 

This was the second opponent Caster met that gave him a run for his money. Of course, for someone who wandered so confidently into Caster&#39;s Territory, did he really expect anything different?

Caster feverishly attempted to snuff out the flames on his wound. The flames seared it, nearly causing him to crumble forward. &#39;<em>No. Can&#39;t use that. He&#39;s airborne. Too early for the other option either. I need to buy some time..</em>&#39; Caster thought to himself. Mimir&#39;s Magecraft appeared to him to be versatile, covering a lot of ground well, while his own was more specialized. 

&quot;These things are from beyond that Age. Allow me, as their chosen Prophet, to show you more!&quot; Caster spoke through gritted teeth from the pain brought on from the flames. &quot;<strong>Cosmic Horrors from Beyond! Tear them asunder, Eye of Cy&#228;egha!</strong>&quot;

Caster&#39;s aura bled skywards as he held onto his wound with both of his hands. It pooled about five feet above his head into an orb which birth forth tendrils in every direction. They lashed out at the reality they were placed in before an eye entered through the center mass of the orb. This Eye&#39;s gaze had no blindspots. Wherever anyone had line-of-sight of it, the Eye had line-of-sight to them.

Unlike the weakened version they used against Lancer, this one didn&#39;t have a singular beam. No. Its desecrating gaze affected everything the Eye could catch in it&#39;s line-of-sight. Just like with the weaker one though, Mundane objects were not affected...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-984167271935131729 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=984167271935131729><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Jun-22 04:49 AM">04:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As like an ant before the impending boot of the towering gods that are humanity, Olga felt her entire being shrink as the Caster summoned forth some being from outside of her understanding of the cosmos. The Church alone was something she had to take time to get used to...the looming eye that presented the buzz of watchfulness cast her mind in an air of unwavering sight. Truly...this was from beyond her comprehension. 

&quot;...Right, well, unless baldy can do...<em>that,</em> I&#39;d say there&#39;s a clear winner here. Which means it might be time to hedge our bets. 

The bird nestled against the Caster of horrors seared and burrowed its Flames deep against his flesh, enough to impart a desperate measure from the Caster. Wasting no time the bird takes  the moment to enact a final vengeance; <strong>eruption.</strong> 

An explosion rolls from Caster&#39;s wound, an effort to cripple the being...while Olga sets her sights on Mimir....and tried to quickly get the hell out of sight of the giant orb.

Mimir flew through the air finding a lamp post to take cover from the beam exiting the eye. He lowered himself to the ground, there was no point in moving from his hiding spot against such a thing. 

Mimir thought for a moment his curiosity the getting the better of himself. He slowly reached his hand out from the lamp post the appendage getting eviscerated. He pulled his wrist back regrowing his hand a fingers. &quot;Ho ho! How impressive, even more grotesque then the last. I wonder, if I kill it will you show me more?!&quot; Mimir clasped his hands together the rune on his right palm changing form, it&#39;s color becoming a deep red. 

The god flung his hands around the lampost towards the eye and caster. Flame and fluctuations of wind fought against one another, explosions errupting down the street as they approached the monster. Glass windows shattered and the street between the two servants would turn to rubble as Mimirs attack stretched across the battlefield.

&quot;Okay...sorry gramps, but that just sealed the deal. Let&#39;s see which one of you buckles first.&quot; 

Gathering her strength, Olga summons 4 of her birds, gathering her mana in both as she proceeds with her plan, sending a violet, wisping light towards the God, and red ball of fury towards the maniac. 

Lighting on his chest, the violet light consumes and covers Mimir in a dark aura, coiling about his limbs as he feels a strange sensation. Almost as if his body was pulling at the world around him...which was emphasized by a rather large boulder of debris slamming into the lampost in an attempt to smash his body. 

Meanwhile, for Horror, a red smog wreathes itself around his frame, ebbing and pulsing in tandem with the maelstrom of horror surrounding him this very moment. There was a slight chill running across his chest, digging deep into his core...something was happening...was this the fellow Caster&#39;s doing?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was so beautiful! He could cry tears of joy from the mere sight of it! Actually, the tears might be because of the pain he is feeling, either way that didn&#39;t matter to him much. He was too far gone to care!

Line of thought was halted though when he noticed something else. An increase of Mana in the air was felt by him. The surge of mana on the bird gave Caster enough time to think of a single phrase; &quot;oh shit.&quot; 

<strong>BOOM</strong>

An explosion saw Caster flying back and tumbling on the ground. His side was charred from the blast as a revelation dawned upon him. &quot;You aren&#39;t alone, are you?&quot; Caster spoke through the pain with a crazed chuckle coming out of him, despite the pain it caused him to do so. 

Then Mimir destroyed the eye with their attack. The eye was too damaged by the rules of this Reality and from his attack to remain for much longer. Though Caster had more immediate concerns to worry about as flames pushed him further back.

As he coughed and got up, charred and smoking from the attack, Caster stared at Mimir with a piercing gaze. &quot;Of course! <strong>That</strong> is why you were so confident! So who is it? Another Caster? No. Can&#39;t be. I can&#39;t sense them anywhere. You have an <em>Assassin</em> somewhere hiding, don&#39;t you?!&quot; The chuckle rose until it burst out in complete maniacal laughter. To think he was tricked into believing he was alone for so long! 

Slowly, but surely, Caster brought himself up on unstable knees. The wound he received was made worse since it was upon a previous one. The flames from Mimir sizzled and smoked. 

Then the Curse from the red smog struck him. 

The effects reverberated across his body. His vision blurred for a second as he felt his mana leak out of him. Even with the Territory reducing the cost of his spells, a Caster is nothing without their stores of Mana. They needed to end this <em>now</em> since they didn&#39;t know how much it would leak out of him.

No matter. I will not have the likes of you ruining my wondrous scheme! <strong>Neither of you will!</strong>&quot; Whatever belief that Caster may have some amount of sanity in there somewhere was killed on the spot as they held out their hands to the side while his blood dripped onto the ground. Caster could give a Berserker a run for their money in terms of Madness it seems like. 

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">**True Name Release...***</code>

A deep rumbling was felt as Caster seemingly released the valves on his Mana stores after speaking those words, allowing it to pour out of him in an inky blackness which flooded the streets. The flare of power was intense. Did Caster intend on bringing this entire place with them?

&quot;Allow me as the Father of Cosmic Horror, <strong>H.P. Lovecraft</strong>, bring forth into the world a being of true beauty!&quot;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">**Grand Ascension of the Ancient Ones: The Awakening of the Old Ones!**</code>

Caster continued his line of insane laughter before falling back into the sea of inky blackness that covered the streets, appearing to sink further into it until his body could no longer be seen, nor his echoing laughter be heard, in the depths below. The ground remained as hard and solid as ever despite Caster falling through it.

While they were given a moment of respite, the rumbling only grew stronger as something stared back, should they stare into the abyss below...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-984261784087195688 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=984261784087195688><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Jun-22 11:04 AM">11:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Olga. She had betrayed Mimir. However it seemed she was also attacking Caster. &quot;Should&#39;ve learned not to make peace after the first time.&quot; He muttered under his breath remembering the day his head was severed.

<em>Clang clang clang</em> sounds of metal clashing rang out as object slammed the lampost. Object where flying right towards Mimir. What seemed like a one sided fight to Mimir had completely changed. The battle was becoming chaos from Olga&#39;s intervention. Mimir held his arms up as objects battered him, his attention split from his target. 
 
Mimirs attention would only be drawn away for a moment. The rumbling coming from the ground was hard to ignore. The black aura bleeding into the ground was even more concerning. Whatever Olga did to Caster prompted him to pull out something large. 

Mimirs eyes peered into the black abyss which Caster sunk. Objects from Olga kept colliding into and breaking his makeshift body. Mimir had no choice but to use it, <em>The Song of Wisdom</em>. He had sworn it off but this moment needed to be an exception. He could not die here, there was too much to do. 

A feint glow covered the Aesir&#39;s eyes, his conscience receding deep into his mind for a split second revealing the truth of Lovecrafts abyss. A silence fell upon the battlefield amidst the chaos. A large grin formed across Mimirs face &quot;HOOO HAHAHAHAHA&quot; a laugh to match Lovecraft&#39;s left his mouth.

&quot;MOCKERY!&quot; He shouted laughs still escaping. &quot;You have truly manifested the greatest horrors man has ever known! Despite this H.P Lovecraft it&#39;s is nothing but MOCKERY&quot; As Mimir spoke runes crawled across his skin engraving themselves into every inch of his flesh, even the pupils of his</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-984279062472183908 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=984279062472183908><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Jun-22 12:13 PM">12:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>eyes. The runes gave off a brilliant green glow. 

&quot;I will instill in you the fear of a real God! Lovecraft, ASSASSIN, let this be a lesson in the fate of those who meddle in the afairs of the Aesir!&quot; The ground began to shake even more violently then before. Out of the sea of black madness sprouted great wooden roots tens of feet in diameter. A large stump the width of a building picked Mmir off the ground raising him into the sky as wood coiled around him growing ever higher. The wood twisted forming branches, silver leaves and fruit sprouted from the tree ends. Mimir had created a near perfect copy of Yggdrasil. 

Below was a black abyss and in the sky was a shining silver tree branching towards the clouds. A true battle of light and dark.

Olga, Assassin, whatever she was to be called in the heat of battle, found her cover was blown...somewhat. Both knew that she was now taking part in battle, though neither knew exactly &quot;where.&quot; On top of that, both were now at the mercy of her Curses, leading to a bit of subterfuge as she tries to hide from whatever chaos both were unleashing. It was likely they&#39;d both forget about her soon, so long as she continued to try and stay on the sideline. 

&quot;Aesir? Lovecraft? Jesus, I got myself really thrown in with a bunch of freaks, gag me with a spoon...&quot; She says, casually tapping more concrete and watching as they brace themselves against the building she was hiding behind, it&#39;s fleshy exterior bleeding slightly from the otherworldly pustules, squelching against the force pressing against it. Perhaps that tin can Sengoku could withstand a building falling on top of him, but could an...Aesir? There were so many, it would be a bit hard to pinpoint exactly who beardy-locks was. 

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s find something a bit heavier to tip this bad boy over, and hopefully avoid getting eviscerated...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Massive tendrils lashed out in the air as the Caster loomed over the buildings surrounding the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#abandoned-streets</span> with ease, only rivalled by Mimi&#39;s tree in size.

The base of the creature had a mix of tendrils, moving flesh, and monstrous goat-like limbs to provide movement for the thing. The aura from Caster seeped into the air like a corrupting smog, scratching at the minds of those foolish enough to gaze upon it for too long.

A large singular stared through the tree and at Mimir himself. Out of all the eyes present on the creature, something told Mimir that this one was Caster&#39;s eye. &quot;<strong>MOCKERY? BEASTS. MORTALS. GODS. ALL OF YOU ARE INSIGNIFICANT TO THOSE WHO STAND ABOVE REALITY! I, MYSELF, AM LIVING PROOF OF THAT!</strong>&quot; An echoing voice boomed from the mound of flesh. There was no single mouth that spoke for him. They <strong>all</strong> did. Despite the grotesque voice that came out, it was undeniably Caster&#39;s voice that spoke to him.

&quot;<strong>EVEN THE AESIR ARE NOTHING! NOW JOIN YOUR COMPANIONS IN ETERNAL SLUMBER ONCE MORE AND PERISH!</strong>&quot; A few of the massive tendrils swung towards the tree, aiming to use the weight and strength of an Ancient One to crush the tree to nothing but splinters.

Even with its form partly obstructed, Olga&#39;s eyes caught one of its many irises, both locked deep within as she slowly loses herself within its pools of yellow ichor. 

<strong>Suicide. Love. Leaking pustule. The soft, wet squelch of Igor&#39;s entrails pooling from the torn flesh of what was once his crotch. Party! PARTY! PARTY! DO YOU WANT TO MEET MY CAT</strong>

Her eyes itched. Her nostrils flared. She wanted to bleed from every pore on her body and bless this mass of flesh for giving her the chance. Thank it for invading her mind with thoughts of tearing through the muscle and bone of her neck to pour out gallons of blood in the name of pointless living...

And then reality crept back in the instant she blinked. A biological function that kept her mind from staring a second longer into the Abyss given shape.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Both of you...I am so sick of Caster&#39;s already,&quot; she sighs, steadying the frantic, horror stricken beating of her heart as it slows from its near arrest at the hands of such monstrosity. Enough to let her drive forward. Not long before her first bird would return, which could give her a slight edge. For now, it was time to make her way up the great tree and get closer to the action. 

Finding the wreckage of a nearby home, Olga&#39;s hand sifts through and sends a few more kitchen wares to slam against the building, the strain slowly causing it to lean towards Mimir&#39;s yggdrasil. Her hand lights on a nearby door frame ripped callously from its hinges, Assassin opting to keep her eyes closed while riding it towards Mimir. An ant climbing in the midst of God&#39;s. A lone mind against the endless ravaging of higher planes. These were odds she&#39;s faced her entire life...

<strong>and she always came out on top.</strong> 

&quot;It&#39;s time to pop a zit and do a little pruning...ugh, that sounded way better in my head. Can they even hear me? Like, I know you&#39;re both pissed at me kind of ruining your bro off here, but this seems like the equivalent of you both just flexing at each other.

His song did well to prepare him for the monstrosity but seeing it in person was a much more haunting experience. Even the god found himself quivering slightly at the beasts strength. Madness creeped against the walls of Mimir&#39;s mind however his mastery over wisdom was enough to keep him in check. 

Peering through his tree Mimir&#39;s rune filled eyes would not stray from Lovecraft&#39;s. This was a battle of gods now, Mimir was fighting for the pride of the Aesir, he could not let some bookworm outdo them. &quot;No monstrosity can stand against the infinite power of the Aesir!&quot; 

As the Lovecraft&#39;s monster swung at the tree it would begin to creak and crack. A large wooden appendage would sprout on each side of the tree as the base of the roots twisted in legs. He had animated his copy of Yggdrasil in an attempt to create a tool that could Lovecraft off.

The trees arm lifted up blocking the blow, the arm shattering into splints of wood, only to start slowly regrowing. Mimirs tree was massive, but it was no match for the power of a Noble Phantasm at this caliber. 

The trees feet dug into the ground swinging it&#39;s remaining arm at Lovecraft, aiming an uppercut at one of its many eyes. 

As the two giants battled, Mimir was completely unaware of Olga making her way to him. The doorframe she was riding would fly towards the center of the tree, that was where Mimir was hiding.

Each tree limb that shattered only fed into Lovecraft&#39;s ego that his Gods were superior over the Aesir. When in truth a Servant&#39;s Skill will always pale in comparison to something like a Noble Phantasm. Lovecraft didn&#39;t care about that though. His sights were too focused to worry about semantics like that. 

&quot;<strong>SPLINTER! BREAK! SHATTER! FALL BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE ANCIENT ONES, AESIR!</strong>&quot; The uppercut connected upon one of Lovecraft&#39;s many eyes. The impact burst the eye in a gory display of pus and, what one can assume to be, blood. Slowly the wound began to fester and mutate into a maw instead to better suit the hole the Aesir left from his strike. However, unlike the tree&#39;s regeneration, this process was a lot more slower in comparison.

While he took care of one eye, they were many others still left. In a crimson beam of madness, Lovecraft fired off a display of beams were either cut through, burned, or let went wide, destroying a section of the streets or a stray building.

&quot;<strong>AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</strong>&quot; Needless to say, Lovecraft was drunk on the power in his hands. 

One of the more massive jaws present on the side of Lovecraft&#39;s mass of flesh opened up as the same starry aura from when he used the <strong>Hound of Tindalos</strong>. Another barrage of stars was being shot out to bombard the tree with.  

While Lovecraft boasted impressive firepower, he could feel his mana stores draining thanks to the Noble Phantasm and the Curse still afflicting him...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-984545848492953601 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=984545848492953601><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Jun-22 05:53 AM">05:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

At this point she wasn&#39;t entirely sure she knew exactly what the Aesir were capable of, much less which one specifically was a tree beard-look alike, but that hardly mattered. What did was holding on for dear life as splinters and blood sprayed through the air, aiming to coat Olga in fluids unknown to man and her sense of hygiene. &quot;Oh com-are you shitting me?! Fucking christ, I&#39;m glad this is about to happen,&quot; she grits through her teeth, feeling a surge of her own mana flare as one of her darling birds returned by her side. Unlike tall, dark and annoying across the way, this bird just came in a plume of feathers, chirping happily by her side. 

&quot;Awww, momma missed you too, baby. But, we can snuggle up later, right now we got some work. Get ready to blow up again,&quot; she says, right as a booming <strong>CRACK</strong> rips through the air between all three combatants, along with the steady rain of dust and rubble that began to shift as leaning tower of foreshadowing began to bear its weight against Mimir&#39;s Towering tree. 

&quot;Alright, hang on, cause one if afew things is gonna happen!&quot;

Burns made it harder patch the tree together, spending Mimirs mana even more. Maintaining control over such a massive object and keeping it together was not easy. 

&quot;You have only displayed the power of a madman Caster! The Aesir have much more then raw strength our wit is unmatched!&quot; Mimir would take control of the flames crawling up his tree, moving them to a concentrated point on the trees fist. The giant flaming fist would swing back towards Caster, hopefully if he cauterized the flesh he could stop it&#39;s regeneration. 

Mimirs punch however was halted with a loud bang. A building had found it&#39;s way toppling onto the trees side with immense force as it gravitated towards Mimir who was nicely tucked away in the trees core. &quot;Arghhhh, the damned woman!&quot; 

The large wooden behemoth began to topple. Mimir tried to dig the trees roots deep into the ground but it didn&#39;t matter, he had sacrificed too much control over the wood while moving the flames. 

The flaming fist would quickly sprout into an array of flaming branches desperately trying to wrap around Caster. Branches from all sides of the tree would start to extend and reach for the monster. If Mimir was falling he would try to take Caster with him, it was only a question of who the fall would hurt more.

All the attempt did was bring him down onto his many knees, shaking the ground in the process when both titans fell.

&quot;<strong>ENOUGH, AESIR! HOW LONG MUST YOU STRUGGLE UNTIL YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE GAP IN OUR POWER?!</strong>&quot; Lovecraft seem to fail to bring attention to the fact that Mimir was sabotaged by their own ally in this engagement of theirs, skewering the playing field quite a bit. Of course, he didn&#39;t care one bit about that. The crazed look in his many eyes told that he wasn&#39;t even capable of logical thinking at the moment.

The burning branches singed and cooked various parts of Lovecraft&#39;s Eldritch form as the parts writhed in agony from the flames. &quot;<strong>AAARRGHHH!!</strong>&quot; As Lovecraft used a nearby building to prevent themselves from falling any further, they began a violent thrashing with the tendrils on their body to rid himself from the branches covering him. This destroyed anything unlucky enough to be within the range of the tendrils, whether it be Mimir&#39;s tree, rubble, or the surrounding buildings.

In addition to the thrashing tendrils, the eyes on his body glowed the same crimson tint again.

&quot;I know you hate me, Aesir, but you&#39;re doing great. Because that building that pimple just crashed into...I see a gas line exposed...&quot; 

What she had to come to terms with was not the fact that this was an abomination from beyond her conception. But rather, a facsimile of one. Even if it were large, gruesome, and maddening to behold, it was only a cheap imitation of what lies beyond the outer rim. Just like Aesir&#39;s tree...and just like Olga herself. 

&quot;Alright, baby steps, try not to get the giant&#39;s eyes on you, and GO!&quot; She shouts, jumping from Mimir into the dilapidated buildings next to it, crashing through the window and into a run down, once-was-living room.

Wooden chunks flew through the air crashing into the ground and through buildings as Caster&#39;s abomination flailed about. Mimir was truly fighting an uphill battle. The only thing in Mimirs favor was Caster&#39;s insanity. Caster was so dead set on destroying everything that an underhanded tactic might be able to work, and Olga had given Mimir just that.

&quot;A gas line?&quot; Mimir repeated to himself. It seemed that maybe Olga wasn&#39;t entirely against Mimir afterall, or at the very least she realized that Caster was en route to kill them both. If Olga was going for the gasline then Mimir had to keep Lovecraft&#39;s monster in place. The tree was barely standing up, and Mimir was using way to much mana to keep regenerating it. He would have to take a risk and hunker down. 

&quot;IF YOU&#39;RE SO HIGH AND MIGHTY PROVE IT! EVEN IF I SAT HERE LIKE A FOOL YOU STILL WOULDN&#39;T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEAT A REAL GOD!&quot; Mimir screamed from inside his tree trying to further provoke Caster. The roots of the fake Yggdrasil fused into the ground getting a stronger grip as the tree coiled around itself and Mimir. By reinforcing the layers of the tree he hoped that he could take a another lazer array from Caster. He would just have to avoid a direct hit. 

From there Mimir&#39;s plan was simple. Focus all his efforts on fortifying his defense so he could brave Caster&#39;s assault long enough for Olga to ignite the gasline. He was putting his trust in Olga, hopefully she wouldn&#39;t betray him again.

Thankfully, Lovecraft was completely ignorant to Olga&#39;s plan. Even with all the eyes present on his body, all of them remained blind to the workings of her grand plan.

&quot;<strong>AND THE MIGHT OF THE AESIR COULD DO NOTHING TO A &#39;MOCKERY&#39;!

But, could it take on seven? Or ten? or more? It all depended on the skill&#39;s capability at Mimir&#39;s disposal. 

Some of the other beams went wide, unfortunately aiming for Olga in the process. She would have to dodge certain death if she wanted to reach her target. There was little time to waste as well. For the same desecrating gaze when Lovecraft summoned the eye from before was being readied.

Beams began razing through the building, plowing through solid stone and nearly ripping through facsimile of flesh as Olga pressed on. Her birds squawk in fear as they narrowly dodge the beams, feathers trailing behind them as Olga tries desperately to follow their lead. This was when he wasn&#39;t even paying attention to her...she&#39;d hate to see what it&#39;d be like if she had his undivided attention. 

Suddenly, a burst of scorched feather and singed flesh, followed closely by the hint of roasting chicken, indicated one of her birds was down. Poor darling...


&quot;Godammit...almost there...&quot; 

She dives through another door, a blast tearing through and catching her thigh, ripping through it and leaving a splotch of caved in meat as she screams in anguish, clutching at the singed meat before crawling forward. Only a bit farther...

&quot;I...see it...go, go, light it! Don&#39;t worry about me, if I die, then this is pointless, do it!&quot; She screams, practically throwing her pigeon as it bursts into Flames, squawking before diving down toward the gas line...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His teasing had worked and Caster was fully focused on him. All he had to do now was try to live the barrage and trust in Olga. The God took one deep breath before hell let loose. The lasers blasted the Yggdrasil look a like cutting large sections and branches off. Losing support the tree cracked under its own weight, flames crawling all over the wooden exterior. Every foot of the tree was caught in the attack stray lasers even cutting into Mimir&#39;s body. 

Unlike previous times something was different, the tree was not being repaired. Part of this was because repairing such damage would exhaust most of Mimir&#39;s remaining mana reserve. Secondly, he hopefully no longer needed the tree. 

The burning plant would only be left in display for a moment before a loud <em><strong>BANG</strong></em> rung out, deafening Mimir. The large explosion from the gasline obstructed Mimirs view of Caster, flames instantly englulfing the surrounding area. What remained of the fake Yggdrasil would be blow into splinters a wooden ball flying across the street which contained Mimirs head attached to only the upper half of his torso. 

The wooden ball landed in the rubble below ,slowly opening to reveal Mimirs upper half. He looked up peaking towards the flames. Was the attack a success? Only time would tell.

A deafening explosion erupted at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#abandoned-streets</span>, erupting the local area in a blaze of fire.

If the roaring inferno didn&#39;t force one to turn away from the heat alone, one could see the sight of an Eldritch God set aflame. The tendrils flailed about before some of them tore apart from the sections where they were only hanging on by a thread. The explosion blew a good portion of Lovecraft&#39;s Eldritch form to pieces, resulting in the mass of flesh that was in its death throes. 

Even if Lovecraft had the Mana to maintain this form, the damage was far too great to do much with it. The tendrils were burned to a crisp. The eyes were liquified. The maws were cauterized or left too mangled. All that this form was good for was for the massive bonfire the Olga&#39;s gambit made out of it. 

The Horror was defeated.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The heat was unbearable. 

The pain was crippling. 

But most of all, the shame of defeat was heavy.

To think their glorious form could be undone by a simple trick from an Assassin and Caster working together. &quot;You tricked me twice. You led me to believe you were against each other to blind me. Bravo. Truly wonderful. I commend the two of you. Wherever you are...&quot; Once they were out of the inferno, Lovecraft collapsed onto the ground. Luckily, they had one more mana battery left. 

With how the place was left, they couldn&#39;t have been left unscathed either. So, he was safe to rest for a bit. He still had his Territory up after all.
