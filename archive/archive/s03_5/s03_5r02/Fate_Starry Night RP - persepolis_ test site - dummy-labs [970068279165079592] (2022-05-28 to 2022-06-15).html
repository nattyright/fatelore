The first day of Persepolis&#39;s great experiment had concluded, and resulted in the early elimination of several Servants. It was rare for Servants to perish so early into a Holy Grail War, as fake and mocking as this one was. Stuffing dozens of Servants into a box and yelling &quot;Go!&quot; probably didn&#39;t help much. You couldn&#39;t swing a sword without lopping off the heads of four separate Servants.

Since Servants were perishing so quickly... It was time to bedazzle the remnants before there were only but a handful of Servants remaining. Were they not deserving of some modicum of entertainment? Of joy?

And to outshine every miserable Caster this Grail War had to offer. He would rip and tear them all to shreds, for they were nothing but frauds born more talented than him.

Or at least, Caster of Spectacle thought from atop the labs he called his territory. He had spent time spreading tickets across every inch of Persepolis&#39;s arena, to the point where most Servants had heard a show was going on, and most even had tickets.

&quot;So many possible audiences, all dancing in the palm of our Masters&#39; hands...&quot; He murmured without bravado. &quot;That is all we familiars are capable of, so I will indulge in vanity. Today, you lot will forget your chains and dance. Dance! Look at me, and me alone.&quot;

He nodded to himself, and took a deep breath.

&quot;<strong>The show starts... NOW!</strong>&quot; Caster&#39;s territory lit up like a firework, with various spotlights dancing in the sky and neon signs dotting the building. Republic&#39;s various feeds and cameras would short out for a moment as they adjusted to the sudden burst of magical energy and light.</span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ecwl3FTG66jIKA9JRDtmg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>SiIvaGunner</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIumb8HGo6g"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Chance Time! - Mario Party</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIumb8HGo6g width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-980536369980006430 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=980536369980006430><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-May-22 04:21 AM">04:21</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Caster&#39;s voice burst out as music filled the air.

Having spent the night in his claimed territory of <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#lab-427</span>. 

The first day of this damnable war was spent in success and disappointment. Byzantium has new territory. New vassal states. But new allegiances would be harder to come by. As was shown in both that maddened Caster and the weak willed Rider who had fallen. However, it was made clear to the Lancer that he was all that Byzantium needed to begin anew. Basil II Her greatest Spear. 

This second day of war, Basil has already chosen a target. A mysterious ticket was found. Which pointed the Bulgar Slayer towards <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#dummy-labs</span>. The Caster of Spectacle was preparing a great show. 

Lancer ,however, planned to make that his next piece of land reclaimed for his empire. Spear in one hand. Ticket crumpled in the other. Basil stood at the entrance to this ‘show’.

A byproduct of Caster&#39;s Territory Creation? Lancer&#39;s Magic Resistance was powerful, and he could likely punch through the defenses and wreak havoc. However, that was not tactically wise.

And so he sat in line. Nameless Servants were funneled into the lab, which, despite Spectacle&#39;s attempts, was still a grungy piece of architecture that made the king wince. Junk was junk, no matter how it was decorated.

After a point, Lancer&#39;s ticket dissolved into bright light, as if it were passing a certain threshold. The Lancer of conquering and violence was in.

Entering the lab, Lancer would be shocked to see that the interior made zero logical sense. It was as if he had stepped into the interior of a circus tent, with concessions stands and the like. The tent was arranged like a depression, with the closer seats being lower down and closer to the stage, while the back seats stood far above the stage.

That popcorn at the concessions stand did look pretty appealing. Almost <em>too</em> good. Was it poisoned?

Meanwhile, the stage remained empty, where was the host of the show? There were posters of him stamped everywhere within the tent, but no True Name.

&quot;Goodness, I <em>do</em> look fat in that poster.&quot; A voice said behind Lancer, revealing a figure identical to the one on the poster.

&quot;The pose was ideal. My clothing, perfect! Maybe it&#39;s the resolution? My paper-manifesting abilities aren&#39;t all that good. Curse Item Construction!&quot; The man hummed as he floated behind Lancer.

It was Garish. Certainly something that needed to be destroyed. But there was absolutely delicious looking popcorn. Perhaps some respite could be used. Before conquest would claim this tent as Byzantium&#39;s. 

A voice then spoke. Annoying. Vain. &quot;Perhaps I should do you this favor.&quot; Unlike the maddened caster Basil met upon summoning. The lancer&#39;s free hand reached out then tore the poster down. Crumpling it into a ball before the emperor turned to the caster. 

He tossed the paper ball at the fool. &quot;Perhaps, don&#39;t distract yourself with meaningless vanity such as this.&quot; Curtly Lancer spoke, spear kept in a relaxed state by his side. 

&quot;But I suppose it only comes with the name. <em>Caster of Spectacle.</em>&quot; The name was spoken with a growl. Basil taking a step towards his new target. The next Conquest for New Byzantium, will start with this Fool.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the mask obscuring his face, it felt like the magician&#39;s <em>feelings</em> were hurt. All over a simple poster.

&quot;Ah, how rude. I think I might cry.&quot; Caster produced a hankerchief and dabbed at his nonexistent eyes, before comically blowing into it. As he did, pigeons appeared from underneath the cloth, before fluttering away.

&quot;You could be far less rude, you know! It was hard work making all of this with my shoddy Item Construction!&quot; Caster griped as he looked over Basil, before scratching his chin. 

&quot;Such magnificent and battle-worn clothing! Bah! You warriors are the worst. Ask one about combat and they&#39;ll list every move from a month ago. Ask them to make a coherent argument or entertain a bit of imagination and and they crash like Wall Street in the 1930s.&quot; Caster splayed his hands, mimicking an explosion.

Looking at Basil made Caster&#39;s blood boil. No imagination. No joy. No wonder. Most were the epitome of practicality, and as such, had no room for imagination. With none, enjoying a show was difficult. They simply accepted whatever was in front of them, or wondered how they could conquer it.

They were almost as bad as other Casters.

&quot;Yes, spectacle! Astonishment! Wonder! Shock and awe! These are the things that make life worth living, no?&quot; Caster said, floating just out of Basil&#39;s swinging range.

&quot;I could very well say the same of you, Artist.&quot; The hostility returned in that moment. &quot;Those things, you think make life worth living are just <em>distractions</em>.

Well, no, not quite. It would be inaccurate to say he was late. Rather, he had not ever intended to participate in this little activity at all. However, during his travels, he had been set upon by a Berserker, a savage woman with feline traits, who intended to savage him. Of course, he had slayed them first, without much effort. But, in the process of attaining victory, he spotted a ticket among the shimmering gold particles floating away.

And then came a vision, flowing off the horns of wisdom and into his mind&#39;s eye. A kingdom of marble and gold upon high, bleeding with the colours of gaudy neon. Was this what awaited him at this ticket? Was it where his next battle awaited him?

Either way, Lancer followed the road that had been paved for him, arriving among the empty laboratories. Whatever this &quot;Caster of Spectacle&quot; intended his show to be, it would be prudent to keep his wits about him.

That is more than I can say for a soldier like yourself.&quot;

With that, Caster inclined his head, as if hearing a faraway transmission.

&quot;Oh, but I dawdle. It is almost time for the show to start! I advise getting a good seat, my crass customer. Once the show is over, and the curtains have set, is when this Grail War can begin in earnest!&quot;

Spectacle vanished in a puff of smoke. After he vanished, the lights suddenly dimmed, and Basil and Honda&#39;s tickets glowed with certain seat numbers:

Okay, not that curious if one had context, but &quot;Curious&quot; is the first thought that enters into Lancer&#39;s mind as he passes through the bounded field and his ticket begins to glow. It is certainly not typical, at least not for him. 

He is already beginning to paint a picture in his head of what this is. The ticket is an invitation, but to what? By following it, he had been led to this place, undoubtedly the territory of a Caster. Were they here to fight, or something else? More than that, was the ticket a clue to the true nature of the servant behind this, or merely a convenient means to bait his hook with a suitable lure? 

If it was the latter, it had worked. Indeed, it had managed to reel in not one, but two Lancers, as Sengoku would soon come to find out.

The arena&#39;s structure was convenient. The signage was well laid out, and walking at a brisk place allowed him to reach his seat within five minutes of arriving. A well designed building. He had no complaints.

Well, not about the design. Who he was seated next to...

<strong>&quot;I assure you, nothing wonderful has occurred yet.&quot;</strong> Lancer (Sengoku) replied to Lancer (Byzantium), lowering himself onto his seat. Though he lacked the prior context that his neighbour did, he sensed that lacking said context didn&#39;t put him on much worse terms than having it did for his fellow servant. <strong>&quot;Though, perhaps that is what is to come next?&quot;</strong>

His eye turned to the stage.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-981198797684232252 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=981198797684232252><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Jun-22 12:13 AM">00:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Mag</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The show was about to start.

The tent wasn&#39;t &quot;filled&quot; with Servants. Many had elected to not come, viewing the show as a trap. Others simply didn&#39;t care, continuing on with this self-imposed Grail War. Both Lancers were sandwiched between a mountain of a Servant, carved from rock, and one that looked suspiciously like a mecha. The mecha munched on a bowl of popcorn.

The tent was only partially full, but it was a large tent, and there were few Servants. Even if every single one had shown up, the tent would only have been half full. Maximum.

At least both Lancers could take solidarity in the fact that if they failed to kill the hosting Caster, they could tear through several random Servants should Caster elude them. Unlikely. Were they even allies, or people united in a common desire to maul annoying Servants until they couldn&#39;t even blink?

And then finally: pitch black. Several Servants reached for their weapons. A few shrieked. An assault? Nay! Spotlights located at the top of the tent blared to life, all focusing on the stage in a rainbow of lights.

In the center of the stage was Caster of Spectacle, cloak and hat billowing bright. He raised his bangled hands, and in that moment, he looked just as impressive as Basil in his seat of power of Byzantium. Just as one&#39;s seat of power gave them strength, so too did this Caster get power from the stage. As he spoke, this became clearer and clearer.

&quot;<strong>Ladies and gentlemen!</strong>&quot; Spectacle&#39;s magically enhanced voice boomed through the tent. His voice as smooth and rich as any orator&#39;s reverberated with an implacable accent.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-981401650889642004 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=981401650889642004><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Jun-22 01:39 PM">13:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;<strong>You have fought and fought across this grand stage that has been laid out for us.

Let this humble magician allow you a few moments of rest and respite, before the grand battle begins once again. I will give you a show. Just as many of you cannot help but fight, I cannot help but tickle your senses with illusions and grandeur so opulent that it will stay in your mind as your body crumbles and you return to the Throne!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>So I welcome you to a show of true spectacle and iridescent brilliance! Welcome, one and all.</strong>&quot; Caster paused in anticipation, before making his proclamation. 

&quot;<strong>LET THE SHOW BEGIN!</strong>&quot; Caster bellowed to elated cheers, before disappearing under a block of concrete the size of a school bus, which crushed him. Servants shrieked and bellowed alike. That was it? Caster had been assassinated almost instantly. As Servants looked for the assailant, a crack appeared down the concrete, before breaking apart.

Spectacle appeared, unharmed, dusting off concrete powder. That made no sense. That was real concrete, correct? A massive ring floated above Spectacle, which dropped a few extra pebbles of concrete onto the magician. It dented his hat slightly. Yes, that was real.

There was no way a simple Caster could shatter concrete, it made no sense.

The magician proceeded to perform a slew of other tricks. He turned popcorn into pigeons, which flew away. Those pigeons turned into knifes, which barely missed impaling a few Servants.

After a short while, Caster elected to procure two volunteers from the audience.

&quot;Will anyone help me with this next trick?&quot; He cried, mask shining. &quot;Anyone? Pleeeeeeeeeeease?&quot;

This is all but a headache. Even what is to come next.” 

Basil turned his gaze towards the stage just as his fellow servant did.  It seemed as if they were both on similar pages when it came to this particular caster. Perhaps unlikely allies. Perhaps another servant who would be willing, and capable, of bringing back Her glory. Unlike that particular rider prior. 

“Lancer of Conquest, might I know your name?” The emperor asked, offering a hand. A sign of respect or mutual disdain for this whole affair. 

The show then began. Darkness encompassed the tent. Eventually the lights came back to the Caster of Spectacle. An impressive sight. A king seated upon his throne. But it’s glory was soiled by that fool. Even still it was clear that this caster held his strength through this stage and performance. 

Next a pile of concrete dropped upon the caster. Like most stage magicians, he was unscathed by this trick. He then pleaded from the audience to give themselves as volunteer. 

“This is a chance to get close. Strike the fool. End him.” Basil spoke as his raised his hand. “Come with. We can take him easily.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Inside looking out, however, it was not so foggy. This man was no Ieyasu, that much was clear. Lancer would not allow himself to be subservient, especially to an inferior lord.

But a military alliance? That had worked before. The thought stirred in his mind as he watched Caster crush himself in concrete, only to come out unharmed. A very familiar sight. Or rather, a familiar feeling?

Hm. Very well.

“And how exactly can we trust this to be the case? And why not something a bit more… enticing, than popcorn which is already free.” Lancer( Byzantium) spoke aloud. Looking towards Lancer( Sengoku) to see if he’d also challenge this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For one to willingly step inside, they would either have to be intensely foolish, or have an intensely clever plan to get out unharmed.

But as Basil turned to gauge his supposed &quot;ally&quot; and his reactions, he would find the spot beside him empty. Indeed, without so much as a second thought, Sengoku had just stepped inside one of these boxes of death, entirely unfazed by the evident threat.

<strong>&quot;Even your most powerful trick, harmful or not, would be insufficient to kill me.&quot;</strong> Lancer (Sengoku) declared, arms folded and eyes closed. <strong>&quot;I have surpassed death. Whether through your talent or mine, I will leave this stage unharmed.&quot;</strong>

How confident. Or, how idiotic? What was it? Was this samurai intensely foolish, or intensely clever? Was he going to turn the tables, or would the tables turn on him?

Granted, he felt like he had. Between the two Lancers, Caster felt the desire to both shoot himself in the head and cheer for their bravery. He would do no such thing, naturally, but the contradiction was annoying.

&quot;Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine. Tell you what, Lancer #1 or whatever your name is,&quot; Caster sighed, waving a hand in the vague direction of Basil. &quot;Do this trick, and you can try to run me through with your glorified barbeque instrument. That&#39;s a pretty good deal. You get free soda and popcorn, I get to kill you both, and the crowd gets entertainment. Fair deal, yeah?&quot;

The Caster confidentially said as he floated towards Sengoku&#39;s box, slamming it shut. Did this floating toothpick think he could defeat two Lancers on his own? That would be extremely difficult, almost impossible, for a Saber. How was a mere Caster give them more than a scratch?

Manifesting a voucher, he slipped it between the cracks in the box. After a moment, Basil and Spectacle heard a minor <em>scrape</em> as the voucher was pulled through by Sengoku. The magician snorted, amused.

After a moment, he murmured a True Name that reverberated through both Sengoku and Basil&#39;s souls.

&quot;▅▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅ ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅&quot;

Spectacle nodded, satisfied, before taking a sword, waving it before the crowd, and slamming it, a crowbar, and a slew of other pointed objects into the box.

&quot;Excuse me. I need to borrow this for a moment, thanks.&quot; Spectacle said to Basil, before prying the Noble Phantasm from the Lancer&#39;s hands, replacing it with a rubber chicken and a coupon for soda and popcorn at the concession stand (already free).

That too was slammed into the box.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-981989263069552680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=981989263069552680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Jun-22 04:34 AM">04:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen.

Caster returned the lance back to Basil. From behind the mask, he seemed very pleased. However, Basil could no longer sense Sengoku&#39;s presence from the boxes. It was as if he had been erased, or simply snuffed out.

Gone.

&quot;<strong>Okay, you next.</strong>&quot; Caster said with a mocking bow.

It was a tactical maneuver which could end in disaster. Good thing it was not Basil himself. 

It seemed as if the Caster has gotten annoyed by Basil’s lack of cooperation.  “My spear is no such tool. But I’ll accept your offer.” Curtly the man responded before something happened. A true Name Release.  

In the next moment Caster began to pierce Sengoku with all manner of pointed weapons. Before forcibly taking the spear from lancer and using it to also pierce into the box. Being left with a rubber chicken and ticket. 

Which Basil squeezed with excessive force. Almost threatening to burst the comedy prop. 

When the lance was returned the other lancer was now missing. Gone. No where to be detected. Looks like He will be having to do this alone. 

Caster of Spectacle made one mistake this time around. He was well within striking range. 

Taking the blunt end of his spear he would move to knock the caster out of the air. A small influx of mana would be sensed as his ‘Bulgar Slayer’ Skill would be activated. Before turning the pointed end down and aiming to skewer the fool.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was incredibly obvious, and despite Lancer&#39;s aptitude for combat, the quiet anger in the Servant had been building since he had first stepped foot on Mimir&#39;s stage. Caster had hoped to get through this show without a fight, but that wasn&#39;t going to happen now.

&quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; Caster squealed, dodging the first thrust by the skin of his bangles. &quot;Your coupon will be invalidated if you keep striking me!&quot; His voice turned sultry after a moment. &quot;That won&#39;t stop you though, so let&#39;s incorporate you into the show!&quot;

Caster spun his bangles, which turned into a massive ring. This ring glowed for a second as Basil went in for a second strike, before releasing a torrent of water that pushed the Byzantine back. However, his lance just barely missed Caster once again.

The energy in the spear hummed, and Caster gulped, clutching his head theatrically. He could feel the rage and scorn within the spear. Just being <em>near</em> it caused him a massive headache. If he got struck by it...

That would be check.

&quot;You won&#39;t lay as much as a finger on me, you bumbling oaf!&quot; He cried with extreme theatrics. &quot;In the seat of my power, with the crowd at my back, I am invincible!&quot; 

The crowd roared its approval.

&quot;Now strike at the foolish Lancer, my pigeons!&quot; The Servant proclaimed, unleashing a massive flock of birds to peck at Basil.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sengoku was in a field.

The stench of blood, corpses, and rotting grudges festered on the ground below. Crows and other birds circled in the sky, waiting for a chance to feast on the pain of the defeated. This was a battle. That was good. Sengoku knew his way around many a battlefield.

Yet this battle was familiar to him. It rang in his ears like a half-forgotten gong. This particular moment was important, he was sure of that, but how—

&quot;My lord!&quot; A soldier disengaged from the fight to pick his way towards Sengoku. He bore the emblem of the Tokugawa clan. He bowed, before standing straight and staring straight forward. The soldier was perfectly lifelike.

&quot;The battle fares poorly! We must assist Lord Yasumasa on the eastern front. He requires your might to sweep aside all those who dare to earn the scorn of Lord Tokugawa! Please, my lord. Only you can turn the tide of this battle!&quot;

And then, it hit Lancer like a truck. The death in the air, the soldier&#39;s uniform, Lord Yasumasa.

This was the Battle of Mikatagahara.

Another stab, and another miss as water pushed the Byzantine back. Giving the Showman much needed space to be effective in a fight. &quot;Oh but I will.&quot; He growled, eye narrowing in on the Caster. 

&quot;You are a weak man. Needing adoration. Winning support through conversation and not through Strength. You are not Invincible. No <em>King</em> should feel safe upon their seat of power. I will show you true power, the power of <strong>BYZANTIUM</strong>.&quot; The Lancer roared in response. 

A flock of birds then were unleashed. In response A dome formed over top of the lancer. The Dome of the Haiga Sophia had been conjured. Saving the emperor&#39;s other eye from being pecked out. 

Two soldiers then materialized before the doom. Rushing towards caster himself. Both taking a wide breadth to pincer Caster.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

My brand will never end, for I am immortal on ServantPedia™️!&quot;

As Caster eyeballed the dome formed over Basil&#39;s head, he inclined his head. Wonderful. A lack of airborne attacks really hurt Caster&#39;s flare and charm. He loved the sky, and took to it as naturally as a bird to the air, or Basil to slaughtering Bulgars. Something like that.

Unfortunately, Caster was not meant for combat. He was annoying, yes, and he was confident that he could dodge Basil for a while, but overpower him? No. Once Basil got lucky, Spectacle would not be in a good position. One good strike was all he needed.

Caster grinned beneath his mask. Luckily, there was not a single situation that he could not worm out of. The magician floated into the air, out of the range of the soldiers. &quot;Tweaky, pokey! Stabby, nabby!&quot; He taunted as the soldiers tried to pierce him. He snickered, before turning back to Basil.

&quot;Your talents are impressive, Lancer. Truly, they are! But on this stage, I am the king! Observe!&quot; Spectacle glowed brightly with power, and his voice made Basil&#39;s body shiver.

&quot;<strong>Your authority is null. Your talent is mediocre. Nobody on the stage of life shines more brightly than me!</strong>&quot; Caster pointed a finger at Basil. &quot;<strong>A Magician Among Spirits.</strong>&quot;

Suddenly, Basil felt like he was wearing a proverbial ton of bricks on his back. He felt tired, drained, as if he had just ran a long marathon. Whatever Spectacle had done, the Lancer&#39;s mana supply had been cut off.

&quot;Now, let&#39;s try that again.&quot; Caster huffed, ring returning to him. He flung it straight forward, where it suddenly grew spikes. It lunged at Basil like a barbed-wire frisbee.

It was a wreck, a field of bodies and blades, a place where people had fought, where they had killed. This is where living men and women, fighting for a cause, had come to die. This is where men and women, dead on the inside, had come to live.

Funny. Put like that, it didn&#39;t sound too different from--

His thoughts were interrupted by the soldier, coming to his side. Yes, they were a familiar face, though he had never once known his name. A capable fighter. Not the greatest, but good enough to hold his own in the thick of it. A loyal soul. Honest, too.

Which meant that he was needed. If his men needed him, then Lord Tokugawa needed him. If victory is what his lord wanted, then he would attain victory. Plain and simple.

<strong>&quot;Very well. Come!&quot;</strong>

With that, the Lancer of Sengoku sprinted off, spear in hand, to face down these foes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-982297861536505906 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=982297861536505906><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Jun-22 01:01 AM">01:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Mag</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Making haste towards the banner, the nameless soldier ushered Sengoku forward with &quot;Hurry!&quot; and &quot;Quickly, now!&quot; as they fought off more and more soldiers. Battle was a marathon, not a sprint. Each time Sengoku pierced a man&#39;s armor, it became clearer that there was no end to these soldiers. Here, he could battle as much as his heart desired.

But that magician. How had he done this? What was his goal? Where was his free soda and popcorn voucher? As realistic as this battle was, it had to have an end, correct?

As Sengoku pondered this, he realized the nameless soldier was no longer with him. Gone. Poof! Like a puff of smoke, like dust in the wind. But, at last, Sengoku reached the banner. Under it stood a man surrounded by men who spurted blood like fountains.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No wounds? As eloquent as always, ▅▅▅▅▅.&quot; Sakakibara Yasumasa smiled disdainfully as he sheathed his blade. When he grinned, it looked like a combination of a sneer and disdain, even when it was a genuine smile.

The warrior&#39;s clothes were stained with grime, yet his hat remained unmarred by mud and filth. Hand on his hip, he pointed up the ridge to where a figure stood, surrounded in more corpses. Yasumasa snorted in amusement.

&quot;What will you do, Lord ▅▅▅▅▅?&quot; Yasumasa asked. &quot;I can&#39;t help you if you march up that hill and face your old foe. <strong>Houdini&#39;s Noble Phantasm is exceedingly lifelike, but even he can&#39;t manifest beings stronger than him.</strong> I doubt he&#39;s even paying attention right now, he&#39;s a bit preoccupied.&quot;

The ground shook and the sky tore slightly, revealing bright light that seemed too unnatural to be sunlight, as if the sky were cracking like an eggshell, and light were seeping in.

&quot;This is your chance to get revenge on Lord Masatoyo, however, should you wish to.&quot; Yasumasa shrugged as if the matter didn&#39;t concern him.

This situation was not a dream, for Lancer was not asleep. It was not a flight of fancy, because Lancer experienced no such flights. No, this was much more invasive, much more sinister. A smarter servant would have recognised such. A more paranoid servant would have recognised such. But, be it idiocy, naivety, or a complete lack of caring, Lancer was undeterred by the bleeding illusions that made up this new world of his past, studied upon his Saint Graph, and rewritten by a Noble Phantasm unnamed.

Battle. It always came down to battle. Battle the enemy to defeat them. Battle to protect your allies so they don&#39;t get defeated. Battle to raise up high your lord. Battle to lower the enemy lord. Battle. Battle. Battle. It was good. It was simple. It was honest. It was easy. Battle was innate. Battle was truth. Battle was right.

It was everything politics was not. Everything the statesmanship lacked. It was what Lancer was, what gave him worth, what gave him a reason to exist, what gave him a reason to get out of bed in the morning and march into the morrow. 

Without it, Lancer was nothing.

Perhaps that was why he did not flinch as the velvet curtain concealed one piece of the puzzle while another was placed in front of him. Perhaps that was why he did not acknowledge the slip in the fa&#231;ade, the clue that fell through the cracks. No, as valuable a piece of information as it was, only one thought played upon Lancer&#39;s mind.

<strong>&quot;I hear the dragonfly&#39;s wings beat, Yasumasa.&quot;</strong>

The samurai stretched out his spear, pointing it in the direction of the ongoing battle. Odd. In this place, surrounded by soldiers with spears of their own, it stood out so much more. Like a towering skyscraper upon mud huts. Not to say that the other spears was bad, of course, such was simply the gulf between them and this. The difference between standard build, and the forging of one of the Three Great Spears of Japan.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-982756174732619826 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=982756174732619826><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Jun-22 07:22 AM">07:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>&quot;I shall face him.

“You seemed to have stripped me of <strong>her</strong>. Impressive.” The man grunted adjusting to this new found feeling of fatigue. “My guards men, to me.” Basil ordered, as the two phantoms returned to their position at their emperor’s side. 

“I concur…. Even with this handicap, you will still fall.” The Lancer opened his arms wide as the disc was thrown. Simultaneously the two guards knocked arrows and fired. And continued to fire as fast as they were capable of. 

As their emperor took the spinning wheel head on. It began to grind into his skin. Leaving a deep gash, before ceasing it’s motion thanks to his hands gripping the ring with force.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Caster dodges Basil&#39;s arrows, the king&#39;s trained eye would realize something suspicious. Caster moved <em>too</em> quickly. Each time an arrow was fired, it was as if it was shot slightly off its mark, allowing Caster to dodge it by the skin of his teeth. If the archers coordinated, and aimed properly, than the magician could be shot down with impunity.

Was it their training? No. Basil had spent a fortune on the Extreme Academy for Gunnery, Assault, and Neutralization (EAGAN). Using Byzantium&#39;s resources, Basil had trained his soldiers to be the best, even if they were a little shadowy and rusty.

So what was going on?

&quot;Hup! Hah! Hoohoo!&quot; Caster danced between the arrows with the grace of an acrobat. &quot;These are far easier to escape from than a mere straightjacket! Haha!&quot;  The crowd roared its approval.

&quot;And now to strike at you, Lancerless Lancer!&quot; Caster cried, extending his arm. The ring dug into Basil&#39;s flesh as it tried to escape, but the Lancer was holding it firm. Caster buzzed with worry.

&quot;No! Wait! Um, give it back?&quot; He asked.

He wasn&#39;t surprised by this outcome, clearly. Sengoku and him had fought in many battles together, and this was all that he knew. He chuckled drily, before shaking his head.

&quot;Alright, ▅▅▅▅▅.&quot; Yasumasa said. &quot;Then off you go. It&#39;s a shame I&#39;m not Lord Naomasa. Maybe the karmic bond you two shared would have allowed me to do more, but as is, depart with a smile under that mask of yours.&quot;

Battle. Bloodshed. Tears. The components of battle. Sengoku&#39;s blood would never rest, nor would many of the Four Heavenly Kings. Yasumasa had fit into his governing position like a glove, and was one of Tokugawa&#39;s favorites as a result. Maybe, through that understanding, Yasumasa understood Sengoku&#39;s reasoning.

As the Lancer left to go pursue his foe atop the hill, Yasumasa said &quot;Lord ▅▅▅▅▅?&quot;

The Lancer turned.

&quot;<strong>The dragonfly&#39;s wings. I hear them too.</strong>&quot; Yasumasa said, putting a hand on the Lancer&#39;s smooth armor. &quot;<strong>You may have only been truly alive during battle, my friend. However, you alone stood as the wisest of us retainers. Even if we never meet again...</strong>&quot;

Yasumasa smiled. &quot;<strong>My friend, in this fiery battle, you are perfect.</strong>&quot;

The Tokugawa Heavenly King vanished in a spray of golden light.

At the top of the hill sat Naitō Masatoyo, Sengoku&#39;s rival.

No. It wasn’t wasted. There was something more to this Caster’s fluid movements. Perhaps a skill this fool has access to with the audience, the stage, <em>his territory</em>. Perhaps there was truth to his ‘invincibility’ when upon the stage. 

It simply needed to be broken. 

Lancer grit his teeth, before removing the ring from his flesh. “It’s mine now. Thank you.” The bloodied emperor spat. 

“Varangian Guard we must destroy this stage. Then Victory will be ours.” The phantoms nodded, ceasing the arrow fire. Swapping over to war axes and striking down to the wood of the stage whilst Basil himself took his new ring and also struck at the stage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least, not a verbal one. Instead, Sengoku responded to Yasumasa&#39;s well wishes with a single gesture - a thumbs up. A fitting show of both acknowledgement and brotherhood. He would have smiled, but it would not have been seen under his helm. He would have offered a high five, but that seemed too modern a display.

He would have hugged him, but... No. The Tadakatsu of this era would not have done such a thing. That action would only have made sense in hindsight, not the past present.

Even if it was not real, that was no reason to break the conventions of the time. He would play along with this strange Kabuki, perform his part in the ritual of dance and drama, see what awaited on the other side of the stage set for him.

As he reached the crest of the hill, Lancer cleared his throat. Normally, he was not one for theatrics. However...

<strong>&quot;Naitō Masatoyo, general under Takeda Shingen, and enemy of my lord!&quot;</strong> Came the declaration, loud and clear, his voice more animated than it had ever been. <strong>&quot;My name is <u>HONDA TADAKATSU</u>, general under Tokugawa Ieyasu, the one who has surpassed death! On my honour as a samurai, you will not leave this battlefield alive!&quot;</strong>

Lancer gripped his spear with both hands, magical energy flowing throughout his entire body. Then, after the briefest pause, he leapt high into the air, boosted by an unseen force sending him skyward. As he reached the zenith of his leap, and as he began to fall, the moment was crystallised. Great insectile wings sprouted out from his back, and a surging jade energy sprouted from the tip of his spear.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOH! LEGENDARY SPEAR OF JAPAN, CUT THEM IN HALF, MY <u>TONBOKIRI!</u>&quot;</strong>

With that final announcement, Tadakatsu came flying forth, swooping down towards Masatoyo, spear in hand--</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-983122724920655983 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=983122724920655983><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jun-22 07:38 AM">07:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Mag</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had offered his True Name and a slew of tricks in order to obtain gifts from the Norse Divine Spirit, and having it get pummeled by an angry Lancer and his servants (without the capital S).

Luckily, Mimir had woven a few enchantments into the stage. What was a stage from a god worth without a few little tricks? Otherwise, Caster would have simply made one himself.

Several roots erupted from the base of the stage, like the massive tree roots of oaks that had stood for centuries, growing larger, thicker, and stronger. It grabbed one soldier by the leg and flung it into the ceiling, where it hit a stage light, which crashed and fell, sparking and smoking. Several Servants backed up nervously, and a few even began running for the exit.

&quot;Now this is peak entertainment!&quot; Caster declared, though he seemed to be applying a handkerchief to his face. Did he sweat through the mask? Caster himself was beginning to get nervous. This was an excellent show, and yet...

His Reality Marble was failing. Even if Sengoku—Honda Tadakatsu—escaped, he would be in no shape to fight. Nonetheless, without his territory, he would lose to Basil. With it, he could take on Honda and Basil until the sun came up, despite his nominally weaker Saint Graph and Class.

As Basil and the remaining soldier assaulted the stage, it felt like the glow Caster got from the show diminished slightly. It was barely noticeable, however. More damage had to be done!

&quot;Now you&#39;re ruining the show!&quot; Caster bemoaned, shaking his fist. &quot;At least leave the stage intact!&quot; The ring in Basil&#39;s hand glowed with magical energy as he smashed through a layer of wood. It began peppering Basil with knifes, chains, and other metal armaments intended on bleeding the Lancer dry. Most failed to pierce the Berserker&#39;s armor, however. A Caster&#39;s offensive was nothing compared to a Lancer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-983128031264653342 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=983128031264653342><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jun-22 07:59 AM">07:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Fighting roots, smashing the stage, and tanking knives with crippled Mana was like lifting a thousand ton weights for Basil.

He looked down. Handcuffs?

<strong>Click. Click. Click. Click. Click.</strong>

Dozens of handcuffs wrapped around the Lancer like snakes, stopping him from moving his limbs. First went his arms, then his legs, and more were gathering by the minute.

&quot;Hehe... I call this one the Spectacular Sponsorship™️.&quot; Caster snickered, twirling a handcuff around his ring finger tauntingly. &quot;A simple <strong>child</strong> can get out of this one, my friend.

His armor was brightly shined, joints barely creaking, and his lance-katana stood between his legs, as if he had abandoned the idea of even moving an inch.

Then he spoke, and his voice was slow and gravely, the voice of a man who had been battling for hours, and hadn&#39;t had a moment to breath or drink. If this Reality Marble was based on his experiences, than this was Honda&#39;s recollection of the individual, based on how Masatoyo&#39;s state was during the battle. It made sense for his voice to be in utter disrepair.

&quot;<strong>Honda, you brute.</strong>&quot; Masatoyo&#39;s voice rumbled as he picked up his spear. &quot;A Servant versus a shadow of a living warrior. Heh. It&#39;s a fair match, don&#39;t you think. Of course you&#39;d get stuck in a battle, you rabid dog. It&#39;s all you were ever good at.&quot;

The Shingen general lowered his body in anticipation for Honda&#39;s strike, preparing to parry. Despite Yasumasa&#39;s warning, the general still seemed fairly strong. Additionally, something misfired within Tonbokiri.

As the magical energy gathered on the rings on his back, they suddenly dispersed, though the Mana Burst of Tonbokiri activated correctly, he did not fly like a dragonfly.

Masatoyo&#39;s blade met Honda&#39;s and the field flattened under the force of both weapons. The general sneered, before kicking at Honda&#39;s feet in an underhanded maneuver, causing the Heavenly King to stumble.

&quot;Idiot. We are shadows. This world is Houdini&#39;s personal escape room. There is no grand weapon to help you, nor any item to save you. If you want to defeat me, then <strong>DO IT WITH SKILL ALONE!</strong>&quot; 

The samurai dropped his blade for a short moment, grabbing it with the opposite hand, before slamming his fist into Honda&#39;s mask.

Damned magicians. They did so love their pointless masquerades.

Then again, he supposed he could not truly complain. After all, he was nothing if not a fighter. In fact, it would have been most disappointing if that one strike had killed. No, a prolonged fight, that was <em>much</em> better.

<strong>&quot;Skill? You know not the meaning of skill, Masatoyo. The truth of it evades you. Allow me to be your teacher!&quot;</strong>

<em>CRUNCH!</em> The fist connected with Honda&#39;s mask, and yet, no wound was left behind, no harm done. All that had occurred in the exchange was that Lancer was given the chance to fight back.

Sure, this wasn&#39;t a genuine Masatoyo, but he was still fairly strong for a shadow. 

Nonetheless, Honda was stronger. Even without a Noble Phantasm to aid him, the fight was still in his favor. Especially given his Woundless Form. Masatoyo could tire himself out, and Honda would trudge forward despite a dozen tiny cuts that the general was sure landed.

Therefore, when Honda rose his great spear, Masatoyo did a desperate gambit.

There was little energy remaining behind this Reality Marble. Caster was directing his magical energy towards combating Basil and his goons. Ergo, with all that in mind, it was likely that this next strike would bring Masatoyo to his knees.

Therefore, as Honda&#39;s rival, there was only one thing he could do.

As Honda whirled his spear around for a strike at the neck, there was an opportunity. Lancer could not defend himself in pressing this attack. There was no need to. Masatoyo would block, as was logical.

Yet he realized what Honda did not. His existence was a fleeting shadow, so it was best to make it count. Wielding his spear, he stabbed the spear into Honda&#39;s gut, despite the Lancer not being able to feel the pain.

His strike took less energy and movement, therefore, it was a hair faster than Honda&#39;s.

Lancer&#39;s spear struck Masatoyo, cleaving the man from neck to groin. The Shingen general fell in a heap, leaving the blade embedded in Honda&#39;s gut.

&quot;<strong>Do it.</strong>&quot; He gurgled from the ground, life vanishing fast.

Tadakatsu&#39;s gaze turned to Caster, eyes narrowed as he stared down the gaudily-dressed magician. He had been loosened, let out of his metaphorical cage. Not only that, but he had been denied the original fight he had been promised, robbed of a true confrontation so that he might dance with the shadows of his past.

The mysterious gentleman could not be sure, but it seemed as though the chains around Lancer&#39;s soul were not as tight as they ought to be. Not that they were ineffective, but that he was simply powering through the burden put upon him...

That is until handcuffs began to entrap the Byzantine. Slowing his momentum and keeping the stage safe, but damaged. Until he came to a complete stop. These infernal contraptions were too many and restrictive in just the right areas. 

Thankfully the other lancer finally returned. And took Caster’s attention once more. Leaving the remaining Guard and Basil an opportunity to be freed of the handcuffs. 

“Excellent idea, fellow warrior. <strong>LET US KILL THIS FOOL</strong>” The Byzantine screamed as the Guard took aim again with a bow while Basil himself threw the ring back at its owner and moved in to stab with his spear, mimicking the motions of Honda but timing them differently to cover a larger area to end the caster.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“The bastard really is popular huh. . ? Those poor saps, had no one else had anything to do?”

*He said in disbelief. How in the world was this man so popular already? Who could he have invited to this damn place? He ventured forward a bit, seeing how the more he ventured the more childish the lab had become. But, the more he followed the more he couldn’t help but wonder how he had done it. This bastard, this had to be territory creation, no? He had built many, but even then, nothing had looked at odd or as strange as this. The sounds of the voices got louder, only making him more interested to see who these people could have been. The way the area had slowly slowly shaken and trembled as if struggling to hold itself together made Daedalus raise an eyebrow. Was the a fight already? He shook his head. Had the show already come to a close when he just began. . . His steps quickened faster. Had he began to miss it? Who the servants could it have been? The clown and who? The clown and <strong>what?</strong> Before he could continue to break through to the other side, he did some housekeeping himself. It’d be foolish to go about a battle on his own, especially if the reality marble was something that was fading away. . . He rose his hand and murmured a word in a foreign language, turning his hand over as a large block of marble had struck the ground with an loud crash.

<em>After the third, the faces receded back into the stone, only for to have the block glow it’s aureole of white light as it cracked and creaked. Soon, the shape shimmered, it’s once sturdy body rippled about before 3 sets of arms set out, before it spat out garbled bodies, each one perfectly made and symmetrical to the other except for its phenotypes. However, each of them dawned another weapon, one a sword, the other a bow, and the last a spear. Soon enough, the reality marble had over exerted itself, the circus like aesthetic fading back into the dummy labs. It was time.  It seemed a fight had been here, and soon enough it was ending, or coming to a close. . . But he did plan on meeting this victor. That, that would be great.

Did his Reality Marble seriously drop his name? He had gotten that fixed in the last iteration. He was going to petition the Throne for more specific regulations when he got back.

Truly, Caster was a orator on par with Caesar. As his brain threatened to bust out more tangential insults like <em>golly gee</em> and <em>gosh darn</em>, he noticed the smell of smoke. He looked down to the stagelight that had fallen over earlier. which had created a small fire that was now creeping along the floor.

&quot;NO! My stage!&quot; Caster wailed as Mimir&#39;s root defenses failed to beat out the blaze. For a full twenty nanoseconds, Caster was sad, before shrugging at the two Lancers, as if saying <em>hey, what&#39;re you gonna do?</em>

The lance cut through flesh like cheese, and the magician hissed. Next, Basil&#39;s archers landed a strike on his hand, causing him to drop his rings.

The magician grimaced. &quot;Now hold on here...&quot; He uttered as the dropped rings hit the ground, and began shooting out random things, like daggers, pigeons, and massive columns of water, randomly striking Basil&#39;s soldiers and the two Lancers.

“There we go! There we go! Something more fitting for us all, don’t you think, Clown? Your show had to have some suspense, no? Meet my grand design. . . <strong>Minos Lambros Labyrinthos.</strong>

<em>Soon enough, the tent itself was gone, broken and destroyed and yet rebuilt to become the home of a labyrinth. As for the trio of servants, something about it had eerily crept up on them, fear?

Even razor-sharp daggers and raging pigeons did little to faze him, and the assorted playing cards and rabbits and milk cartons did even less. It was an evident flaw in Spectacle&#39;s specialisation - An immense defensive ability, weakened by a critical lack of offensive power.

Given enough time, it would not have been difficult for Lancer to chase down Houdini, to defeat him handily. However, it was not that simple.

A new piece had just been placed on the board.

As the walls of the Labyrinth came up, and as the automata rose from the nothing, Honda turned his attention away from Spectacle, from Conquest, and towards Daedalus. The sudden change in location, the chill running up his spine, it could only mean one thing...

He looked at the Lancers pointedly, before gesturing violently towards Daedalus. 

The magician&#39;s clothes were streaked in dust from Daedalus&#39;s labyrinth, and to Basil and Sengoku, it looked like he had lost his luster. He didn&#39;t glow, and despite his spectacular clothing, he didn&#39;t illuminate the room with his presence. There was no crowd, no great applause, or anything.

&quot;<strong>The Labyrinth. I&#39;ve dreamed of escaping this ever since I was alive. This is the ultimate escape room.</strong> I know who you are, you filthy showstopper.&quot; Caster snarled as he doubled over, feeling his energy drain. Not only was his victory being robbed, but it was being robbed by a person who didn&#39;t have the decency to show up on time.

And of <em>course</em> it&#39;d be Daedalus. Spectacle never liked the guy, even as the two mocked each other. The shmuck was a genuine Magus from the Age of Gods. He was miles out of Spectacle&#39;s league, and that infuriated him. Daedalus wanted to be king of the stage, despite not deserving it. He had ruined the show between Spectacle and the two Lancers. 

Ergo, he was a true foe. An enemy to showmanship himself.

But Caster couldn&#39;t defeat him here. He had used two separate Noble Phantasms, and he was running out of juice. He was not in his territory, so there was no advantage.

&quot;<strong>Look, Honda Civic.</strong>&quot; Caster&#39;s voice rattled. &quot;As much as you love to shake spears and whatnot, even you have to realize this is a bad move.&quot; Caster said as he tapped the walls, inspecting them. He floated to the ceiling, and did the same.

&quot;Lancer Number Two, whatever your name was, I know we&#39;ve had our differences... I sent your Lancer buddy to an escape room, but at least I <em>fought</em> you, yeah? Look at this... this... <em>poser</em>. He dropped us in a labyrinth with no hope for escape, although...&quot;

Caster tapped his hand against a corner of the wall, and put his ear to it, seemingly deep in thought.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-984720687631597598 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=984720687631597598><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Jun-22 05:28 PM">17:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Another Caster then made his presence known. Made obvious as to who he is. Daedalus, the man who rivaled the gods in terms of in the construction of architecture. Basil, however, was unfazed by this turn of events. 

Becoming entrapped within the labyrinth with both Honda and Houdini. The other lancer loosing focus on the clown. Who Basil kept his whole focus on. &quot;Give me one. Good Reason to not end your miserable existence, and cooperate with your <em>plan</em>.&quot;

What was the point of being a Servant if he couldn’t throttle people for being stupid?

“No choice?” Caster asked, shrugging. Even his shrugs produced sparkles. That logic was impeccable. Caster should have been a lawyer. Suing dozens of Magi and fakers essentially put him halfway there.

Was there a Lawyer Servant Class? The magician shelved that line up thought and put his hands on his hips.

“Also, a random plot twist from this guy? No no. I don’t appreciate my show getting undermined. It’s like conquering a country only to get invaded from the other side.” Caster grumbled something that sounded like ‘<em>lawsuit</em>’. “Your victory is getting burglarized. Bulgarized… Heh… Now let me concentrate.”

Caster returned to poking around.

Or was he simply able to put on a better performance than a man who looked like he performed for children birthday parties.

“You could say I wish to end a fight, and I chose to join in. And what a perfect timing it was, to see the clown so upset, it takes me back to the memories I enjoyed! Bested at your thing, SSShowman?”

One good strike. That was all it would take to kill him, and send these miles-high walls crumbling down to rubble. He just had to get there first.

<strong>&quot;The fight will certainly end, Caster. And you will be ended with it.&quot;</strong>

The stone statue approached him, attacking with its blade, but Honda was no amateur.

Caster held up his fingers. &quot;Disgusting, droll, and disgusting. Yes, I think you make for a DDDull person. Do me a favor and shut up for a second so you can hear the cheer of the crowd.&quot;

Caster floated for a moment as Honda entered combat with the stone statues. He scratched his chin, before putting his hand against it as if pondering a great dilemma.

&quot;That&#39;s odd. I don&#39;t hear anything, Caster. Why would that be? Maybe it&#39;s because your show is <strong>lame!</strong> Nobody cares about a maze, genius! This isn&#39;t 6000 B.C. Get with the times. You&#39;re a zero, and I&#39;m a hero!&quot;

Everything he made a masterpiece only for unruly and untalented artists to mine and try to contend against. The Caster turned towards the duo, watching as his stone swordsman got close enough to allow his blade to try to slice at the blonde’s chest for a direct hit.

Now reluctantly allying himself with this nuisance. But the want. The feeling. The <em>need</em> to throttle him. Was ever present. 

As soon as spectacle freed them. That would be it for this little alliance. 

The stone statue approached the Emperor and he met it head on. Striking outwards with his spear. Aiming to be deadly to the construct, all the while Houdini used lancer for cover. Or bait. Or both. 

Then Daedalus showed his authority over this labyrinth. Remodeling it to his whims. As skewers were formed and threatened to turn the caster into a pincushion. With his free hand Basil reached back for caster and drug him close. Moving forwards. 

Mana then began to surge from the Lancer of Conquest. A true Name Release.

Four guards men came to his side and began to strike the stone construct as he delivered the final blow.

<em>SCRRRRRR!</em> The blade of the sword dug into his flesh, but left behind no obvious wound. Yet, one could see a slight flinch in Honda&#39;s eye as it struck. 

<em>THWAP!</em> The arrow soaring towards him landed square on his chest, but only succeeding in bouncing off harmlessly. Yet, one could sense that Lancer was most uncomfortable with that outcome. 

But, fortunately, he had one helpful ally. With a shout that echoed throughout the halls of the labyrinth, he activated his Noble Phantasm, calling forth illusory soldiers to fight by his side. A perfect distraction. A perfect opening.

As the Byzantium guards marched forth, Lancer disengaged from combat, using his swift speed to dash towards Daedalus himself. Stomping forth with all his might, he angled the Tonbokiri up, aiming to pierce the Caster directly through the chest.

He continued to poke away at the walls, before chanting quickly, glowing for a moment. He grinned under his mask, before watching several of the bricks turn into birds, and flutter away into nothingness.

He gaped for a moment, and then blinked. The wall was back to normal.

<em>You&#39;re going insane.</em> Caster&#39;s brain said.
<em>Shut up.</em> Caster responded.
<em>Also, you can&#39;t use any more Noble Phantasms. You&#39;re out of juice, Houdini.</em> His brain responded.
<em>Get out of my head.</em> Caster thought.

His brain refused to leave his head. Inconsiderate brain. Yeah, Caster was definitely losing it. Despite this, both Lancers seemed perfectly sane, though calling Basil sane was the same as calling Daedalus more interesting than Houdini: incomprehensibly incorrect.

Maybe Daedalus&#39;s labyrinth was like A Magician Among Spirits, and specifically targeted Casters. That was likely, though he&#39;d need a larger sample size to prove it. A sample size that didn&#39;t include two Lancers who got off to impaling things with their spears.

These walls were feeling a lot tighter. Caster floated out of the way of the spikes with an <em>eep!</em> He must have done something to piss off Daedalus the Angry Architect, because he seemed especially excited to kill Caster.

&quot;Aha.&quot; Caster said, tapping the bir—brick, and causing the labyrinth to glow in a dull golden light for a second. The magician took a grand, albeit twitchy bow. This labyrinth wasn&#39;t good for the magician&#39;s sanity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-985314255173713990 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=985314255173713990><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Jun-22 08:47 AM">08:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Daedalus&#39;s prison was famed for turning its captors mad.

How could the world&#39;s greatest escape artist fare against one of history&#39;s deadliest traps? If there was a way, Caster would find it. That was what Harry Houdini was all about.

&quot;<strong>Ladies and Gentlemen!</strong>&quot; Houdini roared spectacularly in the dingy labyrinth as two Lancers fought for their lives. Nobody turned towards him. What an inconsiderate audience.

&quot;<strong>This labyrinth cannot hold me. Watch in awe as I escape the greatest trap ever conceived, and with two dunderheads to boot!</strong>&quot; Houdini gestured towards the two Lancers currently fighting for their lives.

&quot;<strong>I am Eric Weiss, Harry Houdini, the Master of Escape! Your little maze can&#39;t hold me, just like a straightjacket hoisted by a crane couldn&#39;t!</strong>&quot;

Caster took a bow. He was definitely going nuts. You didn&#39;t reveal your real name for something this droll.

A magic circle appeared around Houdini, which began to glow in a slew of colors.

To Daedalus, it screamed <strong>HIT ME</strong>! To Basil, it said <em>oh please don&#39;t let them hit me I break easily</em>.

“Oh no you don’t!”

<em>Daedalus grew furious when he heard another true name release, tired of dealing with both Honda and those three idiots entirely before the ground sent another jagged edge of marble from the floor again. These edges made a beautiful yet deadly sculpted flower, it’s edges meant to impale whatever had in its vicinity. He’d skewer the fool before he could do anything else to try to make himself a nuisance.

<em>As for Honda, the soldiers he had left. . . Wouldn’t have let go. Their commander was in danger, they would allow such things to continue.

Every one of his strike narrowly missed, impacting upon marble, striking naught but stone. Meanwhile, every strike of the statues hit his body.

It was practically impossible for him to lose in a fair fight, due to his technique and power. Daedalus did not fight fair, however. He simply regurgitated statues like it was upstate New York, and overwhelmed Honda. The warrior disappeared into a slew of marble, where he was impaled.

&quot;Honda...&quot; Caster wiped a silver tear from his mask. &quot;You truly helped end this poser&#39;s false show. Observe.&quot; What actually came out of his mouth was &quot;Uuuohhhhhhhhh, Hondaaaa!!!&quot; Curse Madness Enhancement!

Houdini looked at the Reality Marble. It was a cage trapping him and Basil, and if there was one thing Houdini exceeded in, it was the escape of cages. Even those as spectacular as a Reality Marble. His Origin was &quot;escape&quot;, after all. 

Caster snapped his fingers, and a gash in reality opened up in the sky above Basil and Houdini. On the other side was a burning tent. Excellent, he had found the brick where his territory and Daedalus&#39;s labyrinth intersected!

&quot;Away we go, my muscle-bound friend!&quot; (&quot;Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayuuohhhh.&quot;) Caster grunted, feeling his energy sap away substantially. Grabbing Basil by his shoulders, the two floated towards the gash.

&quot;Heavy... Lose some weight.&quot; (&quot;▂▂▃▃▅▅ーーー&quot;) Houdini grunted, the tips of his hat retaining their comically red shade. 

The two vanished through the gash, leaving Honda behind. They were back in Houdini&#39;s tent, which was now ablaze. Without Caster,  there was no way to combat the flames from the fallen spotlight from the prior fight. Caster looked around thoughtfully.

&quot;Go. I need a moment to escape something like this. Plus, I&#39;m fairly tired.&quot; Caster said to Basil, before collapsing onto his back. He waved the Lancer off.

Overwhelming force could be easily out maneuvered. 

 But Basil was still marching headlong forwards. Maddened to his maximum, thankfully Houdini had gripped the emperor at just the right moment to pluck both of them from the confines of Daedalus’s magnum opus. 

Soon enough the lancer was back on stable ground. Staring down at the worn out caster. Basil could only produce a maddened gaze no verbalizations were made. But it was understood. 

Escaping the labyrinth. At the price of Houdini’s safety. 

The Byzantine began to wander off. Noble Phantasm still active for a few more moments.

Or should I call you Houdini? Either way, I should say this is a good idea of ending our little meeting here. I hope you could forgive my late coming, but let’s meet again in the future! If you don’t die like your friend, that is!”

<em>To see that Houdini had easily made a hole in his perfected labyrinth was almost infuriating, but it was not time to worry about it. He had done what he needed to do, now he simply had to go and get a place to rest. . . His lab would have been great. He just needed to leave. Daedalus rose his hand, watching as the crown he had buoyed upward as if the ground was water as he scooped it up and placed it on its head. Once the duo had gone from his sight, the reality he had broke down, shattering about him like glass stars were he he found himself at the entrance of the Dummy Labs.</em>

“Well, you can’t kill them all. . . Hopefully we see each other again. . .”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
