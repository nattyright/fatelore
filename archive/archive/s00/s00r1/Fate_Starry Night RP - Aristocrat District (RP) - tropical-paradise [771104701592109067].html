                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Tropical Paradise, a place free of the horrendous cold plaguing the city of Persepolis, was where Sandro had chosen to spend his night. He sat up on a mossy cliffside just next to a waterfall crashing into the man made lake below. Sandro took a long drag from a cigarette placed in his right hand as he rested his chin on his other. His coat was sprawled out to his side, his shirt unbuttoned on the top as the artificial heat was getting to him. He blew out his smoke slowly letting it crawl up his face as he peered down into the waters below. 

His reflection in the water seemed so small. Staring back into his own eyes Sandro seemed lost in a world of his own. Deep in thought he was neglecting that fact that behind him was a summoning circle etched against the rocky gravel placed below a cluster of vine ridden trees. None of that mattered to Sandro right now, all he could think about was how much he hated this damned city. Sandro knew that the second he spoke the ritual he would be a slave to his fathers will once more. 

Sandro’s grip on his cigarette tightened, making it buckle into a U shape between his fingers. He flicked the crushed tobacco into the water, spitting down at his reflection as if he were trying to provoke a stranger. He turned his legs to the side standing up from the mossy spot, rubbing the dirt of his buttox. 

Sandro walked over to the circle behind him pacing himself dreading the moment he would be standing over it. After ten long steps Sandro found himself at the circle glaring at it as if it were his father in the flesh. Sandro pulled another cigarette from his pants pocket, dropping it on the circle. He looked down his hands shaking uncontrollably. Sandro looked at his hands trying to steady them. What was he so afraid of? He was confident in his abilities as a magus yet the fear of the unknown, and his unwilling nature, pierced his heart making him tremble with frustration.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He reached down picking the cigarette and bringing it to his mouth with shaky hands, lighting it soon after. He took long hard puffs of the cigarette trying to calm himself down. Once in a more stabilized mental state it was time for the ritual to begin.

“Well Salvatore… Dad.... I guess it&#39;s time for your son to make you proud” Sandro than dug his hands deep into pockets loosening his lips on his cigarette preparing himself to recite the incantation, which had dedicated to memory

“Let silver and steel be the essence.”
“Let stone and the archduke of contracts be the foundation” 
“Let rise a wall against the wind that shall fall”
“Let the four cardinal gates close.”
“Let the three-forked road from the crown reaching unto the Kingdom rotate.”
“I hereby declare, your body shall serve under me.”
“My fate shall be your sword.”
“If you submit to this will and this reason, then answer!”
“An oath shall be sworn here!”
“I shall attain all virtues of all of Heaven.” 
“I shall have dominion over all evils of all of Hell!”
“Yet, though serves with thine eyes clouded in chaos”
“Thou, bound in the cage of madness.”
“I am he who command these chaos”
 
“From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by three greet words of power,
Come forth from the ring of restraints,”
Protector of the Holy Balance.”
In almost one breath and voice full of anger Sandro recited the ritual. From the circle a dark whisping aura poured out, the winds around him picked up thrashing the water around. Sandro stood outside the circle making sure his cigarette stayed in his mouth. He looked at the circle intently waiting to see what was on the other side.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A maelstrom of black mist and wind erupted out from the summoning circle, lashing against anything unfortunate enough to be nearby. Sandro would immediately feel the air around him grow hotter, the humidity in the air beginning to slowly dry out and become arid. It was as if he had entered into a desert, surrounded by nothing but sprawling sands with the hot sun beating down mercilessly upon him. 

The dark fog condensed, growing thicker and thicker with each passing moment. It wrapped itself around the body of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T exoskeleton, like a corpse being wrapped in linens as it was mummified. It started with the hands and feet, following up the limbs like a lit fuse before meeting at the torso, slowly finishing with a featureless blob of a head. From there, the gloom seemed to chisel away at itself, cutting away parts as distinctly human features became notable. Eyes, then a nose, then ears, then a mouth. Organs were moulded within the void of a chest, and fingers began to sprout out from the arms.

Then, without warning, the summoning ritual reached a violent finish. The black mist exploded with a bang, creating a surge of flame that silenced with swaying winds. The flames flickered and burned upon the figure for a moment, seemingly locking in its features, before slowly dying out.

Standing amongst the char and ash was a woman, clad in a combination of ornate golden armour and fine fabrics. The figure seemed to take a moment to acquaint themselves to their new surroundings, before turning to face Sandro. Their deep blue eyes glared him, as if sizing him up for a moment, before a smirk crawled upon her face. She stepped out of the expended summoning circle, her stinger swaying gently as she approached.

<strong>&quot;So, you&#39;re supposed to be my new Vizier?&quot;</strong> Berserker asked, bending down to come face-to-face with her new master. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re a little glum. Shouldn&#39;t you be busy revelling in my second coming? Hm?&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro leaned forward, bracing himself from the strong wind, his cigarette flying out of his mouth and down the waterfall below. He tried to keep his face up, looking at the black mist dance viciously around the circle. 

Sandro watched the exoskeleton&#39;s metamorphosis with a close eye. Sweat dripped from his chin, feeling immense, and a wave of anxiety building in his chest. What was coming to life before his eyes? Watching the Servant become grounded in this world again, he knew he would never be the same.

As the summon finished, the violent burst of energy sent Sandro back a few steps, almost tripping over the waterfall before catching his balance in a panic. His eyes glistened in awe as he watched the flaming figure reveal itself to him.

He locked eyes with the Servant sending chills down his spine; her sheer size was enough to tell him that he was not the alpha in this new pact.

Sandro stared at his Servant, unable to move or speak, but then her voice hit his ears. <em>“A question she… she asked a question.”</em> He thought. It was then that Sandro snapped back into reality. His fear, anxiety, and any doubts from before had left his body. Before him he saw something magnificent, it was a servant, his Servant! A smile grew on his face, followed by a chuckle. He looked up at King Scorpion, meeting her eyes.

 “Revelling? But of course!”? He said with a laugh. “I mean, look at you, you&#39;re really here in the flesh” Just seeing the Servant in front of him, Sandro felt that he might just be living up to the standards his father put forth. “Tell me berserker, what is your name?”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>&quot;You call this revelling, boy?&quot;</strong> Scorpion asked Sandro, glancing around the surrounding area. It was pleasant, like an oasis reprieve in the middle of the formless desert. Yet for the triumphant return of a king? Where was the parade of camels? The monuments in her likeness? The stacks upon stacks of gold? This guy was a rank amateur!

<strong>&quot;Well, I suppose you</strong> <em><strong>tried.</strong></em> <strong>Not very hard, but you certainly made an attempt. A bad attempt, but an attempt nonetheless.&quot;</strong> The queen noted, surveying the swaying trees and rippling waters as she spoke. <strong>&quot;However, I&#39;m in a good mood, so I&#39;ll forgive this transgression. You&#39;re welcome, by the way.&quot;</strong>

Yet as soon as she had dealt with one annoyance, another had come her way. This twerp had already failed to provide a satisfactory welcoming festival, and now he was asking stupid questions?

<strong>&quot;Okay, three things: Number one, you speak when spoken to. That&#39;s another transgression, and my good mood is souring by the second, but I&#39;ll also be kind enough to forgive that one as well.&quot;</strong> Scorpion began, poking her master in the chest. <strong>&quot;Number two, you&#39;ve asked me a stupid question. As my vizier, you&#39;re supposed to have these kind of answers, but since you&#39;re evidently quite bad at your job, I&#39;ll overlook this failure for now. Number three, it&#39;s very obvious who I am...&quot;</strong>

The berserker put a hand on Sandro&#39;s shoulder, shoving him to the ground to further the height difference between the two, before taking a few steps back. She spun around, a fluid and elegant motion, before striking a grand pose.

<strong>&quot;I am the great and mighty OZYMANDIAS! Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;</strong>

There was a pause, the queen of Egypt holding her pose for a moment, before her expression faltered.

<strong>&quot;At least, I&#39;m fairly certain that I am. Probably. Maybe. I think.&quot;</strong></span>

Sandro flinched a bit, stepping back with each poke on his chest; the servant&#39;s sheer size wasn&#39;t something he wanted to mess with, size aside, she spoke big also… maybe too big, Sandro couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing.

Only speak when spoken to? Know the answers to his own questions? Who did this lady think she was? Sandro is the master, and he felt he should be treated as such. Before he knew it, Sandro was shaken from his aggravated thoughts as the King shoved him to the ground.

It seemed his servant was finally going to answer his question… until… 

&quot;W-wait a minute!... You don&#39;t know who you are?&quot; He asked, looking up at King Scorpion, a look of confusion spread across his face. &quot;I mean if you&#39;re Egyptian… are you sure you&#39;d be Ozymandias?&quot; 

Sandro then stood up, dusting off the back of his pants. &quot;First off, I mean, look at that big knocker of a tail you have; if you&#39;re an Egyptian king, I think your identity would be pretty obvious; and second, you don&#39;t get to choose when I speak. At most, you&#39;re my lesser, and at best, we are equals. We&#39;re in this together, ok?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>&quot;Of COURSE I know who I am, idiot!&quot;</strong> Scorpion lied, leering down at Sandro with complete disapproval in her eyes. <strong>&quot;I just happen to not remember right now! You probably screwed up the summoning ritual somehow. That seems likely, considering how many times you&#39;ve already messed things up.&quot;</strong>

Scowling, the queen took a few steps away from her master as he climbed back to his feet. She examined her surroundings, stroking her chin as her eyes glanced across the area. It was certain larger than most oasis&#39;s she&#39;d seen in her life. More trees, too. It was no grand palace, but she&#39;d evidently been summoned by some completely poverty-stricken fool of a master. 

This belief would soon be reinforced, as Sandro did his best to assert that their partnership was a democracy. Yet, perhaps he had been too inelegant with his choice of wording...

<strong>&quot;Me, your lesser?&quot;</strong> The Berserker spun around, looking at Sandro for a moment, before allowing a hearty chuckle to escape her mouth. <strong>&quot;Let me make one thing straight, you glorified serf: I am the one in charge here. You live only because I haven&#39;t decreed that you die. Don&#39;t try anything funny, or I&#39;ll have you buried up to your neck in hot stands until you perish, got it? And don&#39;t talk about my &#39;knockers&#39;, you wretch! You have no right to speak of a King in such a derogatory way!&quot;</strong>

Scorpion took a moment to bask in her self-assured greatness, before something clicked in her head. She cast her eyes downward, her confident facial expression briefly cracking into confusion. She was a girl?! What kind of foolishness was this?!

Wait, but if she was a girl, then that would mean...

<strong>&quot;Queen! You have no right to speak of a Queen in such a way! If you want to make an enemy of the beautiful and captivating Cleopatra, then it will be your funeral.&quot;</strong></span>

Everything that came out of King Scorpion&#39;s mouth was utter foolishness. She sounded like a schoolkid who was half-assing a presentation because they hadn&#39;t been prepared.

&quot;Cleopatra?&quot; Sandro repeated the name, stroking his chin as he chewed at the cigarette bud between his lips. &quot;Well, she is a woman, that might make more sense than a King like Ozymandias.&quot; He thought to himself. Cleopatra was a strong woman, but wasn&#39;t she known to be graceful and manipulative with her words? The servant before Sandro was anything but that; she was upfront and rash as all hell. Then again, her curse of madness could also change her personality. 

Sandro sat looking at Scorpion, scanning her with his eyes. This created an awkward silence as thoughts ran through his head. Something just didn&#39;t sit right; what about the tail?

&quot;Alright King, Queen, your majesty, whatever it is. Just remember killing me would be like suicide, so bury me in the sand if you want. I&#39;d just be worried about disappearing after I&#39;m dead… we are in a contract after all.&quot; As Sandro spoke, he lit another cigarette spitting the old one to the ground. 

&quot;And when I say &#39;knocker&#39; I don&#39;t mean those!&quot; He said, pointing to her chest. &quot;I mean that! the giant scorpion tail, I mean Jesus woman, there&#39;s only one King I can think of who ever meddled with Scorpions and his name, or well uh maybe her name, was just that!&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite her best attempts to assert dominance, it appeared that Scorpion had failed to sway her master. He did raise a good point - No matter how badly she threatened to execute him, she still needed him around to feed her mana. Thus, the situation called for a more diplomatic approach.

<strong>&quot;Okay, look: leading a country is</strong> <em><strong>hard,</strong></em> <strong>okay?&quot;</strong> The Egyptian complained, crossing her arms as she looked over at Sandro. <strong>&quot;Being chosen by the divine will to rule isn&#39;t all just lying down in fancy chairs, being fed grapes while you get fanned by slaves! Besides, you were the one who forced me into being a Berserker instead of something noble and fitting, like a Rider or a Lancer. Really, this is all your fault.&quot;</strong>

Well, diplomatic was a strong word. Her arrogant nature and status as a Berserker made such a difficult at best, and impossible at worst. That certainly did not stop her from continuing to try. 

<strong>&quot;However, I suppose I can forgive your multitude of failings. After all, your taste in women is exquisite, even if you&#39;re aiming way, way, WAY out of your league.&quot;</strong> Scorpion continued, draping her tail over her shoulder and gently caressing it. <strong>&quot;But you are right! I am not Ozymandias, nor am I Cleopatra...&quot;</strong>

Finally, it appeared Sandro would receive an answer to his original question. Granted, he&#39;d already figured out who his servant was, but at least he&#39;d have confirmation.

<strong>&quot;...Because I can&#39;t remember it. Sorry.&quot;</strong></span>

Then again, if she was this much of a handful as a berserker, maybe having a more adept brain would make for a more frustrating time. Sandro snickered a bit as this thought crossed his mind.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Sandro said, standing tall with his arms spread out, almost as if he were looking for an embrace. &quot;Who am I but a lowly peasant to assume that your job, the job of King, be so simple.&quot; Sandro spoke with a deepness to his voice as he tried to imitate the sound of a philosopher. &quot;You are neither Ozymandias nor Cleopatra, though your beauty may say otherwise.&quot; It was clear at this point that Sandro had picked up this ridiculous tone almost as if to mock his Servants boldness. &quot;From now on, we shall assume you the title of The Scorpion King!&quot;

As soon as Sandro finished speaking, he broke out into laughter; he just couldn&#39;t take himself seriously. Although he couldn&#39;t help but feel he was coming off a loser by creating his own humor, he cracked himself up.

Sandro then hopped in place, regaining his composure. &quot;All jokes aside, though, It seems to me that you may as well be the Scorpion King. We have no way of confirming this Berserker, but it won&#39;t do any harm to assume.&quot; Sandro pulled the cigarette from his mouth, blowing a cloud of smoke. &quot;And you can just call me Sandro, ok?&quot; Sandro figured trying to get Berserker to call him master would be a lost cause. He didn&#39;t have any problems with being on a first name basis.</span>
