                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio wandered the streets, shedding a tear of joy as he breathed in the festive goodness all around him. Of course, there wasn&#39;t any actual festivities being celebrated right now. Aimed to attract tourists and locals alike for a cheaper price than dining at the <span class="mention">#restaurant-district</span>, the stalls at the Entertainment District was (thankfully) still operating at full capacity despite the grim outlook in the less savory parts of the city. An illusion to keep everyone with a full pocket happy, and it seemed to work superbly.

The smell of caramel and butter filled Tapio&#39;s nostrils, sweet and heavenly. He found his way to the nearest food stand, his head bobbing up and down as the crowd swallowed up his small stature like an ocean wave. Coins changed hands, and a minute later he pushed his way out onto the main street again, a donut in hand and a slightly lighter coin pouch in the other.

It felt good to be alone. He never believed the days would come when he agreed with that sentiment, but after a whole two (two!) days of being tortured by numbers, sigils, and an excessive amount magecraft theories that made the courses he&#39;d taken at the academy look like a joke, Tapio was just about done with conversing with another human being. Well. A sentient being. Aratron at this point, felt more like a machine than a man - though he <em>did</em> summon him into a Mystic Code that was practically a robot, which seemed quite fitting in retrospect.

Tapio mulled over the question seriously, and came up with a big fat no. He suspected that Aratron had only agreed to this extended break aka food run because he wouldn&#39;t be able to teach Tapio anymore had the latter starved himself to death. Aside from that, Aratron himself needed a fresh pack of mana batteries as well, and since he couldn&#39;t buy them himself, Tapio had the perfect excuse to extract himself from the grueling lessons and go on an excursion. 

Of course, he didn&#39;t feel the need to tell his substitute teacher exactly where he was going. Did they sell mana batteries at the stalls? Unlikely. Though a small detour would never hurt...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio was enjoying a much needed break, after hours of gruelling study sessions that made him feel dumber more than anything else. Not even active disinterest was able to sway Aratron away from shoving his lessons down Tapio&#39;s brain. The boy felt almost grateful for the sudden power outage, albeit he knew that it was only a temporary relieve. The moment things were fixed was the moment he would have to return to that dreaded church.

Maybe he had summoned the wrong Servant?

Just when that thought crossed his mind, he felt something tugging at his leg. His sock slipped down as he looked behind him and noticed a small critter biting at his ankle. The crowd was so large and vast that he had completely shut the outside world, submerged in the swarm of people like a bee in a hive. The same seemed to apply to the small familiar, since the two were basically ignored by the rest of the people gathered at the stalls.

That being said, this wasn&#39;t the first time he saw this creature: It was the gargoyle-like monstrosity that Aratron had conjured back at the church. He said something about it being Tapio&#39;s shadow as well. Well, he certainly wasn&#39;t kidding. Tapio didn&#39;t know how long the creature had been tailing him, but the fact that it had revealed itself to him was a bad sign.

&quot;Student, I tire of waiting.&quot; He heard that familiar, detached voice from a member of the crowd. Despite warning Aratron to stay put, the Servant had ignored his commands and decided to head out himself. Thankfully, his modern looking attire allowed him to blend in rather well.</span>

&quot;I did as you said, and performed around 69 routine checks of the workshop.&quot; Crap. Tapio had just tossed a random, unreasonable task at his Servant to keep them busy, but Aratron was a monster at completing mundane tasks, much like a machine.

&quot;It took me only a measly 30 minutes, which should be more than enough time to purchase mana batteries, rest and replenish your energy reserves all in one. What is the reasoning behind this delay? We only have 16 hours a day to work with, after all.&quot; The Servant said, emerging from the crowd and standing in front of Tapio, towering above him like some sort of monument.

&quot;...And pray tell, why 69 checks, of all things? Could you not go with 70? Or 63? Far more elegant numbers than whatever you demanded.&quot; He asked, looking slightly ticked off. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="WafflesofWar#7330">@WafflesofWar</span></span>

As if on cue, the voice of the person he dreaded to see reached his ears despite the bustling crowd. Tapio gulped, slowly turning his head around as he brainstormed wildly for a new excuse.

&#39;Ah. Um. Right. You work, uh, you work fast, professor.&#39; Tapio grimaced, then a sheepish look crossed his face. He tried to hide the half-eaten donut behind his back. &#39;I was um, just getting to the mana batteries. I heard that there&#39;s a bargain sale at one of the gift shops on this street, and I wanted to see if they had batteries in stock. These things are pretty expensive, you see, and I don&#39;t know how to make my own.&#39;

He shrunk a bit when Aratron started accusing him of some unholy number. Was that what he&#39;d said back at the workshop? But more importantly was the question of...

&#39;...Does it really matter?&#39; He shrugged. &#39;Six is a good number.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Mana batteries? Oh. I was unaware of those.&quot;

Tapio would be caught off guard. Did his own Servant forget about their mana supply? Mana batteries were the only thing tying Aratron down to the world, especially since the two hadn&#39;t bonded yet (and Tapio sure wasn&#39;t going to bond with some lecture obsessed freak). For someone who most likely hadn&#39;t had a physical body in ages, Aratron seemed to care more about Tapio&#39;s studies than his own well-being.

&quot;But it is good to know that my pupil is so diligent. Be at ease, and walk down the righteous path.&quot; Aratron said in an overdramatic manner, gathering the puzzled stares of many. Thankfully, they proceeded to ignore him and went back to shopping.

&quot;Now, where does one procure these...mana batteries? What are they made of? How do they function? Do you--&quot; Before he could continue his barrage of questions, Tapio said the unthinkable...

&quot;...<strong>Six is a terrible number.</strong> You should refrain from making jokes in poor taste, student.&quot; Aratron replied with a raised eyebrow, as if he could not believe Tapio&#39;s audacity to state such an obvious lie. The familiar next to Tapio&#39;s legs could sense the Servant&#39;s ire. It quivered and scuttled away, disappearing in the shadows.

&quot;Numbers are not to be trifled with, especially when you fail to grasp the power behind them. Tell me, if you were to pick a favourite number, which one would it be?&quot; The disgruntled stare started to morph into a murderous glare. Tapio found this whole behaviour rather odd. It was the first time he saw Aratron so ticked off.

&#39;Two. Four.&#39; He blurted out. &#39;Six.&#39; He said adamantly, keeping a watchful eye on his surroundings and trying to secure an escape route should thundering retribution strike upon him from his Servant. &#39;Eight.&#39; He added, conjuring up the beautiful image of a pyramid in his mind.

<strong>&quot;And why is it my duty to acquire these batteries? Are we truly so understaffed you must send a knight to do the job of a pawn?&quot;</strong>

Szrac looked away from his communicator screen, glancing over towards the hustle and bustle of the stalls. There were hordes of people, each squabbling with one another to acquire the best deals at the most competitive prices. How droll. He had long since discarded the need for such petty vices as gluttony. 

Yet the stall did stock one thing that he required - mana batteries. They had long since sold out of most traditional stores, and most those produced by the aristocracy were sent off to fuel Servants involved in maintaining the city. That meant it off to scrounge amongst the dregs, the scalpers, and the third party sellers.

<em>&quot;It&#39;s likely that other Masters will be seeking these batteries too. If that is the case, suffice to say you and your Saber will be better suited than any factory worked or scientist.&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;Fine. This will not take long. Expect our return in an hour. &quot;</strong> Szrac dryly replied, hanging up on the call. What an unnecessary concern. What kind of third-grade master would even be caught dead with their servant in an aristocratic territory, anyway?</span>

If Aratron wasn&#39;t furious already, he certainly was now. His murderous glare got even more frustrated, his brow narrowing at the mention of every number uttering from Tapio&#39;s mouth.

&quot;...Enough! I see now the error of your ways. It is unsurprising that you ended up such a mediocre magus.&quot; The Servant cryptically stated. At least they had limited themselves to scolding the boy at most. Seemed like Aratron had a modicum of self-restraint, even if he was being triggered over something so miniscule.

&quot;Let this be clear, student. The strongest number of all is <strong>seven.</strong> It cannot be divided. It cannot be separated. You owe your days to the almighty seven, otherwise the concept of a week would cease to exist. Its power is beyond your comprehension.&quot; Was he seriously lecturing Tapio right now? Out in public, nonetheless? The boy&#39;s underappreciation for this odd number had struck a nerve, it seemed.

Maybe just nodding and agreeing would get Aratron to stop. <em>Maybe.</em> Or, if Tapio would rather preserve his dignity, he could attempt to cause a distraction to free himself from his lecturer&#39;s ramblings. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="WafflesofWar#7330">@WafflesofWar</span></span>

Frederick the Great, Uniter of German People&#39;s, Great Prussian King had... rolled into alongside Szrac upon the office chair currently serving as his throne, still clad fully in his armor.   He spoke low next, as to not let others listen in on their conversation.

&quot;Preparations aren&#39;t quite complete for the Power Plant&#39;s defense, and leaving the plant has caused the effects of my <strong>Territorial Conquest</strong> to reset. While I don&#39;t expect we&#39;ll be attacked today, creating such a vulnerability would best be done only if necessary. Aside from Mana batteries is there anything else of worth that could be procured here?&quot; 

If he was being honest, while the strategist in him was speaking true, Frederick longed to walk among the common people&#39;s of the time he&#39;d been summoned into. Wished to hear their woes, hold council and work to better this place.  Being out like this was refreshing and he&#39;d be lieing if he denied the want to venture out and explore the stalls, see the goods and sample the foods of street.</span>

That alone attracted unnecessary attention, but he decision to wear full plate armour further amplified it. Then again, he supposed he had no room to complain, given the mechanical oddity of his appearance.

<strong>&quot;There is little of strategic value to be found here, beyond what is being resold.</strong> Szrac answered Frederick, glancing at his servant for a moment before continuing to scan the packed streets. <strong>&quot;Unless one would consider sugary sweets and carnival games to hold any strategic value.&quot;</strong>

A pause.

<strong>&quot;They do not.&quot;</strong> Szrac affirmed, pressing forth as he continued on down the streets. <strong>&quot;However, there are a variety of mechanisms and machines that could be repurposed for greater means, should they be worth confiscating.&quot;</strong></span>

Besides, odd numbers are...well, odd.&#39; Tapio replied stubbornly. &#39;Sure, you can&#39;t divide it, but that can be said for three and five too. Just because it lent itself to the days of the week doesn&#39;t make any more...special...&#39;

He trailed off, feeling the ever so slight murderous intent coming from the direction of his Servant. 

&#39;On second thought, if you were the spirit of the almighty Sevens, or the inventor of the calendar, then forget what I just said, alright?&#39; He took a small step back, the hand behind his back snapping open the pouch at his waist to fetch a 4-sided dice made of polyglass. 

He hadn&#39;t shown Aratron his own spellcasting tool yet, being stuck relearning theories on bounded fields in the past day or two. A crowded street may not be the best location for spellcasting, but he&#39;d have the element of surprise at his side. This should create ample time for his to slip away, ample time for Aratron to calm down enough and forfeit the idea of lynching his student for stupidity. 

Tapio gripped the dice with some extra force, pouring mana into the runes inscribed on each side. He then flicked his wrist without hesitation, sending the dice upwards as it exploded in a shower of light that dimmed even the skylight from above. It was one of his premade runes to capture light so that he could use it to blind people and make a getaway. Whether it would work on Servants was still up for debate, and he definitely wasn&#39;t going to stick around to find out.

With his eyes shut and ears full of cries of surprise from the surrounding crowd, Tapio turned tail and ran. He navigated through the crowd with ease that shouldn&#39;t belong to a blinded person, marking the first alleyway he could sense in the distance and trying to dive into it for a quick escape.</span>

The days of the week were a mere example. If you were to truly open your eyes, you would realize just how often this number affects the world around us.&quot; Aratron chided, sounding like a conspiracy theorist to Tapio&#39;s ears. This type of magecraft sounded far too complicated for his frail brain, and he had enough.

He took out a small die made out of glass. Aratron raised an eyebrow, pondering on the device&#39;s purpose, before he witnessed it first-hand.

<em>flash</em>

A bright light illuminated the skies, blinding everyone around him and attracting some much unwanted attention. Tapio quickly made a run for it, while Aratron remained immobile and looked distraught. Had a Caster Servant been outmatched by a flashbang of all things? Perhaps he wasn&#39;t as cracked up as he--

No. He remained still, not because he was blinded, but because he was disappointed.

&quot;...Of all magecraft you could have accomplished with runes, you resort to a cheap parlour trick? My expectations of you were low, but there is such a thing as digging beneath the grave.&quot; Aratron stated, judging Tapio&#39;s strategy before snapping his fingers.

&quot;Did you forget about your <em>second shadow?&quot;</em>

As he said that, Tapio heard the familiar screech from before. That darned gargoyle familiar! It snuck up behind him, out speeding him in an instant as it jumped and latched on to his...shorts?!

<em>&#39;Squawk squak!&#39;</em>

The familiar screeched, biting down and hard at his clothing while pulling him away with its durable neck. Eventually, Tapio&#39;s pants fell down.

He tripped on his own shorts, stumbling on the ground as his underwear was thankfully covered by his cloak. Good thing most people were blind, or they would find a sorry sight ahead of them.

&quot;As an escape attempt, I can only grade this an F-------, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; Aratron sighed, slowly walking towards his incompetent Master.</span>

He stood, leaping from the chair and soaring over the crowds stuffed between the stalls, eyes searching for the source of the incident.  Creating such a public disturbance was surely an obvious case of disturbing the peace unless someone was simply defending themselves and public violence was something unneeded now of all times with tensions in the city. He would intervene and mediate this incident immediately not matter what its true nature was.

He failed to spot Tapio before the light faded however he did see the Gargoyle dart into the alleyway, it appeared as a creature in pursuit.  As soon as he landed upon the ground he again lept back in the direction of the alleyway drawing his sword as he did so, in but a moments time he caught sight of the creature standing before a fallen child. 

And his temper was set burning.

With a silent rage as he flew towards the familiar in the air he swung the sword at its back, looking to cleave into the creatures back, the attack shallow enough that if it dodged, or was made of weaker stock than he expected, the blow shouldn&#39;t continue thru to strike Tapio, but it was only just short enough. If this strike landed it would more than bite into the creature.

<em>Striking at a child upon the street in broad day light. The vermin that seek to up end the peace of this city are unforgivable individuals! I didn&#39;t think things were this far gone, my observations from the Power Plant have been limited thus far... I must walk among this places people and upon its streets more.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac waited for a response from his servant, but he got none. Instead, Saber leapt off into the distance, leaving the master alone with the office chair. Upon further inspection, it appeared that his servant had gone after a distant flash of light. A flashbang, perhaps? Was this a clash between the mafia and the police? 

It seemed unlikely, but it was still something he&#39;d have to investigate. Unfortunately, there were several bustling crowds between him and the source of the commotion. Despite all the great wisdom Frederick possessed, he had all but abandoned the cyborg in the pursuit of justice. 

If nothing else, that was in character for him.

Grumbling a curse, Szrac looked down at the office chair. A combination of plastics, fabrics, and metal. In other words, sufficient. The cyborg sat down upon the chair, it&#39;s frame creaking under the weight of his sarcophagus. It likely wouldn&#39;t survive much strenuous activity, but it didn&#39;t have to. Inhaling sharply, he closed his eyes.

<em>A hammer striking an anvil.</em>

In an instant, his magical circuits flared to life. It focused itself around the metal components of the chair, mana firmly gripping them, before launching them, the rest of the chair, and Szrac towards the commotion. As he predicted, the chair practically disintegrated from the force, but it had served its purpose in launching him. 

Now free of the chair, the cyborg repositioned himself in time for the landing, planting himself feet first on the ground. It was not an immediate stop, as he spent a few moments skidding across the tarmac before eventually grinding to a halt. 

<strong>&quot;How irritating.&quot;</strong> Szrac muttered, turning around and following the path of his servant.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio felt his shorts snag and coming dangerously close to tearing. That darned gargoyle! He didn&#39;t know familiars were exempt to being affected by magecraft, or perhaps it was simply the difference in strength between him and his Servant that rendered his tricks useless to the familiar. Either way, the damage was done, and the boy fell face first onto the ground as the gargoyle pulled his shorts all the way down to his ankles.

<em>splat-</em>

-Followed by Aratron&#39;s classic grading of <em>F septuple minus</em>, as if to drive the point home that seven reigns supreme. Unfortunately, Tapio wasn&#39;t paying attention to him at all. Instead, he stayed sprawled on the ground, still as a rock as he let his coat cover his bum and preserve what remained of his dignity. 

He could hear movement behind him, some passersby presumably. That was fine. He&#39;d just pretend to be a street artist performing the incredible feat of a living statue until those people pass, then he&#39;ll kick the dumb gargoyle away, drag his shorts back up with lightning speed and try to make a run for it again-

<em>SWOOSH</em>

He felt wind on the back of his legs, the unmistakable sound of something thin and long swinging down at incredible speed, aimed - somehow - at him!

&#39;What-&#39; He stammered, dropping his living statue act not even 10 seconds in, then whipped his head around...and came face to face with a giant suit of armor. Since when could Aratron summon knight familiars? All just to deliver a beating to him, no less! Still pinned by the gargoyle and far too late to get out of the way, Tapio resigned to his fate and covered his eyes with both hands. Out of sight, out of mind...or so he hoped.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The teacher kept walking, unaware of the two strangers that were slowly creeping up on him. Just a few feet away from catching up to Tapio, Aratron witnessed an oversized cuirass of a man lunge forward at his student. Ill intentions could be felt in the air, as Aratron&#39;s eyes widened and feared for the worst.

But he didn&#39;t move. Instead, he quickly cast a glance at the gargoyle. The familiar glanced back, as if understanding what its owner meant. Frederick&#39;s blow was purposefully lacking in heart, to avoid harming the child next to him. Yet despite that, the gargoyle did the unthinkable: It released its grip on Tapio, before lunging at Frederick and taking its blow head on. 

This wasn&#39;t an attack. No, it was a defensive maneuver. The beast intended to take the full brunt of the knight&#39;s blade, if only to completely halt the motion of his sword. Frederick cleaved through the gargoyle rather easily, watching as its instruments for wings collapsed on the ground as the familiar&#39;s functions ceased. It had sacrificed itself to keep Tapio from being harmed, despite having attacked the child just moments earlier. What was that all about?

&quot;Destroying one of my familiars in a single blow. There is no doubt of it. <strong>You are a Servant, correct?</strong>&quot; Aratron asked, his attention refocusing from Tapio to the man standing next to him. His stare was filled with contempt, as if he were looking at an abominable creature.

&quot;I&#39;m unsure of why your seventh-rate Master would send you to attack a child. One who has yet to finish compulsory education, of all things.&quot; Aratron said, though Tapio would most likely object to that last bit. &quot;But let us make it clear: Do not meddle in our business. If you value your temporary, physical form, that is.&quot;</span>

Wait, were those fighting words? Tapio didn&#39;t know what was going on, but Aratron was being irrationally aggressive to some random old guy. The crowd had taken notice of this little scuffle as well.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Frederick&#39;s blow came down he was unsurprised to see the Gargoyle turn to face him, but it was to late, it would not be able to counter in ti-

Strange, the creature had not moved to counter but rather cover the child in question.  However he did not pull back the blow and destroyed the familiar. He stood up straight peering about, spotting Aratron moments before he spoke.  

So the Gargoyle was this man&#39;s familiar, it would only be polite to answer the man&#39;s question of course, and while Frederick stood by his quick reaction of a disturbance in such a public place, it seemed that with no imminent danger the time for speaking rather than fighting had come.

&quot;While I make no claim as the the rate quality of my Master, I am indeed a Servant. But it seems there has been a misunderstanding, after the flash of light, and the advance of your familiar I had assumed the child was under attack.&quot; he turned to Tapio and allowed his helmet to dematerialize smiling at the boy he gave a curt nod and smiled. &quot;I mean you no harm young man however...&quot; he turned back to Aratron.

&quot;As a loyal servant of this City&#39;s ruling powers, and Servant to my Master&#39;s assignment to stability and security, I reacted quickly to the disturbance I will again assume you are the cause of.  However as we both find ourselves accusing the other of attacking this child I would hear your explanation before delivering a verdict upon your guilt.&quot;

He saw his master arrive in the next moment and sighed internally, why had Szrac followed? He was far safer waiting for the situation to develop, Frederick himself could risk  jumping into the unknown, his Master was far less equipped to do so.  Hence why he&#39;d been left behind. 

&quot;Be true with your words and I promise only proper justice to be levied, and hopefully a fine and public apology for disturbing this market is what we may leave your punishment at. But if you mean harm to this child as I assume you do I will render a more severe verdict here and now.&quot;</span>

<strong>&quot;You forget yourself, Sabre. Did you win all your wars by running in alone and trying to act the hero?&quot;</strong>

Of course, describing Szrac as &quot;much&quot; would have been an understatement. He was VERY much, some would even say that he was TOO much. The cyborg approached the scene, eyes narrowing upon Tapio and Aratron. They were an odd pair. Master and servant, perhaps? Or simply two idiots bumbling about and misusing magic? Either way, they had disturbed the peace, and thus made themselves the target of his ire.

Having turned his back and cowered at the very last minute, the familiar&#39;s heroic sacrifice had gone all but unnoticed, but that didn&#39;t stop him from picking up the bits and pieces from Aratron&#39;s provocative words. 

It was one thing to be on the receiving end of Caster&#39;s ire, but another entirely to hear him cracking down on another individual. Gods, was Aratron like this with <em>everyone</em>? Even a fellow Servant? 

He could only stare as the visage of an old man fit to be his grandpa revealed himself from under the helmet. He sought to return the smile, but felt his jaw go slack instead. 

&#39;You&#39;re...old!&#39; He blurted out.

Quite the amateurish insult compared to Aratron, master of debate. But he was genuinely curious! Aren&#39;t Servants supposed to be summoned in their prime? What kind of war general fought on their deathbed?

Unfortunately, he wouldn&#39;t have time to ponder more at such a thought-provoking question as another giant suit of metal blocked the entrance of the alleyway and inserted himself into the squabble. The seventh-rate Master had finally shown himself, and Tapio, at this moment, wasn&#39;t so sure who fit the title of seventh-rate more.

&#39;No one&#39;s hurting anyone, it was all just a misunderstanding...sir?&#39; He made an attempt at the honorifics, seeing how this metal can spoke as if he held some form of authority over this area. This would be the first time he had to deal with Persepolis&#39; local authorities, and he&#39;d rather not let the situation fester any more than it already had.

 &#39;Your, ah, Saber, broke my Servant&#39;s familiar.&#39; He explained. <em>And good riddance. Please don&#39;t make more.</em> &#39;That&#39;s it, really! We can sweep up the stone and be on our way, right, teac-Caster?&#39; He tried to establish eye contact with Aratron and hoped he&#39;d cooperate, perhaps start by using less condescending titles.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron did not seem to care for Frederick&#39;s explanation. He seemed to be more fixated on the condition of his Master. A quick scrying from afar would suffice. Limbs: Intact. Skin: Uninjured. Clothing: Slightly dusty. Tapio was fine. In fact, the student rose up and attempted to dissolve the tense situation around them. The walking tin can was a member of the local police force, it seemed, and they were rather peeved.

But instead of opposing them, Tapio tried his best to be complacent and avoid any trouble. Aratron raised an eyebrow. For what purpose? Lesser beings should know their place. Or was this some odd custom that was exclusive to Persepolis only? Well, no matter. Aratron was a cultured individual. He would respect other traditions and go on with his work. There was no point in wasting time with the authorities when he had yet to hand over around 77 tomes for Tapio to read in the next 7 hours and 7 minutes.

&quot;...Of course I wouldn&#39;t assault my own students. After all, why would I bear any hatred towards someone far,<strong> far more incompetent than myself?</strong>&quot; Aratron replied while staring back at Frederick.

Tapio&#39;s urge to step on his Servant&#39;s feet rose.

&quot;All I feel is ignorance. But ignorance can be repaired. There is no human that is born stupid, after all.&quot; Aratron stated. &quot;I was merely attempting to restrain my student and prevent them from skipping class. Or do the authorities of this drab city imply that the younger folk should skimp out on studies? If that is the case, then I am quite disappointed in your educational regression.&quot; 

He cast a judgmental glare to the two.</span>

Szrac glared at the Caster, naught but absolute loathing within his eyes. A servant with no regard for others, and a master incapable of controlling them. It was evident that, left unchecked, they would surely cause more havoc, in turn creating further problems for the aristocracy. That, in turn, meant more distractions for him.

In that case, it would be best to nip this problem in the bud. Or, in this case, tear it from the ground roots and all.

<strong>&quot;You are the citizens of this realm, not those in charge. You reap only benefit and face no hardship, akin to grazing cattle. You provide no aid in sustaining the city, yet actively cause problems with your presence. That, combined with your blatant breach of peace, leaves me with only one suitable conclusion.&quot;</strong>

As if the accentuate his point, the master of metal extended an arm, pointing towards Aratron directly.

<strong>&quot;Sabre, reclaim that S.E.R.V.A.N.T suit and apprehend the master. I will not suffer their foolishness any longer.&quot;</strong></span>

&quot;Your quite right about that child, I am sor-&quot; he was intent to apologize for destroying the familiar, after all there was no reason to if the boy hadn&#39;t been in trouble.  Good intentioned or not it was best to admit to mistakes, even those of ignorance however he was cut off as Aratron began to speak, and while at first the Servant seemed to care for the boy, it became obvious he did not. The remark on Tapio being more incompetent than himself irked the Old King. It was to be expected a Servant was more capable than their Master let alone one so young.

This Servant reeked of the elitist practices he had sought to curb in life, the foolish pride that had doomed so many to the sword and plagued society.

While he was intent to respond Szrac took the lead, and Frederick was more than willing to follow when the order was given, his helmet materializing around his head as he charged forward bringing his sword into low hold, ready to sweep upwards at the opposing Servant. He would have liked more time to observe this foe, the fact it used Familiars was telling that it was likely a Caster, but at this distance Frederick would likely have an advantage and it was time to push that before Aratron had a chance to work his trickery and mage craft.  So he sent the straight forward attack flying as he momentarily reached Aratron, the vicious upward sweep threatening to take the Caster&#39;s left leg cleanly.</span>

He wondered whether Aratron was actually trying to hold a conversation or just talking to himself. But it didn&#39;t matter, because unlike him, the tin can man&#39;s fuse turned out to be rather short. 

Tapio felt his heart skip a beat when the elderly Saber launched himself towards Aratron in movement unbefitting of someone in his age bracket. Aratron may have had a way with stone, but he&#39;d never seen him fight in close quarters before. In front of the fully decked out Saber, he looked like a twig in comparison. An incredibly expensive twig, mind you, so hopefully he wouldn&#39;t shatter like the gargoyle in a single strike.

And what of Tapio himself? As all eyes fell on the two Servants, the incompetent Master did the only appropriate thing he could think of, picking himself up from the ground in a mad dash down the alleyway. He just needed a head start, turn the corner and scale a wall or two, then he can lose himself in the crowd, never to be found aga-

<em>splat</em>

Face. Ground. Intimacy. He had forgotten to pull up his shorts. Grey boxers with citrus prints exposed themselves for a brief moment before his coat covered it up safely. The boy rolled off the middle of the road and into a pile of empty barrels, successfully burying his figure and shame behind the makeshift barricade.</span>

The Caster remained composed, as if they had already formed a response in their head. Before they could speak back, however, Frederick struck first. It seemed like Aratron&#39;s words had irritated them.

And Aratron felt equally irritated for being interrupted.

Frederick&#39;s aim was true, and his slash masterful. Yet his opponent stood still, the sword colliding with Aratron&#39;s leg. However, a clean cut never occurred. Once Frederick glanced back to his sword with more attention, he would understand way.

His blade had been turned to <em>stone.</em> His own weapon had started to crack.

&quot;Saber Class Servant, was it? To think the Knight Classes were so vile and corrupt. Whatever happened to your manners, hmm? Perhaps I&#39;m expecting too much from a mere familiar.&quot; Aratron openly expressed his distaste, lightly kicking Frederick&#39;s stone sword away.

&quot;Heroic Spirit or not, you are just another familiar in my eyes. An existence below that of dirt. Now, <strong>kneel.</strong>&quot; The Caster&#39;s words commanded authority, but Frederick wasn&#39;t one to be swayed by such egotistical words. He had faced worse in his past, and would find a way to counter the Servant&#39;s strange abilities. It was time to strike ba--

<em>clank</em>

Before he could take another step forward, he realized that he could no longer move. Instead, his body stumbled as he almost tripped on the ground. He stared back to his own body and realized that everything from his feet to his kneecaps had been petrified. So, this was the opponent he was dealing with. Such vile Magecraft was excluded from his protection to corruption, but it seemed like Aratron could only petrify small portions of his body for now.</span>

&quot;Tch. Magic Resistance. How bothersome.&quot; Aratron spat as he measured the situation. While he did, Tapio attempted his grand escape, which ended in complete failure. The odds were 2 against 1, since Aratron doubted that the tin can man would remain docile. He could attempt to fight and stand his ground, but a Caster was like a fish out of water when away from their workshop. The surprise factor of his petrification was long gone, especially when his opponent was a Saber.

&quot;...Recess is over. We shall continue this at another time. I look forward to completely demolishing your defenses next time, Saber. As a statue, you will be fine material for my next familiar. Be sure to survive until then.&quot; Aratron said, his words sounding like parting words. While both Szrac and Frederick had no intention of letting their target escape, Aratron had already made his move.

People amidst the crowd started screaming, as Frederick realized that people around the stalls were starting to be unconditionally petrified left and right. There was no priority nor bias: Aratron was petrifying people at random with his mere presence, most likely as a distraction to buy time for his escape.

&quot;What will you do now, Saber? A familiar has orders, correct? Yours are to protect your Master and the humans around here. Therefore, pursuing me goes against your objectives. Need I say more?&quot; Aratron said, before turning his back on Frederick and making a run for it. Frederick&#39;s knee caps were slowly reverting to their original state, but not fast enough for him to get up and pursue Aratron. For now, the civilians had priority.</span>

Aratron headed over to the barrels, finding his incompetent student hiding behind them along with his shame out for public display.

&quot;...You seem intact. Good. That being said, is purchasing mana batteries normally such a troublesome task? Or is this the exception?&quot; Aratron asked out of curiosity, before picking Tapio up without adjusting his pants.

&quot;Calm down, student. You won&#39;t feel this at all.&quot;

He proceeded to petrify Tapio himself, turning him into a stone statue...that still showed his gray boxers and citrus prints. A work of art befitting for a museum. If only he weren&#39;t an actual human being...

&quot;Good. You are lighter as a rock.&quot; Aratron muttered to himself, grabbing the stone Tapio and running away. He left the stalls in a hurry, heading for the closest route to the church. <span class="mention" title="WafflesofWar#7330">@WafflesofWar</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tch. How irritating. The enemy Caster had dug their own grave, yet refused to lie down. They instead resorted to a sneak attack, attempting to petrify Frederick, but failing to cause any lasting damage. He supposed that rank of Magic Resistance proved sufficient for that.

Unfortunately, it seemed that Aratron still had a few tricks up his sleeve. In an act that could only be described as &quot;completely lacking in any kind of moral fiber&quot;, he began to turn his petrification magic upon the civilian crowd. Did this idiot have absolutely no respect for the well-being of others? He was even worse than the petty scumbag criminals that roamed the streets!

Szrac channeled his metallurgy into a nearby pipe, ripping it into jagged pieces and causing the water flowing through it to spill everywhere. Yet the panic caused by the random act of terror gave the Caster and his master the perfect opportunity to escape, with no clear shot available for his projectiles.

Thus, they had failed. 

Obnoxious.

<strong>&quot;It appears this farce is over. Return to base and lodge a report with the authorities. If they wish to make a fool out of me, then I will make dead men out of them.&quot;</strong></span>
