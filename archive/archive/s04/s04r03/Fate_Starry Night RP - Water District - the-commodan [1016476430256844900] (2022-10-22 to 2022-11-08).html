The result of the first round was still fresh in the minds of the citizens of Alexandria. A loss was an expected outcome in this tournament. However, the despair that came with it was something they couldn&#39;t have anticipated. 

The Republic struck hard with their first contestants, leaving the Martyr of Alexandria hospitalized but, thankfully, alive. Did the Republic bring nothing but <em>monsters</em> to fight for them? Did Alexandria even have a thread of hope of winning the Grail War? Only the next rounds will tell.

&quot;...Come on. Stop shaking...&quot; A nervous announcer held their hands together and rested their forehead against them. It would appear that stage freight has taken over the announcer. Their foot threatened to tap a hole into the ground with how restless the anxious tapping was. 

&quot;The people are counting on you to hype them up after all...You got this.&quot;

A deep breath was taken. It was now or never...

&quot;<strong>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO THE DAY OF THE SECOND MATCH IN OUR WONDERFUL CITY!</strong>&quot;

The voice attempted to revitalize the spirits of the crowds with its energetic commentary. Alexandria may have lost but it was not defeated yet! They needed to show that.

&quot;<strong>OUR NEXT CONTESTANTS WILL BE ARRIVING IN A FEW MINUTES NOW. JUST WHO WILL STAND AGAINST THE REPUBLIC THIS TIME? WHO WILL THE REPUBLIC SEND OUT AS THEIR NEXT CHAMPIONS?

He was juggling a small grenade, throwing it up with one hand and catching it with the other, repeating this movement for at least a minute before casting potential energy reinforcement on it with a surge of mana and putting it in his grenade pouch.

&quot;Well, Manco. This is when we fight in the official tournament. Remember the plan? Summon your condor and have it circle around the nearest to me enemy high in the air, so i know where the enemy is at all times. It&#39;s a bit cloudy and probably will rain today, so the bird can&#39;t really be too high. But i found some information about our enemies and i&#39;m pretty sure that their ranged attacks are limited, so i think your bird will be safe. And make the bird screech when an enemy servant is approaching me. Also give me the two potions beforehand, i can put them in the backpack i bought. Waiting for you to bring them to me would be inefficient.&quot;

Mikail was confident going into this battle, seeing how weak some of the Alexandrian masters were, both the librarian woman he fought and the magus that was defeated the previous round. He then double checked his guns, inspected his magazines to make sure they were full and got up, ready to enter the arena.

&quot;Hey. I was thinking about something. Are <em>we</em> the monsters here? That brutal barely human master, that unspeakably evil dragon... And me, a gunman who randomly becomes a violent creature of hatred. This makes me feel like we&#39;re on the wrong side. Although, who cares about sides? Life is about the stories of many individuals, not just black and white, right?&quot;

Then there was the loud sound of the announcer speaking, hyping up the crowd and saying about the contestants arriving soon.

&quot;Maybe we should go now? It&#39;s maybe a bit early, but you know, early bird catches the worm.&quot;

And with that, he started to approach the entrance to the arena.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034105279681400832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034105279681400832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Oct-22 12:05 AM">00:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alexandria wanna protect its own infrastructure and self while the Republic may have their reasons for wanting this knowledge.&quot; Manco answer unamused as his master referred to what had happened in the last round. 

While the old monarch was no strange to the horrors of war he couldn&#39;t help but share some of his master concerns about their side. The previous match couldn&#39;t be called that, it was pure slaughter which honestly make Manco feel nothing but disdain for their so called allies. Winning was good but what had happened had gone beyond that and in his eyes it looked akin to an adult just beating up a powerless child just for the sake of it. But even so, to called them evil was no entirely accurate. 

&quot;But, whatever may happen to either master the responsibility of it lies not with their foe but with the city who chose them to be masters in this tournament.&quot; he said as he gave Mikail the potions. &quot;But I will warn you Master, even if our opponent may look inexperience don&#39;t let your guard down. Although I guess I really dont need to warn you about that right?&quot;

The king smiled as took a step forward walking in front of his master towards the arena. &quot;Still, we aren&#39;t monsters Mikail as what we seek is not slaughter but victory.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The time they were given to get ready was just about to run out. Soon they would have to leave the comforts of the room and out into <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-commodan</span> itself. Into the flay.

The familiar sensation just before riding out to battle was fresh within Rider. Instead of walking out to the faces of her fellow comrades however, Rider will be walking out to the faces of the people of Alexandria. That was very much a different feeling indeed. 

Nerves was the last things she could allow herself to fall victim to though. Not in front of Amelia at least. 

&quot;Hey, Master. You ready to head out? We lost our chance to bail the moment we stepped in this room if that&#39;s what you&#39;re planning.&quot; A cheap chuckle came from her as she joked about their fate. It was an attempt to lessen the pressure placed upon them as Rider stood ready to head to their side of the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-commodan</span>.

&quot;You know, we didn&#39;t need to accept the call if you weren&#39;t ready.&quot; Rider did her best to help ease the nerves upon her Master. 

She wasn&#39;t sure just how ready she was, especially once they knew of their opponents. This <em>Mikail</em> had all the markings of an actual boogeyman with what she learned about them. Their Servant wasn&#39;t a pushover either. The Republic truly wasn&#39;t pulling back any of their punches.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034342186239668264 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034342186239668264><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Oct-22 03:46 PM">15:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The girl was sitting on the bench by Hannibal, checking and rechecking her gear and magecraft over and over. The only other thing she paid attention to was a single silver coin with a reading lamp embossed on it, that trinket she kept dancing between her fingers, flying from one hand to the other. To Hannibal, she seemed a bundle of nervous energy on a fragile fuse liable to detonate. 

To herself, there was little that seperated the battle that was about to begin from some of her previous escapades. She had run up against plenty of people with guns before, even handling a few herself when she summoned her companion. Granted none of them had the reputation Mikhail had, anyone who stayed long enough on Alexandria heard the stories about him. To fight a magus so honed on killing others was disconcerting to be sure but he didn&#39;t have real connections to her real source of worry.

It was that coin that spun so wildly, somehow Alexandria came to knew of her past and her origin. So concerned about their previous loss that they decided to resort to some twisted means to provoke her to taking another round. She hated that they&#39;d resort to that, the city had been so good to her. Still that was a much more palatable conclusion than the alternative, that somehow <em>they</em> found her again and wanted to throw her into the gauntlet to determine the true extent of their powers, that their years of nurturing and wrangling her were ultimately not for waste. 

&quot;Huh? Yeah, yeah... I&#39;m all ready. There&#39;s never been a way to escape this, so we just have to win,&quot; Hannibal&#39;s voice snapped her out of her funk, yet distraction and worry still lingered in her words like ballast tethering her regular excitement to the ground. A half-hearted chuckle followed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034854931481513984 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034854931481513984><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Oct-22 01:44 AM">01:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I&#39;ve never been the best at confrontations but maybe I won&#39;t have to run away this time with you by my side,&quot; she slid over and gave Hannibal a pat on her back that was for the master&#39;s benefit as it was for the servant. &quot;We&#39;ll do or die out there, Alexandria needs a miracle... you think we can deliver that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And you know, inexperienced enemies are actually more dangerous to an expert than other experts. Because they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, and that means they&#39;re unpredictable.&quot; Mikail said as he put the potions into his backpack.

&quot;I do seek victory, yet my curse thirsts for slaughter... But i guess someone who does slaughter willingly is worse than someone who can&#39;t control it.&quot;

Eventually after several seconds of walking the pair entered the arena. Mikail briefly shielded himself from the sunlight with his hand before looking around. But instead of a flat empty arena he was expecting, it was something different. A street was going from the Republic entrance to the Alexandria entrance in a straight line filled on the sides with random cover like walls, crates and sandbags, surrounded on two sides by an urban jungle of small, empty, tightly packed buildings.

&quot;I think someone might&#39;ve pulled the strings here. This arena looks like it was designed to make the fight harder for someone with a gun. But you know... Actually i don&#39;t mind the extra challenge. Just walking up to the enemy master and shooting them in the head would be boring and almost unfair.&quot;

Mikail reached into one of his ammo pouches and casted potential reinforcement on the throwing dart there.

<em>One supercharged dart.</em>

&quot;I still have the five throwing darts from the last fight by the way.&quot;

He then put his arms behind his back and looked up at the crowd. They looked disgruntled, still pissed at the previous Republic victory. Mikail moved one of his arms out from his back and formed a peace sign with his hand, knowing full well that it will only anger the crowd more instead of calming it down.

&quot;Heh. Manco, even if we might not be monsters, the audience sure does think that we are.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;And? Only ones I deem worthy enough to judge me are my own people. Spectators like this have no real say in this matter. Unlike the ones fighting they are just watching and hoping for the result that may save them.&quot; 

His words were harsh and to a degree not completely fair, the Republic had leave them with little to no choice it was either sacrifice that which make them a city or probably face heavy losses in many different fronts. But even so what annoyed Manco was how ease to please was the crow and even all of Alexandria to a degree. A common enemy should unite this people as they should understand that those guys regardless of how strong or weak they may be were the only thing protecting this city. But one loss was all that it took for them to go against their champions. 

That was annoyed him, there was no respect for those fighting from those watching. He had seen the news, how they began to make excuses and how the blamed that poor boy for losing. It was disgusting in his eyes, but that was also part of how humanity worked. it make him remember how most of his clan didnt wanted to join him, how they rather keep walking the path that would kill and instead send others to die first. 

&quot;SHUP UP!!!!&quot;  he yelled as he felt himself annoyed at the booing. It was a command powerful enough to make quite a few a shut up for a few moments. Although it didn&#39;t last long, but that was okay, the one he would focus right now were the only ones worthy of his attention. The enemy master and his servant

&quot;I hope our opponents are worth the hassle&quot; he said with a smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No matter who they send against us, be it monster or merc, we will show that Alexandria can still bare fangs.&quot; The pat on the back was the reassurance she needed from Amelia. Rider wasn&#39;t sure just how obvious it was that they were nervous. However, the more important part was that they had each other&#39;s backs. 

&quot;A miracle, huh? I managed to pull out some impossible victories before, haven&#39;t I? What&#39;s one more?&quot; Rider returned the pat on her back before stopping in the hallway leading to the gate. Were she having second thoughts? After all of that big talk? No. Not with the grin on her face. &quot;Hey, Master! Let&#39;s have Surus give us a proper entrance, shall we?&quot; Surus was more than excited about the idea as he followed behind the two of them by stomping a few times.

What would be better after all? Walking out on foot? Or riding on the back of a powerful war beast? The answer was rather obvious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

OUR CONTESTANTS HAVE MADE IT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GATES!</strong>&quot;

The tension was heavy in the air. No one in the audience knew who would be fighting today. Everyone was holding their breaths in anticipation to see whether or not they held the odds from first glances. 

The first ones to walk out were the Republic. 

&quot;<strong>FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLIC IS A MAN WHO COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS SLAUGHTER INCARNATE! WHEREVER THIS MAN APPEARED, A PATH OF CARNAGE AND BLOODSHED WAS SOON TO FOLLOW! IF YOU ARE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO STAND AGAINST HIM, THE RED TINT OF HIS LENS WILL BE THE LAST THING YOU WILL SEE! THE NOTORIOUS MERC HIMSELF, MIKAIL BERNSTEIN!</strong>&quot;

A roar of boos and jeering came from the audience. The fact that Mikail had the balls to give them a peace sign flared up their animosity towards them even further. It was expected but they had no fans among the crowd. Even if they did, the hatred drowned them out. 

&quot;<strong>SUMMONED ALONGSIDE MIKAIL IS A SERVANT WHO&#39;S REPUTATION IS JUST AS GRAND AS HIS MASTER&#39;S! BELIEVED TO HAVE DESCENDED FROM THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES, THIS CASTER IS HERE TO GRACE US WITH HIS PRESENCE. SECRECY MEANS NOTHING TO THIS SERVANT WHO PROUDLY WEARS HIS TRUE NAME TO OTHERS! THE KING OF THE GOLDEN NATION, MANCO CAPAC!</strong>&quot;

Manco&#39;s attempt to silence the crowd wasn&#39;t enough to keep them quiet for long. Now it was time for their opponents to make their presence known.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was hoping she didn&#39;t come off as too nervous but she felt more calm knowing Rider would be watching out for her. She couldn&#39;t help but smile as the confident smile of a conqueror emerged.

&quot;On Surus? Heck yeah! Alexandria needs to know who&#39;re they rooting for and that we&#39;re coming out swinging!&quot; She could practically feel the nervousness evaporate off her back and excitement replace it as Rider proposed their entrance. She could herself grin from ear to ear as she leapt onto the war elephant and awaited their cue.

The girl that the city would see emerge on a colossal beast was a stark contrast to the cutesy researcher from last round. Her outfit was of solid, earthy colors:  green padded pants, tan shirt and black whistle hanging from her neck, a heavy brown coat with rolled up sleeves and work gloves, green and white scarf dancing in the wind along with her curling white and green hair all kept safe by a wide-brimmed helmet. If anything she looked more ready for a safari or mountain expedition than she did an actual fight but the City of Scholars always had a flair for the eccentric.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With Surus standing at twelve feet at the shoulder, this allowed the two to loom over their opponents for the time being. However, it also made them a much bigger target as well. An unwise move? Perhaps. A declaration for them to come at them with everything they had? Definitely.

Rider covered her the curved sword she got from Saber with her lightning, allowing her to add a loud crash of thunder to their display of power to top everything off.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The light show and booming thunder shook the crowd into a rumbling cheer for their side. The animosity towards Mikail and Manco was seemingly forgot in a flash from the looks of it as the announcer continued their job.

&quot;<strong>DON&#39;T BE FOOLED BY HER SMALL STATURE! THIS MASTER&#39;S WINDS ARE SURE TO SWIPE YOU OFF YOUR FEET FASTER THAN YOU COULD BLINK IF YOU TAKE HER LIGHTLY! WHILE HER HISTORY IS AS MYSTERIOUS AS HER APPEARANCE, SHE IS JUST AS CAPABLE AS ANY OTHER MAGI WHO COULD TAKE HER PLACE! LET&#39;S HEAR IT FOR LITTLE MISS GREEN THUMB! AMELIA IPOMOEA!</strong>&quot;

The sight of someone young walking into the arena yet again created this air of unease for the crowd. Did Alexandria truly have no one but the young to send out to fight? However, the confident posture did what it could to ease those concerns. If she could stand that proudly then they had no reason to doubt her. Right?

&quot;<strong>AND RIDING ON TOP OF HER WAR BEAST STANDS THE SERVANT FIGHTING ALONGSIDE MISS AMELIA! ROME FEARS HER! WHETHER IT BE CROSSING THE ALPS, OR FACING OFF AGAINST A SUPERIOR FORCE, ODDS JUST DOESN&#39;T SEEM TO MATTER IN THE FACE OF THIS SERVANT! THE GREATEST GENERAL CARTHAGE HAS EVER KNOWN!  ALEXANDRIA&#39;S RIDER OF LIGHTNING!</strong>&quot;

The infectious energy that was surging through the crowd was almost enough to shake the very foundations of <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-commodan</span> itself. Now they were excited to see just what both sides were able to bring to the match. Just how will the match unfold? There is just one way to find that out...

This was the first time he saw an elephant outside of pictures in animal encyclopedias, and seeing one in real life induced the feeling of awe in him. It did not scare him however.

&quot;Actually this arena seems to be designed not only to make the use of guns harder, but it also might give trouble to large animals. I don&#39;t think this elephant can charge through all those buildings around here without at least severely slowing down. I take back the statement of someone pulling the strings. By the way, i think it&#39;s about time you summon your bird and make it circle above the enemy master. Wait a second, this plan that we thought of is actually perfect for this! Even if this girl tries to hide among the buildings, i can just look at where in the sky your condor is circling. Even if they get inside of a building, their location will still be compromised anyways. And meanwhile they will have no idea where i am once i get into those urban jungles on the sides. Unless they also have the capability for recon, but i doubt it.&quot;

Then Mikail started walking forward, and when he got to the middle of the arena he started speaking loudly to the enemy pair. 

&quot;I appreciate your bravery going into this tournament, Amelia! So if you lose, i will make sure that what happened with the last challenger does not happen to you. If after that the crowd tries to even slightly persecute you, <strong>i will deal with them.</strong> But still, i will not hold back on you! Good luck with the fight!&quot;

And with those words and a vague threat to the audience, he turned around and walked back to his side of the arena. After that he climbed onto one of the empty buldings on the sides and reached into one of his ammo pouches, casting reinforcement on another dart.

From the flames just as if being a phoenix a red condor emerged resting on the king arm. Manco would lean and murmur something to the bird, while he murmur it even if the other side or even the audience were to hear him they wouldn&#39;t be able to understand nothing but gibberish. 

He relayed the orders that Mikail had already mentioned but added a few as a sort of safekeep, he had seen how Mikail&#39;s curse could take him to some extremes and while he really had no issues with it he decided that it was his obligation in order to avoid any possible issues during this match. While the chance of that happening seemed low it wasn&#39;t completely 0 so he rather be prepared. It was a few added commands, including that if Mikail were to ever lose control the condor should screech twice in order to not confuse his master in the middle of battle. 

As the condor open its crimson wings and flew into the sky Manco hoped his worries end up being nothing. But he would put those though aside as he focused on the woman riding an elephant. As the condor left his arm he stood with a smile as he shift his position showing them the golden metal rod he was holding in his other hand before he let it fall. The moment the rod touch the ground it bury itself inside of the ground as a golden circle with a radius of ten meters surrounded Manco. 

&quot;I will say this before we start oh Rider of Lighting. If you can move me from this spot victory would be yours.&quot; he said as he extended his arm once again signing for the other pair to just come and get him.

Whether that was the intention or not, it left her stunned for a bit. It was not something she imagined someone so closely related to the term Slaughter to be like. Well, don&#39;t judge a book by its cover it seems. Unfortunately for him, neither of them planned to lose. The safety net was relieving to have though. 

&quot;Alright, Master. Surus and I will try to protect you as much as we can if you want to stick with us. If not, give us a signal and we will come charging through my Noble Phantasm faster than you&#39;ll be able to finish calling for help.&quot; Rider kept her gaze on her opponents as she waited for the bell to ring. Her grip on the curved sword tightened, causing the lightning to surge more. 

What was most curious though was the subtle shaking of Rider&#39;s hand that held the reins. Was it the excitement? Was it that she still held doubt in her heart towards herself? The grin on her face masked the true nature of it all too well for now.

<em>&quot;..If you can move me from this spot victory would be yours.&quot;</em>

&quot;...Easy.&quot; 

Soft words came from Rider. Enough to be considered a whisper but still enough to be heard by Amelia at least. 

&quot;That&#39;s it?! You are making this too easy for me, Caster! There has been nothing capable of stopping Surus in his tracks! I doubt you&#39;ll be the first!&quot; Rider roared back as she accepted Manco&#39;s declaration without any hesitation. She knew the capabilities of Surus and nothing Caster could throw at them could break that confidence. 

All she waited for next was the ring the bell.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035438344533983242 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035438344533983242><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Oct-22 04:22 PM">16:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a potent mix of emotions that caused her restless spirit to stir with excitement. She practically waved her whole body to the audience&#39;s cheers. Back home, she&#39;d always have an audience of one to three but this was that times thousands! So much so she brushed over the odd comment about her being short or Mikhail&#39;s planning with Caster.

&quot;Hey thanks, mister! I appreciate the offer but I&#39;m going into this not thinking about losing. Glad you aren&#39;t either, should make this a great fight!&quot;  She called back, waving her helmet at her armored opponent, not a hint of ill-intent or fear carried on her words. &quot;Best of luck!&quot; 

She watched the man turn and walk away, imagining his heavy footsteps and the rattling of equipment from his large frame. Sure he wasn&#39;t quite the brute like Nikolai in words or posture but still the man looked like business and then some. She spotted the pair of guns and whistled. Republic was taking absoulutely no chances in this competition, their masters more like Mage-killers than proper magi. It would be a hard fight but she had Rider on her side, one of the greatest generals in history!

&quot;Mhmm,  I&#39;ll stick with you for the first bit but don&#39;t be surprised if I suddenly disappear or something. I got plenty of ways to distract the enemy master and hey, don&#39;t worry about me getting hurt.

This wasn&#39;t just some measly pistol, it was more like a machine gun because of the rate of fire, emptying half of its magazine in only a second. 

<strong>BRRRRRRRT</strong>

While the enemy pair was distracted by the hail of bullets, he already threw a primed grenade by this point, which was heading in their direction. But this wasn&#39;t just a grenade throw - Mikail cast potential energy reinforcement on the grenade beforehand, causing it to fly out into the distance with unnatural speed. And by the point he stopped firing, the grenade already reached them. But it looked like he threw it too high, as it was about to fly above the elephant and miss. 

There was another factor however - this wasn&#39;t a regular grenade. It was a grenade with a very short fuse, made to explode only a second after pulling the pin. And so it exploded mid-air.

<strong>KABOOOOOOOM!!!</strong>

An enormous explosion appeared from above, showering the enemy pair and riddling the elephant with devastating amounts of powerful supercharged high velocity shrapnel, followed by a horrifyingly destructive shockwave. This explosion was more like something from a high explosive artillery round rather than something that a simple frag grenade could do, yet thanks to Mikail&#39;s potential energy reinforcement, it was possible for the grenade.

And he still kept going. Immediately after the explosion, Mikail started moving extremely quickly by casting small explosions under his feet, running on the rooftops of the buildings in a diagonal direction - getting both closer to his enemies and closer to the edge of the arena. Then he stopped, grabbed one of his a reinforced throwing darts threw it at Hannibal.

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

And so the dart shot out into the distance with the power of an anti-tank rifle.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035629343570927616 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035629343570927616><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 05:01 AM">05:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>After that he reached into his ammo pouch to reinforce a third dart, finally stopping his agressive assault, even if for a moment.

However that was never her job nor something she sought out eagerly. It was moreso a distraction to her journeys and a necessary thing to do if someone blocked all means of escape. She had done well against Lord Sudbury and his goons, yes, but that was because of the chaos surrounding the summoning of Rider. She had the initiative. 

That was not the case here. There was nowhere to run, no one to barter or trick. Like she said earlier, it was do or die. Mikhail clearly knew that better than anyone in that stadium  as he unleashed a maelstrom of armaments upon the Alexandrian pair in the same amount of time it took the bell to ring thrice. If any master could survive that concentration of fire, Amelia would not be first on many people&#39;s lists. Somehow a loss seemed guaranteed at the start, even with the monstrous frame of Surus. 

She heard first the bell toll only for that to be silenced by the tear of a pistol spitting rounds far faster than it should. The sudden start meant she could do little about them, simply hope they didn&#39;t shatter bone. The metal ball tumbling towards her, it seemed so slow and harmless. She&#39;d toss it back if she didn&#39;t know what it was. She knew what a grenade was and she knew it was the thing she could affect the most. 

Quarter second rolls by, breathe in. Half second arrives, breathe out. Three quarters, stir the waves. One second, action. The sound of both her hands snapping in unison was the crack of gunfire as two low pressure waves surged out and hit the blast wave of the grenade head on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035737453602033774 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035737453602033774><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 12:10 PM">12:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>To Hannibal and Surus, the three supersonic cracks were a terrible combination that would doubtless ring for minutes. Amelia&#39;s own ears trailed little red streams as she focused on disrupting the deadly concussive blast. It bounced and buckled for half an instant before still forcing down a strong, hot gale upon the riders with a cutting hail of metal. 

It hurt, it really, really hurt. Slivers sliced open her cheek, needles rammed into her arms and spines stuck her legs. Her bones still felt whole, the wind was strong. That was all she needed for a shot at freedom. The rush of pain and adrenaline addled her mind and forced it to hone in on instinct and impulse. Strategy did not matter. The rush of battle, the race to freedom, the thrill of it all did however. 

She beckoned the wind to her command as a bird flapped its wings to fly and wrapped the resulting smoke of the explosion around Surus like a heavy, acrid curtain. She slammed herself into Hannibal and yelled into her ear a single word.

Honestly he really had no complaints about it , while it may look crude and dishonorable, it was effective and who is to judge how one uses his abilities, and that being said the spectacle was something even someone like him could appreciate. Their opponents maybe not so much for obvious reasons but even so it picked Manco’s interest. In their last fight he really had not a chance to properly appreciate it, due to him being sent flying more times than he was willing to admit. 

But it was curious in more than one way, the difference in how combat had evolved made his curiosity perk up. But it wasn’t just that it was that massive beast that he was forced to stop one way or another. While he had issued that challenge it was more of a necessity than him picking a fight. But regardless of that he had already spoken up, to not follow through would not be fit for a king. 

Still the question remained what to do, he knew very well he couldn’t stop such a massive beast with regular means the fight with Saber had taught him that much. Not to say he really had no plan, he just wasn&#39;t 100% sure if it would work as he really knew nothing about the behemoth of a beast besides of how dangerous it looked.But either way he needed to do something first he needed to separate her and from her master let Mikail have his own fight while he kept Rider busy. 

“Inti!!” he yelled as he conjured a gigantic fireball at them taking his master assault to try and find an opening but the fireball was not aimed at the beast but at Rider. As Manco wonders what would be his opponent&#39;s answer his condor remains vigilant not missing a single one of Amelia’s moves. Then again the fire ball was not meant to actually damage them. He assumed they would resist it like many servants were before, so in the midst of the barrage of attacks a rock hand would sprout from under Surus aiming for Amelia.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Such an explosion went off above them. 

Instinctively, Rider grabbed onto her Master to shield her. Some pieces embedded themselves into Rider. Her ears were ringing but, thanks to Amelia, they were able to weather the worst of it. however. Sadly, some pieces still managed to get past her. The pain of knowing she wasn&#39;t fast enough to protect her when she managed to protect both her and Surus hurt more than the shards did. She <em>needed</em> to be better than this! 

Suddenly, the cloud that engulfed the Alexandrian pair rumbled and became alive with lightning coursing through it. The sound of crashing thunder that followed shortly after was the starting pistol to Rider&#39;s charge. What kind of General would she be if she disregarded her Master&#39;s request to charge after all?

Bursting from the smoke cloud was Surus as they made a path of destruction while en route towards Caster. The onslaught from their opponent refused to stop there as soon a blazing fireball rushed towards Rider herself. It seems he thinks he could simply knock off the rider from their mount! How foolish of a King he must be to think that.

&quot;Behind me, Amelia! Keep going, Surus!&quot; 

Rider shouted out her commands as she used her arm to position Amelia behind her. Quickly, she activated her <strong>Mana Burst</strong> skill again to shift the lightning to encase herself and cover Surus&#39;s legs. This allowed Surus to send a powerful burst of lightning with each stomp, destroying anything along their path. The coat of lightning-infused mana around Rider enhanced both her <strong>Endurance</strong> and her <strong>Magic Resistance</strong> for a short time, allowing her to take the fireball directly to protect Amelia from harm.

Scorch marks and embers covered Rider&#39;s body as she held a wolfish grin towards him. The pain from the burns were dulled thanks to her <strong>Campaign Longevity</strong> skill, making it seem like it did much less than it did.

With the ground being destroyed with each step of Surus, it would seem that staying in the path of the war beast was suicidal, unless Caster could think of a way to stop both of them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035822893101232160 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035822893101232160><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 05:50 PM">17:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

What if instead of trampling caster the elephant would trip and fall face-first into the ground? He holstered his pistol, cast potential energy reinforcement on a part of the roof of the building he was standing on, and punched it a few times while casting strong concentrated explosions. 

Then he quickly grabbed the resulting pieces of rubble, pebbles and sharp rocky shards with both of his arms before all of them could fall down, and threw them all onto the street between Manco and Surus. Now the Carthagian elephant had an entire field of reinforced improvised caltrops(or tribulus, as Romans would call them) in front of itself. 

After casting such powerful and concentrated explosions to destroy the reinforced part of a roof, Mikail&#39;s combat gloves were set on fire. So he shook his hands vigorously to put them out and looked at them for a second. They were burned and some of the skin on them was torn, just like after almost every battle he had in his life, encouraging him to fight more.

While that field of caltrops that he set up was dangerous, the elephant could just easily crush the small pebbles and avoid bigger rocks, completely nullifying his efforts. So Mikail had a plan, an almost cowardly and unhonorable plan. But in a fight with mortal danger nothing was unhonorable. 

He proceeded to quickdraw his Uluu Toion pistol loaded with freeze storm rounds and fired entire four times at Surus&#39; back legs. It was a beautiful show of bright shiny metal sparkles surrounded with freezing fire, but it was also a great danger. What would happen if the elephant&#39;s back legs couldn&#39;t keep up with front legs? A fall. And combined with all the rubble it would make a fall almost certain. Unless Hannibal finds yet another genius unconventional strategy, the only reasonable move for the elephant would be to slow down and stop charging.

His magic was powerful but his fight with Saber and Lancer had taught him many thing about different issues. Specifically, he had learn a huge deal about his limits, servant were powerful being there was no doubt about that but they also remained unchanging. It was no surprise really they were summoned at what would be their peak form, so their limits was something that was already stablished even before they were summoned into this world. 

Right now regardless of how much damage his fireballs really did Manco knew that his magic couldn&#39;t stop Ursus regardless of what he may try and with him knowing his limits does that meant he really had no chance in this particular fight? 

The answer was no, it was a matter of looking at the problem from a complete different perspective. Did he really had to stop Ursus and Rider? He really didn&#39;t, other options were available but time wasn&#39;t on his side to device a plan. As the ground shake at the steps of the massive beast Manco was well aware that the moment Ursus and Rider reached his territory he would probably die. So the solution was rather simple, he just needed to move the beast out of his way. 

As he heard the sound of more bullets being fired Manco smiled at his master actions, the help was welcome although he really didn&#39;t believe that he would be able to stop the assault on him maybe slow her down a bit if lucky and right now he was actually counting on that. Water surrounded him, forming a small dome around him at first glance it would long like a sort of crystal bubble but if one were to do a more extensive appreciation they would seem the water was rotating around him at high speed, not enough to cut nor harm that wasn&#39;t his goal either way but to block.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Amelia couldn’t hear or afford to look to observe the crowd. How could she when everything she had was needed to survive. The thunder kept rolling with every movement of Hannibal and Surus. Likewise it seems the staccato beats of Mikhail’s Arsenal would never relent, never give Amelia time to properly think. Only raw instinct, the domain of a cornered animal, would come through here.

Adventure could always be spun as some time of fun or glory but she could never see how a real battle or war could be seen the same. It was chaos, but not the same one she knew danced with the winds. This was just violent impulse after violent impulse for the sake of killing in only the way a human mind could think. Maybe Simon was right, to be inhuman would spare her of this torment even if the pain was unavoidable. If she could turn off that human part, maybe the battle wouldn’t be so bad?

Yet Hannibal’s selflessness grounded her in that moment. Here she was putting her own life on the line to make sure Amelia made it through in one piece, even if in the moment it sacrificed her own survival. Hannibal was not family yet she already was throwing herself into the role of the elder member. One Amelia had done for her own more vulnerable siblings on Lemuria and one Blanche did for her to make a new life on Delphi.

<em>She had to help Hannibal through this too.</em>

As the fireball crashed into them, Amelia once again made the wind dance and swirl away from the pair in large eddies, pulling away some of the fire’s strength, always enticed by the promise of fresh air to consume. The burden on Hannibal ever a bit lighter and another dark cloud for her lighting to germinate into a proper storm.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036215590290993163 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036215590290993163><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Oct-22 07:50 PM">19:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The buzz of the gun was terrible but it was strange, Amelia knew this was the second time it swarmed her position yet why did it not hurt? She felt no more needles burrow into her skin and light it aflame, only little charred holes in her coat. Weird. What did that gun really do? She wanted to find out and more importantly she wanted to put an end to his monopoly on the order of initiative.

She took one seed out and instantly fashioned into her best approximation of a firearm, a slender branch stock, rootlike trigger and a large bud at the end. Into it she stuffed several seeds and gave them the commands they needed for their explosive birth. She steadied herself best she could, pressing hard into Hannibal’s back and lining the bud with Mikhail’s large frame.

Breath in, hold. Breath out, fire.

With one loud pop, the contents of the seed pod burst out, hurtling towards the enemy master with deceptive speed. Mikhail could see the bullets trail long green streamers behind them only to find out the truth as the weighted seeds made contact with his dominant arm and wildly spun up it. A bolo snare was the best analogy his mind could make and the ropes were vines coated in sticky residue that clung tightly to his arm.

Yet he’d only have enough time to comprehend that as suddenly a gust sought to humble him with a eastward hook to the back of his shoulder and send him tumbling towards the ground. Amelia, back on Surus, did what she could and attached the other end to one of Surus’s hind legs. It was a cunning scheme, with every rushing step the elephant took, Mikhail would likely be dragged along behind, being the victim to the very trap he set for himself. Amelia’s intermittent down gusts would make sure he’d be a fast acquaintance to those caltrops of his own making.

“Hey, he’s got a weird dome! Find another way around it! Go above or behind!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The ones which managed to get through the gaps dug into the flesh. However, the hide was thick and required a more powerful bullet if Mikail wanted it to have an impact on the war beast. 

It would seem that Caster intended to build up his defences to brace himself against the charge. That man was mad! Despite Rider&#39;s thoughts being as such, she couldn&#39;t help but respect the King for keeping his word. He actually intended to see it through to the end. 

The wind was a nice change. It gave her relief knowing the burning edges of her attire were put down. That small act reminded her that they had each other&#39;s backs in this fight. Instead of fighting to protect her, she should fight knowing her back is safe as long as she keeps Amelia&#39;s own back safe. 

The caltrops and another waves of giant hands rising up to provide more obstacles. This is where Rider would utilize her lightning in another way to overcome yet another futile attempt to stop them. But the lightning never moved from Surus&#39;s legs. There was a brief window before she could use her skill again it seems...

She would be vaporized just as much as Caster would be. Neither can she make use of <strong>Journey Through The Alps</strong> due to have two passengers.

Damnit! Damnit! She felt the lighting surge but fail to manifest when she tried it again. They had no options besides just barreling through.

&quot;No choice but to stay on course, Master! Come on, Surus!&quot;

Fortunately for Mikail, Surus&#39;s warpath cleared a way for him to be safe from his own caltrops as well as slowing the beast down from having more things to storm through. 

Soon the beast was upon Caster. However, due to their efforts, Rider was unable to activate her burst of speed to make the ram truly devastating and instead just relied on the raw, brute strength of Surus. The towering beast stared Caster down before their armoured tusks attempted to gore through the shield. For the first time since the start, Surus was stopped. However, for how long will be determined by Caster&#39;s shield as Surus attempted to push through.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036246351752728636 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036246351752728636><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Oct-22 09:53 PM">21:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was about to just cast explosions in multiple places on his arm to easily untangle himself, but decided that he didn&#39;t want to continue staying far away and just deliver suppressing fire. He said that he would do most of the fighting and Manco would support him, not the other way around.

As Mikail was dragged across the ground, he would continuously cast small explosions under himself to protect himself from getting hurt from scraping against the ground. But he also put his left hand on the ground and cast multiple concentrated explosions from his fingers, carving out a very crude and uneven stick of rock from the ground and picking it up.

Then he proceeded to suddenly jump into the air by, you guesssed it, casting a big explosion under himself before casting yet another explosion from his back to get closer to Surus. This resulted in him getting swinged by the vines in the direction above the elephant. After that Mikail casted potential energy reinforcement onto himself, resulting in sudden acceleration and causing him to fly at near terminal velocity directly at the pair. But he wanted to go faster.

Mikail proceeded to cast several tiny explosions at his right arm, untangling it from the vines to avoid having his arm ripped off from the next move he was about to do. He casted another explosion from behind him, increasing his velocity to breackneck speeds. And then he finally did what he was planning this whole time, delivering a devastating drive-by attack to the enemy pair with his improvised stone club while still flying through the air, an attack that would definitely kill a human.

While that landing seemed like it will injure a person, Mikail was still under effect of his reinforcement, resulting in minimal damage from that. He then cast another explosion under himself, sending him flying onto a nearby rooftop, just in case the elephant would get through and trample him.

Then Mikail felt a faint pain in his back and got a headache. But it was not just because of the velocity of what he just did. He used a lot of mana from casting so many explosions, to the point that his artificial magic circuits in his back muscles started overheating. And so while laying on the ground, he immediately pulled out Manco&#39;s mana potion out of his backpack while keeping it close to the ground and quickly drank it, with potential energy reinforcement helping him do this fast enough before Amelia could react and steal it with her air magic. And now that all of his tiredness disappeared and most of his mana was restored, he was ready to fight more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036337336251863091 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036337336251863091><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Oct-22 03:54 AM">03:54</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So you and me or Surus and you? Ok,&quot; Amelia simply nodded to the new information. There wouldn&#39;t be much time to go over a plan. Mikhail was occupied but for how long? Her and Hannibal could take it on foot but there goes their best weapon all by itself. No it&#39;d have to be Hannibal and Surus to make the Journey. They did it once before, they could do it again. They should not have to worry about Amelia getting in their way. 

She always hated that, imposing self in the way of others, to make them feel obligated to give up their own path for her. That wasn&#39;t freedom, it was binding by guilt. She would not tie her servant down out of worry for her safety. She knew the knowing looks people gave her when she said she could handle herself in the past and how they always brought up her reckless endeavors. She could handle herself always and the last thing she wanted to do was make Hannibal suffer more for wanting to protect her. 

To win, she&#39;d have to split, distract Mikhail, end his nuisances, wear him down. Hannibal could handle the rest. She just needed an opening. 

The returning constant rumble that overshadowed even Surus&#39;s thunderous steps drew her back to her target. Mikhail had gotten himself loose with what looked like little effort. He was coming in fast too, almost too fast, more a bullet fired from a gun than a man flying. Speed had always been Amelia&#39;s friend when in the air and it was apparent he was reaching speeds even she didn&#39;t fly in. What was that doing to his body? There was no way it could survive that kind of abuse for long.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036485272906514483 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036485272906514483><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Oct-22 01:42 PM">13:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Once again, no time for thinking as he hurtled towards them with some club. Her body instinticly tucked in on itself and did its best to roll out of the way. She yelled out for Rider as she did so, sending the words shooting into her ears with a shot of wind. 

&quot;Club behind you! Move!&quot;

The quick maneuver saved her from a sudden shattering of all her bones but she still saw stars as one fragment bounced off Surus and right into the base of her skull. A nauseous haze rose up from the hit but she had to keep going. 

&quot;See you around, Rider. Give Manco it all!&quot; She cheered as she rolled off the elephant and into the fast fading slipstream behind Mikhail. So too did she shoot off like a smaller bullet, wings tucked into her back for the moment as she gathered the rest of the turbulence around her and used it to speed her forwards. 

She banked hard to the right as the watery dome of Caster came into focus and her opponent cratered into the ground behind him. Her flight came to an end as she perched within the husk of a building. She only had to look to see the man-bullet flying again and took her time to position herself behind him as he was too busy restoring his depleted reserves. 

Oh this was perfect, just the opportunity she needed! Finally a break from that storm of fire and lead. This was her chance! That backpack was tied too tight to take the whole thing but something from within? For sure and a little innocuous breeze was what was needed to keep the compartment open enough for a clear vine shot. 

A single pop sounded behind the mercenary, a strong breeze blowing backwards and a brief tug on his holster would be all that he would notice as Amelia&#39;s plants pilfered a singular vial from the backpack and right into her hands. He was certainly welcome to turn around and get up to investigate.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036485294477811725 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036485294477811725><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Oct-22 01:42 PM">13:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Hey Mikhail, we&#39;re not going to hold back on you.

The only problem with that would be a sudden gale that would blast against his head and shoulders to try and toss him over the edge. But before he went tumbling, he could see his opponent holding the other mana potion Manco had given him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But Manco was smiling, as even if they hadn’t been able to stop Surus their efforts had not been for naught. Yet more than that, he was in complete awe after seeing the response of his opponent. Regardless of the many obstacles put in her way Rider hadn’t stopped trying to advance towards him. Just as he had kept his word on this challenge he had issued she had done the same. 

It was a display worthy of a king, for moment Manco began to wonder who he was fighting. She was different from the pure Lancer or that brat fox, he honestly wouldn’t be surprised if she was the queen of some far away land he never heard before. After all, with all the time he had spent with his wife he knew how strong and scary women could be. That being side seeing her determination to smash him into pieces he had no choice but to answer in kind. 

“Marvelous Rider!! You are making this worthwhile!!”

After all, just like she wouldn’t stop no matter what he wouldn’t move either. As Surus&#39; tusks reached his shield, they stopped for a moment. Both Manco and Mikail attacks had dulled his charge making it possible for Manco to stop them but even so it would only last for a small moment before the shield was pierced. 

“I&#39;m glad Rider, I knew that believing in you was the right choice to make.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036520062170964088 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036520062170964088><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Oct-22 04:00 PM">16:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As soon as he said that, the spin of the shield increased a sudden current hitting Surus’s tusks. The answer he had come up with was simple yet so crazy that no one in its right mind would even attempt it. Hannibal would notice that the beast would move, for a moment it would mistake the sudden movement as Surus piercing the shield only to notice that the direction they were moving was slowly off. The sudden current was not meant to hurt nor stop Surus, it was all the contrary. Alongside the spin on the shield it was meant to slowly deflect the direction away from him. But all of this had been nothing but a gamble from the old king who believed she would undoubtedly reach him and even when stopped would still push forward. 

As Surus passed next to the king&#39;s shield breaking everything in his path Manco would smile at Rider. 

“I think the modern term for this would be…. Ole?” 

But this was a one time measure, during the whole exchange Amelia had left Rider and right now it was a 1 vs 1 between the two servants. So now the real fight was about to start, which seriously put Manco in a real disadvantage but overcoming the odds is how he built his legend after all. 

“Your master is such an energetic young lady Rider. So what would it be? Is a gamble now, me or your Master I wonder who will last longer” 

Taking the chance  a gigantic rock arm came at Hannibal aiming for the small gap before the massive beast turned back and aimed to impale him once again. The arm this was was different from the one that had tried to stop Surus before, its size was on part with the elephant, it finger came together forming a massive fist which threatened to smash at Surus and Rider at the same time. 

“Pacha Mama!!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His aim made it clear that it didn&#39;t matter who he struck, just that he struck <em>someone</em> at all. However, instead of moving out of the way, Rider swung her sword in an upward arc to collide with the club. 

In mid-swing, Rider&#39;s lightning seems to flare up again, allowing the curved sword in her possession to shatter the club with a thunderous clash of steel and stone. The second swing she took at him went wide as he was already escaping by the time of the clash. 

&quot;Is running away all you could do?! Damnit!&quot; Rider spat out at Mikail as he repositioned himself. Fortunately for her, her annoyance towards the exploding trickster was subsided by Amelia taking her leave. Rider opened her mouth to voice her concerns, she was already off doing her own thing. 

&quot;Damn kid...&quot; She knew why she did so though. Thus, a smirk formed on the corner of her mouth. Now she didn&#39;t have to worry about her getting caught in the crossfire.

The clash against Caster&#39;s shield appeared to be in Rider&#39;s favour before his true intent became clear. That damned Caster was redirecting her and Surus! Rider pulled on her reins in hopes that she could keep Surus on course but it was futile. They ended up continued passed Caster and towards the closed gates of the Republic side. 

&quot;So you have a few tricks to call your own! A simple redirection won&#39;t be enough though! Because I have a few of my mine as well!&quot; Rider stowed the curved sword and materialized in a flash of golden light a partially melted falcata sword. 

She didn&#39;t have a lot of time. A giant stone fist was forming to crash into both of them! It was hard not to be impressed by what Caster could do by just standing still.

Journey Through The Alps!</strong>&quot;

A massive burst of Mana erupted from Rider as she unleashed her Noble Phantasm with a slash in front of her. Afterwards, a massive snowy portal swallowed up Rider and her war beast just before the giant fist could hit them. Cold winds and the faint drops of snow was all that remained. 

The explosive, literally, energy of the arena was brought to a pause as the crowd combed the arena to see if they could spot Rider first. Caster would need to be quick on his feet to react in time if he wanted to remain standing...

&#39;<em>If we can&#39;t find a way, then I will make one...</em>&#39;

Suddenly, the portal reemerged further down the destroyed path she already came from, essentially resetting her position.

&quot;I trust my Master, Caster! Besides, she won&#39;t need to last for any long, I&#39;ll make sure of that!&quot; With those last words, the body of Surus coursed with lightning as their speed increased! Thanks to <strong>Mana Burst</strong> boosting the speed of Surus this time around, Rider glared at him with a wild grin as if to challenge him to attempt the same trick again.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036592325167697950 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036592325167697950><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Oct-22 08:47 PM">20:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then he felt as something tugged on his backpack and a sudden gale wind attempted to throw him over the edge. There was a mistake in Amelia&#39;s plan however, Mikail was still under effect of potential energy reinforcement, letting him easily resist the gale by simply tilting his body back. During that time he blindly shot at the ground behind him with his Abaas pistol which was still in his right hand, and was previously reloaded with the magazine of movement marker rounds instead of normal bullets, predicting that this ammunition type would be more useful soon.

Even before Amelia finished talking she saw Mikail turn into a purple blur for less than a moment, and before she could blink the man was sitting right in front of her, facing forward. But other than the teleportation-like activation of the movement marker round, there was another unusual thing. It turns out that the gale of wind did do something. The gas mask wasn&#39;t secured well enough and fell off his face and fell right onto the street below them, laying there on the broken ground damaged by the stomps of an elephant. While this could be seen as a lucky moment for Amelia, it was far from it.

Cursed hatred boiled within Mikail&#39;s soul. &#39;Is running away all you could do?!&#39; &#39;It&#39;s our turn now!&#39; not only was he called a coward by Hannibal, not only did Amelia assume that she had the advantage when she did not, but also the gasmask comically fell off his face, pissing him off even more! The magic crest on his chest suddenly began brightly glowing with red light, clouding his mind with rage and anger.

&quot;<strong>STILL! MY! TURN!</strong>&quot;

Approaching Mikail was not a genius plan, it was a terrible mistake - the combination of his physical strength and potential energy reinforcement turned him into the equivalent of a low-rank servant, making him an incredibly dangerous opponent to humans in close quarters combat. She could very briefly see Mikail&#39;s violent wrath-filled smile on his scarred old face, but in the next moment the only thing she would see was fists flying towards her.

What happened was a flurry of three lightning-fast bone-cracking punches amplified by casting explosions at the elbows to speed up the punches, strong enough to easily go through whatever vines that she could create to stop him. The first punch was slightly different from the rest, as during the punch a long and thin jet-shaped explosion appeared from his arm aimed at the healing potion, causing the glass to shatter, followed by a bigger bigger and slightly less concentrated jet evaporating the potion to nullify whatever attempts of salvaging the potion Amelia could do.

Thinking logically, there was no real way for Rider to avoid the coming blow her only option was to tank it somehow, which for Manco was completely find he planned to deliver blow after blow making sure to not give her nor her best the chance to strike back as he was well aware he wouldn’t be able to stop her once again. 

Yet the gigantic arm would never find its target, after announcing the name of her noble phantasm Rider would disappear. It was a confusing situation which at the same time it shed some light about the identity of his opponent. It was interesting although he really didn’t understand what was the point of hiding one’s name. His opponents would find out his weakness one way or another at least this way he really didn’t need to worry about hiding it. 

Still the situation made more sense now, no wonder nothing was able to stop that woman. She had climbed higher mountains than him. Really knowing this part of him wanted to have a long talk with her but his admiration should have to wait as seconds after she disappeared she reappeared away from him and ready to give running him over with her beast another try. 

Yet even in the face of such a situation Manco was smiling. Even when knowing that the same trick wouldn’t work again, even when knowing that failing to stop Hannibal would lead to quite the gruesome death Manco couldn’t stop smiling. In a sense it couldn’t be helped, that woman encapsulates  all which Manco loved about humanity. Her strength and determination were in such a level that not facing her head on would bring shame to not only to him but also all of his subjects. 

“Damn, you are the second strongest woman I met”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036909612617711616 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036909612617711616><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Nov-22 05:48 PM">17:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>While it may not sound as much for him, this was one of the greatest compliments he could give anyone. As for him, there was no woman he held in higher regard than his wife Mama Ocllo. She who joined him in his travels, she who guided and gave him comfort when he needed it. While he was the Inca, an absolute ruler in the eyes of his people, his queen was the only one he considered his equal. As that city, that empire was something they built together both sharing the same dream towards the future. 

He felt the ground trembling, the hairs on his whole body began to rise due to the powerful static generated by the massive beast even when there was still some distance between them. Although that distance doesn&#39;t mean much, he had a few more seconds at best and honestly that was all he ever needed. The fist he had once unleashed upon Hannibal&#39;s move, changed its course by wrapping itself around Manco forming a small wall around him. But this wouldn’t be enough, even if its sturdy could match Surus the lighting put the construction at a disadvantage. 

“Inti!!!” He yelled as golden flames wrapped itself around the construction as the massive fist met the best tusk. Fire and thunder clashed with such force that for everyone watching the time seemed to stop. 

No sound was ushered between neither of the two servants nor anyone in the audience was able to open their mouths being left speechless at the clash of power as for a single second that felt like minutes Surus was stopped by the might of the Inca emperor.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036909632939118632 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036909632939118632><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Nov-22 05:48 PM">17:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>crack</em>

Yet stopping her was not enough.

<em>crack, crack crack</em>

The fist began to crack but even so the flames burned brighter, the elements stood together in a way not even Manco had seen before before time once again began to flow for all the presents as a huge explosion engulfed the arena and Manco was sent flying toward the entrance of the republic. 

The whole arena was shaken, the emperor felt the hard and cold rock of the walls of the arena as his body crashed into them. He felt how his body broke as he coughed blood and ended up lying on the ground. Hannibal had moved him, yet had she fared just as badly was something no one could tell as the smoke from the explosion still made it hard to see how she had fared.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the thrill her body craved, danger in all its forms gave it the fix it needed. After all the times he zipped around and struck at Rider and her without much in the of being able to hit back. Yes, a time to even the score, to rid her mind of the growing annoyance with his tactics.

She swirled the mana potion in her hand, whatever magic Caster conjured up looked real potent and pretty all at once. Her mind chased after the possibilities it would give her to make the playing field level. Unfortunately, Mikhail not only got up far quicker than she thought but he closed the gap at record speed and began shouting nonsense at her.

“Huh? You’ve been the one running around like it’s a mad game of tag. Who chased after who when suddenly he faced someone stronger than him?” The pain from her shrapnel wounds pressed in on her mind and aggravated the mounting frustration and pressure in her head. 

What was this guy’s deal? So kind at the start and now ranting at her for something she didn’t do? Was he even sane to begin with?

“Still your turn? You’re throwing a fit over me getting a shot to begin with? You’re a real bully.

It was also the only one she saw coming and spun to the right, feeling the thundeorus jet stream roar by and press her clothes tight against her body.

She couldn’t register the next two right away. One careened into her rib cage and the other into her shoulder. What she did feel immediately was being launched backwards fast and how hard it got to breath all of a sudden. Her brain skipped a beat as it struggled to keep up with happened, jolted into clarity when her wing pack expended a gust of wind to arrest her path before she hit a wall.

That’s when it all came crashing upon her mind. Everything hurt, far worse than the shrapnel, worse even than the times she suffered a broken arm or leg. No one but those who rescued her from Lemuria knew why, her bones were hollow, perfect for storing more air within. Her affinity for wind magecraft was no coincidence. So when those shattered, it was like a thousand jagged nails raking her innards simultaneously. 

To breathe and scrounge for more air was a cruel joke, only causing the fragments to tear more. To move her arm at all sent stars in her eyes from the pain. The sheer amount of stimulation made her mind blank out fully. The gleam in her ruby eyes faded into oblivion. She didn’t see Mikhail anymore, she saw <em>him</em> instead.

The doctor who wanted to prime the four children to be weapons for Lemuria’s disposal, a perversion of their original purpose. The one who made them jump through countless hoops, suffer countless cruel trials, and endure countless hours deprived of freedom while the others could only watch. Now he was here again, trying once again to crush her spirit, because if she broke, all of them broke.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036934486870458419 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036934486870458419><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Nov-22 07:27 PM">19:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She stood unsteadily on her feet, everything feeling heavier than it should but a desperate animus kept her standing, she was a beast cornered and no one should underestimate the lengths they would go to escape to freedom.

Her mouth mindlessly whispered words of power, drawing out what air they could from her shattered, defiant body. All were heard by a solitary, lowly leaf and as the monster descended on her again, she screamed with all the might she could, letting the pain fuel it.

<strong>”GET AWAY FROM ME, MOREAU!”</strong>

Lifted by her words, the leaf began to dance on a breeze before it landed gently on Mikhail’s chest. The breeze became a gust and that gust became a gale. It reached a howling pitch that could match a banshee’s in intensity. Leaves and thick clouds of pollen began to materialize from that very wind, condensing into a maelstrom localized entirely around Mikhail and it carried with it the very same animalistic desperation its master did in that instant.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036934511449083974 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036934511449083974><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Nov-22 07:27 PM">19:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It did not care for Mikhail’s reinforcement. Pollen forced its way down his exposed nostrils, dug into his eyes and into a growing number of open cuts as razor sharp leaves sliced away.
It did not care for Mikhail’s strength or rage. The pollen forced his muscles to relax, his coordination to worsen and his footing to be susceptible to the winds.
It did not care for Mikhail’s explosive propulsion or teleporting bullets. The wind swept him off his feet and tossed him around, using the momentum from any explosions to direct him into a nearby obstacle, bounce him off it, throw into the air and slam down again. If he teleported, the wind would follow and shackle him again.
It did not care for Mikhail’s life as it tried to cram razor leaves down his throat and slice his eyes. It rammed smoke and fire from the explosions down exposed airways in equal measure with the pollen.
It was the Untamed Wind and it’s sole purpose was to liberate its master from all those who sought to oppress her, carrying them away to the far corners of the Earth. For that moment, Mikhail would be humbled and battered by a force he could not control or shoot.

It was only with one last precipitous plummet down towards Republic’s gates that the mauling by the wind would cease and he would get to witness his own servant be brought crashing down as well.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The elements danced with each other as much as they sought to snuff out the life of the other. However, all of that was ignored by Rider who focused on just one thing; Caster.

The more cracks she saw in Caster&#39;s defences, the more excitement coursed through her. Victory was within her grasp! Just. A. Bit. More!

Even as the heat from the flames attempted to force her retreat, Rider endured it all since she doubted Caster would allow her yet another chance at victory if she did. &quot;...Just like what Amelia said. It&#39;s do or die!&quot; Rider whispered those words of encouragement to herself before yelling out the end as the clash of powers reached its apex.

Then the explosion came. 

Even if Rider could bolster her defences in time, there was still the timer in between activations that would&#39;ve prevented her. Whether it was planned or not, Caster struck at the gap of Rider&#39;s own defences in what could only be described as a brilliant gambit. 

Flying out of the explosion from the opposite end as Caster came Rider. Her body crashed against the ground. Any protruding stone that was left behind Surus&#39;s warpath turned into obstacles as she slid and tumbled across the path. 

Surus, the mighty war beast, finally took a knee. With a weak, defiant trumpet, they fell onto their side with a mighty thud. They were Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm so they were most likely still alive despite the abuse. Unfortunately, that charge would be their last act that they would be able to contribute to the fight. For Caster had brought down the beast.

Rider wasn&#39;t so lucky though...

The force of the explosion being point-blank without a blast shield like Caster, as well as the landing, was too much for her to handle. If it came from a Master, perhaps things would have been different. Instead, it came from a <em>Servant</em>. Even for someone like Rider, it was too much for her to withstand.

.

..

...

For Rider however, the loudest thing was the ringing in her ears. 

The pain that her body felt was <em>searing</em>. <strong>Campaign Longevity</strong> did what it could with numbing the pain, but it was still intense despite that. In fact, she was positive that she would&#39;ve returned to the Throne if it wasn&#39;t for <strong>Campaign Longevity</strong> keeping her alive. <em>She doubts she could get as lucky a second time</em>.

Slowly but surely, Rider pushed her body to get up. The screaming pain that her body sent out almost made her collapse back onto the ground again. She casted aside these pains and kept going through gritted teeth. Her vision blurred as she swore she blacked out since the next thing she knew she was standing up, albeit with her legs shaking. 

The ringing in her ears were calming down so she heard the dulled cheering from the crowd. Despite the premature celebration, Rider knew the match wasn&#39;t over until one side was unable to continue, or if they surrendered. 

<em>”<strong>GET AWAY FROM ME, MOREAU!</strong>”</em>

Rider&#39;s eyes shot open once she heard those words from Amelia. Shit! She was alone with that lunatic! 

&quot;<strong>Amelia!</strong>&quot; 

Rider spat out those words with blood following suit from her mouth. With her sword drawn, Rider stumbled as she came to Amelia&#39;s aid as fast as her battered body could take her. Lightning surged from her ever-dwindling mana stores around her body, ready to lash out at a moment&#39;s notice.

Luckily, Amelia made it easy to know her location with her trump card, along with Caster&#39;s bird.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1036959695488962600 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1036959695488962600><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Nov-22 09:07 PM">21:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

All of the three punches were only from his left fist, as the right hand was occupied by the pistol. Had he holstered the pistol and made another three punches with it, she would be dead right now, but Mikail was so blinded with rage that instead of preparing the attack by dropping the pistol beforehand, he chose the fastest and most instinctive way to cause harm.

And now he was about to run up to the injured girl, but a gust of wind appeared. Then it started getting stronger and stronger. He resisted the wind for way more time than he should&#39;ve, but then the reinforcement on Mikail&#39;s body ran out and he was instantly sucked into the small cyclone. He blocked his face with his right arm stopping some of the pollen and leaves. Then Mikail attempted another attack, throwing one of the two remaining reinforced darts at Amelia. But even though the velocity was high enough to not get diverted in a different direction by the wind, by the time it reached the girl it had the same power as an arrow - still dangerous, but not certain death.

He was about to throw another dart, but the pollen started acting, relaxing his muscles and preventing him from properly doing this. Mikail couldn&#39;t do anything for a few seconds. But instead of yelling loudly in frustration, he started calming down as something switched in his curse. His violent, mindless rage disappeared and got replaced with something worse - cold, calculated wrath. Instead of causing Mikail lash out at everything around him, it gave him an illusion of genuine hatred towards Amelia.

<strong>&quot;Who the fuck is Moreau?&quot;</strong>

Now that he had more clarity, Mikail made a plan and started executing it. Instead of blindly going into another trap, he would get away to continue to attack Amelia from a distance, since he now understood that trying to approach her right now would have a low chance of killing her.

While wind will attempt to follow him, it can&#39;t follow to the other side of the arena. So he wanted to do the same maneuver that he did in the previous battle - teleportation flight. Because it was just a sudden movement with a sudden stop instead of true teleportation, this technique was extremely dangerous. He got away with it last time because he was still under effect of reinforcement, but this time it was different. Despite the great danger, it was the only way to end up in a good position after the tornado.

So he pushed through the wind and the weakness in his muscles, aimed in the direction of the Alexandria&#39;s gates and fired in full auto, trying to activate each marker while they were still within five meters of him. And within only a second he was all the way on the opposite side of the arena, far away from the other three. But it did take a big toll on his body, as this resulted in briefly falling unconscious during the flight, crashing into the ground, getting a concussion, breaking some ribs and getting multiple bruises. While it still was very painful, it was nothing like what Amelia felt.

Then he slowly got up and noticed a sharp pain on his forehead, before putting his left hand on it and seeing that his hand now had blood on it - it seems that he hit his head a bit too hard during his landing. So instead of doing something active, he decided to make preparations. Turned around to face the Republic side and fired at the ground in front of him, slowly aiming further until there was a line of movement markers within five meters of each other going all the way to the Republic&#39;s gates. After that he reloaded the gun with the magazine of normal bullets and holstered it, switching it for the Uluu Toion pistol once again.

Then again he should be thanking the fact that he was able to feel this pain, after all it was proof that he was still alive and could fight. Although as he continued to lay on the ground looking more death than such though was not something he was even willing to consider. 

He slowly tried to stand up as his vision began to get more and more clear, if asked Manco would admit he really didn’t know what had just happened. He could make an educated guess about it, he had either lost or drawn with Rider in their last and consider that he was still able to breath and even take a moment to compose himself he was betting on the second outcome. 

“Ugh” that being said even a draw had been quite painful as the old monarch was forced to cough up some more blood into his hand as he leaned himself into the wall of the arena determined to not fall once again. 

The sudden movement made his crown fall into the ground with a loud ting only for crimson droplets to soon follow as the blood squeezed itself in between the old king’s hand before the king itself gave up in trying to hold back as he limped into the wall. His eyes looked upfront, seeing how the dust began to settle hoping that his mad plan had worked or least had some effect. A loud thud gave him an answer as he saw the massive beast now laying on its side with its Rider just a few meters away.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037180847079563314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037180847079563314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 11:46 AM">11:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You are a tough one…” he said as he slowly saw her rise. Well it seemed that clash had left both of them in quite a sorry state. Manco began to go through all the cards he had left in his hand. Due to having his condor keeping eyes on Amelia he couldn’t summon another familiar and he spent more of his mana fighting he still had his noble phantasm but he needed some time to charge it and even if wounded he doubted Rider was willing to call it quits as long as she breathed. 

The king prepared himself to somehow survive her assault before he saw turn backwards and move away. Manco let out a sigh of relief before realizing where she was going, he didn’t know Rider at all but given the circumstances there was only one reason for her to leave him on his own and that was his master. He made a sign with his hand calling the condor who rapidly descended back to him letting the kind give him some more instructions.

<strong>Support Mikail…. and if he is losing control try to buy me some time.</strong> he murmured on the bird face as he gave it a soft pet on the head. 

The condor would fly away as the Caster would grow up a rock stick he would use to sustain himself as he slowly tried to follow Rider. The bird would light itself on fire as it would search for Mikail only to descend near him ready to attack whoever were to come at him be it human or servant.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Honestly, she was grateful that she found her in the state she was in knowing just how dangerous Mikail was. He could&#39;ve done a lot worse.

However, the pain she felt in her heart when she saw Amelia was much worse than the pain from the explosion. 

&quot;H..Hey, Amelia...&quot; A short scoff came from her as she fell onto her knees by her side. &quot;You aren&#39;t looking so good. You know, when you say do or die, you aren&#39;t suppose to be doing the dying part.&quot; With a weak chuckle, she brushed her hand on Amelia&#39;s cheek to clean it off. Despite her own words, Rider looked much worse off. Blood and charred wounds covered her body. It was amazing that Rider was even standing with the damage she sustained.

Every movement she would have to take from now on would have to be deliberate, weighted against an unignorable cost.  Her mind was in a deep haze of chemicals, but none would convey anger or sadness, just a bestial cocktail of pain and excitement, with the only clear thoughts she had was on making it stop, to make the danger go away. 

She would wave at Hannibal from a distance on top of a building though that action made her sick even with her good arm. Rider would find her master in a truly pitiful state, between the blood-crusted pockmarks of shrapnel, the singed char from explosions and the broken body laying gingerly against a wall. There was not a single glint of brightness in her red eyes, the luster dulled by agony.

&quot;Hah-nibal, you made... it,&quot; she managed to cough out, each word raspy and raking her chest. Her breathing was shallow and quick, gasps of air followed by a reflexive retch. She could barely manage the shadow of a smile with her servant&#39;s arrival. &quot;Yes, you.. good too.&quot;

She pushed back the sleeve on her left arm, taking her time to do so and revealing the command spells tattooed in red on her pale flesh. Lifting it up with her right arm, she placed her left hand on Hannibal&#39;s chest and the servant could almost immediately feel something begin to flow into her.

&quot;I-I command you... make sure... coward master not... leave unharmed... he is... <strong>Roman</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The round now contained so much energy within it that it started violently shaking within his hand. After several attempts, his burned hand with no nerves barely managed to put the bullet into the magazine. He finished reloading the Uluu Toion pistol and looked into the distance, watching as Amelia writhed in pain from her broken bones. The curse made Mikail happy from watching her suffer, making him go completely against his nature. 

But he couldn&#39;t get a clear shot at Amelia from such distance, so he used a three quarters of his previously created line of movement markers to get closer to the Republican side of the arena, but it was still not enough to properly aim at her - Hannibal was in the way. He moved to the side, but a proper line of sight was once again blocked - now by a pile of debris that seems to have appeared at some point during battle.

<strong>&quot;It&#39;s like the world itself is against me now.&quot;</strong>

So he thought of different plans. Jumping into the air to shoot would be too risky, there was a high chance of missing. Approaching them to fire from a good angle was also a bad idea, Rider would just instantly kill him. And he was left with only one option - shooting directly at Hannibal so he can kill Amelia later. While it was not ideal for what his curse wanted him to do, it was good enough.

But before he could fire, he noticed his gas mask lying on the ground near him. And he just had to pick up the mask. Without thinking he picked up the mask and put it onto his face, this time properly securing it so it won&#39;t fall off again. But that gave quite a noticeable amount of time for Hannibal to approach fairly close, something he managed to completely forget about while focusing on his favorite face-hiding device.

The round flew out of the end of the barrel with such destructive power, that as the bullet moved forward, the ground below, which was not directly touched by it, had small cracks appear on it from the sheer force. It was more like as if it was an enormous and heavy vehicle which was moving on the ground at breakneck speed, rather than a bullet. This was the power of the Obliterator round - it was neither a precise nor elegant bullet, it was not made to target and pierce weak points of a human body, but rather to simply destroy everything. And all this primal energy was layered on top of the projectile with reinforced potential energy, making this attack truly catastrophic. 

<strong>BOOM!</strong>
<strong>CRACK!</strong>
<strong>KABOOM!</strong>

It was a violent crescendo of sounds - the actual shot, the ground cracking and the devastating impact. Anyone can understand that this is not something meant for a human to survive. But his current opponent wasn&#39;t a mere human, it was someone who suffered many wounds before and always survived - Hannibal Barca.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="04-Nov-22 03:34 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037781722932195380 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037781722932195380><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Nov-22 03:34 AM">03:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Utter shock and disbelief.

That is what Rider felt when she heard those words leave Amelia. The dominating force of the Command Spell used pouring into her body as the order was made. The pain was dulled even further. All it was replaced by was a ever-growing compulsion, mixed with Rider&#39;s own hatred towards her ancient foe, to obey her Master&#39;s words. 

As Mikail got into position, she saw him without his mask for but a brief moment before he placed it back on. For a moment, she saw <em>him</em>. Was it the command spell twisting her vision? Was he actually just hiding in plain sight this whole time? Or maybe it was just some pain-induced hallucination. Rider wasn&#39;t sure. Nor did she care. 

&quot;<strong>YOU BASTARD...</strong>&quot;

What Mikail saw staring down the sight of his barrel was Rider&#39;s blood-hungry gaze which remained fixated on him as if she were possessed. It was no different from a Berserker&#39;s gaze. The sight was enough to almost forget that she was a even Rider Class to begin with. 

A scowl twisted her face into one of pure hatred. To think a <em>Roman</em> would have the gall to leave her Master is such a state! Who did he think he was?! A mere bully to the weak?! She will not let another crime of Rome go unpunished. <strong>NOT AGAIN!</strong>

Unless he saw the missing Command Spell on Amelia&#39;s arm. Although, that would require taking his sights off of Rider, of course.

<em><strong>BOOM</strong></em>
<em><strong>CRASH</strong></em>

Lightning surged throughout Rider&#39;s body as the bullet impacted her square on the chest. The force from the augmented bullet was enough to cause her to slide back and collide against the wall of the building. A crater formed around Rider but the building held true and, unfortunately for Mikail, so did Rider. 

Caster managed to catch her in-between the gap of her activations of <strong>Mana Burst</strong>. Mikail didn&#39;t. 

&quot;You Roman filth!&quot; Rider covered the distance between her and Mikail in two bursts of speed used in rapid succession  from <strong>Mana Burst</strong> to deliver a punch against his chest to return the favour. &quot;The day a Roman claims my life is the day I crush my own fucking Spirit Core to dust!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037798254382940251 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037798254382940251><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Nov-22 04:39 AM">04:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The condor had made a decision in the split of a second, one could argue it was the wrong one as Mikail and Rider could easily  see how the lower half of the familiar blow up by the impact of Rider&#39;s fist. It was an expected result, Manco&#39;s familiars weren&#39;t made to sustain such amount of damage but that was the only way the familiar could support Mikail. 

The young man would realize this as even when the familiar sacrificed it self the impact of the blow was still able to hit him although he had been momentarily saved from certain death.  As the familiar began to disappear it flapped its wings one last time unleashing a wave of flaming projectiles towards Rider. Whenever the attack succeeded or not the familiar would never know as it just vanish in golden cloud of flames leaving only loud screech as proof of its existence. 

Nothing remained, yet its actions hadn&#39;t been for nothing. To the very end it follow the king&#39;s commands and in that he gave Manco and Mikail a fighting chance. As even if for a moment Rider had been stopped.

&quot;Inti!!!!!&quot; 

A pillar of flames would aim to strike Rider on the side, if she were to look at the side she would see an angry Manco who had managed to craw back to the place where he had set his territory. The  Inca knew better than just move himself towards the fight without a plan. Even hurt he knew that Rider was superior to him in the physical aspect and that&#39;s even if he weren&#39;t in such a bad shape himself. 

&quot;Run away Master!!&quot; he yelled as  he launched more fire projectiles to cover his master retreat.

Their current options were limited, right now his only sure way to win was his own noble phantasm but he couldn&#39;t deploy it unless there was some distance between Mikail and the enemy  as his master could end up trapped in the crossfire.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They all slammed upon her skull like heavy hammers, shooting yet more pain into her besieged mind and contorting her mind further. Even with the command seal, Hannibal hadn&#39;t made it all stop yet, why hadn&#39;t it stopped. They had to be stopped.

The masked form of Mikhail appeared yet again and Amelia&#39;s addled mind believed she laid eyes on her old adversary. He shouldn&#39;t be here, he meant no good, only more pain. Pain had to be stopped, at any cost.

&quot;Ri-der, don&#39;t let... him get away! Make him... ah...pay!&quot; She yelled out before lapsing into a coughing fit. Yet she couldn&#39;t stay still, not now he was here again. Behind Rider and rubble would be the safest bet. 

Rising to her legs took less effort than she expected but each step carried its own burdens, her boundless energy from before not longer blessing her stride. It was a slow lurching movement more like she was throwing herself forward than actually walking. 

She was close to Rider now and a pile of rubble protected her from Manco&#39;s indiscriminate rain of fire. She couldn&#39;t hear the whsipers of the wind like before and the pull she had over it felt weak. She tried to ground Mikhail where he stood, making it easier for Rider to knock him out or worse but it was nothing more than a strong wind that any determined individual could resist. She grunted as continually trying to exert such power made her bones ache and her eyes water.

She had to change tactics. No longer could she hold him down but what about a body part? a small one at that. The wind came again and bound his dominant hand firm against his side. Again, Amelia could feel razors press into the marrow of her bones but it didn&#39;t feel as bad. If she could keep it up for a moment more, surely Rider could score the decisive blow to end this now.

&quot;He can... teleport. Make him... stay still. He knows... can&#39;t win... against you...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, thanks to the knockback Mikail easily had enough time to cast potential energy reinforcement onto himself and slightly reposition himself. Manco&#39;s condor suddenly flew down in front of Rider&#39;s fist, sacrificing itself to weaken her punch. And as Hannibal&#39;s fist was about to collide with Mikail&#39;s chest, he managed to move slightly out of the way with the help of his reinforcement, cast an explosion to counteract Amelia&#39;s wind and even activated one of the movement markers from the remaining quarter of the line of them to dodge the attack. But even after all those efforts, the attack still hit him - his left arm was too close to his body, resulting in the punch hitting between his left arm and his torso, glancing both of those parts.

After the attack all of his left ribs were now broken, his upper arm bone now had a minor fracture and he violently fell onto the ground. It was way less than Hannibal had hoped for, as the reinforcement made him way more durable than he should be. The amount of pain returned Mikail&#39;s curse into the state of irrational rage.

<strong>&quot;AAAAAARRGH! FUCK! WAIT AND WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING TALKING ABOUT? ROMAN THIS, ROMAN THAT! I&#39;M OF YAKUTIAN HERITAGE, WHAT DOES THIS ROMAN CRAP HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? WHAT ARE YOU, A ROME FANGIRL? IT WAS DESTROYED BY SOME RANDOM GERMANS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO! WHY ARE YOU STILL LIVING IN THE PAST? SHUT THE FUCK UP.&quot;</strong>

Then Mikail noticed a girl hiding behind a pile of rubble. And then he used some more of the remaining movement markers to move closer to the Republic side of the arena, but it also ended up with Mikail being on the flank of Amelia. And so, he leaped out of a lying position at Amelia with the help of a big explosion in an attempt to punch her with his left arm.

The fist rapidly approached her face, but then it suddenly moved to the side and hit the wall of the building behind her. And as he moved his arm away, Amelia could see that it wasn&#39;t Hannibal who saved her life by redirecting Mikail&#39;s punch, but rather she was spared by him. The magic crest on his chest seems to have stopped glowing.

&quot;This damn curse... I surrender. I do not want this victory anymore.&quot;

This situation was familiar to him, a bit too familiar. Trying to kill someone completely defenseless while surrounded by ruins. And her comparably short height made her seem like a child to him, something that he couldn&#39;t kill after everything he did in the past. So he stopped his curse from making him do so through sheer willpower and disgust at the idea of killing a child.

&quot;I cannot kill you. But neither do i want to die as someone who would be remembered for trying to kill an almost defenseless opponent. Please accept my surrender.&quot;

Then he turned around to avoid eye contact even despite the gasmask already hiding his eyes.

&quot;I heard that no one in the hospitals wants to do anything in the moment. I will intimidate them into letting you stay there properly and pay for your hospital bills. I will visit you at the hospital again after Manco brews a new healing potion so you will have a faster recovery... Please tell me that i convinced you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038160021483175996 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038160021483175996><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 04:37 AM">04:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Those last words would have been enough to sign Mikail&#39;s death warrant, if it wasn&#39;t already at that point, of course. However, Caster&#39;s quick intervention allowed Mikail to continue on another day. That damned Caster! She thought that she dealt with him already! 

&quot;<strong>STAY OUT OF THIS, CASTER!</strong>&quot;

The screams were almost overshadowed by the roaring flames that attempted to engulf Rider. Luckily for Caster, the projectiles gave him the time he wanted as she kept trying to deflect or stop them using swings of her sword. If there was ever a moment to escape with his Master, now would be the time.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038532382011170956 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038532382011170956><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Nov-22 05:16 AM">05:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

What kind of king would I be if I let my subject get killed?&quot; Manco said with a smile although the situation was hardly any better. While he didn&#39;t share Hannibal hatred towards the Roman he could understand the feeling. If he were to be fighting a Spaniard, his anger would have no limits as this was a feeling that defy all reason and logic. Such a grudge that even when one understood how pointless it was, couldn&#39;t be stopped. 

So right now Manco knew that probably the only way to stop Rider was to kill her but that was an option he rather not rely into as he knew he couldn&#39;t make it painless. Due to how she resisted his  fire projectiles he assumed that he would need to possibly burn her till nothing remained. And that was only assuming she didn&#39;t get him or Mikail first. Which honestly was quite likely as even though he was putting quite a front he was running on fumes and after seeing his master being blown away he assumed his master was not in the best shape either. 

It was a no brainer really, if they wanted to win they needed to lower themselves to the same level of those of the first match. Which was something Manco didn&#39;t want under no circumstances so there was really no option. 

Fortunately, his master had come to the same conclusion. Mikail would notice a rock hand which would grab him and pull him away from Amelia and Hannibal and back next to Manco. 

&quot;Mikail, we are losing this one&quot; he said as a matter of fact ready to ignore any possible complains coming from his side. 

&quot;Rider!! I am a man of my word you move me from this spot so victory is yours!!&quot; he yelled. That being said he knew she probably wouldn&#39;t stop and so he encase her into a rock prison. Hannibal would suddenly find rock wall emerging around her, the walls would stand tall before closing on each other. More and more walls would appear adding layer and layers of defense. 

&quot;Okay I&#39;m thinking that should hold her for a few minutes. Can you walk Master? We need to leave&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even Hannibal&#39;s attacks didn&#39;t seem to stop him. In her less than stable state, she began to consider if the other team was actually two servants, that they were cheating to some degree.

Mikhail&#39;s final assault was something she was not expecting but nonetheless, he&#39;d find himself facing the cellulose barrel of a plant pressed between her palms, aimed directly for his lens. In the commotion, it popped and something embedded itself in the eyepiece and pushing against his eye. It did not pierce it but there was a distinct pressure against it.

This was going to be the end for her but she wasn&#39;t going down without trying, even in her condition. If Alexandria was going to lose, there was at least going to be a martyr this time...

Yet the punch collided with the rubble behind her and the brute hung his head in shame.

&quot;Huh!? You... don&#39;t <em>want</em> this victory?&quot; She rasped accusingly, face contorted in not only pain but insult. After all that abuse and careful positioning, he was just going to give up? That wasn&#39;t the doctor she remembered. What was he getting at, what trick was he about to pull. &quot;What&#39;s the catch? I... owe you now?&quot;

Cannot kill you... trying to kill a defenseless opponent... accept my surrender... all those words filtered into Amelia&#39;s turbulent mind and the hallucination before her began to disappear and be replaced by an equally terrifying man but one with a completely different spirit. 

&quot;OK... if that&#39;s how... you wanna do it... I... accept... your loss,&quot; her words coming out tense and parsed as she willed herself to stand before the cursed giant and a faint light returned to her ruby eyes. &quot;Just do... one thing for... me. Kneel... and show them... your choice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
