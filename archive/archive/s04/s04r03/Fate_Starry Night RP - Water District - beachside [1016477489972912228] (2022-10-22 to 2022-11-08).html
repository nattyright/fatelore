He was standing in a more rocky, less scenic area of the beachside, one purposefully chosen as few people came by. Barrett had received a message from one of his fellow teammates in this Holy Grail War, one Aida Moretti.

She had requested Barrett&#39;s advice and expertise in combat. A request Barrett thought was far too late to be considering at this point, but he wasn&#39;t going to turn it down. He had to try and support the other members of the Alexandria, lest someone end up like Thomas...

Barrett turned his gaze downwards at that thought.

Barrett then took a deep breath and looked back up towards the sea. He raised his wrist to his face, the watch on it slowly ticking away. He and Archer had arrived a bit early and Aida should be arriving soon...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Visitors, commuters, festival goers, and troublemakers...everywhere people went, it seemed that something would get broken, be it an instrument or a bloody nose. The casinos and lottery houses that usually operated covertly had never been met with more enthusiasm as people betted on their favorite champions with both riches and fists, and even the ghetto of the city looked brighter, as their narrow streets had been polished by all the boots and shoes that plodded up and down the tarmac roads, and their dated walls illuminated by the flashing of cameras and glowing cigarette tips.

The <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span> had broken their record on mana rail riding incidents on day 3 of the tourney. Then the record was broken again on day 5, then challenged once more on day 9. It had become quite easy to differentiate visitors from long-term residents: if you saw someone walking down the road with a limp, but no crutches, canes, or any form of walking assistance, then there was a very good chance that they were a visitor who had just had their first crash on a mana rail, got dispatched to the hospital, and subsequently got kicked out by very annoyed staff.

<strong>&#39;We have no cure for stupidity!&#39;</strong> Had become the hospital&#39;s new favorite motto, as the staff fully embraced the spirit of their workplace&#39;s namesake. Almost like a conspiracy, all the shops at Alexandria had suddenly, mysteriously, stopped selling walking aids as well, as if they had been in cahoots with the deeply harassed hospital staff and agreed that the best way to keep the visitors from the mana rails was to simply stop wasting resources on nursing them back to health. After all, someone who was ill-equipped to get on the mana rails in the first place would have zero chances of breaking their neck on it.

Especially in crucial times as this, where the entire city was in an unprecedented upheaval <em>whilst</em> trying to keep itself operational - which implied that <em>any and all</em> festivities were to proceed on schedule even when Noble Phantasms were being deployed across the street - for a city without substantial criminal law experience nor the accompanying task forces, this was a challenge. And how would the city respond?

Only time would tell.

But time, as it so happened, seemed to have stagnated at several places, such as the headquarters of the esteemed Bookbinder&#39;s Guild. As more people resorted to various methods of breaking themselves or breaking others, the librarians at the Guild found themselves to be suddenly relinquished of their 20-hours-a-day duties. New requests became rather infrequent, giving the staff a much needed window to deal with all the piled up orders from before. As such, they were allowed to work at their leisure in the spires of their workshops, all the while watching the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span> &#39;on fire&#39; from several streets down. It was entertainment at its peak.

But, as always, there would be exceptions. Not everyone was having such a great time, which was doubly true for our aspiring bookbinder and inkweaver-in-training, Aida Moretti. For almost a whole week at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>, the young lady locked herself in the workshop and, quite undramatically, worked. She finally made a head start on clearing her desk, which was sagging under the collective weight of all the documents that she needed to mend, not to mention the sack of instruments that only seemed to grow since the last time she had set her eyes on it. 

She was quite literally glued to her desk. Not by choice, but out of necessity. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037113367212605500 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037113367212605500><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 07:18 AM">07:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was difficult for her to walk. Though she had been in the clear to receive treatment when she had been admitted to the hospital, her stay there hadn&#39;t been all too pleasant. Her aunt had been placed on a temporary ban during hospital visiting hours, and after a failed attempt at running away from her room, conceived and executed by none other than yours truly, young Miss Moretti had been discharged from the hospital the moment she could limp.

And so she went back to her office and spent the rest of her incredibly dour week tethered to her desk. 

She didn&#39;t like to think about it, but all the pain killers she had been prescribed to kept a constant reminder of her failures. She felt compelled to think that it wasn&#39;t to punish herself, but to motivate her to do better, to work harder, to remember that he every action had consequences. But in the end, she only managed the &#39;consequences&#39; part, as her mind was filled with terrible, terrible thoughts, the many what-ifs that kept her awake. She was an excellent mender, but there was little she could mend when it came to her psyche. The doctors had fixed her body, but she wasn&#39;t strong yet.

&#39;I&#39;d rather you told me what happened,&#39; she had argued with Reynard when she&#39;d confided her plans to escape the hospital. &#39;I don&#39;t understand. How were you able to hijack my familiar?&#39; 

That wasn&#39;t the only question on her mind, but it was the only one that she had some measure of control over. Oblivion had claimed the rest, as in between her vision of a golden city and the pale bleached blankets of her hospital room, there was a gaping blank in her usually impeccable memory. It was also a blank that her Servant could not fill either, if his frazzled tail was any indicator of his agitation every time Aida questioned him on the specifics on his actions. The normally sleek fur of his tail was now more often seen standing on end, showing how anxious he was at exposing his secrets!

Every page has two sides. Every story has multiple perspectives. But what meaning was Aida to make out of a constant stream of &#39;I don&#39;t know!&#39;, or &#39;Go figure it out yourself if you&#39;re so capable, Master!&#39;?

Well, that suited her just fine! She had always wanted to be given full reins on the things she could do, and since when had anyone managed to stop her? Oh, her auntie didn&#39;t count. Aida was sure she had pulled some strings, but she could pull those strings right back! 

Well, not without considerable challenge. But that was the art to figuring things out on her own, wasn&#39;t it? She would just have to accept the challenge and tackle it in her own way!

And it all pretty much boiled down to the fact that she had to learn to gain more leverage in these talks with her distance relative, or anyone at work, for that matter. If her auntie, or even Cathy would stop treating her like a child...

&#39;This meeting will be crucial to our success,&#39; she briefed Reynard as they climbed out of the gondola and almost immediately sank their feet into the warm sand. To any architect outside of Alexandria, the city&#39;s urban design must&#39;ve been a nightmare. From giant lakes to interlacing canals to waves stretching beyond the beach and reaching out to the open sea, there was very little in terms of dry land. Why Alexandria didn&#39;t build a dome over its head, completely submerge itself underwater, then rename itself Pavlopetri was anyone&#39;s guess.

But, it was hard to deny that living in such a borderless city came with innumerous benefits as well. For instance...

&#39;There he is!&#39; The librarian spotted the older mercenary with pinpoint precision. Not that she could miss him easily, as the ensemble of his oufit stood out strikingly against the monotonic canvas of the beach. Guns and cybernetics at the beach? Won&#39;t the sand get into the bearings...?

Any form of lasting appeal that the city could have had was soured by the events a week before. A chaotic scuffle in a busy market, resulting in not only injuries and defeat, but the risk of death at the hands of <em>a giant meteor.</em>

Reynard&#39;s past concerns of angry farmers, petulant kings and greedy wolves were nothing in comparison. Plus, it was one thing to survive a ridiculous attack that could only be found in a comic book, and another thing <em>entirely</em> to survive with enough strength to make a quick getaway. Of course, the moment he used up the jellyfish&#39;s last ounce of strength, was the moment Aida passed out and was left defenseless. Her armor had started to melt, since it was nothing more than extension of her familiar. Reynard didn&#39;t even think as he placed her back on his arm and her thighs on the other, scurrying away like a tramp with a tail between his legs. He expected to be shot down in an instant, but it seemed as if their opponents had agreed to call it a stalemate.

And that is how Aida ended up at the nearest hospital, courtesy of Reynard asking for directions with hisses and chitters, almost collapsing under the librarian&#39;s weight. While Aida was asleep, the fox was pacing outside the visitor&#39;s lobby with a scowl on his face. He was worried. He wanted to tear Aida apart. He wondered about her condition. He pondered his mana usage. He wanted to punch that stupid librarian in the face so bad.

He was <em>so mad!</em> After all, the only reason this entire situation had happened in the first place was due to Aida&#39;s own foolishness. Yet he could not scold her, for the doctors were doing their best to mend her injuries. But anger was hard to get rid of. It needed release, hence why a rumor spread around the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span> about the building being haunted, namely because of the inhuman screams originating from the hospital&#39;s rooftop late at night.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037141022028877934 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037141022028877934><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 09:08 AM">09:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Eventually, Aida woke up. All of the fox&#39;s plans for revenge disappeared in an instant, as he instead focused on his Master&#39;s condition. She was hurt, but still lively. No sign of brain death. Still a malignant glint in her gaze that constantly eyed his fluffy tail.

They talked every now and then, albeit the conversations were brief due to the doctors and nurses wanting to do more checkups. Reynard never got the chance to scold her properly, of course, since it would always branch into Aida asking what happened at the fight, since she had forgotten the exact details of his Noble Phantasm. He would consistently avoid the subject, namely because he couldn&#39;t believe that the idiotic librarian was still reminiscing about the fight with such cheery eyes. What an hopeless endeavor it was to think that she would have grown to fear fighting...

It became even worse once Aida confided her plans to escape from the hospital. Reynard just sighed and ignored her. A terrible mistake, since Aida never lied: She indeed attempted to escape, and was kicked out for it. All that she got out of that little stunt was a painful healing back home, where she was glued to her desk and did nothing but work and spring cleaning all week.

&quot;I can&#39;t stand your foolish attitude any longer!&quot; That was the last thing Reynard remembered from the conversation they had back home. Aida had gotten on his nerves, so he abandoned her to a life of pencil pushing and noodle legs while he explored more of Alexandria. Deep down, he hoped to encounter some more excitement to put his mind off things, but he never found another Lancer to pique his interest.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037141047014334555 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037141047014334555><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 09:08 AM">09:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He would periodically check back on Aida, mostly so he could glare at her with contempt from afar. Anytime he noticed that she had food nearby, he would sneak in and steal a few. Anytime he noticed that she had clumsily forgotten her lunch, he would place some on her desk undetected. He continued this habit of being present, yet unseen, until Aida beckoned for him via the threatening flash of a Command Spell.

&quot;No need to do that.&quot; Reynard grumbled, emerging from underneath Aida&#39;s desk with a grumpy look on his face. &quot;What do you want? Need help getting something from the cupboard?&quot; He stared at her legs, before receiving a flick in response.

...And before he knew it, he was on a gondola, immersed in the scent of sea breeze and bright sunny rays. Aida had briefed him on her plan: To meet up with a fellow Alexandrian who planned to participate in the tourney.

<em>&quot;That is a terrible idea.&quot;</em> Was Reynard&#39;s first response. Aida had countered with another flick, hence why he was now on a gondola in the first place.

The two got off the boat, much to Saber&#39;s delight, since he was never a fan of the sea in the first place. But now he had to contend with the second worst thing: Sand. It was rough, irritating and it got <em>everywhere</em> on his fur. How could humans stomach such a despicable environment?!

Clearly Aida hadn&#39;t thought this through, judging by her frills now showing slight shades of brown. Her mind was more focused on the gruff looking man in the distance, his body outfitted with various mechanical parts and being packed with a lot of firepower.

Reynard stared at the man, then back to Aida. One of them was tournament material. The other was better off working at a local stationery, that much was clear.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037141111480795186 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037141111480795186><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 09:08 AM">09:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m the one who needs to behave themselves.&quot; Reynard replied, lightly sticking his tongue out. He let Aida lead the way, deciding that the best way he could handle this was to let his Master do the talking and only interrupt her if she started leveraging him or putting him in danger. Reynard paid more attention to his surroundings instead, for he had never been to a beach. The sea was vast, the sand was annoying, but he did notice a lot of ladies in eye-catching outfits...

&quot;Aida, I assume.&quot; Barrett greeted with a smile. &quot;Name&#39;s Barrett.&quot;

Barrett took a long look at the two. The gremlin-looking kid with an air of mischievousness about him was likely the Servant. He looked young, but Barrett knew that looks were deceiving when it came to Servants. The other, Aida, she was also just a kid. Probably just barely in her twenties, if that. However, there was a determination in her eyes, the same patriotic flame that Barrett saw in many Alexandrian. What Barrett saw in Thomas&#39;s eyes.

Barrett let out a heavy sigh and there a brief look of solemn melancholy before Barrett shook it off.

&quot;Okay, you wanted some help getting ready to fight? I&#39;ll be glad to assist you then, least I can do for my job. So, what am I working with here? What experience you got under your belt?&quot; Barrett cheerily asked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Another pair was supposed to meet up with them in order to be trained by his master, but Mehmed didn&#39;t care too much about that. 

He was only here because otherwise he would have bored himself to death.. 

<strong>Although, I have at least some ideas on what to do in order to entertain myself.</strong> Mehmed thought as he turned his head towards where the tower of Babel was supposed to be. Such a magnificent tower would make for an interesting base, so Mehmed was eager to at least give it a visit...

Before he could give this any more thought however, he&#39;d hear his Master talking to some newcomer&#39;s. Those had to be the ones who requested some private training sessions with his master. Mehmed finally got up from his not-so-comfy rock and turned towards the group. What he saw did not fill him with any confidence. It was a young lady who looked like physical work was beneath her and a... A child? Again? Did all the children of the past decide to play soldier in this day and age? 

&quot;Say, master... Are you sure Alexandria wants to win this war? Because I&#39;m slowly starting to doubt it.&quot; Mehmed muttered as he stared down Aida. 

&quot;Well, maybe they&#39;ll surprise me like the last guy... Tommy I think was it? He did go out with a &#39;bang.&#39; Although, she looks more like a slight breeze would knock her off. Not to mention her servant...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, she was a prim and proper lady, and Reynard...she glanced his way every once in a while as they crossed the beach, just to make sure he wouldn&#39;t try to slip away by deliberately dragging his footsteps. It almost felt like walking with a puppy who was off the leash.

Thankfully, their short walk ended rather peacefully. Despite the lack of enthusiasm which Reynard was by now radiating in an almost palpable aura, he allowed himself to be received by their guest, who seemed to have arrived at their meeting spot with the punctuality of a clock. It was quite the amazing feat, considering how slow the canals had been running lately curtesy of the festival that had nearly emptied out Alexandria&#39;s breweries. The city was still recovering from the massive hangover that had been blown out of proportions by the results of the second match, as supporters of either side of the tourney drank to celebrate and to drown the sorrow of their side&#39;s resounding flop. 

Aida had completely missed out on the festivities, of course. She had her eyes set on the final prize, and she would not be dissuaded until she could grasp it with her own hands!

She grabbed Barrett&#39;s hand into a firm handshake, though the determination of her action was all but lost to the mercenary. She had grabbed his cybernetic hand.

But that didn&#39;t discourage her. &#39;Pleased to meet you in person, Barrett,&#39; she said, nodding once as she confirmed his questions. &#39;As I explained in our brief correspondence, I&#39;m looking to gain some hands-on experience with fighting. The kind of fighting that can win me a match in the tournament,&#39; she added, looking slightly crestfallen.

I have a familiar that can punch several times harder! I also have a Servant...a Saber-class Servant.&#39; She sounded a bit unsure as she revealed Reynard&#39;s class, as if she herself still had trouble processing that fact. &#39;He&#39;s...&#39;

Good? Capable? Reliable? 

Light as a feather for some reason beyond her comprehension, thus allowing her to punt him all the way across the room if she so wished?

&#39;...But the thing is,&#39; she decided to gloss over that bit of information. &#39;The thing is, when I tried to apply these knowledge to a proper fight, nothing works the way I wanted. Not to mention, no one plays by the rules. Is it not proper etiquette that no one else interferes in a duel? What should I do when there is an ambush?&#39; 

Contrary to Mikail, Barrett seemed less like a madman and more like...well, a proper citizen of Alexandria. Not all mercenaries acted the same, it seemed, and that put Aida at ease. She fired off question after question as she tried to get everything off her chest, bombarding poor Barret with the most inept questions he&#39;d heard ever since he started this line of work. From the sound of it, the client he was dealing with...was the worst pupil he could possibly receive. Physical prowess aside, even her head seemed filled with the most childish fantasies.

Barrett quietly raised a hand, signaling Aida to stop talking.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be brutually honest with you Aida.&quot; Barrett said in a low tone. &quot;It would take around a year of intense physical training and combat experience for you to get anywhere close to the level of your enemies in this tournament.&quot;

Barrett sighed once more.

&quot;You wear your inexperience on your sleeve. You&#39;ve been bombarding me with questions that, no offense, range from banal simplicities that anyone with a warrior&#39;s mindset has figured out to inane childish babblings. I couldn&#39;t teach you any techniques that would help you in a day.&quot;

Barrett let his words sit for a moment as he pondered the enigma in front of him.

&quot;What I can try to help you out is help you change how you think.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Barrett pondered. &quot;You really like stories don&#39;t you, worryingly so. I guess life is sort of like a story. I would personally compare it to a dark comedy written by an amateur with a lot of passion. You I believe, have been interpreting this story with the wrong type of logic. You shouldn&#39;t be asking, why doesn&#39;t my opponent fight honorably? It should be, why should my opponent fight honorably?

Manuals provide clear, concise instructions on how to perform actions. Applying that in a real scene is like trying to speedread a manual graffitied with scrawlings, on uneven ground, while having to read another book in the background. It&#39;s why people say you should learn the basics until they become instinct. When stress is at a high that&#39;s all that remains, instinct.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037503086987595837 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037503086987595837><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 09:06 AM">09:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A wise man once said &#39;Everyone is a protagonist in their own story.&#39; Just like how I&#39;m a side character in your story, you&#39;re just a side character in my story.

She was fairly knowledgeable for a librarian, yet was oblivious to how na&#239;ve her own mannerisms and motivations sounded to everyone else. Barrett was frowning and speaking as he would with a child. His Servant didn&#39;t think any better of the woman either. Even Reynard would be hard pressed to find any redeeming traits about his Master that made her a good candidate for a Holy Grail War.

Not like he cared, for he was still staring in the distance, observing the various people that had shown up at the beach today. Some were engaging in fun activities, such as beach volley or surfing. Others were lazily lying around in an attempt to get a tan. That was all good and fine, but it wasn&#39;t what he was focusing on...

Barrett&#39;s speech hit Aida like a sack of bricks. Well, she had expected advice, but the man certainly didn&#39;t sugarcoat his words at all. It gave her a lot to think of, but her thought process was interrupted by the realization that Reynard had nary said a word since she spoke. In fact, he was purposefully keeping himself out of the conversation.

If she were to turn to her side, she would find the fox child staring emptily into space, his expression nonchalant and his eyes static, nary a blink. His tail had drooped down while his ears were raised and alert. Something had caught his attention, but what?

And then she saw it: A thin, bloody line dripping from his nose. A nosebleed, if you will.

That would make any Master panic a bit: What was going on? Was Reynard hurt? Did he still have lasting injuries from the previous fight? Was he actually being attacked right now by a shadowy Assassin? So many questions and too little answers. All Aida could do was look into the direction of where Reynard was looking at and-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037518333832089670 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037518333832089670><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 10:07 AM">10:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>boing boing</em>

If she was supposed to be the protagonist of her story, she certainly didn&#39;t feel like one back there. Reynard&#39;s gaze was carefully fixated on groups of ladies relaxing at the beach, each of them filled with unique charm. Bikinis, one piece, high cuts, low cuts, off shoulders...Summer fashion had come in early and it showed. Reynard had been utterly spoiled, his fairy tales having no concept of beach bods. All he could do was indulge himself and observe as each outfit perfectly accentuated the figure of the ladies in the distance.

<em>spurt</em>

A small bubble popped as the fox snorted, releasing a tiny bit more blood from his nostrils. Despite his gaze and reaction being obvious, he maintained a nonchalant, distant look, trying his best to ignore Aida next to him. One could truly tell that he was doing his best to appear innocent...

She realized that she didn&#39;t have an answer to his question. Why <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> people fight honorably? It had always seemed so natural to her, she had never felt the need to question it. But now that she was forced to confront it and come up with an explanation of her own...

&#39;Well,&#39; she began uncertainly, doing her best to rack her brains and come up with an answer. It felt as if she was back in the classroom. &#39;To sully a fight with cheap shots and trickery, that&#39;s got to weigh on your conscience. I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep soundly at night if I felt guilty about something I did during the day.&#39; 

But even as she said it, she realized that it was a rather weak response. After all, a villain rarely, if ever, shows remorse. Why should she expect them to feel bad about their actions, just because she would? Bringing modern weapons to a magecraft duel, concealing their intentions and lowering her guard in order to get the jump on her...yes, she was quite familiar with such conduct, but-

&#39;Just because you can, doesn&#39;t mean you should.&#39; She said glumly. &#39;I get your point, but doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of a duel?&#39;

The logical side of her was waging war against the emotional side of her as she made a futile attempt to reject Barrett&#39;s analogy. &#39;Look where we are,&#39; she flapped her arm and gestured towards the cityscape behind them, &#39;we&#39;re not barbarians...&#39;

...

Reynard felt the sharp prick of his Master&#39;s stare. Aida&#39;s lips were pursed together in a condemning silence, her cheeks puffed up behind them. It was the calm before the storm,  and he couldn&#39;t help but feel a chill at the back of his neck. His animalistic sense was tingling and warning him based on the rather painful memories from before...

In severe pain even. This girl&#39;s delusions and fantasies on how a fight should be like was ridiculous. Did she never leave her house? He would have gladly giving Aida a piece of his mind, but he ended up taking a backseat instead and let Barrett do the talking. Instead, Mehmed opted for simply rolling his eyes as dramatically as possible to make his disdain for the girl obvious. 

He did however notice the little rascal bleeding from the nose. Was he perhaps unwell? &quot;I think your little boy is hurt. He&#39;s bleeding from the nose at the very least. Maybe you&#39;d want to let that get checked out...&quot; Mehmed pointed at Reynard before noticing that he seemed to be in a sort of trance. His eyes was locked on something... Mehmed turned his head towards the direction of where the kid was staring into and whistled. 

&quot;I&#39;m taking it back. Your boy&#39;s in good health it seems. He just knows his priorities... although I will admit, half of my wives were better looking than them. They do beat the other half however.&quot; Mehmed joked and let out a laughed, which got even stronger the moment he saw what the master-servant pair were doing. 

&quot;Master, maybe there is still hope for Alexandria. We just have to make sure she&#39;s in a bad mood before the fight. And I am pretty sure her little child will be able to handle pretty well on his own.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had endured various trials and tribulations ever since his summon, mostly due to the insufferable antics of a certain Master. Perhaps they were just life&#39;s way of testing him, since the vista in the distance was nothing short of enlightening.

But his trials had yet to end. He realized that once he noticed the all too familiar feeling of being watched by someone out for blood. Although Aida had been busy debating the advantages of her methods (of which there were none) to Barrett, she eventually took notice of the fox&#39;s trance. Needless to say, she wasn&#39;t pleased.

Reynard felt like he was being pricked all over, constant signals of <em>&#39;I&#39;ll kill you&#39;</em> emitting from his Master&#39;s mind. Surprisingly, the Saber showed no fear or concern in his face. He kept staring into the distance, blank eyed and expressionless despite his bestial instincts warning him to flee. It was a calculated response: If he ran away, where would he even go to? Aida would just bring him back with a Command Spell and be even <em>more</em> furious. Clearly, the best strategy was to pretend that nothing was wrong. That he was just a poor, innocent passerby in that sea of bikinis...

...

One snide comment and a rough shake later, and Reynard thought that perhaps this method didn&#39;t have as much effectiveness as he had hoped. Aida held him by the cloak, dangling him in the air like you would a rabbit with its ears. It was annoying and embarrassing, but the expression on Reynard&#39;s face didn&#39;t change in the slightest. After all, he had received Aida&#39;s rough treatment several times in the past, to the point that it was growing dull. Instead, he refocused on the imagery from before, imagining those beach ladies and their exotic outfits, envisioning alternate realities where he was allowed to take a closer look. Sometimes, even a closer touch.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037645493100085269 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037645493100085269><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 06:32 PM">18:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He felt no shame as Aida hoisted him up for Barrett and Mehmed to see. Why would he? He had nary uttered a word in their conversation and silence equated to politeness in his eyes. All he was doing was minding his own business, yet clearly Aida had a problem with even <em>that.</em>

&quot;I am being nothing <em>but</em> behaved.&quot; Reynard replied quietly, albeit with a puff of hot air to let Aida know of his annoyance. He rubbed blood off his nose with his elbow as he continued speaking. &quot;Why are you even bothered? Did you see me steal any apples or woo any of your co-workers? No? Then we should be fine.&quot; He nodded.

Reynard wasn&#39;t wrong, even though he knew exactly why Aida was furious at him. Still, you wouldn&#39;t poke a sleeping bear until you absolutely had to. Hence why Reynard would keep moving in circles to avoid getting to the crux of the issue, since that would imply his own guilt. Instead, he attempted to right the course of the conversation.

&quot;Maybe you should pay more attention to what that man is telling you.&quot; He raised his head and stared down Aida from below. &quot;Cheap shots and trickery? Weigh on your conscience? My dear Aida, <strong>I ate live hares.</strong> And I&#39;m from a story for <em>kids</em> of all things. You see any guilt on my face from that? Hmmm? No?&quot;

<em>&quot;And I&#39;d do it again.&quot;</em> Reynard reaffirmed, much to Aida&#39;s shock. It was one thing to get a scolding from an experienced vet, but to be reprimanded by her own Servant in public was something else. &quot;Point is, not everyone in the world is as foolish as you or naive as you. If there are people who will take advantage of that, they certainly will. No amount of conscience or morals will stop them.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037645528789422090 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037645528789422090><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 06:32 PM">18:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He glared at Aida intently. Mostly to intimidate her, but his mind was still frazzled from the earlier vistas and the previous shaking. Part of him was still thinking on the beach, causing his mind to fluctuate and split into two halves. One thinking about the joys of beach fashion, the other about how much of a dunce Aida was. It was inevitable for those ideas to collide.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037645624503451649 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037645624503451649><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 06:33 PM">18:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
It started off with small, subtle things, such as Reynard noticing that Aida&#39;s height matched one of the distant ladies. That their waists were similar. Arms. Chest. Inevitably, he started voyuering, taking note of her three measurements and making comparisons. It came down to outfits, then colors. Perhaps in a one piece, and maybe if she took off those dorky glasses-

<em>snort</em>

Another sneeze. From both nostrils. A shotgun like blast of blood dripped to his lips, while small droplets of it made contact with Aida&#39;s frilly dress. It would have shocked her, no doubt, though not as much as Reynard&#39;s insistence that nothing had happened. Despite showing his depravity once more, he kept staring at her and talking down!

&quot;So, that&#39;s why you&#39;re unsuited to a Holy Grail War. Fairy tales are childish, yet even those kinds of stories show all sorts of cruelty and evil. Did you already forget about the poor, yet dumb jellyfish? He did nothing wrong, yet was punished with a fate worse than death and all of his descendents were cursed with the same fate. Yet I&#39;m sure the Dragon King is sleeping soundly right now.&quot; Reynard chided her, before tilting his head back and looking at Barrett.

&quot;If she is incompetent, please just say so. You would do me a huge favor if you managed to shatter those childish delusions of hers.&quot; He smirked.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037645720230051920 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037645720230051920><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Nov-22 06:33 PM">18:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Momomo-mo Mo-momo#8008">@The Morbdustrial Revolution</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Your leachorus friend has a point. I’ve actually been to Republic a few times you know. The people are friendly and it’s just as nice as it is here.” Barrett said while looking out to the city.

“Yet even Alexandria has its dark places and shadowy dealings. That I have no doubt.”

Barrett looked straight at Aida.

“What’s makes you think that this War is anything like a duel? This isn’t a squabble between two nobles trying to prove their honor. This isn’t a simple battle between the hero and the demon lord. This is a multifaceted struggle between nations.”

Barrett explained calmly.

“It’s a struggle between many groups of people, each with their own unique morals and beliefs driving them. This war started long before this Holy Grail War was a thing and will likely continue long after it’s conclusion. A veritable Epic, if you will.

You’re optimistic and have a childish view of the world. That’s not inherently a bad thing. However, you are deep in some incredibly dark and dangerous dealings with little idea as to what you are doing. If you refuse to acknowledge that, your story can only end in tragedy. 

We’ll be fighting in the next match. I consider myself a man of my word, but I can guarantee you that I’ll be fighting with every trick I got. And if Archer here ever gets a clear shot at the enemy master, I wouldn’t even hesitate to tell him to take it. Anything less would be an insult to my employers.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I really do, Mr. Von Meer.&#39; 

A tinge of sadness crept up Aida&#39;s face. She was used to it, being lectured on the the intricacies of the world, how nothing was ever what it seemed. Where corruption and wickedness lurked unchecked beneath the surfaces of even the most immaculately run city, luring and seducing people by its charms. Even now, the two Servants on the beach were proving that very point as they gawked at the scantily clad beachgoers. 

Of course, there was nothing wrong with having an appetite. Even Aida would find herself jelly-legged and hard-pressed to move whenever she discovered a new bookstore in the precinct. The same could be said for cities and nations, of course, but...

&#39;Even so, we can&#39;t justify every single method just because they represent the beliefs of a distinct group of people. You can&#39;t justify participating in war with whatever means you have at your disposal, because it makes you feel like you&#39;re acting in the interest of your faction. That&#39;s like saying it&#39;s okay for the members of a gang to beat up innocent people on the street because it gives them a sense of belonging, or worse, that it&#39;s okay for the innocents to beat up the gang because it cements them as a team!&#39;

&#39;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to accept that,&#39; she said flatly, before raising Reynard up to her face, &#39;just like there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to let you defile my familiar. You don&#39;t know anything about fairytales. If the only thing you can glimpse from my &quot;poor jellyfish&#39;s&quot; story is that cruelty is a-okay, then you&#39;ve got much to learn, my furry-tailed Servant! Do you want to know why I made the jellyfish my familiar, but not the Dragon King himself?!&#39; 

She dropped the fox child, feeling more repulsed than she had before.

But what I - what <em>Alexandria</em> is trying to do takes lots and lots of hard work.&#39; She steadied herself and breathed deeply.

&#39;And that means we must be doing the right thing.&#39;

Reynard&#39;s comments had lit a fire in her chest. It was one thing for a senior Alexandrian to lecture her on the ways of the world, but her kid-sized Servant had insisted on making it personal. She looked up at the mercenary.

&#39;I don&#39;t have the power to change your ways.&#39; She told Barrett. &#39;You will allow me to see your actions in a different light when it&#39;s your turn on the stage. But right now, I only come to you, as a fellow Alexandrian, to look for a way to prepare for these &quot;dangers&quot; without having to stray from my own convictions. I will never resort to trickery, untruths, or half-truths to win my battles. If that means scaling a mountain in order to claim my victory, then so be it.

Before you know it, you&#39;d most likely end up trying to have a picnic with the enemies, I reckon.&quot; Mehmed pulled out his sword, swinging it around for a bit before pointing it towards Aida. 

&quot;Do you know what this is? This isn&#39;t just a little tool for cutting bread or opening your letters or whatever else you would use it for.

&quot;If you don&#39;t like that idea, be ready to not only fight back, but win against me. And to do that you must do something other than just begging me to follow some made- up rules. Those do not matter once everything is said and done. Sure, you are the one on the morale high-ground, but I will be the one still standing. You can count yourselves lucky the republic pitied you, giving you a chance to defend yourselves. If it was me, I would have bombarded the city until you gave in. After all, that&#39;s how warfare used to work back in the day... Do you know how the people in the cities and towns defended themselves? If they refused to parley and hid behind thick walls? They used every chance they had to protect themselves and weaken the enemy side. A hunter wouldn&#39;t stop hunting its pray just because it started to beg with teary eyes. It will however think twice should the prey to bite back.&quot; And with that Mehmed once again turned around, watching the ladies sunbath.

&quot;On the contary friend, I think there&#39;s a bit more than pure fantasy in her head.&quot; Barrett finally spoke out. &quot;That was quite well spoken Aida, maybe if more people thought like that, this world would be a better place. So, allow me to teach you one more truth of the world, and summurize what my partner is saying in less hostile terms.&quot;

Barrett then slowly grabbed his rifle from his side. It didn&#39;t look like any standard model of firearm. It looked more like a series of patchwork pieces fitted together from various other models. Yet, the workings on it were exquisite. It was not cobbled together from leftover scrap, but meticulously and throughtfully constructed with each piece serving a clear purpose. The words &#39;Will to Power&#39; were carved into the frame.

&quot;Without power, you can affect nothing.&quot;

Barrett looked into Aida&#39;s eyes, they were filled with the same fiery determination he had seen before.

Barrett pulled out a gun magazine and showed its contents to Aida.

&quot;Rubber bullets.&quot; Barrett stated. &quot;Less deadly than the real thing but they hurt like a bitch and can still be lethal in certain circumstances.&quot;

<em>Clack</em>

<em>Clunk</em>

<em>Click</em>

The magazine slid into Barrett&#39;s rifle and he held it by the grip in his flesh hand, finger off the trigger, barrel pointed down and to the side. Barrett then held up a single metal finger.

&quot;One minute. A duel between you and me. If you&#39;re still standing, I&#39;ll hammer as much knowledge and techinques as I can into your little noggin. If not, I&#39;ll make certain that you can&#39;t participate in the Holy Grail War. Even if that means putting you in the hospital until its over.&quot; Barrett then waited for Aida&#39;s response.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t a crime to have pure intentions, but the fox inherently disagreed with that concept. After all, what had his tales shown besides the fact that honesty would get you nowhere compared to treachery and selfishness?

Clearly, Aida disagreed.

&quot;Oof!&quot; The fox spat, landing tail first on the sand as Aida now towered above him, arms on her waist as she looked down on him and gave him a stern talking to. A lecture on why exactly she believed in fairy tales, despite how cruel and sinister they looked in Reynard&#39;s eyes. The explanation was a lot simpler than he had expected.

But it did nothing to change his own viewpoint. If anything, it made him see the two as even more incompatible!

<em>&quot;What would you know about real hardship?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;You&#39;ve never been poor. You&#39;ve never been hungry. You never had to lie and cheat to survive.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Foolish librarian.&quot;</em>

&quot;...I get more and more tired of your voice with each passing day.&quot; Reynard scoffed, spitting out air as he pumped his cheeks. &quot;You call a life of hardship a good thing? <em>Masochist.&quot;</em> He gave her a piercing glare, as if judging her for her fetish of being morally correct.

&quot;But whatever. I am unfortunately stuck with your melon for brains.&quot; The fox sighed, but much to Aida&#39;s surprise, he didn&#39;t push his argument any further. No, he stood up, wiped sand off his tail and returned to his Master&#39;s position. He listened to Barrett&#39;s statements, followed by Mehmed&#39;s criticisms of Aida&#39;s naivety. He interjected the sultan once they were done.

&quot;You&#39;re right. She is a dreamer. A fairly milquetoast one at that: Truth, justice and the Alexandrian way? Talk about vanilla!&quot; Reynard mocked her, but then crossed his arms and stared Mehmed down.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038242312389664768 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038242312389664768><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 10:04 AM">10:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Unfortunately, I am stuck with this melonhead. Which means that I have no choice to defend these childish ideals of hers.&quot; He stepped forward, standing in front of Aida, acting as a barrier between her and their two opponents. &quot;I don&#39;t respect her ideas of course. She might be the worst dunce I&#39;ve ever had to accompany. But as a Servant, it <em>is</em> my duty to respect her wishes.&quot;

Was Reynard truly serious? Perhaps his plan was to send Aida in shock with how supportive he was being. Back at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>, he had completely vanished from view and let her tend to her own injuries, yet he had raised to the occasion to defend her once the other two Alexandrians begun ganging up on her.

Maybe he was just jealous that someone else was tearing her down...

&quot;If you want her to learn the idiocy of her ways, I&#39;m afraid you will have to beat it out of her.&quot; The fox said with a threatening tone, as if he was confident he could take Mehmed and Barrett on. He stared at the cyborg&#39;s gun, unamused. In fact, the man&#39;s words had more impact than the threat of his gun.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say, but this woman won&#39;t rest until she can still breath. Even if you were to destroy her legs completely-&quot;

His mind flashed back to Aida&#39;s condition when she was hit by Mikhail&#39;s bullets, followed by when she passed out with a half torn armor after Manco&#39;s meteor shower. He remembered how relieved he felt once the doctors told her that her condition was salvageable.

&quot;-she would simply start walking with her hands.&quot; He sighed, Aida and the others being unsure on whether he was joking or not. As if noticing the change in atmosphere, he immediately followed it up by a raised tail and a cheery grin.

&quot;...Of course, if you were to <em>pay</em> us to stay out of the Holy Grail War, I think that would be a different matter entirely. Right, Master?&quot; He gave her a wink, albeit he knew she wouldn&#39;t take that chance at all. Reynard couldn&#39;t help teasing. &quot;Just a small sum. That&#39;s all it takes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038242345314947132 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038242345314947132><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 10:04 AM">10:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Momomo-mo Mo-momo#8008">@The Morbdustrial Revolution</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Aida didn&#39;t know whether to tape Reynard&#39;s mouth shut or to allow him to keep talking, but by the time she&#39;d made a decision, the damage had been done. The fox child had run his mouth. He had managed to paint Aida as some sort of wraith who wouldn&#39;t stop haunting people until she&#39;d achieved her goals. Just how was that fair? She would...she would never...

...she would, wouldn&#39;t she?

Aida stared at the sword Mehmed so deliberately brandished towards her. She noticed how sharp the blade was. She also noticed that she was not afraid. She stared at it for a few more seconds, with the eyes of someone who refused to comprehend the terror of death. She&#39;d had her closest encounter with it not so long ago, but she still lived, as if fate had rewarded her for trying. Some part of her mind still believed in the sugar-spun miracles that so many of her beloved fairytales doled out like candies. After all...

&#39;Saying this makes me want nothing more than to dig a hole and bury myself in shame, but just this once, I&#39;ll have to agree with my Servant, as childish as his words are! You&#39;ll find yourself in quite a lot of trouble if you hope to defeat me with threats alone.&#39; She expelled the words as quickly as she could, a flush of pink climbing up her cheeks. &#39;I won&#39;t let you give up on me. I&#39;ll make sure to protect myself from your bullets to the best of my abilities.&#39;

She withdrew her fountain pen from the inner pocket of her dress, clamping the tip of the pen between two fingers and shook it in front of Barrett and his haughty Servant. She brandished her tool of trade in the air, dragging out a lingering thread of ink that seemed as if it were made of a solid material.

The ink thread whipped itself towards Reynard. It coiled around his lips and tightened itself, forcing the fox child into a pout and it shut his mouth like a sack.

&#39;If you&#39;ve got something to say, save it for when we beat this challenge. Otherwise, less talking, and more doing!&#39;

In a flash and the mercenary was gone. No, not that he had made himself invisible, but by the time he made contact with Aida, most of her attention was still on her furry-tailed Servant. No one had fired a starter pistol or blown a whistle, no one had called to initiate the challenge, no one but Barrett&#39;s fist that had lodged itself securely in Aida&#39;s collar. 

By the time the librarian realized what had happened, she had already landed face down in the sand. It was not as soft as she&#39;d hoped.

Frantically, Aida groped around for her glasses, but a hard knock on the back of her head sent her flying back to the ground again. In the span of mere seconds, she&#39;d had her first <em>and</em> second kiss stolen by the beach. She lay there, facedown and unflinching.

<em>Aida Moretti, death by s-</em>

<strong>&#39;Why didn&#39;t you shoot?!&#39;</strong>

Muffled sounds pushed through the sand. Aida scrambled to her knees, her heavily concussed head spinning as she tried to focus.

&#39;That wasn&#39;t a bullet, no fair!&#39; She was already anticipating that! Aida spoke while she spat out hair and sand, which was quite the difficult feat. A sticky warmth trickled down the back of her neck, making her collar feel slippery and icky, but she could hardly pay attention to that. After all, she&#39;d nearly gotten her head cracked open!

He did however look at Aida occasionally as she showcased her powers, but any sense of interest quickly faded away when the comedy troupe went back to their usual mischiefs. 

&quot;Master I honestly think this is a lost. She seems to have some talent for magecraft, but her mindset and her servant are not going to do them any favours.
