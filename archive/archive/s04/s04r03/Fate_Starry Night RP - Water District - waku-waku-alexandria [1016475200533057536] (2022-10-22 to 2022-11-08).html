Why did they have to meet at the Waku-Waku, where the temperature was too hot, there were people all around, and said people wouldn’t stop their glances and glares towards him and Lancer? The presence of the Servant made things awkward as well, their disastrous encounter fresh on the mind. 

Saria insisted, later yesterday, on the idea. Her search had proven useful: the Mercenary route didn’t yield much, but Nobility were suckers for a thing such as a free wish from such an influential player. As she had explained it, shipping records for Servant Frames didn’t give much info, but when they were sent to such interesting places, like a noble mansion, it proved interesting.

Even more so the fact that docking records proved that a vessel, commanded by the same household, returned to Alexandria not long after. Murmurs and rumors on social media confirmed its presence. The <em>important</em> cargo, hidden in between the lines on records? 

VIP’s. 

From there, all it took was a letter from a courier and time. As for the place…

Payback for the sudden dip from society for a day or two. Aforementioned nobles wouldn’t take such a breach of information lightly. A vein on his forehead bulged, remembering her stupid face and hideous laughter at the revelation of their meeting spot.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033798533855330345 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033798533855330345><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Oct-22 03:46 AM">03:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Thus, they arrived thirty minutes before the scheduled time, two o’ clock, parked themselves near the center of it all and waited. They stole a table at the edge of the Food Court, the lesser of all evils. Nauseating smells and sounds sent his senses into overdrive, the air thick with an awful mix of chlorine and grease from fryers. He sat hunched over the table, eyes focused on his hand.

He crushed the neon green wristband in his grip even further, much too large to fit around his arm. Damn staff had insisted. Didn’t even let him keep his shield, the bastards. It was funny, though, to watch four scrawny young adults struggle to carry the thing into their storage room.

Nikolai tilted his head slightly to Lancer, “<strong>Remember. Convince. Drop. No. Attacking.</strong>”

If he could avoid a physical conflict inside such a packed area, the better. His wallet still felt the sting from the last few days.

Even if it wasn&#39;t obvious from the layers of cotton that were cooking him underneath the artificial sun rays overhead, it had to be from the bare-laden Alexandrians that were taking the dousing, drenching and drizzling themselves in the sprays of water that threatened to take Saber and her Master. Of course, If anything, this was probably the one instance where Saber&#39;s more loose definitions of clothing let her fit in with her surroundings. Not to mention, it was the perfect place to collect trinkets left behind on pool chairs and beneath the shade of parasols by absent minded children when they spy their next aqua sported escapade. 

Phew. The sun makes the mind wander...and opens the inner thesaurus. They wouldn&#39;t be needing that much of a vocabulary, based on their correspondence. 

Another Republic member. The one from their first Tournament round. The winner, and their Lancer. 

Simon&#39;s last encounter with an Alexandrian master had made it clear; he would have to make more of an effort to reach out with his teammates. He couldn&#39;t rely on their victories, and more than anything, he had to know who to rely on should more Alexandrians discover him like Amelia had. He doubted whether anymore would be friendly enough to let him go...and he definitely did not want to watch Saber let herself loose. Not when it was something he couldn&#39;t control of even keep himself out of the crossfire of. 

&quot;I think that&#39;s them over there. They have the mass enough to count for it,&quot; Simon says, waving with his own hand and pointing to his green wristband, forgetting momentarily that everyone had the lime cuff glued to the fibrous hairs along their arm, waiting to lay claim to the follicles...

&quot;This won&#39;t take long, then we can get back to the ba-den. Back to the den...sorry.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From what Grendel’s Mother knew of the situation, they were to meet yet another member of Republic’s team.  The team who had won the first fight of the tournament. This however, mattered little to the Matriarch. 

What seemed to intrigue her more was the idea of a ‘water park’. A place, where humans could go to relax and cool off. Even though their world already offered ample beach space to make use of. Some human deemed this site a necessity? It was novel. The little wrist band was also something interesting, most definitely it will remain there for a while. 

Little mind was paid to the encounter with Hannibal. She understood her master’s intentions for this outing. Find more people to make an alliance with. 

“The tin man, and the snake.” Grendel’s mother responded to Simon, when he pointed to them. “This is your issue, child. Go meet them yourself.” She was prepared to wander off, and leave him alone to meet these intimidating people.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Someone pointed and waved. 

A child and… a woman. Either she had a skin condition, or she was his Servant. Unfortunately, given his own unique ‘problem’, it was impossible for himself to discern which was the case. One as little as that could make many terrible decisions, too, such as leaving a Servant outside or even at their residence. 

The boy, at least, was the right one. The picture he’d been shown earlier by Saria and this one were near identical. Simon Despierro. 

Wars, it seemed, were fought by the children and disabled these days.

Lancer glared at Simon as he approached, green eyes wide, incredulous at the sight. <em>This</em> was to be their ally? A <em>child</em>? Not only were they expected to wage war against toothless brats, they were also expected to fight alongside them? Were Alexandria and the Republic truly so desperate for victory that they would conscript any runt that could stand up straight?

As the boy approached the table, Ryujin would push his Fishy Delishy Deluxe™️ across the table, over to Simon. On the surface, it seemed like a kind gesture, an offering of food to a starving child. In reality, it was an insult - after all, what was once a delishy fishy meal now looked akin to a crime scene, the meat eviscerated and spread all across the plate. Still, food was food, was it not?

<strong>&quot;It was quite the victory, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</strong> Lancer mused aloud, idly cleaning off a few scraps of fish and batter as he spoke. <strong>&quot;Truly astounding work. Though, I suppose we were big fish in a small pond, kuhuhuhuhu...&quot;</strong>

Underneath the table, Ryujin&#39;s tail would shift, poking Nikolai in the leg twice. The subtext was clear - his servant was expecting him to follow up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man slid over a foot, to ensure that both Simon and his guest had enough room to wiggle around. Also helped that he now had a clear view of the area behind them. 

On Lancer’s prod, he nodded along. “<strong>Small. Pond.</strong>”

He leaned forward, “<strong>Very. Small.</strong>”

“<strong>Too. Small.</strong>”

What did he mean?

Nikolai returned to his previous position. As unfortunate as it was, he wouldn’t be able to properly convey the intended message without a lot more words. Words he didn’t have the energy to speak. His throat hurt a lot more, and faster. Ugh.

“<strong>Know. Prize? Wish.</strong>”

“<strong>Many. Teammates. Share.</strong>”

Once more, he rubbed his sore throat. “<strong>Lancer. Explain.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Without missing a beat, Lancer went for the kill. He did not even look the boy in the eyes as he spoke. He simply continued scraping his claws together, even though the last crumb of fish had long since been cleaned off. He let the statement hang in the air for a moment, allowed the crushing gravity to settle on Simon&#39;s shoulders, before he continued.

<strong>&quot;Children have no place in this Grail War. You cannot possibly comprehend the consequences of your actions, let alone be trusted with a wish for the future. Your involvement is an insult, and if you continue down this path, you will almost certainly meet a most unpleasant ending. Nobody will weep for you. You will not be remembered. In the eyes of history, you&#39;ll just be another corpse tossed to the graves...&quot;</strong> 

A hand reached out, grasping the boy&#39;s shoulder. Talons dug forcefully into the skin, not enough to break it, but certainly enough to hurt.

<strong>&quot;With that in mind, wouldn&#39;t it be better for you to simply forfeit, and spare yourself such needless suffering?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They had all seen how Thomas had gone. Last he heard, guy had been hospitalized for the last few days. Someone with <em>less</em> experience would surely fare worse. Bloodline be damned, one&#39;s own survival was perhaps the most important.

Then, it made little sense as the boy grew more upset as Lancer finished his miniature speech, and Simon scrambled for something, <em>anything</em>, that Nikolai’s own fist curled tighter. Visions danced in his own head. 

 A disappointing look from his parents, seemingly glued to their faces. Backs faced away, gone for good. A new place to live, far away from anything he could call home.

How cruel was this one’s father? Unsympathetic? Considering the sniveling mess in front of him…

Another hand joined, onto Simon’s other shoulder. Much gentler, even perhaps a comfortable feeling.

He gently rubbed his hand back and forth, “<strong>Stop. Safety. First.</strong>”

“<strong>Father. Not… Hmm. End. All. Be. All?</strong>” He growled at himself. He removed his hand and instead dug a finger deep into Simon’s chest. 

“<strong>Not. Pawn.</strong> <em>Human.</em> <strong>Make. Own. Choices.</strong>”

With any luck, it would be the decision to surrender his position in this tournament and disappear from the register. Anything less was inadequate. Even the most pathetic of nobles managed to stab a few people in the back from time to time.

He glanced up, his eyes flitting across Nikolai&#39;s...mask. It had the stoic visage he came to expect from even his own father, but the words...he&#39;d never heard such words. His father never uttered the word human once around him. In fact...

&quot;...I cant,&quot; Simon says again, his own fist squeezing tight in response to Nikolai&#39;s gentle prodding. Everyone kept telling him the same thing...but what use was it if no one even knew the real truth? What real gift did these words bring if they didn&#39;t even capture what he really was...

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple, I just...all I&#39;ve been told since I got here were things like making my own destiny. That I can make my own choices...but I&#39;m not like you. I&#39;m not like any of you...I want to be, God I really, REALLY want to be but...&quot; 

<em>If you fail, do us all a favor. Do not return. There will be no place for you.</em> 

<em>You are an insect! They are our enemy!</em> 

&quot;...I&#39;m not human. I don&#39;t have that drive...all I have is fear. Fear of...I cant even be afraid to die anymore. I&#39;m just afraid I&#39;m not really alive.&quot; 

He dares to look them in the eye. Lancer&#39;s own reptilian visage and Nikolai&#39;s masked and guarded one. Both stared back, and he even now felt that emptiness welling up once more. Saber might as well have not even been there...he was alone. Naked. And small.

Her hands then fell upon those holding onto her master, plucking them away from his shoulders. The comfort of Nikolai and the coercion of Ryujin were no longer felt on the child. As she leaned downwards. Caring not for the child’s opinion. “You again… care so much about not being human, yet you <em>never</em> grow past your weakness. This frustrates me.” Saber’s hunched over form whispered into Simon’s ear. 

Face contorting, and shifting into something a bit more monstrous. The matriarch then turned to the two before her. “I refuse to give up <strong>our</strong> shot at the wish.” Her face remained settled upon that demonic visage. “Especially to one’s like yourselves.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slowly, the dragon stood up from the, putting themselves on eye level with Grendel&#39;s Mother.

<em><strong>&quot;I was not asking.&quot;</strong></em>

For a moment, a flicker of bottomless contempt passed the eyes of Lancer. However, just as soon as it arrived, it left, replaced with his normal blank stare, which he proceeded to direct back towards Simon.

He had so carefully curated this mask, had he not? It was time to make use of it.

<strong>&quot;You will turn around and leave this place. You will return to the Republic Embassy, where you will submit your formal retirement from this tournament. From there, you will head to the docks, board whichever ship you wish, and leave Alexandria forever, never to bother me again.

The child wanted a pat on the back from dad, but the girl wanted the wish. Fair enough.

So, as Lancer finished his grandiose list of instructions, Nikolai suddenly stood up.

And held his arm in front of Ryujin.

“<strong>Enough. Down.</strong>”

He met the gaze of the serpent, calm and unflinching. He gently guided one of the clawed hands further into the table, and slowly lowered himself back down into his seat. 

“<strong>Leave. Consider. Offer.</strong>”

He turned his back to the pair, no longer interested in what they had to say. However, for Ryujin, this was an outrage. Once more did he defy the wishes of the god. How dare—

A tap on the wrist. If he looked down, he would notice that the hand that moved his own back now missed its pinky finger. Another second passed, and his thumb joined it in the center of his palm. Three of the five digits remained in contact.

A countdown? For— oh ho, was this a surprise!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only she so far caused him to shake, but maybe she was truly right. What use was it to wallow in this despair. It was clear no one cared, least of all Lancer. Ryujin...God of the Oceans...so this was simply a command, one that he already felt compelled to listen to, even if it meant returning home and being sent away...or worse yet, being simply discarded to the pile...the meat and sinew that were mere components of his form. An alchemical waste...

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving.&quot; 

It surprised even him, once he realized he actually said it. Out loud, no less. Not even under his breath. And while this would certainly invite wrath, this wasn&#39;t just for him anymore...he had more to learn, after all. And Amelia...he did want to see her again. Alexander, as well. For the first time in his life, he had...purpose. 

&quot;We&#39;ll leave, but we&#39;re staying in the tournament. I don&#39;t know what Saber wants with a wish, but...but I&#39;m not just a bother. I&#39;m your teammate, whether you two like it or not. I have just as much of a stake to help as you two do. I wanted to discuss our future in this tournament, but it seems that was never going to happen...so I guess I&#39;ll just be on my own. Nothing new there. Saber, let&#39;s go.&quot; 

As he turned his back, from both Lancer and Nikolai, his back straight and posture proud...his face deflated enough that it was clear he was ready to pass out if he didn&#39;t get home in time. He could make kt out of the park, but hopefully Saber wouldn&#39;t be opposed to carrying him...or dragging him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Teeth more akin to fangs, fingernails now growing into claws. “It’s been a few ages since I last <em>slaughtered</em> a dragon.” She almost mused not once breaking eye contact from the other pair. 

The bear spoke, breaking up the tension between servants. Simon then spoke. Turning away from the threats and began to leave the park. His biggest mistake. If this fellow teammate was so willing to stop a confrontation then this seemed to have worked. Saber’s form slowly shifted back to that of a woman, situated in an uncanny valley for her appearance. The boy did make his will to stay in the war known. 

Slowly Saber began to back away. Not once removing her eyes from the tin man and the snake. “It looks like we will need to postpone our duel, Lancer.” Grendel’s mother kept creeping backwards, not feeling safe until they were well out of her line of sight.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Had they not learned their place during their last interaction? The dragon had half the mind to bludgeon him over the head for his insolence. However, as he felt the fingers counting down upon his wrist, he could not help but allow a smile to creep upon his face.

So, it appeared even the simpleton beast had the good sense to lie. How amusing of a thought! When handed such a compelling script, how could he not act his part?

<strong>&quot;Fine. Fine! Very well!&quot;</strong> Ryujin half-shouted and half-sighed, sinking down into his seat. In this moment, he was nothing short of the picture of pure dejection. <strong>&quot;Who am I, a living god, a divinity in the flesh, to be the arbiter of sensibilities? If the brave hero and his beautiful chaperone are so intent on walking the path of tragedy, they are free to do so. Tis no skin off my scales!&quot;</strong>

Two fingers. As the countdown grew closer to completion, Nikolai would hear a low gurgle escaping from Lancer&#39;s throat, like water boiling on the stove. A preparation for what was to come next.

Their duel would be postponed? No, no, that was a most silly mistake. There was never any duel. There would never be any duel.

<em>This would be a massacre</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two.

Probably. However, a wonderful umbrella sprouted from the center of the table they chose. Attached at the base, but surely not strong enough to resist him. Worse come to worse, he could always break the stand over the head of that woeful Servant.

Or Simon. He’d live, right?

One.

Probably not.

Ryujin’s mouth was eager. <em>Hungry</em>. Nikolai made <em>much</em> less noise, somehow. He let go of Lancer, the best sign that now was the time, and quickly grabbed the chair next to him with both hands.

As he swung around, he grew in size. The massive man grew larger, an already preposterous idea. Yet, armor bulged as Saber watched him rise and swing around, black chair in hand. His arms swung around as fast as they could, which wasn’t exactly fast.

However, when he released his grip on the furniture, it sure didn’t feel like it. Black approached with lightning speed, right towards <em>Simon</em>. A test, to see how much she truly cared for the child. 

And how easily she could fend both of their attacks off. What was Ryujin cooking?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 02:14 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Eyes ever vigilant of both potential assailants, Lancer let out a cruel sound. A hiss akin to the bubbling of a kettle brought to a full boil. 

They weren’t going to allow Saber and Simon to leave just like that. There was blood going to be spilt. 

Especially with how vain Lancer was. 

The tin man then acted. 

Muscles swelled, bulging to the point where he looked more like gorilla than man. A chair was swung at break neck speeds, headed right for Simon. While Lancer has not yet acted. 

In a simple yet brutal act, The Matriarch’s leg shot backwards knocking Simon out of the way. No doubt it would cause her Master some harm but it would far outweigh what that chair could cause to the boy. 

Two swords then materialized within her hands. “So, death is what your wish for?” One a simple affair straight and sharp. The other curved like a flamberge. With her next step she threw the straight blade right towards Nikolai, while moving to slash at Ryujin. “Child, if you wish to make up for a prior transgression. Now would be the time.” Grendel’s mother called as her eyes, seemingly glinted with excitement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was only ever one way this confrontation would end, and that was in bloodshed.

Saber was quick to counter-attack, throwing one sword towards Nikolai while keeping the other in their grip, poised to slash at Lancer. A pitifully simple-minded attempt at a two-pronged attack. With all the effort of a yawn, the dragon&#39;s tail swept out, smacking into the thrown blade and sending it clattering down to the ground. Nikolai was now protected. As for the other attack...

<strong>FWOOOSH!</strong> Ryujin opened his maw, and from it, magical energy poured forth like a wave of fire, burning everything that it touched. Onlookers screamed and fled at the sight, tables and chairs being melted into nothing from the overwhelming heat. Of course, the dragon cared not about the pleas for mercy. If they died, they died.

And if Saber died? Even better.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He rolled backward, his body bruising as the collateral only multiplied upon itself, the boy landing in a shuddering heap. He couldn&#39;t even hear the din of battle beginning as Saber leapt into action, as his main concern was to not simply double over in pain, the boy fighting back the tears welling in his eyes. 

<em>Don&#39;t cry here, don&#39;t cry here, no time you have to do something he&#39;s going to kill you</em> He thought to himself, Simon clenching his teeth as he looks up. The broiling Fury of Lancer surged forth, rolling on itself in waves and swallowing whole the decorum of the rest area. Screams told him that fanciful parasols and beach chairs weren&#39;t the only thing being consumed. 

&quot;Saber...Saber, i can&#39;t...&quot; 

The energy was surging forth, billowing and warping the battlefield, boiling the lazy river and melting the slides that circled above them. It was getting closer, and closer, threatening to overtake his own prone form. 

But he couldn&#39;t die...not after that speech. It was his one moment...his one chance...to be cool.

A shimmer in the air. A subtle puff as mass is taken up. The spreading heat from Lancer&#39;s blast reaches out to caress and mulch his form, only to furl against something. It even sizzles as it curls around some form of wall dividing it from its prey...a shield? An invisible shield?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sword bounced uselessly to the side, now just another object on the ground.

Other such objects melted in the face of Lancer’s fiery wrath. People screamed, shouted, and panicked as the two began their deadly assaults. There were few people in the immediate area who had run at the first sign of conflict. No chance in hell that innocents got hurt, at least.

So long as they knew what was best and stayed the <em>hell</em> away. 

As for Nikolai himself, he instead reached for the previously mentioned umbrella. With two hands firmly on the handle, it came free from its stand with little difficulty. He moved his grip upward and brought the length of the umbrella perpendicular to him.

<strong>RIINNNNNGGGG</strong>

The shady part snapped away from the main shaft and was promptly discarded. It would have to do, despite being the last thing he wanted. The other Servant was too fast, and Simon had disappeared from his sight. Unless he posed a threat, it was best to leave him be to wallow in self-pity. 

“<strong>Child! Run!</strong>”

With his declaration, he slowly approached the Servant, makeshift staff at the ready. It felt flimsy in his hands, but a blow would sting all the same. He aimed the broken-off side towards the girl and jabbed a few times, to gage her own speed and to avoid the pools of liquid heat that bubbled and sizzled on the ground.

The reek of sulfur and brimstone was added to the already muddled mix of scents. This was one-hundred-percent worse than before, without a doubt.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Bothersome.” Grendel’s Mother’s hands and face began to morph into something more terrible. “You care little about involving others in this feud. Something meant for only our parties.” As Saber spoke, Nikolai jumped into action. Stabbing a makeshift spear, barely managing to puncture her skin, all the while the Servant didn’t give a reaction. At least that’s what seemed to happen until her clawed hand shot out, gripping the weapon and yanking Nikolai forwards.

Perhaps if your legs weren&#39;t so ugly. You have such hideous toes.&quot;</strong>

...What?

There was no time to ponder what grotesqueness had just came from the dragon&#39;s maw, as he was already moving into action once more, reaching out to snatch Nikolai before he could come too close to the flame. It marked an evident difference between the pairs, one pair ruled by dysfunction and unable to work together, the other--

<strong>&quot;KNEEL TO YOUR GOD!&quot;</strong>

--Ryujin proceeded to launch Nikolai like a javelin, sending the mercenary careening towards Grendel&#39;s Mother. It seemed that, upon further inspection, neither team was particularly inclined to any kind of advanced cooperation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seemed like Saber was doing more than well on her own, though for how long, who was to say. 

<em>I can&#39;t just stand by, but last time I just ended up in the way...maybe it&#39;ll be enough if I can at least distract them...</em> 

Fishing in his pocket, Simon recovers a gemstone, his own shield melting away and reforming around the object, the boy using his rather unremarkable presence to try and reposition himself. Nikolai thought he was doing him a favor...telling him to run away. But without Saber, he&#39;s nothing...defenseless and completely cut off from the world. Even if she hated him for it, he had to at least try to help. If she died...he might as well die, too. 

If anything, Ryujin was the true threat for Saber. That blast was enough to convince Simon that they were dealing with more than the average Servant. Ryujin...based off his studies, Simon knew him to be a more benevolent figure. A water deity of Japan...so why he was blasting such devastating heat he&#39;d have to figure out on his own time. 

Simon sends the bubble floating through the arena, soaring above Saber and Nikolai, and positioning itself above Ryujin. If he can grab Lancer&#39;s attention, maybe Saber can deal a blow...

&quot;I&#39;m not going to run! This...this is all I can do! It&#39;s all I&#39;m meant to do! And I&#39;ll show you the extent of that!&quot; 

A nice shout never hurt anyone, Simon gasping and releasing the Jewel from its floating prison. A Single crimson raindrop falls lazily through the air amidst the spray from the battle, lightly cracking itself against Ryujin&#39;s hide. Of course, that was merely the shell, as evidenced from the pale blue rays that shone through, mist unfurling from the chasis and signaling the arrival of a crystalline sword, aiming to pierce straight through Lancer. Aiming to, of course.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Both servants showing they could care less about the health or safety of their masters. 

“<strong>I Refuse too.</strong>” Saber spoke, a clawed hand knocking the body of Nikolai to the side. Causing her to stumble slightly from his sheer mass. She then lurched forwards. 

Her Form becoming more akin to a woman. As water from the surrounding water park began to raise up. Just as Simon’s own attack came into view. 

The boy… perhaps wasn’t worthless. 

A quick move of her hands and water began to flood forth. Dousing the flames which Ryujin had covered the area with. “Now drown, false sea serpent. Like the rest of this forsaken world.” The water quickly began to pool around lancer’s feet, before its temperature began to drop. Lower. And lower. Looking to freeze the snake in place.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

First, the lass physically lifted and <em>threw</em> Nikolai at Lancer.

Lancer, thankfully, caught him. Death by flame was not the fate for this day. However, instead of being positioned feet down, his body grew parallel to the ground instead. What was—

Oh. <strong>Oh.</strong>

Well, no use to flounder around. He was the weapon of choice for Ryujin? So be it. He still had his makeshift spear. With the speed he flew, it would surely create a hole into her gut. He aimed the lance and—

Flew to the side. He unbalanced her, but she was still a Servant. It was only slightly trivial to simply push him to the side during his flight. 

The landing sucked. Not painful, but he looked rather silly as he slid and rolled to a stop a few meters away. At least he didn’t land in any of the molten material, which still groaned and spewed embers not far away.

As he stumbled to his feet, Nikolai considered his options. The enemy Servant proved to be annoying and out of his league. Lancer, if given the chance, would not be as helpful either. Or, rather, he’d do literally <em>anything</em> to get the upper edge. 

That left Simon, a literal child, as the best target. Ugh.

Ryujin could handle himself against the cold and water. He was a dragon <em>and</em> a water god, right? He’d just use it to his advantage.

With heavy heart, Nikolai trudged foward, careful to not step into any of the puddles of magma. Simon couldn’t have gotten far, and if his own declaration was anything to go by, he had no intention to change that. 

As he approached the last place he heard Simon, he steadied his breaths. Violence would do little more than get that Servant on his ass and a sword shoved into his throat. Steady nerves and a clear mind would do more than rash actions and mindless rage.

And a shakey metal rod would ruin any attempt at intimidation. Why wouldn’t it stay still? 

“<strong>Simon! Last. Chance.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>SCHK!</em> Simon&#39;s crystalline blade fired from below, landing between the chitinous plating of Ryujin and stabbing into his flesh. His eyes went wide with surprise as his body froze. That pipsqueak was actually capable of fighting? What a shock.

Such a shock that the dragon was caught-off guard by the surge of water. For a moment, he was entirely consumed by the rushing wave, dragged beneath the surface by the sheer strength of it. Yet as the water grew thinner in preparation for Saber&#39;s trap, Ryujin would never reappear. Even when the water got so low as to only be up to the knees, he was still gone.

Saber was able to catch the beast off guard. And it was all thanks to him. 

Is this what pride felt like? That spreading warmth that tickled his toes as Simon slowly crawled back to his feet? He watches Saber in motion, noting the glide of her feet as it almost seemed like she was dancing on top of the water, while the stone-hearted reptile sank beneath the surface, weighed down by its own callousness. He had helped Saber reach this position of advantage, a fact he wouldn&#39;t let slip away from him today. 

But he wasn&#39;t the only Master in this battle. He had been a weapon wielded by two Servants. A blunt tool that aimed to set about carving the battle with its chisel in hand. His hulking frame and ragged breath eclipsed the battle behind him, skewer in hand with piercing intent flashing behind the crimson veil of his goggles. This was a Holy Grail War, after all. The outcome not decided by the will of age-worn warriors, but of their successors. 

&quot;...I told you,&quot; the boy begins, drawing himself up, fighting the steel anchors of trepidation that attempt to bind his feet in place. His mouth dries, and the boy fights through swallowing his own tongue as he takes in all of Nikolai, gripping his jeans tightly to keep him from seeing his slick palms. &quot;I can&#39;t leave...I can&#39;t back out. If I do...<strong>I might as well die right now.</strong>&quot; 

He would lose. Facing Nikolai was tantamount to suicide. To leave would be the same. 

Simon raises a hand, a faint image of an orb coalescing before firing at Nikolai, aiming for his hands. No sooner had it left did the boy start running, the shackles of fear giving way to the drive of survival that pushed him through the cracked battlefield, his wartorn audience of anthropomorphic hotdogs and cartoon innertubes cheering him on as they lay, popped and treaded husks amidst the carnage. Simon shot two more shots of air, one splashing chlorine water against his face and the other colliding with his shoulder.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was hope for the boy. Even if it required more testing to pull from him. Simon could be worthwhile. The Matriarch thought to herself summoning her silver blade into her hands. 

An ancient piece of metal. Graced by the forgotten words of giants. “Serpent.” Saber spoke with force. “Did you need to shed your skin before we reconvened?

Before he could get another step in, Nikolai was pelted with an orb. Magecraft. It did little to perturb the massive man, and he felt it even less. His grip was far too strong, and the pole stayed in his hands.

What was more annoying, however, was the fact that Simon<em>ran</em>. Nikolai started to chase after the boy, unbothered by the spray of chlorine and unfazed by the shot aimed at his shoulder. An unstoppable force, with any amount of momentum, would not stop for parlor tricks.

And even worse, he seemed to get <em>larger</em>. The gap closed little by little, yes, but he seemed bigger than before. Armor once more pushed to its very limits as his footsteps shook the very ground. 

Simon would soon learn a very unfun fact about objects with large amounts of weight and a forcibly increased speed, carried by the inhuman strength granted from his Origin: they tended to get faster. Especially when they continued in a straight path. 

Except Nikolai didn’t have any intention of a wild goose chase. His arms arched back, pole now perpendicular to the ground. With all his might, it flew forward and right towards Simon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The ice underneath Grendel&#39;s Mother&#39;s feet erupted, shards of frozen shrapnel being flung high into the air. She would barely have the time to process what had just occurred before talons grasped her by the neck, sickle-like claws digging into her flesh.

It was, doubtlessly, Ryujin, and it would only take one look down to see what he had done - there was a massive hole, a tunnel bored straight upward. He had managed to dig a hole that quickly? Impossible! Even a servant could balance sheer power and accuracy so efficiently! But then, how? How did--

<strong>&quot;Save your insults for one who cares to hear them, Saber.&quot;</strong>

Mustering all their might, they tossed Saber across the food court, sending her crashing into the vending machines, which crumpled under such force. Meanwhile, Lancer hovered their way down to the ground, taking the time to pluck Simon&#39;s gem sword from his neck, as one might remove a splinter.

The not-so-rapid depths took Simon beneath the gently rolling waves, the boy only staring wide eyed through the chlorine-infused current, debating whether he should even resurface. He reaches into his coat pocket once more, pulling out the gemstones of his namesake and carefully holding two in his hands. The need to hyperventilate was strong, but unless he wanted to taste burning waters as they eat at his inner lung, this would have to wait. 

Two small geysers erupt from the water as two bubbles take to the air, knocking themselves against the brickwork of the river and releasing two more crystalline swords towards Nikolai. Simon himself surfaces shortly after, taking a large gulpful of clean oxygen as he let&#39;s the current try and take him away from Nikolai.

The snake burrowed. With an impressive speed to match his pace. She simply spit into his face in an act of defiance. Before being tossed towards the concessions like a doll a child was tired of playing with. A vending machine thankfully cushioned her throw, like a kind metallic catcher. But her collected materials… were utterly ruined by Lancer’s throw. 

The Matriarch began to stand, pulling herself from a bath in a multitude of sticky and sweet fluids. Flavored from DR. Beppy to MAGTA. “Simple. I <em>was</em> a Goddess. One more ancient than that pathetic Drake you claim to be, snake. You simply reside within the sea. I. Am. The Sea. Lost to time, my name is <strong>Gabia</strong>.” Her name was spoken true and loud, something which her own spiritual core had to reach for. 

Grendel’s Mother then drew her blade once more. “You talk too much. And say so little. For a false god.”A portal then opened to her side as a giant clawed hand shot forth. “Perhaps you do not deserve the gift of speech.” Going to smack lancer right towards Saber where she would deliver the final blow. Aiming to sever the head from Ryujin in one swift and brutal blow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead, he stayed below the depths as Nikolai approached. Forget the broken fixture, he’d end this facade with his bare hands. There was zero doubt that it’d do the job and then some. 

However, that idea was cut short. Water flew from the air, and pockets burst forth. From them, two crystalline swords appeared. Ready to skewer him where he stood. 

Unfortunately, these two swords would stand little chance against him. As they flew towards their mark, he swung his arm to intercept. While his arm received a nasty gash, fragments of glass and dust scattered across the concrete. He barely felt the marks either, a sting that ran along his arm.

“<strong>Cute,</strong>” he said. He bunched his knees and cleared the gap between the edge and the center of the lazy river. Various obstacles swamped the island, but Simon looked to be vaguely trapped in the waters as well. Said medium would slow him down, plenty enough for Nikolai to close the distance. 

“<strong>Give. Up.</strong>”

He navigated the awkward surroundings, and soon enough reached Simon&#39;s location. A terrifying sight indeed; the kind one would experience in a nightmare.

If only it was. 

The goliath kneeled down and jumped into the water. As if a pallet of concrete had been chucked into the water, he stood tall and strong. A steady drip of crimson tainted the waters, and dissolved into the mix. He extended his hands and slowly pushed against the current, which carried Simon. 

There was barely any room between the two, thanks to Nikolai’s comparatively unimpeded path. Would the child fight, or perish like a dog?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Stay away from me! I&#39;m not. Giving. Up!&quot; A flush of adrenaline and emotion pulses through the boy, his arms stretching back and throwing a string of jewels into the river between them. All of them. A flash of light beneath the water reveals a line a of swords rising from the depths, each pulsing and waiting to slice through the flowing wind to gouge and let blood flow freely from their mark.

Ah, it felt good to do away with silliness, didn&#39;t it? Like stretching one&#39;s limbs after a long slumber. The mistruth of his name had been a convenient tool, but it had lost its purpose. After all, there was nothing left for him to hide! 

Saber, likely seeking to end the battle decisively, charged him, a clawed hand emerging from one side to strike him while the ogress herself attacked directly. A two-pronged attack, was it? Was this the most strategy that a lesser monster could offer? How disappointing. Now, time to put this fiend in her place underneath his heel...

<strong>&quot;But, you may refer to me as [AZHI DAHAKA].&quot;</strong>

In that instant, magical energy swelled forth from within Zahhak, not quite a true name release, but certainly similar to one. The change was immediately, as his right arm was cloaked in an inky black cocoon, not unlike the one he was summoned from. However, unlike that slow hatching, this evolution was immediate - in a instant, the arm nearly tripled in size, before bursting out of its chrysalis fully formed, a far more ghastly and brutal limb than before.

It was, simply put, Armageddon. Apocalypse. Catastrophe. Calamity.

Despite its absurd size, Zahhak wielded it as effortlessly as his typical arm. Slowly, they extended a single talon, what would typically be the index finger, before moving it. Effortlessly, it poked the encroaching arm, and with a single prod, it sent the limb flying back to the portal from whence it came. Likewise, it came to deflect Saber&#39;s blade, and with a single tap, it felt as though Grendel&#39;s Mother was struck by indescribable force, so much so that she one again found herself flying backwards, only this time to crash through the remains of the vending machine, through the wall behind it, and through several more walls for good measure.

This was the power of the end of all things.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Announcing his true name and discarding the facade of ‘Ryujin’ for the name Zahhak. A fallen goddess of the seas, faced with the terrible serpent of Angra Mainyu. Dragon or not, she was still determined to skin this serpent and add it to her collection. 

That was the plan. Until the force of apocalypse crashed headlong meeting little resistance from the sea. 

Her child’s limb was tossed away uselessly. While Grendel’s Mother raised her blade. Only to be met with an overwhelming force. The new limb of Zahak sent her flying. Tumbling through the vending machines remains, and through many many walls. It was decisive in their current battle.  

When the matriarch’s flight finally ceased she was meters away. Now standing in the midst of the lazy River. Eyes still remaining locked onto the form of Zahak. 

Blood dripped from her forehead. Boiling the nearby water. Causing steam to rise up around her body. In her periphery, the fight between Nikolai and Simon continued. The boy was at a severe disadvantage, and it would be a shame to have him die. At this moment and in these circumstances at least. “<strong>Zahhak</strong>, Serpent.” Saber yelled, while her free hand raised up drawing water from the lazy River around her. It began to crystallize around her. “Do not think this means I won’t be after your hide anymore.” Her hand then forcibly shot forth. Sending a torrent of ice and water towards Lancer not looking to strike the snake but to rather block him off and keep him separated from his master. Saber herself was now poised to intervene.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was all he needed to end this silly game. Once the boy was in his grasp, it would be all too easy to get what he wanted: a declaration of surrender and a drop out from the tournament. Nothing more, nothing less. So long as he could ignore the sinister voice in his head, things would be fine.

One more second passed. Inches away, he surged forward.

Ultimately, the gigantic man got lucky. Lucky to have noticed the ring of swords that appeared from thin air. The bestial instict took over, if only for a fraction of a second. Skin condensed, toughened into one more close to the thick hide of a bear. 

But the swords stayed still. A threat, perhaps? Or a warning? And the way they danced in the air...

He swung his arm into the blades, yet his limb shimmered through the crystal weapons. Once more, he swung. Once again, he missed. No, not missed, that didn&#39;t describe it well. Nikolai should&#39;ve felt the glass shatter and crumble to dust. Fill the lazy river, fill the air itself.

This trickery wasn&#39;t fun. As soon as these went away, Simon would be absolutely <em>decimated</em>. Thus, he swung again and again. What was the trick here?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 04:27 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The swords seemed to dance and morph around his attacks. Fading and rippling along with the water, a dance between his attacks and their edges leaving neither harmed. 

They had never been in front of him. 

<em>Plip. Plip.</em> 

Blood clouds the water around Simon&#39;s waist as it falls from his nose, the boy leaning against the debris behind him, splayed along the scaled ridges, his eyes dimming. Whatever happened next...he could at least say he tried. Pride felt good...

As Simon fell unconcscious, his body held halfway in the red cloud, his true power revealed itself, as the image of the swords slowly faded away, replaced only by the pain of being struck by a shard of glass from above. And another. And another. The swords had been above him, Nikolai having attacked a mere image, a reflection crafted by the boy&#39;s shields. Something that, while amateurish and miniscule, had drained the boy&#39;s energy quickly. He was wide open for an attack, only after Nikolai bears the full brunt of a hailstorm made of piercing swords.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038257228190339162 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038257228190339162><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 11:03 AM">11:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The wall of ice appeared in front of him, barring the path that his destruction had just made. What a laughable effort! Did Saber truly believe that this would be enough to halt him? That he could be stopped? What a hilarious joke!

Except it wasn&#39;t funny.

<strong>And Zahhak wasn&#39;t laughing.</strong>

<em><strong>He was furious.</strong></em>

<em>SMASH!</em> His engorged claw slammed into the barricade of frost, the sheer might causing many layers of it to immediately crumble. However, even his unrelenting power could not break such a dense shield. It appeared that Saber had bought herself a few precious seconds of--

<em>SmashsmashsmashsmashSMASHSMASHSMASH!</em> Without warning, more and more cracks raced through the barrier, causing it to shatter like falling dominoes. However, Zahhak had not touched it since the first blow - it seemed as though the ice was destroying itself! In the blink of an eye, all of that ice was reduced to little more than slush and snow, and the dragon&#39;s path was once again impeded.

It appeared that Saber had bought herself <em>a</em> precious second of relief, and nothing more.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite his young age, there was a trick up his sleeve that not even he could figure out.

Perhaps it was better to describe the massive man as the bumbling child, unaware of the world he was in.

Only did he realize this as the first sword pierced his armor. A sharp pain into his shoulder, as a sword found its mark. By the second, only then did he look up. 

He was barely fast enough to shatter the third. 

Oh, how foolish he had looked. An absolute <em>idiot</em> to not realize the play. To be bested by such an immature opponent, one so young and naive made his blood <em>boil</em>. 

Despite the grey concrete and blue water, the world turned red. Labored breaths escaped his lips, and rushed out from his helmet. His body grew in size, much larger than the last few times. His armor, unable to hold in the increased mass, frayed and teared at the seams; more black hidden beneath the cloth.

The boy wanted to think himself clever? No matter. As the swords shook in their newfound holsters, and soaked the river in even more red, he pulled his fist back. The limb shook in place, and shot forward with the force of a cannon ball.

Right towards a now unconscious Simon. Nikolai had given the beast an inch, and it planned to run a marathon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A clawed hand met the force of Nikolai’s punch. Pulling the beast forwards, bringing them into an uncomfortable intimacy. “Such power. All you do is just let the beast control you. Pitiful.” The claw then began to close tightly around the fist. Ripping into the barely human skin Nikolai was beginning to show. 

“I shall just kill you and save you from misery.” A sword appeared within her free hand. An elegant piece of craftsmanship. Something only the most seasoned centurion would wield. With a swift motion it was forced upwards, going to skewer the mercenary before driving him deep into the water that remained of the lazy River.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As he emerged through the break in the wall, it only took a second for the dragon to spot Grendel&#39;s Mother, and only a second longer for him to act. Once again, his grotesque arm reared back before shooting forth, rending claws seeking to shred Saber to ribbons.

The Servant had decided to step in for her Master finally. Only when the child was truly in danger did she see the need to try and help. The most pitiful of all Servant types: the Arrogant. Did she not realize that without the boy, she was no better than dead?

She did, but not in a truly cognizant way. Insults were thrown his way, yet they meant little to Nikolai. At most, it was a pot that called the kettle black. As she maneuvered themselves closer and conjured a sword from thin air, he took back the reins on his emotions.

If only by the skin of his teeth.

“<strong>Have. Control.</strong>”

His muscles stayed bulged, and he lifted his foot high off the ground. In slow, confident movements, he drove his boot right into the side of the woman&#39;s knee. With his free hand, he tried to position it behind her elbow and pushed as hard as his tendons would physically let him go. 

Finally, he threw his entire body into hers. A makeshift shove that would do little more than buy himself time. He could see and hear the cries of Lancer as he tried to claim his quarry. Better to try and let him deal with the Servant rather than try himself. 

So long as he did not perish to her immediate strike, Zahhak would finish the job and then some. Already did his skin once again bunch together, and his entire muscular system prepare for the sword strike that had yet to penetrate his flesh. 

Or rather, that probably would penetrate his flesh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If only for a brief moment. “So you do have control.” Saber spoke with a slight bit of surprise. Body still tensed and ready to unleash every bit of energy when Nikolai gives her just an inch. 

But in his moment of clarity the strain of the man’s muscles increased. Focused entirely on his survival. 

The entirety of his body weight was forced into Grendel’s Mother. Sending them both back into the water of the lazy River. All the while Zahak roared towards them both. 

The Matriarch used this to her advantage. No longer holding the blade threatening to pierce through Nikolai. Her legs were poised right at his abdomen, and with a swift push upwards aided by a shift in the currents. Placing the opposing master right in the path of Armageddon which Lancer wrought. 

With being freed from struggle she was now able to collect her master. While fog began to cover saber and Simon’s escape.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His shove worked well. Too well, if anything. As they tumbled into the waters, he himself was shoved back upwards. Right into the path of Zahhak. They collided into one giant mess, and Nikolai collided with the curb of the concrete.

All the air in his lungs rushed out while his momentum carried him over the lip. Breathless and unaware of how Zahhak positioned himself to further the chase, he focused on his breaths.

In. Out. In. Out. Steady, now. Steady…

That was too close. Far too close. He had almost lost the battle. He was better than that. Had to be better than that. If it happened now, then every single action since that day was for nothing. 

Nikolai could not— <strong>would not</strong>— settle for that. He had to find her. Find Sapphire. Try to right his wrong, any way possible.

Then. Then, he could die in peace.

Slowly, he rolled over. Careful not to fall back over the edge, he took stock of what occured in the last few moments. Lancer surely eviscerated that bitch of a Servant, right?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not dead. Gone.

A more persistent hunter might have tried to give chase to the wounded prey, to exhaust them of what little energy they had left, to deal the killing blow. They were already on the verge of destruction, so close to their fated death. It would have been so easy to gnash them between his teeth and to swallow their remains...

If only he had the magical energy.

Like a balloon deflating, his enhanced arm burst, excess flesh fading away in a shimmer of magical energy as his original arm, swollen and bruised, returned to its place. Suppressing a scream of pain, Lancer fell to their knees, clutching the overexerted limb with his well hand as he took deep breaths, sucking air as though his life depending on it.

He&#39;d came up short. And so close to the end, too. Tch.

No matter.

They had nevertheless won.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
