A testament to the hubris and arrogance of humanity. It was a monolith that lead to the collapse of the original humans, and lead to the creation of multiple languages around the world.

Gatsby sipped his large thermos of coffee as he stared up at it. Did it really take only a thirty story building to reach God? What did that make the Empire State Building?

Was it wrong for him to be a little unimpressed?

&quot;Do we have to do this? Maybe Nimrod&#39;s Master is a nice individual who doesn&#39;t know what happens to the Tower. Maybe if we explain it to them nicely, they&#39;ll tear it down? 

The Tower of Babel&#39;s fate had been etched into this world from the moment of its creation. Gatsby, like any good American, had read the Bible. The Tower of Babel was a risk that invoked the wrath of God, so it had to go.

Yet Paganini&#39;s expression was one of war. He would tear this Noble Phantasm apart, brick by brick, stone by stone, if need be.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="24-Oct-22 06:36 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Paganini was not the same individual from before. Normally, he would simply rage about this tower being higher than he was, but now, it was personal. Curses flowed through his veins, slowly but surely.

The Tower of Babel, which invited humanity as a whole to reach closer to heaven. Bah! That did not matter. Humanity did not matter. There was only one&#39;s self, and that was all.

&quot;A tower that is disconnected from the sins of the ground? Interesting.&quot;

As interesting as the floating tower was, there was no elegant solution to entering it. It was dozens of meters off the ground!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was against the law, and he would never break the law. Sometimes.

The pair were left alone for a few minutes longer before the King graced them with his presence.

The doors were thrust open and Nimrod stepped out onto the top of the staircase. His gaze looked down onto the two trespassers below. It was filled with two things: rage and disgust.

Paganini’s intentions of playing a flashy orchestra paid off. It was near impossible to miss the impact the violinist left on the bottom of the tower, after all. Lea emerged from behind Nimrod, still sloppily dressed and yawning as she looked below the staircase.

Nimrod’s disposition was anything but pleased, but he was never pleased anyways. At least never when addressing her. Though, one look following Nimrod’s gaze proved his irritation was well-justified—

“Trespassers? Did you just call them trespassers?! Finally!”

Although, in contrast to Nimrod’s disdain, his Master seemed to meet the pair of Servants with an irregular enthusiasm.

Undismissably irregular when considering her defenseless state. She had no weapon in her person, and her striped green pajamas indicated just how short of a time had passed since she woke up, disturbed by the noise.

For all intents and purposes, she should have been in immense danger, and yet she met the potential threats with excitement.

“Someone who wants to skip talking and break stuff? Perfect by me! I’ve been itching for <em>some</em> action for the last few days now. I can’t hold myself back anymore. Ah, do you two mind if I go get my weapons?”

On top of that, when considering her audacity…

It was a miracle that a King as self-proud as the Berserker that ruled over the tower had managed to uphold a contract with this woman at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The musician didn&#39;t even glimpse at Lea as his gaze met the king.

What an arrogant soul, this man. Speaking as if he had dominion over everything just because he had a massive tower. Paganini glanced around the ornately detailed room. No televisions, no mansions, nothing. This tower had none of the luxuries of Gatsby&#39;s mansion. Once Nimrod installed cable, maybe then he would have the right to talk in such an arrogant manner.

Oh, what rage he was feeling. Oh, what passion was brimming!

&quot;You believe there are no miracles in this world? How do you believe you were summoned? I am a violinist so talented that I was blessed by God and Lucifer himself!&quot; Paganini boasted back at Nimrod.

It was originally the audiences that believed him to be corrupted, but what did the audience matter, now? Nothing else mattered but <em>him</em> thanks to Zahhak&#39;s interference with his Saint Graph.

&quot;This Tower of Babel is a mistake. You are Nimrod, yes? Vaunted king who strove to reach God? You will not reach him. He will not answer you. You are a fool. I recommend suicide, you utter nimrod.&quot;

Paganini spat venom at the king. Despite his boasting, it was clear that there was nothing that connected Paganini to God. He was a rabid dog, and there was only one thing to do to dogs in the eyes of the king as generous as Nimrod:

Put them down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thinking quickly, he twisted his collapsed form into something that could be considered a sort of bow.

&quot;Your Majesty, I am Jay Gatsby.&quot; The bowed man said, kneeling towards Nimrod. To the king, it was clear that this was a Servant as well. However, compared to Paganini and Nimrod, this Servant was nominally third rate. If anything, he was more comparable to a human than a Servant. What was this &#39;Gatsby&#39; fellow?

Rising, Gatsby caught the eye of Lea. He looked at her hard, before sighing and looking up to stairwell above. It was clear what his eyes were saying: <em>go now, this will be ugly.</em>

&quot;I must confess, as a devout Christian, that I know your tale well. However, as many times as I read that story, I will never be as knowledgeable on the subject of the Tower of Babel as you. Your Majesty, you, well, <em>you lived it</em>!&quot; 

Gatsby said, wondering if it was rude to drink coffee in the presence of the king. He decided not to.

&quot;But you of all people must know what happened to the Tower of Babel when you first built it. If that were to happen again, it could be a disaster for Alexandria.&quot;

The first was a feral dog trapped in the class of insanity much like the King, not that the King would ever see himself that way. Neither were on his level but the second of the two was particularly insignificant barely worth a mention. Simply stepping on the bug would crush it. A dog and a bug wishing to defeat a King. Perhaps it could make for a good story but the reality was quite impossible. A slight chuckle escaped his lips; it was admittedly quite hilarious to him.

Lea’s excitement fell as the three Servants initiated dialogue. More than that, though… all of the present figures mostly ignored her presence, including her own Servant.

That kind of annoyed her.

Even if, when observing the situation for what it is, it should be obvious that an improperly dressed, ill-prepared Master still in her pajamas would be much less of a concern than the king that ruled over a construct as meaningful as the Tower of Babel.

The desire to be the center of everyone’s attention, in spite of her lack of merits, was Lea’s hubris.

When she wasn’t given that, she responded with an ugly showing of frustration and apathy.

Fine then. If they wouldn’t pay attention to her, she’d <em>make</em> them.

— A red glow chained the battle-ready Nimrod.

An unbelievably petty use of a Command Seal as the Master vanished behind the door, off to her quarters.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nimrod was simply going to kill Paganini and him! There was no reason to even bother trying to grovel for his life or open a dialogue with the king. To be fair, they had essentially broken into the Tower of Babel and messed with the king&#39;s stuff.

And yet... Nimrod was simply so aloof about the entire exchange. Nimrod thought he could deal with God&#39;s wrath? The delusion of a man who had hung onto a dream for so long that it had become a nightmare.

&quot;Old sport... No, you aren&#39;t worth being called &#39;old sport&#39; anymore. You are an arrogant fiend who attempts to hold hope in your palm. I am thankful for you giving everyone life. That does not give you authority to do it again!&quot;

Then, Lea snapped. Gatsby instinctively turned to the release of magical energy and gaped at Lea. &quot;You...&quot; Gatsby sputtered. &quot;He was already going to <em>kill</em> us, you poorly dressed salad! What does wasting a Command Spell prove?&quot;

Lea ran off, and Gatsby groaned. Could he and Paganini defeat Nimrod on their own? Paganini was at a disadvantage, but his rage and Noble Phantasm might be able to close the gap with the King of Shinar.

&quot;I am going after the Master, old sport.&quot; Gatsby said to Paganini, squeezing the man&#39;s shoulder as he glanced at the door Lea had left through. 

The door that had Nimrod blocking the way. 

Joy.

&quot;Time to represent the Roaring Twenties. Let&#39;s boogie.&quot; Gatsby muttered as he sprinted towards the door as quickly as he could.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="26-Oct-22 04:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This man who believed himself to be some sort of savior was completely delusional. There was only one person who could truly save the world.

That person just so happened to have a taste for coffee overflowing with milk and sugar. That person was also trying to run past one of the oldest kings in human history.

Without wasting a moment, Paganini strummed a violent tune that inspired awe. To Nimrod, it sounded like the proud procession or coronation of a king as noble as himself. To Paganini, it sounded like Caprice #16.

A shockwave of sound followed Paganini&#39;s playing, giving Gatsby a boost towards the door while pushing against Nimrod&#39;s massive frame.

&quot;<strong>If you are the king of the land, then I am left with two options: kill you, or myself. </strong>&quot;

Paganini kicked off the floor towards Nimrod.

&quot;<strong>There is only one person who can save this world, and you are NOT him! You cannot even compare!</strong>&quot;

The shockwave that followed from Paganini&#39;s playing was only the start, as the musician continued strumming his violin as he prepared to go in for a brutal sideways swing on King Nimrod.

He turned back and shouted at her as she ran off. With wording that vague her command seal served as more of a demerit than anything. &#39;The verge of death&#39; which meant he couldn&#39;t actually straight up kill them. She had invertedly limited his own movements. He would have to punish her over this blunder first albeit her command seal had given him some extra strength at least. Still had she forgotten who her servant was, he hardly needed a power boost to deal with these two. He once again prepared to move in on the two he really couldn&#39;t let them leave now even if he wanted to but he was once again stopped as the dog released a note. It was a nice tune actually until the shock wave was released and he was pushed a single step back. It did hinder his movements but with his high strength it would be difficult to stop his large frame from moving forward. He thrust his sword as Gabtsy went past aimed to cut straight through his legs. Quickly though Paganini came in with a follow up attack catching him off guard well it should of

His arm has suddenly shot out grabbing ahold of the violinists forearm with enough force to crush it. Nimrod was a Hunter as well as a King and he had the eyes to show for it. His skill &#39;Might Hunter in the Sight of the Lord&#39; had been in effect. He was able to predict his opponents opening move and prepare an adequate defence. A hunter always remains a step ahead of its prey. Having caught his foe midair he was able to limit his number of options and could deliver an optimal strike. Holding his sword like a knife he thrusted it at his opponents stomach.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="27-Oct-22 08:57 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gatsby&#39;s exclamation was on-point. Nimrod&#39;s frustrations were justified. The Command Seal did nothing but restrict her own Servant&#39;s movements. 

Understanding that the Master used it in such a manner <em>intentionally</em> was the perfect cherry on top. She would rather hold back her own Servant than continue letting him overshadow her.

&quot;Warfare&#39;s all about the glory, baby! I can&#39;t have that be stolen. That&#39;d be no fun!&quot;

So she&#39;d steal whatever &#39;glory&#39; she could from Nimrod instead, without ever pausing to think about whether or not she deserved it. 

Though, at the very least, Lea wasn&#39;t dumb enough to fight without a weapon. Not only would it needlessly increase the risk of death, she also wanted to test her dearest toy out in a real-time fight.

So the question remained how quickly Gatsby could catch up to her, after maneuvering around Nimrod&#39;s blade. At the very least though, she hoped to make it back to her room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As soon as he cleared Nimrod&#39;s weapon, he would be able to follow his Master to her room. Scandalous! 

It was likely that Gatsby wasn&#39;t even going to stop by the Tower of Babel Giftshop™️ if he got past Nimrod. Therefore, it was up to the King of Shinar to stop this third-rate Servant.

As the blade was thrust out at Gatsby, Nimrod noticed that his sword was quickly being covered by writing.

<em>The sword of the King of Shinar, Nimrod, Lord of Babel. A symbol of war and arrogance against God.</em>

Quickly, the writing changed:

<em>The sword of the King of Shinar, Nimrod, Lord of Babel. A symbol of peace and prosperity, in which nobody under its reign was harmed.</em>

As the weapon got near Gatsby, a mysterious force began to push it away from him. No matter what Nimrod did with the sword, it refused to do harm to Gatsby.

&quot;Excuse me, old sport. <strong>Enjoy the shield! Sword... thing?</strong>&quot; Gatsby said as he hopped over Nimrod&#39;s weapon and scampered after Lea, disappearing from sight.

&quot;Who cares about glory in combat? It&#39;s an outdated concept where people could feel good about sticking themselves with pointy sticks! You want glory, then do something that <strong>warrants</strong> it.&quot;

Gatsby puffed after Lea as his thermos morphed into a blank novel, and then into a machine gun.

<strong>RADTATATATATATATATAT!</strong>

Bullets that missed Lea ended up spelling out letters or words all over the wall. Was he <em>shooting</em> her with the English alphabet?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nimrod could feel Paganini&#39;s bones giving under the pressure.

Yet Nimrod knew not Paganini&#39;s talent. He was a Demonic Virtuoso, blessed with the power to play any musical instrument under any condition. What was a crushed wrist when your whole body was an instrument? 

Paganini continued playing his violin as Nimrod prepared to lodge the sword into Paganini&#39;s gut.  Despite the grip, Paganini&#39;s hand seemed to ignore the king&#39;s pressure. The musician seemed amused by Nimrod&#39;s plan. No, he seemed <em>unconcerned.</em>

&quot;The best person to save humanity is <em>that man</em> you just failed to kill. There is nobody with greater kindness, or an evil bone in his body. He alone sees the good in every person, even a foolish musician like myself. Even a foolish king like you.&quot;

&quot;Your weapon is a sword. It is a symbol of warfare and conquest. He has made it a symbol of peace and protection. It will block every strike, its original purpose has been <strong>revised</strong>.&quot;

&quot;<strong>And soon, very soon, he will disconnect this world from the concept of sin, and create a world full of light.</strong>&quot;

Paganini&#39;s playing continued to grow in power. The music he was playing was reaching a crescendo. As he reached it, Paganini strummed his violin like an electric guitar.

Magical energy on the level of a Mana Burst blasted out of the violin, knocking Nimrod and Paganini apart.

An orchestra of gunshots and rage began to ring out from within the tower. <em>This</em> was the exact lively atmosphere Lea was looking for. A thrilling exchange with her life on the line. An opportunity that forced you to showcase <em>everything</em> you were capable of. If you met anything short of that, or hell, even if you <em>did</em> meet that gruelling condition, it would mean you forfeit your life. 

“The concept of honoring veterans persisted well after the creation of guns, thank you very much! I’d describe it as underappreciated!”

With not a single ounce of hesitation, Lea continued to dash through the hallway onto her room. There was <em>some</em> distance between herself and Gatsby. Reasonably speaking, it should be enough to allow her to leap into her own room before sustaining any major damage. At least, that’s what she estimated.

Gatsby’s taunts worked surprisingly well. Goading Lea’s battle-hungry nature, it drove her aggression higher. Her response to Gatsby’s challenge, asking her to do something to <em>warrant</em> the glory, was of course to shoot Gatsby herself. If she could get <em>his</em> head, it’d prove to be more than enough of a merit for her first battle ever.

Thinking about what laid after defeating Gatsby, Lea looked backwards with an excited grin.

However, the moment she saw the weapon he decided to morph his novel into, all of that excitement was eradicated away. She understood better than anyone.

No matter how adept a soldier was, it would be impossible to dodge every single bullet from something as rapid-firing as a machine gun. Even if she had been in a more battle-suited state, that fact would not have changed a single bit.

The risk of death, just for an instant, suddenly turned into <strong>guaranteed demise.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035351684328726590 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035351684328726590><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Oct-22 10:37 AM">10:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Wait—“

Her pupils rapidly contracting out of fear, she attempted to jump to the side— where the room to her door was— to dodge out of the way as fast as she could. Any of her previous bravado was difficult to muster up again from such a vulnerable state.

The sudden movement would allow her to steer clear from the bullets, many of them engraving themselves into the walls.

But as to whether or not she could avoid being shot by even a single bullet…

Lea’s intrinsic knowledge conveyed just how optimistic of a wish that was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Allow me to clarify something for you, foolish king: <strong>it does not matter what you think.</strong>&quot; Paganini shrugged apathetically, strumming his violin. As he continued to do so, Nimrod noticed that the violinist&#39;s Saint Graph was stabilizing and growing in power. Soon, the violinist would be on the same level as Nimrod.

Without a sword, that was a dire tiding indeed.

&quot;You will not harm him. I will use your tendons as strings before you get a chance. He doesn&#39;t even know what his own goal is, yet. Yet I saw it in his eyes, Nimrod.&quot; Paganini&#39;s voice became filled with glee and violence. &quot;<strong>Salvation.</strong> For me, for this... <strong>filth</strong> running through my veins. This grotesque form I&#39;ve been given by the masses. The masses can go to hell, for all I care.&quot;

Paganini had, at some point, cared about what people had thought about him. He had relished in their cheers, yet despised them for turning them into a freak. He had been ostracized, and thanks to Zahhak&#39;s Noble Phantasm, he no longer <em>cared</em> about anyone but himself and Gatsby.

He could do whatever he wanted. For the first time in his life, Paganini was free.

&quot;<strong>IL CANNONE GUARNERIUS!</strong>&quot; Paganini roared, blasting a massive cannonball of sound and shockwave towards the king.

Was he baiting her, or had he run out of ammo? Luckily enough, it gave the Master an opportunity to reach her room. 

The sound of a machine gun being reloaded echoed down the hallway. It really was too much for Lea to expect a Servant to run out of ammo, wasn&#39;t it? Especially with Gatsby&#39;s mysterious typewriter-gun/novel/coffee thermos.

&quot;I am not good with weapons. I try to be a pacifist by heart, see.&quot; Gatsby sighed as he checked his weapon&#39;s sights. &quot;Unfortunately, Heroic Spirits don&#39;t get much of a luxury when it comes to fighting. Humans are the same.&quot; 

Gatsby stared at Lea as she continued scampering to her room, as if reading a book. He chuckled and shrugged.

&quot;Ah, well. War isn&#39;t for everyone, old sport. The explosions and honors are a lot more interesting when you read about them. <strong>Experiencing</strong> them? <strong>I would not wish war on even my worst enemy.</strong>

Gatsby held down the fire button as Lea continued to sprint towards her room. She was so close...!

<strong>RADTATATATATATATAT!</strong>

Lea was lucky, as most of the clip seemed to miss her. Thank goodness for low accuracy automatic weapons. Then, she felt the letter <strong>L</strong> carve a gash along her thigh.

An L, indeed...

They were Berserkers after all stuck in their ways. In the same way that Paganini did not care about what Nimrod thought, he did not care about whatever rebuttals the crazed man had for him. He was curious as to what exactly this noble man was planning but the dog was simply parroting what he had been told it was unlikely he knew anything of note. 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Salvation…
</div></div>
Paganini&#39;s growing strength was alarming. He had been insignificant when entering his tower yet now was the King&#39;s equal. Well that was the logical outlook. The King was not logical. Even if his foe greatly surpassed him he would never lose confidence in his victory. He would kill the god; it was a foregone conclusion. The cannonball of sound was released rushing towards him-

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Salvation also comes in death no?
</div></div>
And so he leapt straight forward charging towards it. Gabtsy and Paganini had helped him out with all their talk. &#39;Shield&#39; &#39;Block&#39; &#39;Revise&#39;. One of the Hunter&#39;s greatest strengths is adaptability even if their prey managed to gain the advantage they would use all resources available to them. If his sword had been changed so that he could no longer use it as an unstoppable attack then it would become an impenetrable defence. With the sword held out in front of him like a shield he collided with the cannonball with the intent of pushing straight through. He was unsure on how powerful it&#39;s defence would be but regardless of the level of injury he would continue on. Hopefully Paganini would be surprised by the sudden change in tactics and with the Hunter&#39;s quick speed he quickly closed the distance between them. Lowering his sword and raising a fist he unleashed a straight punch into the musician&#39;s face with his full strength with the intent of knocking the smaller man down onto the ground.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least when it took the form of a machine gun, it did. Lea didn’t expect whatever magical weapon Gatsby held to be confined to just three forms.

That gave her the slightest leeway of time to crash into her room while minimizing injuries. The <strong>L</strong> formed on her leg seemed to remain as a permanent attachment, as though some cartoonish tattoo. A letter by itself reminded her of the alphabet she would learn as a child, but nothing about the lingering pain was child-like. The longer she kept her eyes on what effectively felt like a wound, the more vivid the pain got, so she averted her eyes and began to limp around.

Only after scrambling to grab her weapons did she feel comfortable enough to take a deep breath to try and calm herself down. The distance between herself and the attacking Master granted her a moment’s worth of respite. Though, she wasn’t dumb enough to think it’d last.

The mark on her leg left Lea puzzled. She <em>should</em> still be able to walk, even if awkwardly, but… the bullets that left Gatsby’s gun couldn’t have been meaningless. Was it a form of Magecraft…? It was probably easiest to assume so.

A field of study Lea neglected her entire life. If she had a <em>bit</em> more knowledge on what kind of an ability her pursuer was using, it might have made the fight easier.

Her chest’s beating grew faster and faster. Not just because of the impending danger. Nimrod’s battle was eating up a lot of her mana. The Artificial Circuit wrapped around her heart, the circuit that was given to her in hopes of her growing into an excellent Mage, now firmly grasped onto her heart.

It was scary how close the warmth was. Her blood felt warmer, her head lighter.

—To keep her composure was surprisingly difficult, huh?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035751899770662953 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035751899770662953><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 01:08 PM">13:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Keeping an ear out for footsteps— Lea laid in wait right besides the door. She was armed, as was her opponent. From this point on, effective usage of <u>covers</u> would be crucial to the battle.

To find opportunities to shoot Gatsby while making it difficult for him to shoot Lea. To do so, minimizing the amount of her body that left the door to aim was crucial. More than that, though, to shoot when Gatsby’s attention was off of her.

Though, the distance between her room and Gatsby was small. She only had a few opportunities. Though… Gatsby <em>probably</em> wouldn’t make a dash for her. That put both of them at high-risk, fully open to each other’s gunfire. And each bullet easily held the potential to be lethal if it hit the right spot.

Her knowledge pertaining to combat, in particular, trench warfare, was coming in handy in-application. The issue that remained was…

The mark in her leg that refused to leave.

 <em>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</em>

She should have shot at three, but Lea allowed five. The moment Gatsby took his fifth step, with a nervous gulp, Lea peeked out of the door and aimed her gun.

Her movement was surprisingly proficient. Amateurish, but still practiced. Peeking out of a concealed location to land a shot was something she commonly played with, but… doing it against a real person, who also had a real gun to retaliate it was nerve-wrecking.

In spite of her all her hesitation, her timing was perfect. <u>Right as Gatsby took his fifth step</u>, his attention would have been somewhat diverted to his foot.

Truth be told, it didn’t matter when Lea shot. It was just a small hope that the time when Gatsby would be the most vulnerable was as he finished a step.

A single bullet from her modified gun left, aimed diagonally towards Gatsby’s right leg.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a bumbling brute, Nimrod was no fool. He had already determined the true nature of his own weapon. As the cannonball struck the modified sword, Nimrod felt the weapon absorb the blow extremely well. It was like he was holding a comically thin shield!

Yet it was still a simply shield in the form of a sword. It blocked well, but it could not hope to completely block a Noble Phantasm. Instead of getting hit by a train, it was like getting hit by a double decker bus. His ears rung. It was <em>loud</em>!

Paganini fell as Nimrod struck him. The musician was frail when compared to Nimrod, but Paganini responded by attempting to jab Nimrod in the chin with the neck of the violin.

He folded surprisingly easy for a Heroic Spirit. Nimrod could have flexed, and the bullet would have popped out with barely a scratch. With Gatsby, the bullet did surprising damage, causing the man to collapse in a heap with a grunt.

He did not bleed red, he bled <em>words</em>. Cluttered together, black as night, but still <em>words</em>. No Heroic Spirit bled like that. Paganini did not, Nimrod did not, and Lewis probably did not!

&quot;Ah, drat. I have your number now, though. Are you practiced in airsoft, old sport?&quot; Gatsby grunted as he lodged himself behind a corner, and manifested his machine gun.

Lea inadvertently took in a breath of relief, before quickly ducking again for cover. <u>She <em>could</em> fight back.</u> That was a small source of confidence, at least.

She thought she would enjoy this high-risk situation, where one wrong move would mean her death. She dreamt about it for the longest time. But when actually confronting it, it was difficult to move her body like she wanted to.

“Stop calling me old! I’m still in my twenties, damn it!”

She jested back, but the rampant panic in her voice was evident. In comparison to earlier, when she arrived with not a care in the world behind Nimrod, panic radiated from her wobbly voice.

Her opponent was experienced in gunfights. <strong>She was not.</strong> Hearing him jovially taunt, that realization sank in.

“First time being in one, though!”

She refrained from verbalizing her fear. If she acknowledged it, she felt as though she would become unable to hold herself together. But it was well-implied through her quieter tone.

Both of their legs were stolen. In this type of a high-risk situation, any factor to even out the field in her favor was pleasant. Loading in a new type of bullet, a two-layered exploding type she developed, Lea ducked out of her hiding spot and fired.

But— the second time around, perhaps being influenced by her adrenaline and hasty relief, <u>she made no attempts to aim when Gatsby’s focus was lowest</u>.

A bullet was a bullet nonetheless. Her shot would still be dangerous, but Gatsby would easily be able to avoid it.

The Gunned Bomb, as daftly named as it is, allowed her gun to fire exploding bullets. After hitting the floor upon missing Gatsby, it should still create a small explosion that couldn’t be ignored. All said and done, for this weapon, Gatsby’s attentiveness mattered less than if she would have fired a normal bullet.

But— panic slowly encroached her decision making.

Likely something Gatsby could see, even before Lea’s bullet left the barrel.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Spinning around in the air, the weapon had regained its true purpose.

<strong>Crunch.</strong> Paganini&#39;s nose broke under Nimrod&#39;s fist. Despite the barrage, Paganini did not stop playing the violin sandwiched between Nimrod and himself. In fact, the musician seemed more concerned with playing his piece compared to actually fighting off his attacker. A madman to the end.

Then, Paganini stopped.

Then, the beat dropped.

<strong>TWANG!</strong> Nimrod found himself blasted against the ceiling as Paganini squirmed out from under him, his elongated limbs assisting in the endeavor. 

&quot;Salvation.&quot; Paganini said, pulling a flute out of his pocket. He eyed it, thoughtfully. Then, he pulled his nose back into place, the rest of his face battered and bruised. He grinned.

&quot;<strong>What would you know of salvation?</strong> Did your men feel saved when God struck your tower asunder? Did they feel saved as they slaved to build a tower under a king like you? They <strong>deserved</strong> to be punished, of course. You played into their greed. Their arrogance.&quot;

Paganini snapped the flute in two over his knee, creating a jagged shiv.

&quot;To think their applause meant something, once. I don&#39;t know what you see in them.&quot; Paganini sniffed.

Do not take offense!&quot; Gatsby bellowed as he tapped his leg. That wound was deep, and Paganini was still fighting Nimrod. It was best to conserve mana until it was needed.

He was lucky that Lea and Nimrod both utilized relatively primitive weaponry. If it were something advanced, like a Noble Phantasm, then it would require multiple viewings for Gatsby to wrap his head around.

A gun, for instance, was no biggie. 

As Lea pulled her gun towards Gatsby, his eyes narrowed, and they seemed to glow slightly. Gatsby lacked pupils, and his eyes were hazy and unfocused like a distant light. Were these Mystic Eyes?

Words appeared behind Gatsby and on Lea&#39;s firearms.

<em>An explosion is not a display of violence, power, or force, but of cold. A cold as fierce as New York&#39;s winter, or Chicago&#39;s freeze.</em>

Lea&#39;s bullet fired, landed, and detonated, creating a white blast that blinded both parties. When Lea&#39;s vision cleared, the entire hallway was frozen like a meat locker. Gatsby, meanwhile, was wearing a very fashionable fur coat. He shivered.

&quot;It is better than that Valley of Ash, I suppose.&quot; Gatsby chuckled to himself as he walked directly towards Lea. &quot;Bold. Arrogant. Switching ammo is unique. I like your creativity! If only you weren&#39;t such a war freak.&quot; Gatsby shuddered.

The hallway rumbled as Nimrod and Paganini fought.

&quot;You&#39;re putting a lot on your Servant, ma&#39;am.&quot; Gatsby said carefully. &quot;He really cares about this tower. What will you do with it?&quot;

Gatsby held up his machine gun.

He would never admit it but he was beginning to weaken. His ears were still recovering but they were in good enough condition to figure out the gist of what he was saying as he inspected his sword taking note of how that writing had disappeared.

Nimrod’s tone of voice had changed from before. His words were usually flowing with confidence made as loud as possible for everyone to hear. Now though they were quiet and sharp, cold. Paganini could feel his emotion through them. It was fury. Uptill now the two had simply been a mild annoyance to him. Like a bug he was attempting to stamp out. Now his annoyance had turned to disgust. Paganini’s latest comment had taken things a step too far. He had personally insulted him.

Those men and women were truly just unsatisfied. They weren’t content with what they had. They wanted to reach God, surpass him, become better him and more importantly better themselves. Nimrod would never scorn those who desire to grow and grasp for more. Those who did to him were fundamentally inhuman. It was sad that his subjects had been villainised; it was a recording of history he would have to set right. He would tolerate no disrespect on their part.

Every syllable was like an assault on Paganini’s mind, psyche and soul. His brain would attempt to understand this foreign language and fail and then try again and fail once more. It felt like he was being ripped in two. To be clear though this was not a mental attack from Nimrod who was slowly approaching the violinist as his mind suffered. He was simply speaking a language and Paganini’s mind was reacting to it with every fibre of his being. He had been cursed. Not just him but all humans. They had been cursed by God. When punishing humanity for the Tower of Babel he had taken away their unified language making it fundamentally impossible for them to understand it to the point it hurt. Nimrod being a servant from that time period was fine using it but Paganini would be highly affected leaving the perfect opening for the insulted King to strike.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Common sense was overwritten, leaving those who didn’t understand the miracle in confusion.

“If it wasn’t interesting, then it wouldn’t grow an audience.”

Lea retorted meekly, defending her life’s obsession over war. What was so wrong with reading stories as stories, and wanting to experience it herself? That <u>dream</u> to do what they wanted to was innate in every child, and Lea had been no exception.

As soon as Gatsby drew his machine gun, Lea ducked away again. In order to get a <em>clean</em> hit in, it was clear that Gatsby would need to close the distance, or find cover himself. Although, that only applied when abiding by common sense.

Completely defying what was expected of him, Gatsby’s confidence didn’t waver one bit in spite of both his wound and the seemingly vulnerable situation he’s been placed into.

“… What does the tower have to do with anything? It’s his, not mine. I don’t have any reason to care about it.”

Throwing out the first dialogue to come into her mind, Lea stalled time in order to read the inscription upon her gun.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><em>An explosion is not a display of violence, power, or force, but of cold. A cold as fierce as New York&#39;s winter, or Chicago&#39;s freeze.</em>

As long as these letters continued to be applied to her gun, her explosions would serve little purpose.

If she could do that, her bullets could be effective again. Sadly, the answer didn’t seem to be as simple as rubbing the text off. His eyes seemed to morph ever so slightly, but— Lea had only heard vague rumors of Mystic Eyes. Her lack of confidence in the subject made her doubt her judgement. Perhaps his eyes just happened to zone out.

Secondly— until she could meet the first objective, she should conserve her exploding bullets. Those were difficult to craft, and she only had a limited amount. Until it could fully take effect, it’d be for the best to just force Gatsby to take his distance and stall for time. Maybe with enough time, the letters would vanish…

<em>”… No, battles of attrition never go well. Not like we can both sit here forever, either. There’s no food in this room. There is a bed, but nowhere enough time to lie down in it.”</em>

She didn’t have the stamina to keep up fire for the whole round. Lea understood her limits.

… What should she do?

“Ahhhhh!!!!!”

Screaming out her mind, Lea shot out another bullet towards Gatsby, aimed right in front of his foot. Solely meant to keep him at bay, not at all to deal any additional damage. She gave up hope that the letters would disappear with time. Rather, she wanted to buy time to clench her fear.

“God, this is terrifying! Is it supposed to be like this?!”

—Her eyes were on the verge of insanity. Gatsby could see that much. She didn’t ask that question rhetorically. <u>Lea’s fear had progressed to such a point that she looked for refuge from <em>anywhere</em>, even from the very enemy aiming to shoot her down</u>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It is such a droll trope. It is the pinnacle of a self-serving attitude. You are too obsessed with do or don&#39;t that you fail to look into the complexity of your subjects.  Did you <em>truly</em> understand them, or os that the lie that lets you sleep at night? Don&#39;t impose your delusion onto me.&quot; Paganini&#39;s mouth twisted into a grin. 

&quot;<strong>You are nothing but a dog chasing its own tail.</strong> A twisted monument so dark and terrible that your name has become nothing but a petty insult in languages around the world. <strong>That</strong> is your legacy.&quot;

Paganini prepared to release the True Name of his Noble Phantasm, but it was too late! He felt his mind bend under the weight of Nimrod&#39;s words. What was this tone? Staccato? Incomprehensible!

As Paganini tried to finish uttering his True Name, he realized that his mouth wasn&#39;t working. Was this the language that humanity spoke all those years ago?

&quot;▂▂▃▃▅▅&quot; Paganini roared at Nimrod as his head threatened to split, flinging the shattered flutes at the king in  a halfhearted attempt to strike at him.

She didn&#39;t care about the tower. That meant that she was either apathetic, didn&#39;t understand the situation, or simply delusional. All of the above were actually better than Lea being a nutcase who wanted to reach God.

Therefore, there was room for empathy. <strong>Lea simply lost control of the situation.</strong>

&quot;<strong>Yes.</strong>&quot; Gatsby murmured, stepping forward. &quot;<strong>It is.</strong>&quot;

&quot;War is a cruel, heartless thing. It changes people. I never got to marry my Daisy because of the Great War. I never got her back.&quot;

&quot;The state of the world stems from conflict. The Fuyuki Grail War was a mistake, born from warfare and avarice. What was it like for those Masters and Servants, locked in that battle? Did they feel as you do now?&quot; Gatsby pondered, walking closer to Lea.

Jay Gatsby was an individual born out of an ideal. He did not exist to spread conflict. He hated how people suffered meaninglessly. How many other Gatsbys and Daisies existed in this world, separated because of war?

The machine gun vanished. Gatsby smiled, utterly defenseless. If Lea shot him now, he would bleed.

Nimrod did not view those as negative traits. The lines between arrogance and confidence or greed and hope were thin ones. To him those made human individual because that&#39;s what humans are. They want, they hope, they believe. When a human loses any want of their own, a part of their humanity is lost. Paganini seemed to lack true wants of his own. Due to that Nimrod was unable to view him as a fellow human. Admittedly he could not claim that he knew every single one of his subjects. They were obviously some despicable people in the bunch who had gotten a hold of too much power but on the whole they weren’t malicious. Sinful yes but not necessarily malicious. They all had their own personal reasons for joining. Someone were simply curious, others wanted to grow, some wanted to meet God, others wanted to learn the truth of the world. The king had spent his reign trying to understand them as best he could. He may have misunderstood at points but he did try the violinist was mistaken in that area at least. He was mostly likely saying something akin to that in this moment

But to passerbys it simply sounded like more gibberish. Try as they might, it was humanity&#39;s curse to never understand the unified language again. It was due to that curse though that Nimrod wouldn&#39;t be able to continue speaking it for much longer. His native tongue was one of the strongest tools in his arsenal but being a forbidden language and all it wasn&#39;t something to rely on. It&#39;s usage was incredibly draining for him and he would only be able to continue for a bit longer. In that time he would have to dispose of Paganini</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037119867125518449 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037119867125518449><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 07:44 AM">07:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">G̶̔̕h̵́̌k̵̗͌d̸̽̕p̴̈́͊s̴͑̐ù̷̉i̶̎̅ ̷͂̐d̶͆̽p̵̀͘a̷̎͐m̴̎̏t̵̎̊ú̴́w̵̌͂m̵̋͊k̷̈̕o̸̍͝ď̶̾ ̸̍̕t̴͛̂r̴̤͑ǒ̷̀q̷̛̆n̷͌͠s̷̎̊,̷́̽ ̴̏̕p̴̈́͘ÿ̵́̽p̷̛͂y̸̍̀e̶̊͗ ̸͘͝j̷͑́w̶̓͑h̴̏͛i̶̊̕ò̸͝;̴͛͝ ̴͊͘p̵͊̃m̷̋̓,̸̑̈s̶̔͝ẁ̶̈́n̷̆͗h̵̓̈ ̸̏i

Nimrod arrived in front of the violinist his attempt at an attack bouncing off the King&#39;s skin leaving no damage. His eyes looked down on his foe as if looking at the lowest of scum his disdain for the man had grown significantly through this encounter. He was most likely cursing him to death with his unknown dialogue at this moment. If not for his master&#39;s command seal he would have beheaded him on the spot but alas he would have to work around it. The verge of death could easily lead to death. The King wasn’t really a flashy fighter, his style centred around his skill as a hunter so his next step was rather simple. His sword plunged into Paganini’s stomach, his face seemingly saying &#39;be grateful that wasn’t your heart&#39;. Assuming that strike landed successfully he would pull the sword out and raise it once more. Next he would disable movement to make sure his prey couldn&#39;t escape. He brought the sword down on Paganini’s led in an attempt to sever it. In the time he had left he would maximise the damage he could inflict.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A phenomenon Lea had only looked at with fascination, never truly understood. No one could, unless they were put into the situation themselves.

To begin with— it seemed like they were on the same side. Lea hadn’t even paused to think to ask why they had invaded the tower, so she didn’t have the opportunity to confirm Gatsby’s intentions. When understanding the fear having a gun pointed at you could cause, the weight of her actions suddenly 
dawned on her.

The hesitation was everlasting, but this time, her body didn’t freeze due to it. Instead, she tossed her weapons to the side, before meekly exiting out of her cover.

“… Sorry.”

Lea scratched her head while looking at Gatsby’s wound. She habitually forced out a smile, even if it ended up morphed from hints of guilt and fear. She still didn’t have confidence that Gatsby wouldn’t shoot her without warning. It was just easier to accept that he was well-intentioned. His words implied he disliked conflict. Assuming that that was true was easier on her psyche.

“I don’t think wars are as black and white as you say. War’s just… inevitable. Part of a ritual to join two groups together.”

Her internal justifications behind her obsession slowly leaked out, but as she formed them into words, she began to question her own worldview anew.

“I agree its heartless, though.”

… Lea needed to physically grab her weapons to attack. In comparison, Gatsby seemed to be accessing his machine gun in seemingly magical ways. If he decided to shoot her right now, she’d probably stand no chance of recovery.

The silence made her think of nothing but such morbid thoughts.

‘It changes people’, he said.

“… So. Daisy’s a cute name. Was she hot?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He grabbed at the king&#39;s legs with enough force to crack bone, though it was nothing before the might of the king.

No. <em>No.</em> <strong>No.</strong> <em><strong>Nononononononononononononono—</strong></em> It was not going to end like this. He was one of the most talented men to grace this world, and he was getting torn apart by a man with no true skill, beyond convincing animals that they could flail about with no care in the world.

The only power Nimrod had over Paganini was that of age and authority as a king. He was <strong>not</strong> special. He could <strong>not</strong> be special. It simply wasn&#39;t possible. Paganini was not going to lose to... this brute. A man so stuck in his ways that he thought he was even remotely &#39;good&#39;.

Nimrod&#39;s sword struck down on Paganini, piercing the Servant&#39;s gut. 

Good. Yes. That was where this problem began and concluded. Zahhak had lamented the value of good and preached evil as he infected Paganini with his blessing.

<strong>Then, why fight it? Let those seeds bloom.</strong>

As the ooze erupted from Paganini&#39;s body, the violinist gurgled and laughed. His violin slammed into Nimrod&#39;s side with the force of a train. Though the strike wasn&#39;t much stronger than Paganini&#39;s other attacks, it harmed Nimrod on a fundamental level, as if he was being struck at the core of his being: a good ruler.

&quot;A blessing from Angra Mainyu.&quot; Paganini cackled, standing to his feet. &quot;I admit it! I loathe my audiences. I admired and respected them when I was first summoned here in Alexandria. Recently, that respect has turned to nothing but contempt. <strong>They can all go to hell, for all I care.</strong>&quot;

Paganini plunged into his pocket and produced a string, before stabbing his hand into the open wound, stitching it with a violin string.

&quot;<strong>Salvation for me. Salvation for him. Not for you. Not for anyone. You are not one of the Twenty-Four Chosen.</strong>&quot; Paganini laughed, staggering towards Nimrod.

&quot;The Great War, for instance. Nasty business. Is it right to tell someone to go fight across the Atlantic in a land he&#39;s never seen?&quot; Gatsby said, studying her. He chuckled. &quot;You probably don&#39;t know what the Atlantic is. Curse the state of things.&quot;

Lea&#39;s answer was extremely interesting. &#39;Part of a ritual to join two groups together&#39;. America had been founded on the idea that thirteen colonies were able to unify into one through conflict. Yet, was that truly fair to force evolution through violence?

Oh, Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Would he have become a Heroic Spirit if they had stayed together? He missed her, so very mu—

<strong>SPLOOSH!</strong> Gatsby spat out his drink and reddened.

&quot;<strong>She was a lady! Fine, graceful, and kind! To call her &#39;hot&#39; is...</strong>&quot; Gatsby sighed and composed himself. &quot;Yes, she was hot. She loved fine clothes, and... I loved her, but then war split us apart.&quot; Gatsby sighed.

&quot;Why does war interest you? It&#39;s pretty boring, if you&#39;ll believe it. Lots of trenches, not a lot of action.&quot; Gatsby shuddered. &quot;Lots of war crimes, I must admit.&quot;

He tried to speak but his throat was dry, his tongue useless, he was at his limit, his greatest skill sealed once more. He was then sent flying as if hit by a train crashing into the wall.

He had been thrown around in this battle quite a lot actually. Unbefitting of a King such as himself. He groggily got back onto his own feet. He was confused as to how Paganini had gained so much strength suddenly. His attack physically hadn&#39;t been that powerful but it had felt like his very spirit core was under attack. This wasn&#39;t a power that a musician should have had at his disposal. &#39;Angra Mainyu&#39;. That was the name his foe had used. He did know who that was due to knowledge as a servant but he didn&#39;t see what their connection would be. Either way the situation was unfavourable. The ooze had scarred his flesh and the hit had left him drained. Close quarters combat in these conditions was no longer the best idea.

Usually he would have just obliterated the dog with his second Noble Phantasm. But in this situation using it would be detrimental to him as well as his foe. He really did have to end this now less the scale be ripped any less in his favour.  Pulling his arm back he positioned himself as if holding a javelin and shot his sword forward. He was also compatible with the Archer class so his aim was good and true. The sword would impale the Berserker straight through the neck unless Lea&#39;s command got in it&#39;s way. The king would admittedly be in an non ideal situation if this didn&#39;t work.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though, now that she had experienced what it felt like to act as a single soldier, it was hard to dismiss the concerns Gatsby brought up.

“When looking at the gambits that a whole faction takes, I think war can be pretty interesting. Its not often you get to have so many people working together towards a common goal.”

The sip of coffee warmed her up. A welcomed contrast to the cold air that now surrounded the hallway. Gatsby chose to spare her as well. Her comfort rose.

“Trenches are boring from a logistical perspective, but they could be so much more interesting! As long as you make those holes <em>liveable</em> in, I doubt there would be a single soldier who would complain. Even after so many thousands of years, humanity is still far from having perfected warfare! Imagine a world where its economically feasible to build underground hotels to keep morale high!”

As her comfort rose, Lea became more willing to speak her mind out. A perspective created entirely from an observer’s perspective, theorizing on hypotheticals she had no method to of guaranteeing. No matter how well-informed her hypotheticals may have been, it was clear that all they were were a child’s delusions that happened to grow out of control.

“Though, I… it is pretty black when acting as a soldier, huh?”

All of Lea’s excitements could be dismissed with that one sentiment. And so— she averted the conversation back onto the more appealing topic at hand.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038346808067371018 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038346808067371018><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Nov-22 04:59 PM">16:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>One they could more lightheartedly talk about for hours on end without any burden weighing them down.

Still absolutely lacking in tact. That was… not something you could detach from her, it seemed.

Maybe in a world where soldiers are treated so well that they can live in luxury, it might be worth something. Yet...&quot; Gatsby&#39;s tone grew thoughtful.

&quot;<strong>Isn&#39;t that what this tournament is?</strong>&quot; Dropping the subject, Gatsby listened to the thrashing of Nimrod and Paganini. The American&#39;s eyes grew dark. Something was off. 

Soldiers did definitely get the blacker end of the spectrum in combat. Nameless soldiers clashing over things that mattered little to them. Few wars were for simple things like freedom or liberation. Many in history were senseless. Soldiers fighting and dying for ideals that they didn&#39;t truly understand.

Wasn&#39;t that just this tournament? People fighting for protection against a power they didn&#39;t understand? One person had already lost their memory. What more would it take for Republic to back off?

Then, back to Daisy. It alwats came back to Daisy. Oh, how he loved and missed her! 

&quot;No, no. She was a lovely woman. It&#39;s hard to explain her properly. I could ramble about her for eons. People described her hair as short, but the Daisy I knew had blond hair that fell to the floor. She saw and understood little, yet what she understood she conveyed with wisdom.&quot; Gatsby responded earnestly.

Daisy Buchanan was a shallow and cruel woman within the Great Gatsby, yet Gatsby himself described her as a saint. Was he simply being polite, or was his Daisy different from the Daisy within the book?

&quot;The eyepatch makes you look threatening. I&#39;m certain that if you let your bangs down, you would look simply <em>adorable</em>!&quot; Gatsby beamed. &quot;Oh, or perhaps a cape. You would look, ah, what&#39;s the term? <em>Badass</em> with a cape! Here!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1038693297125871686 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1038693297125871686><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Nov-22 03:56 PM">15:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>An elegant cape with a billowing end suddenly fell atop Lea.

Nimrod was a powerful Servant, of far higher quality than Paganini himself. However, Paganini was blessed with techniques that let him stand firmly above someone so foolish that he blindly stumbled after an ideal in the name of &quot;good&quot;.

This was the blessing of Angra Mainyu. Those who were good would be burned by Paganini&#39;s attack. This was the edge Paganini needed. Nimrod could have ended this battle several times if not for Lea&#39;s interference. A stupid Master, a stupid Servant.

Paganini gathered magical energy into his violin. He cackled as his fingers cracked and dislocated as he prepared his Noble Phantasm.

&quot;<strong>Listen, angelic muses who rest in the clouds above. Listen, wretched imps who claw on the ground below. Watch and weep as I turn my back on my original nature, and embrace delusion and fantasy.&quot;</strong>

&quot;<strong>Twenty-four voices around me, I urge you to laugh with me! Ring aloud on this rotten stage: 24 CAPRICES FOR SOLO VIOLIN!</strong>&quot;

Paganini&#39;s fingers dislocated as Paganini played twenty four songs at once. To Nimrod, it was much like his Unified Language, but attuned not to the unity of his people, but to the discordant nature of the player. It was a man hamfistedly scraping on his violin, as if he were at war with himself. It was true madness.

The sword struck true, impaling Paganini. He fell to the ground with a gurgle, and a laughter erupted all around Nimrod.

There were twenty-three other Paganinis to deal with. Each played their violin, and prepared to release the individual power of their violins at once.

However, as the violin came down...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gatsby walked out, furious, hands on his hips. He almost looked threatening, if not for the fluffy cat earmuffs put snugly over his ears. 

His eyes blazed brightly, and twenty-two of the remaining Paganinis vanished into a puff of musical notes. The actual Paganini remained, slightly to Nimrod&#39;s right. He reeled back, as if in pain.

&quot;I know it hurts. I apologize.&quot; Gatsby admitted. &quot;As Niccol&#242; Paganini was never a demonic monster, you&#39;re technically not the real one. <strong>No wonder Eyes of God, which strips away fiction and lies, would harm you.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I almost had him.&quot; Paganini groaned as his Noble Phantasm was deconstructed by Eyes of God. All of his fake clones vanished into the ether, while he felt like he had bene placed in a microwave.

Yet he was so close... Just one more strike, and he could surely beat Nimrod. The musician took a step, before collapsing under Nimrod and Gatsby&#39;s gaze. His blessing from Angra Mainyu was growing weaker in Gatsby&#39;s presence, and Nimrod outpaced him in both mana and physical might. Blast, blast, blast!

&quot;He&#39;s right there... I can take him.. He&#39;s a freak. A <strong>freak</strong>!&quot; Paganini hissed, spittle flying from his mouth. &quot;No king can unify all the people in the world. He&#39;s a liar! A cheat! A fraud! When he does it, his people laud him! When I do it, people call me a monster. It&#39;s not fair, Gatz. <strong>IT&#39;S NOT FAIR!</strong>&quot;

Paganini hissed as he collapsed into a frothing pile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Paganini had a good heart, but he was locked under the chains of his own summoning. Another Paganini would have a happier life, but Alexandria had summoned a Berserker. 

Yet there was a way to right all the wrongs done today. Gatsby&#39;s coffee thermos morphed into a machine gun, and then a typewriter, and then into a book. Gatsby grabbed it.

&quot;<strong>Turn, pages of fantasy. Turn, pages of truth. Bring the American Dream into reality, and bless the world anew. A brighter future, just for you.</strong>&quot;

Words covered Gatsby&#39;s body, Paganini&#39;s, Nimrod&#39;s and even Lea&#39;s.

&quot;<strong>The Great American Novel.</strong>&quot;

The wounds on Nimrod and Paganini completely vanished, as if the fight had never happened. Paganini&#39;s expression had become peaceful.

Gatsby walked past Nimrod and to Paganini. He unceremoniously closed his eyes and collapsed onto Paganini&#39;s chest. &quot;I won&#39;t chase your Master, anymore. She&#39;s a good woman, just confused. You chose well. <strong>You are a good king.</strong>&quot;

&quot;Since I fixed your wounds and whatnot, and didn&#39;t kill your Master, can you let me off your tower? If Your Majesty is willing, would you give me and this nimr—fool a way off the tower. I&#39;m a bit tired. Just gonna... rest my eyes.&quot;

&quot;Zzz...&quot; Gatsby snored. Wonderful.

Unfortunately Lea&#39;s command seal hadn’t quite worn off so killing him was still an impossibility. He reflected for a moment on that noble phantasm he had used. He loathed to admit it but without Gabtsy&#39;s interference the lowly musician would of landed a considerably damaging attack. The situation was highly embarrassing for him. Even receiving help from the enemy. Killing the two would have brought him deep joy but he had to admit some respect was gained in their healing of him. Also killing the writer before he had a chance to speak to him would be a loss. The damage was repairable their deaths could be delayed till a later date

Begrudgingly he took a hold of them and unceremoniously began to drag them along after him as he approached the walls of the tower. Reaching the wall an opening appeared in the tower&#39;s side and the king promptly threw the two trespassers out. It was the first floor so they wouldn&#39;t receive any serious damage from the fall. He watched them fall for a moment before the opening closed up and he walked back deeper into his tower heading to his master&#39;s room.

</div></div>
One thing stood out to him. Gabtsy had called Lea confused. Nimrod had said when they first met that the girl&#39;s nature was rotten but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean bad, simply broken. Something wasn&#39;t right to put it even more simply. She didn&#39;t seem to properly grasp the environment or herself for that matter. She had summoned him here. She served as a vassal. He felt some obligation to oversee her progress. He did in fact appreciate Gabtsy highlighting the issue. It was something he would take note of for the future. Right now she would need to be punished for the stupidly that was used with that command seal.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
