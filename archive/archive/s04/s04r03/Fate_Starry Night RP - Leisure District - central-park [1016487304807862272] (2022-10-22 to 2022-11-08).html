Leather boots kicked up dust as they ran down the busy Alexandrian streets, dodging people left and right deftly as they weaved through the early afternoon crowd. Such delicate, unwasteful and quick movements could only come from a <em>Servant</em>.

This Servant was holding someone in his arms, apparently a teen. On closer inspection, it seemed that the Servant himself looked small and young. He ran unnecessarily fast through the streets as he clung onto this other kid, hurrying for no apparent reason...

No, the apparent reason was behind him.

A crowd of people were stomping the streets in their direction. Angry Alexandrians and eager journalists were running in unison, hoping to get their hands on the nimble Servant. Like a modern-day witch hunt of sorts. Passive onlookers on the street froze as the blurry Servant ran past them, then quickly moved out of the way once the crowd caught up with them.

The crowd raised their voice with little care for their surroundings, drowning the ambience with their feet and mouths.

<strong>Wait a second!

His heart was still weak, his head still hurt from time to time, his overall coordination still lacked: this was clearly no way to treat a hospital patient. Unfortunately, there was little more Lewis could do. He didn’t want to run this way, but he <em>had</em> to.

This was supposed to be a quiet afternoon. A <em>pleasant</em> afternoon. After spending nearly a week at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span>, the doctors pushed for a walk outside. Surely because Thomas had barely tasted any sunlight from his hospital room ever since the fight at the Commodan. Lewis quickly agreed to take him if it meant he could both help his Master recover and relieve his adventurous itch by exploring Alexandria a bit more.

Though, neither of them thought this pleasant walk would turn out like this.

&quot;T-Take a left there!&quot; Thomas struggled, desperately clinging onto Lewis as if his life depended on it. &quot;This alley’s narrow, they won&#39;t be able to chase us all at once!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or dangerous. . . Or both. What had started as a means to explore the neighborhood to get Thomas to read his books resulted in a high speed chase with pedestrians. . . With the sickly Thomas in his arms. Fun. 

The crowd that chased them down spewed whatever comment they had, one on questions for a report, the other on how they were children who were doomed from the beginning, the last over how their lost caused someone’s cat to die! Now that was just rude! Lewis loved cats, especially the fluffy ones! But, no matter how much they questioned or threatened or blamed, they wouldn’t even get a glimpse of the boy, but rather the blur he left behind! 

In a quick turn the duo found themselves in an alleyway, the long stretch of brick narrow enough to where Lewis almost had to compress the boy to fit through with him. 

“Weeeee, I haven’t had this much fun since I got chased my the bear Seaman woke up!”

His comment something that showed the sheer exhilaration of the stressful situation. How could he have been so carefree? Not many could answer! Their trip had began to slowly come towards an end, the alley branching into separate sections, each one almost maze like in itself. When a loud and clear <em>beep</em> made itself known. Lewis’s bag shuffled a bit, a light grew from it and soon enough, something had come out, and to make its presence known, with the voice of a mechanical woman, it spoke.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034242457237467206 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034242457237467206><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Oct-22 09:10 AM">09:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Going 250 feet left. . . 40 feet straight. . . 10 feet left again, an unknown mana signature is present.

The voice was new, definitely something strange to hear for Thomas, and even for the crowd following, but for Lewis, he knew exactly what it was! A large blue map appeared in front of him, enough for him to read exactly where he was. In a head nod, the map disappeared. He knew where to go! 

“Just what I needed, thank you Sacs! I’ll make sure to get there!”

But to Thomas, who was Sacs? The wooden doll couldn’t have been a real person, but his servant spoke to it like one! Another swift turn would be made. This was the 400 feet right it spoke of. . . would it get them actually to where  it said?

After Ā-Q&#236;ng checked out her books, Alexander having to explain how a modern-day library works, they decided to come back to their previously used training spot. Lancer had mentioned that magecraft was new to her and that she would have to learn to be careful around it. Because of this gap in Ā-Q&#236;ng’s fighting knowledge, Alexander wanted to show Lancer more of his arsenal to get her adjusted to ranged combat against magus. 

Reaching their previous sparring location, Alexander would crack his back, each vertebrate cracking up his spine in order. From the number of times Alexander stretched like this, it would be easy for Ā-Q&#236;ng to tell he had a quickly aging body that was nowhere near as flexible as a martial artist.

“Ā-Q&#236;ng, I figured we should use this open time to work out your lack of combat experience against modern technology and magecraft, any objections?” Alexander would wait for Lancer&#39;s response before doing anything else. However, he wouldn&#39;t expect the battle-hungry servant to decline his offer of a sparring match.

Thus Ā-Q&#236;ng had continued to wear her summer outfit purchased by her Master, flowing dress and cozy cardigan replacing the commoner’s robes she had been summoned in, an attire she seemed to have utterly neglected upon receiving Alexander’s gifts to her.

Today was meant to be spent on exercise.

As it had already been three days since she had suffered her debilitating defeat after receiving the Incan Caster’s fireball to her chest, the injury itself was now no more than a memory, her body having managed to recover completely. Yet the perks granted to her by her Servant body should not be counted as a success. Having lived her life as an undefeated legend, untouchable even by the greatest warriors of her Kingdom, she had clearly grown complacent over time, her lackadaisical attitude perhaps even bordering on arrogance were it not for the fact that Ā-Q&#236;ng did not particularly care about the refinement of her abilities and was simply a product of her particular set of skills being honed in utter isolation with no one else to measure them against.
Now she finally gained this opportunity, but at a cost.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">“Ā-Q&#236;ng, I figured we should use this open time to work out your lack of combat experience against modern technology and magecraft, any objections?”
</div></div>
Her Master was right. Though she may have mastered traditional anti-personnel combat, she lacked knowledge on all manner of magecraft and mystical abilities that were developed outside of her Bamboo Grove, and in the three times she had battled the inhabitants of this time already, she received injury during each and every one.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034766749654056960 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034766749654056960><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Oct-22 07:53 PM">19:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“None~”

Therefore it was a simple task to agree to her Master’s offer.
Her body longed for exercise due to being confined to rest for a full three days, and though her opponent was only human, his pretty rocks made battling him quite interesting.

Yet something halted her preparations.
Like an itch scratching at the root of her hair.

<em>“A Servant?”</em>

Ā-Q&#236;ng curiously turned her head at the not-so-distant location from where she could feel the presence, a low gaggle of voices now being somewhat noticeable from that direction as well. Perhaps it was someone famous?
It wasn’t exactly uncommon to run into Servants on the streets of Alexandria. Some were used as workers, some as companions, and some even existed with a level of independence that rivaled that of their mortal counterparts, though naturally they were still monitored and regulated to prevent any unfortunate incidents, especially so in the case of Berserkers. As such, the appearance of a Servant’s aura should not have made much of an impression on Ā-Q&#236;ng due to having passed several others on her way to the park already, but an irrational whim urged her to take note of this one regardless. Perhaps it was instinct or perhaps simply misguided curiosity, but before she knew it she had already taken a few careless steps towards the direction of the fast-moving Servant. Were they running from something, or simply leaping across the rooftops as she enjoyed doing? She was compelled to find out.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1034766810173669396 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1034766810173669396><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Oct-22 07:53 PM">19:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Master, I sense a Servant nearby!

A perfectly reasonable proposition.
Ancient heroes from the past would no doubt be attracted to any sort of battle, whether it be a friendly spar or a desperate struggle to the death, so it would only make sense to assure them preemptively of their intentions so as to not trigger any of their lingering battle instincts.

This made sense.
Yet the curious glimmer in Ā-Q&#236;ng’s eyes betrayed that she was not thinking reasonably at all, simply letting herself be swept away by her instincts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was he referring to <em>Sacagawea</em>? According to the… the website thing on the hospital’s computers, this was believed to be one of Lewis’ n… no… Noble…something? He didn&#39;t quite catch what it was, but the fact Lewis spoke to it like a real person was odd to say the least. Wasn’t it just a map?

Beyond that, what was this <em>unknown mana signature</em>? Mana, mana... it had something to do with Mages and Servants, didn&#39;t it? From what he understood, both were fairly common in Alexandria, but... that thing that impaled him was a Servant too, right? 

Thomas felt the jibbies.

‘Sacs’ eventually led them through the streets of Alexandria to a place called Central Park, one of the places the doctors recommended before they left the hospital. It was supposed to be a nice place filled with greenery and animals. This place looked quite relaxing, very nice indeed... much nicer than the crowd chasing them from behind, that&#39;s for sure.

But upon arriving at the park, Thomas was surprised to find ... not many people. Very few people, in fact. Wasn&#39;t this place supposed to be a tourist spot? He didn&#39;t mind. Fewer people meant fewer people chasing him for things he didn&#39;t remember doing. But still... <strong>was it because today was the day of the second round opposing Alexandria to Republic</strong>?

Cut off from his introspection, Thomas&#39; senses were alerted when he laid eyes on a girl in a summer dress in the distance.

Thomas felt the jibbies again.

There was something strange about this girl, but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on why. It was like his body naturally tensed up when he saw her... just as it tensed up whenever Lewis was around.

<em>Was she a Servant, too?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With precise timing and direction, the boy weaved throughout the maze of alleyways as if he were home to them, and with the caution in mind, he had tried to ready himself for whatever could have been ahead. A servant was what <em>she</em> pointed out, but was it going to be friend or foe?

In a few more turns, the duo slowly cleared their way towards Central Park, the lush green grass greeting them first as the sounds of the crowd died behind them. And while they had seemed to escape them, the warning of a servant presence stayed true. With a quick halt from Lewis, the boys were still, and both Thomas and Lewis’ eyes went about to see if maybe they’d find who exactly that servant could have been, and ending with both the two looking at a young girl no taller or older than what Lewis was. Could she have known one? He went to ask.

“Yo—you! Do you know where a servant is? It’s like me. . . Yeah!”

His question was blunt, straight forward, though he was curious too! He moved closer, Thomas still in hand.

“My map said there’s a servant here! Have you seen one?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only a few days prior, Ā-Q&#236;ng had watched Thomas’ and Lewis’ horrendous defeat at the hands of Republic’s other Lancer Pair, yet here they were. In the flesh. Not quite hale and whole despite the time seemingly spent in recovery, yet alive nonetheless.

Her face lit up as if chancing upon a celebrity.

It was not exactly the fervor of a fan jumping at the chance to exchange words with the object of their admiration, but more the relief of someone finding that an injured bird they cared for had recovered enough to take flight once more. Not that she had played any part in their recuperation, but the sentiment remained similar nonetheless.

“You are the ones that fought the ugly dragon and the mean metal man!” Ā-Q&#236;ng excitedly froliced over towards the pair, defenseless and unguarded, her Master’s previous day’s reminder of whom she should consider allies already pushed to the wayside.

“And a Servant, you say? Why are you looking for one here, silly. There are plenty of them in the city where it is more crowded, so this is a nice place to be alone if you want to. That is why me and my Master came here today as well. Right?”

Peeking over her shoulder, she casually motioned towards the adult man with her chin before having her attention snagged by Lewis’ insistence of a Servant presence in the area.

“A map? That shows the location of Servants? How does it do that!?”

Ā-Q&#236;ng had seen much and more of this world, each and every discovery a new experience utterly foreign to her, and yet again this Servant before her would teach her even more of what it had to offer.
It would be a lie to say that her interest was purely motivated by innocent excitement and curiosity, despite her previous conversation with her Master allowing her mood to temper and grant her the luxury to play along with her childish whims once more. To an extent. Instead her fascination with this new ability was perhaps motivated by something a touch more personal. Selfish even. A means to track down someone that should have long departed this world.
Though for now those unlikely musings were not to be taken too seriously should they fail to deliver her desired outcome.

“But if that is so, that is odd. Because other than you and me there are no other Servants here.”

Alexander had told her to keep in mind which participants belonged to their side and which opposed them… but here was a pair that had already lost their first round in the Tourney.
Surely the rules did not apply to them.

Not only did she just blow her own cover to another master servant pair, but she did so to a group that they both knew to be the enemy.

Alexander&#39;s eyes moved to meet Lewis and Thomas a fake smile showing itself. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, please ignore my servant here, she&#39;s quite the fan of you two.&quot; As Alexander spoke his hand would reach behind his back grabbing his shotgun. He would keep the weapon concealed, only holding it for safety.

While it was a nice change of pace, Thomas couldn&#39;t help but feel his stomach stir as she got closer. His brain associated Servants with danger. Sure, some of them came to visit you at the hospital and took you under their arm to escape hysterical crowds... but others stabbed you in the chest and made you faint from the pain, making you forget all about your life in the same occasion. 

Overall, it was fair to say Thomas had a poor impression of Servants. As such, it was with great caution that he proceeded, tapping Lewis to let go of him. 

&quot;Fans of ours, you say...&quot; Thomas said with an exhausted voice. &quot;Then I guess we won&#39;t have to introduce ourselves. To be perfectly honest with you, she&#39;s the first person to meet us and not want our heads on a pike. I appreciate it, A-Qing. &quot; 

Though his words grateful, A-Qing could easily deduce from his body language that he was uncomfortable around her, talking and maintaining Alexander&#39;s gaze instead of hers. <em>Ignoring</em> her, almost. 

&quot;But I&#39;m sorry...&quot; He mumbled, vaguely looking in A-Qing&#39;s direction. &quot;I&#39;m not that keen on fighting right now. Things didn&#39;t go well last time I fought someone, so... no offense, but I&#39;d rather relax. There&#39;s a lot on my plate, right now.&quot; 

It seemed Alexander&#39;s fake smile went unnoticed by the Master. He was either a good actor, or Thomas couldn&#39;t... or rather <em>didn&#39;t try</em> to pierce through him. 

Not only that, but the blond&#39;s mannerism greatly changed compared to his on-screen iteration from a few days ago. His posture was sloppy, his confidence gone, his wit inexistent. None of the sharpness he might&#39;ve didplayed against Nikolai remained within him. 

Yes, <em>it was like he was a different person altogether</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lewis put his master on his two feet, careful to not drop him as he put his now free hands on his hips. But what he didn’t expect was the girl to say she was a servant herself, the surprise taking him back a bit too. So she was the servant Sacagawea warned him about. She didn’t seem much of a danger at all really! Lewis ignorantly didn’t think much that she could have been from the republic. And when she asked her question about his map, with a loud beep of recognition, his bag rumbled.

“Yup! It’s apart of me! Sacagawea told me that in this area. . . C—Central Park? That’s what it is! And she said that it would be a servant to be wary of! So you’re that servant. . .but you seem nice and you seem to know about how that ugly lizard tried to bully America!”

At his comment the sound in his bag let out a protective beeping noise, as if to register that there wasn’t any sort of “hostile” presence that it had spoken about. While A-Qing spoke on her and her master’s behalf, Lewis had to think of what they could have been doing. Frankly, it wasn’t as fun as training to learn to beat up Mages, but it was fun that they were gathering attention from crowds! Was that was Gatsby was doing? Were his friends like that?

“We we’re running from people! They really don’t seem to like that we lost. . . And they don’t seem to like that my master has hurt his head!

“But why? We only have to fight seriously when we are called to the big arena, so it should not matter if we are not on the same side or not right now. And they already lost, so they are safe.”

She seemed to be working under the erroneous assumption that a loss in one of the official Tourney Rounds equaled an immediate disqualification of the sanctioned conflict entirely, though even should that not have been the case, her attitude likely would have remained unchanged.

Still. Seeing how Thomas behaved so warily in her presence was enough for her to relent to her Master’s grip on her shoulder, even if she yet disagreed with his veiled hostility. He treated them as if they were dangerous, foes that would lunge at his throat if presented with a chance, yet his caution was utterly misplaced. It wasn’t them he needed to look out for, but those that he had professed to be their allies, the very same pair that reduced Thomas to the state he was currently in. His spark lost, his spirit broken. Now no more than the faded shadow his former self had once cast.

“You do not have to join if you do not want to…” Ā-Q&#236;ng assuaged Thomas’ meek refusal of her offer to join them, her hands harmlessly raised to reassure him of her intentions, “I saw a recording of your fight and was just happy to see you were ok. That is all.”

It was a blessing that he did not pick up on Alexander’s subtle reach for his weapon, even if he himself did not intend to initiate a conflict, but a misunderstanding under these circumstances could have quickly soured their meeting. Thus Ā-Q&#236;ng continued her slight rebellious streak. Hopping over to her Master’s dominant hand, she <s>purposefully</s> <em>just happened</em> to position herself just in the way of his draw-arm, restricting his range of movement to bumping into her back even should he decide to draw his weapon.
But clearly she just did this to get a better look at the new Servant arrival. Surely?

“Sa… Sagawaga?” she giggled as she struggled to imitate Lewis’ pronunciation of an utterly foreign name.

The Core embedded into her S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame may have granted her mastery over the common speech spoken in this world, but anything deviating from the basic language patterns still appeared to present somewhat of a challenge for her.

“Eh? Your Master has hurt his head?”

The mention of his Master’s condition was somewhat of a shock to her however, a revelation which, oddly enough, caused her to express something akin to… a smile?

Defeat? Fight? Didn’t the latter lead to the former? If, so what exactly was her definition of a ‘fight’ if it did not include victory nor defeat?

“Besides…” Ā-Q&#236;ng sullenly kicked the ground as she mumbled, her words confirming what should have been plain enough to see, even if the veil of cordiality had obscured it from sight, “...I would much rather play with them than with the dragon and the metal man, even if we are supposed to work with them.”

And Alexandrian Pair, in the midst of recovery, now caught in the sights of a Republican Pair who yet remained undecided on how to treat with them. Was this truly preferable to escaping from a harmless mob of humans?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="29-Oct-22 10:19 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, he always believed in being better safe then sorry. This philosophy did not seem to bode well with his servant, her child like inclination to make friends and play clashed with Alexander&#39;s defensive stance towards their enemies. 

Alexander let out a frustrated grunt as Ā-Q&#236;ng moved to block his left hand. For some reason she was particularly moody today. While she had done well to avoid her master&#39;s wrath, she was quickly working her way to a serious lecture.

&quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng, just because they lost does not mean they can&#39;t participate. This tournament is worth more then just strength alone, people have stakes in it.&quot; Alexander tried to inform Lancer on the nature of the conflict. He didn&#39;t explain much, not expecting her to understand the politics behind the tournament and why it was so important to Macedon. 

Taking a deep breath Alexander released his grip from his gun. Despite Ā-Q&#236;ngs pestering, she was somewhat correct. The pair was not a threat and at this current moment in time they weren&#39;t strictly enemies. &quot;You two are not welcome to train with us, however, you are fine to seek solace with us while you wait for your pursuers to give up.&quot;

After Alexander spoke he gave Ā-Q&#236;ng a deep glare of disappointment, she most likely wouldn&#39;t be able to get off free for her actions today.

He gave Lewis a frown to match. 

You don&#39;t have to tell everyone about my issues, he wanted to tell Lewis. He wanted to make it abundantly clear this didn&#39;t concern anyone but him. But what was the point, now that the cat was out of the bag. He repressed a sigh, showing his back to the group as he watched the horizon. 

The mob was still there. Their progress was slow, Central Park was a vast place, but they would likely make their way here if given enough time. Part of Thomas wondered how much free time these guys had, when they were supposed to be taking care of Alexandria&#39;s libraries. Did their work matter less than a couple of kids that had already suffered a crushing defeat? So much for Alexandria being a &#39;peaceful&#39; city. Thomas turned back to the group. 

Alexander clearly didn&#39;t like them. He didn&#39;t follow every bit of the conversation, but he suspected it had something to do with their involvement in the CGW. Thomas felt a special kind of frustration at the thought, directed towards someone who was and wasn&#39;t him at the time. His &#39;past self&#39;. If he was still here, somewhere deep in his subconscious or something, Thomas hoped he was paying close attention to the consequences of his actions. A fat lot of good it did to fight in that tournament. Neither the people working for Republic nor the Alexandrian citizens had him in their good grace, now. He effectively made an enemy out of everyone, then left <em>current Thomas</em> to deal with the consequences. Great job, past him.

If I could, I&#39;d hit my head again and forget all about it forever. Nothing good came out of fighting this idiotic war. This sucks.&quot; 

His annoyment bubbled as he was reminded of just how poor his current situation was, and the current conversation didn&#39;t help brighten his mood either. The annoyment slowly changed to irritation as he turned to A-Qing, forgetting even his fear of Servants momentarily, his frown contrasting deeply with her smile. 

&quot;And thank you for <em>not wanting to defeat us</em>. It&#39;s reassuring to know that someone who could wreck us is holding back because we&#39;re such losers. Yeah, this is reassuring. <em>Relaxing</em>, even.&quot; 

For Lewis, this was the first time he ever saw Thomas so dejected, so openly annoyed. He never even suspected his Master was capable of <em>sarcasm</em> until now. That fact, amongst other things, really drived the point that he was a different person home. This wasn&#39;t the ever-prepared, cunningly knowledgeable, always in control Master he once had... no, the current Thomas acted more like his age. Easily annoyed, tired all the time, hardly ever seen smiling. 

But then again, could he truly blame him knowing his circumstances? The tired, emotionally unstable Thomas waited a few seconds before continuing, breathing out in an effort to subdue his mood. Irritation gave in to exhaustion as his gaze wandered. This kid was evidently going through a lot, A-Qing and Alexander could easily tell. 

&quot;...we don&#39;t want to &#39;train&#39; with you,&quot; He assured Alexander. &quot;I don&#39;t, at least. We&#39;ll just rest for a bit then take our leave. Bear with us, please.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was as if tension were wherever they went, especially with whoever they’d meet. First the dragon and metal beast of a master and servant pair, then the crowd, and now. . . Even the master who he hadn’t known about them enough seemed to dislike their guts! And now he had Thomas who shot him a glare worse than Clark could ever. What was happening to humanity?!

Well at least the girl who seemed to be surprised to see them wasn’t as guarded as the others, though her comment about needing to defeat them made him unnerved a bit. He tried to ignore it, thinking nothing more than he trying to say something different but it came out wrong, just like how he would say <em>tapoica</em> and Thomas would once again repeat for the fifteenth time, <em>tapioca</em>. What really mattered, was that she had asked about his noble phantasm, Sacagawea. 

“Sacagawea yeah! She is my noble phantasm that is here! Though she can be a tad strange to use at times, she helps me with all my adventures, dont’cha girl?”

In his bag another ruffle could be seen and then the latch opened only to reveal a small robotic like figure, appeared, it’s body looking nothing more than what could be described as a tin can with arms and a strange hole, that could only be described like a camera. It’s figure floated around the boy, like a planet orbiting around the sun, letting out a few reactive beeps before it settled just beside him.

“See? Isn’t she cool? She can land out the whole U.S if she wanted! Luckily we had her when we found her, else it would have been impossible to navigate or even communicate with the Natives.”

He was proud of this thought, that his noble phantasm, the legendary Sacagawea had been such a thing. And to those who even gave it mind would notice it wasn’t exactly a standard look, but almost similar to a mystic code of some sorts. While the masters gave themselves dirty looks, the two servants were happily enamored with the idea of the metal being.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1035938153892151306 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1035938153892151306><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Oct-22 01:28 AM">01:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You see! I just gotta tell her where I want to go, or somehow get lost and boom, she helps! Sacs! Tell me where the nearest <em>Tapoica</em> tea shop is?”

In mere moments, a woman’s voice responded, and soon a holographic map appeared before them, the layout in 3D while a red dot appeared on the map, luckily with the buildings and parks exactly like how they were in! 

“Your local Boba and Tea shop is within 2 kilometers, would you like directions?”

With it, Lewis shook his head and the map left their sight. Happy to the demonstration, he waited for the girl’s reaction, but got distracted by Thomas’ abrupt comment. Dragging him from his happy feeling back to reality. . . The master’s anger at his situation made the boy feel guilty, had he been stronger than maybe such a thing didn’t need to happen. But, unfortunately, he wasn’t. The more he went on, the more concern the boy had.

“I—Its fine Thomas, they know we don’t want to fight, right? Right, Ā-Qing? If anything, they don’t seem to want to harm us! We don’t <em>have</em> to be fighting, we came here for a way to get away from the crowd remember?” 

In this, he tried to comfort the rambling master, but it had seemed he made his mind already. They wouldn’t be staying to train with the new group, just to rest. Lewis looked back at Ā-Qing, disappointment in his eyes. How did such a thing go wrong so quickly?

“S—sorry, the mean republicans have done a lot to him, that dragon and man aren’t the best of master and servants. . .”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Having spent as much time with his Servant as he did, it wouldn’t have been hard to garner a guess as to why she was behaving this way. To anybody else this simply would have seemed to be the thoughtless whims of an unbearably naive child, one whose sensibilities did not quite match up with the pragmatic values of her Master. Not that this was entirely wrong. She had befriended enemies and clashed with allies just few days prior, though those incidents were mostly caused by chance and oversight, a product of Ā-Q&#236;ng simply not knowing any better and frankly not being too concerned with the rules and regulations that governed the Tourney her Master had summoned her to fight in.

This was different.

Two days ago they had opened themselves to each other, and in the conversation that followed, Ā-Q&#236;ng had officially agreed to support her Master in his endeavor due to her own goal lacking a clear path and destination. She now knew who her allies were, who her enemies were, and so while she had blurred that line previously due to ignorance, this time she crossed it out of defiance.

Ā-Q&#236;ng spoke in a measured tone, her keen demeanor reminiscent of how she behaved when she first told him about Xī Shī, her childish mien peeled away just enough to make one realize that her actions were not guided by whim, but motivated intent.

“I want to help you fight and win because you said you wanted to make the world and the people in it a nicer place, not to break them. Or help those that do.”

She motioned towards Thomas, too weak to even stand comfortably and forced to sit on the ground without even looking for a nearby bench.

“Would you have done the same to them to win? The same things that the metal man and his Servant did?”

His condition was severe. Not just his body was broken, but his spirit too. To want to forget and run. To bury one’s regrets and failures and look the other way. That was no way to live, not happily at least, as it was only a temporary comfort that failed to address one’s aching heart as it continued to rot and fester. Ā-Q&#236;ng was no stranger to that sensation, and thus she said nothing as she weathered Thomas’ venomous sarcasm, simply regarding him helplessly as he vented his frustrations.

Not that she had much reason to care about him to begin with. To her, Thomas was simply another face in the crowd, one whose brutal defeat upset her of course, but ultimately someone she barely knew.

Which made his Servant’s unadulterated excitement all the more painful.

“I see…” she answered his impressive demonstration of his Noble Phantasm with a regretful smile, as she was sure they would have gotten along under different circumstances, though the current mood made sure to dampen her usual cheer, “Perhaps you can show me again next time when your Master is better. Whatever that mean dragon did to him must have really hurt.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alexander saw those words as a truly detestable rejection of Thomas&#39;s self. He had no drive and no ambition. &quot;If that is how you feel, then victory was never yours in the first place. Weakness has no place on a battlefield.&quot; Even though Thomas&#39;s current personality was dictated by his horrific loss, Alexander viewed it as a cowardly part of the boy that had shown itself as a result of the battle.

Alexander&#39;s attention turned towards Lewis as they revealed their tin can robot. Was that really Sacagawea? The monarch pushed his glasses up getting a closer look. He was very well educated in world history, so naturally Alexander knew all about Lewis and Clark. However, He did not expect Sacagawea to be some tin can machine. Perhaps it was just a manifestation of how Lewis viewed her? Or was Sacagawea really just a mystic code? &quot;I must say, I wouldn&#39;t have expected Sacagawea to be... Whatever that is&quot;

Alexander&#39;s tone was far less hostile to Lewis. At the current moment Alexander&#39;s problem wasn&#39;t Thomas&#39;s alignment, it was his attitude. Lewis on the other hand maintained a positive demeanor and was trying to diffuse the situation. 

Turning to his Servant Alexander raised his left eyebrow. Her question seemed nonsensical. The answer was obvious, could she not figur it out for herself? Alexander was willing to not only hurt, but kill for his goal. &quot;Yes&quot; Alexander quickly replied. &quot;I would do whatever it takes to win. People do not want the world to change Ā-Q&#236;ng, even if it&#39;s for the better. If someone stands in my way, I will do whatever it takes.&quot; There was a coldness in Alexander&#39;s voice, a feeling that Lancer wouldn&#39;t have felt from him before. This was the true nature of Alexander&#39;s ambitions. He was determined to see his goal through to the end no matter what the costs.

He may have been annoyed and slightly unsettled at the moment, but he was not impervious to others. Small hints and subtle gestures, otherwise invisible to the usual moody man, hardly escaped his slowed perception of time. Ā-Qing&#39;s silent, almost regretful look as he lashed out at her. Lewis&#39;s subtle attempt to comfort him by going back to their previous goal.

Small things like these helped put things into perspective.

The little girl wasn&#39;t the reason he was the way he was. The young boy wasn&#39;t working against him here. Even if he was hurt, there was no reason for Thomas to redirect that pain onto others... no, there was a selfish reason. <em>Because it felt good to unwind</em>. To take it out of your system. To complain out loud to someone, even if they’re in no way related to your issues.

But there was a specific time, a specific place, and specific people to do this to. And none of those three variables were applicable to the current situation. Thomas sighed, now a little ashamed of himself, and poked his head out towards the Servants.

Unsure how to continue without sounding whiny or annoyed, Thomas instead settled for a meaning-laden silence. His mood was recovering somewhat, and the first step in that recovery had been his renewed self-awareness. The little things, the perspective he regained. They helped him regain his bearings.

...but it wasn&#39;t long before Alexander&#39;s unsolicited opinion caused him to lose his temper again. The power of a few words, Thomas thought. Not only did his statement about his ambitions make little sense, as he knew as little as Thomas himself about what was going through his mind that day, but his following statement painted him as the bleak and frankly despicable man he was. Thomas was hardly surprised.

&quot;You&#39;d do whatever it takes,&quot; Thomas repeated hollowly, vaguely surveying the crowd in the distance. &quot;Of course you would. Makes sense why you’d side with Republic, you fit right in with Nikolai and his Lancer.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only that both he and Thomas trying to defend the idea that they were removing themselves from everything, though the loss the suffered clearly showed that. 

With Ā-Qing questioning her master’s goals and intent, her master scoffing at the fact that one of the participants of this war had been scarred by it, and how Thomas had to receive such backlash of everything, it was up to Lewis to try to reason with it all. When Alexander questioned his noble phantasm, he shook his head. He wouldn’t answer to a mean master. And to make it better, he spoke on such a thing.

“My master is right, we fought to defend against the people who came to take what Alexandria had. . . It isn’t fair for you to judge those who are trying to defend their home. The British had tried to do the same, and while America may have struggled at first, we came and won still!”

The words may have seemed out of place, but they had weight to them. If anyone could understand such a thought, it was Alexander, especially if he knew about America’s history and their bouts with the British monarchy. The republic may have started off correctly, but in the end, the victor would have to be Alexandria. The boy continued on.

“The metal man and dragon have taken my master’s will, but why are you fighting? Is there a reason you wish to fight in the war? My master fought because he deemed it best at the time. If Ā-Qing says that you’re trying to build a better world, then why are you destroying a place like Alexandria?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The contempt with which he belittled Thomas was clear as day. Almost as if he found the act of sharing the battlefield with an unworthy combatant itself insulting, a blemish on his own perfect record. And when he addressed his Servant he did so without hesitation, bluntly enlightening her about the lengths he would go to secure his precious victory. To rid the world of pain, ugliness, and coldness. Those were his words, the goal he shared with her when she allowed him a glimpse at her own wishes, but those promises may as well have been ashes in the wind for all the value they held to her at the moment.

“...liar.”

His kindness and warmth. His reliability. The love and compassion with which he spoke of his wife and children. Had they all simply been the surface to his ambitions, concealing the resolve and cruelty that lay beneath?

Ā-Q&#236;ng retreated a single step away from the man that claimed to be her Master, her feet unsteady as they found purchase on solid ground.

And while she was not exactly wrong, she had vastly underestimated his devotion. The darkness he himself harbored. The qualities which allowed him to not only maim, but even slaughter, should it bring him closer to victory.

Her vision blurred from moisture, eyes wide and unblinking as they beheld the man before her for what he truly was. Not a Master. Not a Father. But a Ruler.
Yet despite it all, he still insisted that he did what he had to change the world for the better. Even if he had to rid it of the people that opposed that very change.

“But what good is it if they are not around to see it anymore?”

Her voice quivered with forlorn anguish, her body seeming even smaller and more frail than ever before. As if crushed by his betrayal of her trust.

“What good is your world if Xī Shī looks at it and cries?”

Even the clothes he had bought for her on the day of her summoning now felt rough and coarse on her skin, the affection she had borne for them now gone with the wind. And her body would follow suit.

The moment her last word passed from her lips, her figure disappeared from sight, leaving naught but a blurred green flicker as her very presence was erased from existence. Like a midsummer mirage, she left no trace other than the gravel pushed aside by her shoes, an unexpected and sudden breeze the only reminder of the girl that had previously stood amongst the three men.

Just like that she was gone.

Thomas’ unique gift and Lewis&#39; inhuman perception may have been enough to allow them a glimpse of her movements, fleeting as they may have been. Rather than running or jumping, it was as if her body itself blinked in and out of existence at irregular intervals, as if she was only visible to the naked eye if viewed from a very particular angle, not unlike the prismatic reflections glimmering amongst the morning dew. This wasn’t speed attainable by mortal means, perhaps even out of reach for most Servants, as these were not the nimble efforts of someone that had mastered their innate agility, but a separate Skill altogether. Like a needle piercing and weaving across the fabric that was space, she quite literally Reduced the Earth between her and her destination with a mixture of physical finesse and the surgical application of her own Qi.

And now she used this uncanny ability of hers to its full extent, the fading image left by her shadows disappearing towards the Foreigner’s District as she ran.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While roping Alexander in with the likes of evil wasn&#39;t necessarily wrong, he didn&#39;t view himself that way. Rather he saw his actions as a necessary evil and net good for the world. His intentions were grand and his heart in the right place, or so he thought. 

Lewis took a more inquisitive and calm approach, instead of lumping Alexander in with his teammates, Lewis gave him the benefit of the doubt. Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s words had given the enemy servant a reason to hear Alexander out before instantly dismissing him. 

Pushing up his glasses, Alexander would prepare to go through the entire mission statement of Macedon. However, just before he could give his justification Ā-Q&#236;ng burst, displaying feelings of betrayal. Alexander had spent so much time gaining her trust and building a bond. He was always careful and meticulous with his words, making sure not to sour the child&#39;s opinion of him. However, the one time the ruler let down his guard was one time too many... He had spoken too much. 

Watching Lancer dash off with incredible speed, Alexander knew he wouldn&#39;t be able to catch her. An instant pursuit would be meaningless. Thoughts raced through Alexander&#39;s mind as he grit his teeth in frustration. He would need to think of a way to remedy his words to Lancer. Perhaps his explanation to Lewis and Thomas would be good practice.

&quot;I&#39;ll make this quick because I have to go... Being without a servant is dangerous afterall.&quot; Taking one more breath the monarch recomposed himself. &quot;I do not care for the republic and I owe them no allegiance. In fact I much prefer the contributions that Alexandria has made to the common person. However, there is more in my life then just myself. I have a family and entire cities of people placing their hopes in me. Everything I do is for them, just like the American&#39;s freeing themselves from the British. My countries best interest is my highest pr</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037155918330212462 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037155918330212462><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Nov-22 10:07 AM">10:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>iority. I am an opponent, not an enemy. I implore you to make a trip to Macedon one day, maybe then you will understand why I am fighting.&quot; 

Alexander reached from his pocket handing out a business card to both the servant and master. Whether or not Alexander was genuine or simply playing a political add for Macedon it was hard to tell. He was definitely genuine in some parts of his speech, but still the reality of his motivations would go unknown.

Liar? What had Alexander said to her to earn himself such a mouthful? Who was ‘Xī Shī?’ Before he could even attempt to answer these questions, A-Qing disappeared with a blink, much like Lewis when he had escaped the raging crowd. Just how agile was this little girl...

Her Master didn&#39;t say anything about it. Instead, he blabbered on again. It was really as if he had the gift of making Thomas angrier with every word. Even though his words seemed genuine, and the reason why he was fighting somewhat legitimate, Thomas still felt irredeemably annoyed towards him.

&quot;...what do you expect me to say? You want me to feel sorry for you?&quot; Thomas frowned, ignoring the card he was presented. &quot;I don&#39;t know you. I don&#39;t care how noble your reasons are. You caught me in a bad mood and you only made it worse by being a jerk, so you won&#39;t earn any sympathy points from me. &quot;

He painfully got to his feet from the ground, hissing as the sore muscles in his legs straightened. The act of moving itself was a pain, literally. The kind that made everything in your body hurt. But despite it, he still frowned as he looked up at Alexander. Something about what he said struck a chord, somewhere in his throbbing mess of a brain.

The words spun in his mind, endlessly echoing in that place where time stood close to a standstill. Instincts took over, moving beyond the words and into the specifics behind them. The hows, the whens, the whys. A casual approach at a network of possibilities that complexified the more he dwelled on it, but that seemed so simple in retrospect.

&quot;Not to mention, if you&#39;re looking to get that... &#39;wish&#39; or whatever it is Republic offers,&quot; He sighed, making quotation marks with his fingers. &quot;Then fighting for Republic is <em>one of the worst things you could have done</em>. You want to know why? Let me explain it to you. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make this quick too.&quot;

&quot;There are roughly eight different outcomes for you as a fighter in the tournament. You can either win or lose, and the faction you represent can either win or lose. Multiply that by two. Let&#39;s say you fight for Republic.&quot;

He closed one of his hands, leaving the other with four fingers in full view.

&quot;Half the time, when Republic loses, you’re not getting that wish. Too bad.&quot;

He closed two fingers on that hand, leaving only his index and middle fingers open.

&quot;The other half of the time, when Republic wins, another question arises: <strong>who gets the wish?</strong>” He waited a few seconds, letting the question sink, before continuing. &quot;Let&#39;s ignore all the outcomes when Republic doesn&#39;t hold up their end of the bargain, or when you die during a fight and thus can&#39;t use the wish for yourself, or when your competitors kill you in an attempt to steal the prize after the tournament is over. Let&#39;s all ignore the <em>worst</em> worst case scenarios, and look at the <em>best</em> worst case scenarios.&quot;

&quot;The worst case scenario is that the wish is split evenly among the winning fighters, and you are not one of those winning fighters. You get nothing. Boohoo.&quot;

&quot;The second worst case scenario is that the wish is shared equally among all the fighters, win or lose. I don&#39;t know how powerful a fifth of a wish is, but something tells me that even Republic’s resources don&#39;t cover the recovery of an entire nomadic city by a fifth of a wish. If it&#39;s even an option.&quot;

&quot;The third worst is that the wish is divided equally among the winning fighters, and you are one of them. A third of a wish is not bad. But again, is it enough to help Macedon?&quot;

He also couldn’t have been much help, especially since he himself didn’t know who Xī Shī was, nor the other names he had heard, but clearly they were important. He wished he could have met them. . . But now was not the time.

Alexander went on to explain himself, trying to absolve any sort of misconceptions that he had been given. He was not from here. Lewis was the one to take the card, looking at it while he stared at the location. Macedon. He was a king. While Lewis couldn’t seem be very happy with him being a ruler, especially having hailed from a democratic land, he did know he’d visit. If this tournament was to help his people, then maybe he couldn’t do much to say he was incorrect. 

In that, he stood there, conflicted on going about it. Condemning them wouldn’t be best, in the case of Alexander that is. Thomas continued going about, trying to get logistical with the opponent, but Lewis rose his hand, almost bold enough to say bluntly that what he said wasn’t needed for now. He thought that the republic was his enemy. . . But clearly, now that was something he didn’t expect. If he didn’t side with them morally, he couldn’t be blamed for the events. . . But where did that leave him and Thomas?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1037814030062067773 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1037814030062067773><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Nov-22 05:42 AM">05:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><img

Sorry for my master’s reasoning, but then I cannot be upset if you are in such a position. We know the Metal man and dragon are the enemy, they fought with the intent to kill both me and my master. But, if you’re fighting for your own homeland, then I can’t be upset with you. . .”

Lewis turned towards Thomas, knowing what he said could have sounded traitorous after all, but with his more concerned look over how his master would fare with the next branch of information, he couldn’t help but hope he’d given.

“We can’t pick fights with those who are not from the republic, he didn’t hurt us. . . And from what we know, we need to focus on trying to get your memory back. Let’s go. He should go find Ā-Qing, just like how she is upset, I can see you’re upset.”

He couldn’t do more than try to say it as calm as he could, the explorer bowed his head, all in hopes of excusing himself and his master. But he turned around and gave Alexander a small nod of acknowledgement. Macedon. He would visit it in the coming days.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hearing what he had to say on the matter, Thomas felt as if he was the only one standing against the irrational wall that was Alexander&#39;s ambitions. Was this really the extent of the recognition his Servant was going to give to the question? Sweep it aside with a wave of his hand, then ask him to leave?

&quot;As if it matters if he fights for his homeland!&quot; Thomas retorted to Lewis&#39; comment, pointing intently at Alexander. &quot;The end justifies the means <em>if</em> the end is reachable! This guy is at the point where his end is almost unattainable, yet he insists on fighting this stupid war as if it&#39;s going to be his salvation! Of course I&#39;m upset, what&#39;s <em>not</em> to be upset about?!!&quot;

Thomas paused, panting heavily after his grandiloquent speech, forgetting even his poor health for a second. A question dawned on him: <strong>Why did he care so much</strong>? He didn&#39;t know about Alexander ten minutes ago, and it&#39;s not like he had any connection to him, personally or otherwise. Why did he get so carried away then?

...

Thomas closed his eyes and took a deep breath, turning away from the group to show Alexander and Lewis his back. His face was hidden from view, unreadable.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; A single word, deep and meaningful. &quot;You&#39;re not a bad boy, Lewis. You&#39;re nice. But I don&#39;t think I can handle nice right now. You heard me just now, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

A pause. Then he continued.

&quot;I need personal space. To be alone with myself. I think that&#39;s what the me of the past would have done, because I&#39;ve been drawn to the idea of being alone for a few days now. I <em>need</em> to feel alone, if only for a little while.&quot;

“Sorry.” He said again before walking, not even glancing behind him, his exit a profound contrast to A-Qing&#39;s. Slow and meticulous, but inevitable all the same...

Until he finally disappeared from view, never to be seen in the park again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seemed no matter what the leader said, he was simply not compatible with Thomas at the time. He did not understand Thomas, and Thomas did not understand him. In fact the boys rant would do little criticize Alexander&#39;s true intentions of the war. While most people wanted the wish, Alexander would not bet on something so unlikely. He was not here to win the prize, it didn&#39;t even matter who actually got the wish. Instead the war was a showcase for Macedon, a giant advertisement for their greatness. 

Before Alexander could get a moment to explain himself to Thomas, the boy was already storming off. Even Thomas&#39;s servant had struck a nerve. Despite the boys verbal outburst, Alexander&#39;s mood remained unsoured. He was, if anything, delighted to see Lewis understanding his situation. 

&quot;Well, I suppose you should go after your Master. You two are a hot topic right now it&#39;s best not to leave him alone, even if he wants to be.&quot; Alexander placed his hands in his pocket coats, quietly contemplating where to look for Ā-Q&#236;ng.

He would step back preparing to leave. Hopefully she had just gone back to the hotel. &quot;Oh and Lewis. Do your best to keep you and your master alive now ok? I&#39;m expecting to see you on Macedon in the future. Just give me a call and I&#39;ll cover your transportation.&quot;

He hadn’t expected to chance upon land, and now, he hadn’t expected to think Thomas had been so ignorant of other people’s conviction. He tried to speak, but Thomas was quick to cut him off, not wishing to hear his blathering about something he felt so strongly about. . . And in an instant, when he wished to talk, he was gone.

Great. Just like Ā-Qing, now he had a master who was gone, only it hurt a lot more for him since he didn’t <em>do</em> anything wrong in the beginning. It wasn’t fair. Lewis went to turn tail to head towards Thomas’ direction, but he couldn’t exactly find himself to leave Alexander yet, that was until he had dismissed them two’s meeting to find his servant. 

“I will not need money, I’ll use my boat! Thank you, but now I must go find Thomas before he gets lost.”

And now, it left Alexander standing in the park. Both in search of their respective partners.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
