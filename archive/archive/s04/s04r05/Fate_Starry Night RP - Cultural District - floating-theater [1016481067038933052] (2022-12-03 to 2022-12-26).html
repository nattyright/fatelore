I do not think there was ever an actual &#39;beginning&#39;, nor is there to be an &#39;end&#39;. I simply woke up one day and realized that living without her was simply unbearable.

When did this happen? Am I broken? I treated her like worthless garbage in life. She hated me. She should hate me. She would hate me now, if she saw me. If she saw what I was trying to accomplish.

Yes. I, F. Scott Fitzgerald, am a shameless fraud who was catapulted to fame by plagiarizing my wife&#39;s work without permission.

Surely, my books were good on their own, before I met her. That changes nothing. I plagiarized as much as I could. 

Even if I were to write the greatest masterpiece of all, a &#39;Great American Novel&#39;, it wouldn&#39;t matter. One paragraph of fraudulence would cause the entire thing to burn.

Why?

Why is it that I am on the Throne and she isn&#39;t?

Or perhaps she simply didn&#39;t want to answer.

Yes, that must be it. 

I wish I could be just like Gatsby again, with that positive outlook. If I could at least hope for the chance to see her again, I think that would make all the difference.

If I could just be like Gatsby...

Then maybe...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His fingers were a blur as they danced across the typewriter, creating a blur of words on the page. He was getting close.

Perhaps it was time to set the stage?

&quot;His—my—parties are likely to gather a crowd.&quot; Fitzgerald murmured to himself as his fingers accelerated faster and faster. &quot;Even with Paganini&#39;s fame... The more people the better. Alexandria has people from both Neo Holy Empire and Republic within its borders. The city is more packed than it has ever been...&quot;

Fitzgerald took a deep breath and ran his hands through his hair. With both superpowers surrounding Alexandria, this was the prime location to activate his Noble Phantasm, with the exception of the Neo Holy Empire&#39;s seat of power.

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s get this show on the road!&quot; Fitzgerald roared as he pointed the Great American Novel at the sky. It shot up a beam of light, and an American flag ignited over the theater like a beacon.

It was massive, lighting up Alexandria like a second sun. 

&quot;And now, we wait.&quot; Fitzgerald said as he popped a vintage wine bottle and poured himself a glass.

&quot;Not for too long, I hope. I&#39;ve only got so much here with me. That shitty violinist drank all my wine.&quot;

Paganini...

That explosive buffoon had been nothing more than a muscle-bound brute to protect him as Gatsby. Even if the two were summoned from the same batch of Servant Frames. Fitzgerald felt little for the destructive tool.

Yet his heart turned slightly.

&quot;This is stronger than I thought.&quot; Fitzgerald blinked in surprise. &quot;Making me feel shit now of all times.&quot;

The man laughed hollowly, before wiping away a tear.

The intervention he manifested with Amelia and her Rider’s help back at the Culinary Bazaar had worked, opening up the walls he had covered his heart with. Although he still didn&#39;t feel comfortable talking about the issues that made him feel this way, he at least felt comfortable spending his days with Lewis at his house. His mind wasn’t fixated on that dreaded tournament fight anymore.

However, something was keeping him from completely relaxing. BenjaB, the reason behind his infiltration of the ServantPedia™ Head Offices, kept nibbling at his mind. BenjaB had lost faith in humanity, and now he was preparing to cleanse the world with his <em>Greatest Work</em>. Whatever that was. Of course, Thomas told Lewis everything he&#39;d discovered, but he wasn’t able to find anything more about either BenjaB or his Great Work since the day of his infiltration. There was a nagging fear brewing inside him that what he was about to do was going to be huge. As in <em>life-changing</em> huge.

Lewis had been the first to spot the huge American flag in the skies, and his boundless curiosity quickly screamed at him to go check it out with his own eyes. Naturally, he brought Thomas with him since they had just recently reunited. Besides, Thomas would have been lying if he had said he wasn&#39;t a little intrigued by the flag too. Something was bothering him, as if it had something to do with his concerns somehow.

Thus, two of them stood in front of the theater, right in the middle of the Cultural District.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He knew not to ask certain questions yet because of how fragile Barnes, though he acted now, truly was. He didn’t speak of the fight. He didn’t speak of what he were up to. He didn’t speak about how he felt afterwards. . . Not until the master had told him first. 

“You did a lot! More than I did, I went to Waku Waku Alexandria, and met with Rider and Amelia and they found me! That was basically all I could do. . .”

He sounded defeated as he spoke about it, and maybe he was. Such a fun thing to do, Thomas did, meanwhile he moped around like a sad and kicked puppy. But, he was here now, and that was what mattered the most. 

He was going to ask about getting of that tapioca tea  when a beep rang from his bag, and a familiar voice had alerted the boy of something unknowing. The bag ruffled, revealing the robotic toy that Lewis carried about. The mystic code named Sacagawea.

“Unknown Mana Signature detected. . . 4.6 miles away.”

It was definitely interesting to hear as the tin canned like item hadn’t often given such a warning on things that weren’t familiar, but maybe because it was so random, it felt so unfamiliar, it set the alarms of the thing off. Lewis cocked his head to the side. . . 

“Can we go see? What is it?“

He hadn’t <em>truly</em> asked the question of permission, rather it came off as a warning because once the boy stood, he already had Thomas’ hand in tow, pulling him out the door and towards the outside when he saw it in the distance. It was. . . Amazing! The red, white, and blue all together into one thing that seemed to resonate with everything around it. He <em>found</em> it.  The American flag. Sacagawea gave off another hesitant beep, as if to warn that in that direction it was where the unknown mana signature had come from, but Lewis shook his head and pulled. American Flag.

When they got to the cultural district, they found exactly what they’d been looking for, a large theater floating above the water. The rider turned to Thomas to point at it, the brilliance of excitement easily showing on his face.

The Blacksmith&#39;s weapons arrived as promised but the King had already lost interest in that particular party although he still took new weapons to replace the one he lost. Nimrod had sat in his throne room with only Lea to keep him company wondering if he was going to die of boredom. It was at this time he saw the American flag. To be frank it was an eyesore. He held no bad blood towards the United States of America. In fact he had a lot of respect for their ideology although it had failed when put into practice. His issue was that lighting a flag over Alexandria so obnoxiously was insulting to him. He had summoned his tower here and thus had claimed this land as his own. To raise the flag of a foreign power over his own land was the same as a call to war. It was unacceptable in every way. That was the reason why he had told Lea he was leaving and set out towards the cultural district expecting her to follow. 

He arrived at the scene of the crime only a short while later. Moving at a brisk pace he rushed straight past Thomas and Lewis to approach the theatre before pausing. He turned back looking down at the duo having recognised them out of the corner of his eye. His face contorted to that of disgust.

He had no kind words for the pair. He had of course been aware of their loss in the first round, the only stain on Alexandria&#39;s record.

It wasn’t the worst feeling in the world to be forced to move out of the tower, following behind his strides. Even if she showed reluctance at how obtuse she was to her input before moving, she understood the end result would most likely be the same.

The spectacle that loomed over the theater was something that intrigued her as well, anyways. She didn’t mind the opportunity to answer her own curiosity. Contrary to Nimrod, Lea didn’t see the gesture as <em>hostile</em> in particular. America hadn’t been a factor in the war between Alexandria and the Empire. The sore standout flag was a bizarre oddity.

She was far from the only person to think this, of course. By the time Lea had caught up to her own Servant, quite the crowd had formed nearby the theater.

“<strong>So</strong> many! There are so many people around here!”

The chatters were a testament to just how grandiose this set-up spectacle was. The ability to touch the populace was something Lea would normally express awe over. A charismatic display could help keep morale high. Right now, though, her attention was devoured by a different worry.

If this spectacle’s <u>intention</u> had been to gather this number of people, and whoever had set it up was, just as Nimrod assumed, malicious… there would be no way to stop any casualties.

That awareness caused Lea’s caution to heighten. No matter what the circumstances may have been, civilians getting dragged in wasn’t something she could condone. Her self-made promise was to protect Alexandria. That was the way she could be the most useful, she figured.

She took in deep breaths. Panicking, <strong>again</strong>, would do her no good. Unnecessary chaos would just create a stampede.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049171684537671690 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049171684537671690><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:53 PM">13:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Lea was one individual in a crowd of what seemed like hundreds… no, thousands. She could look for ‘something she could do’ all she wanted, but the outcome seemed gut-wrenchingly inevitable. It became a little bit easier to keep herself together when she spotted a couple of familiar faces, however.

“Oh, you’re…”

She was reluctant to greet them at first. Recalling all of her empty boasts during their last meeting made her quite embarrassed. Before Lea’s hesitation could show through, though, Berserker had already began commandeering the scene.

“Hey! There’s no reason to be so harsh, is there? We didn’t even get to battle, what if we had lost, Berserker?”

She turned over to the Mage and Caster with the slightest hint of hesitance.

“Long time no see. I… don’t remember your name. Sorry. Was it Barnes?”

She hadn’t given much thought to the other Master since their encounter, haughtily writing him off with her arrogance. On the contrary, whenever she began thinking about him, a sense of jealousy started to boil. It would have been more accurate to say she actively avoided thinking about him.

But come now, when he stood as a potential reliable ally, her regret over that callous dismissal ended up seeping through both her tone and demeanor.

“… Whatever! More importantly, do you have any idea what <em>that</em> is?”

Regardless of her apologetic attitude, however, it seemed like she still disliked dwelling on uncomfortable topics for long. Attempting to quickly move the conversation forwards, she pointed to the state of the theater.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was there anything to do but follow them in? Yet would Nimrod, a Berserker and a king of humanity, gladly shuffle in line? Nay, he was a <em>king</em>, and kings lead their people.

The doors into the auditorium creaked open as the two entered the theater&#39;s main stage. People took their seats overlooking the stage, as well as looking up at the stage.

As they shuffled inside, Lewis&#39;s Sacagawea beeped. This mana signature was familiar. His Noble Phantasm only had the chance to register the user in one interaction, and yet it was familiar.

After all, it was...

He sat on a pianist&#39;s chair, but the instrument before him was <strong>not</strong> a piano. Instead, it looked more like a massive typewriter. It continuously clicked out words as Gatsby stood up and took a bow.

&quot;<strong>It is so nice to see you all again.</strong>&quot;

Gatsby smiled serenely, yet something was off about his smile. It seemed false, like someone had described a smile to Gatsby, but the Servant himself had never done one before.

&quot;To think that I would see the four of you again. Lea, Thomas. <strong>Did you two find the answers you sought?</strong>&quot;

Little did Thomas know that his name was Nimrod and that they had already met before. His memory loss completely erased that conversation, preventing him from seeing the Servant as anything more than another crazy Alexandrian citizen. He frowned. It seemed that being quibbled with by random people on the street was inevitable, no matter if Alexandria already won two rounds or if a huge American flag randomly showed up in the sky.

His Master arrived shortly thereafter, addressing Thomas in a strangely familiar way, even calling him by name. She and her Servant knew him. He did not. The girl couldn&#39;t remember his name? How ironic. Meanwhile, Thomas couldn&#39;t remember their faces before they spoke to him. His stomach churned as he was reminded once again of his condition. This wasn&#39;t the first time he had met someone who knew him, but whom he had completely forgotten. These encounters were usually punctuated by awkward silences and painful smiles. And it seemed that Lea was one step ahead of both of those things.

&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t remember...&quot; He began, but her quick attempt to move on in the conversation silenced him. He looked at the main stage of the theater as Lea pointed at him, and reluctantly dropped his previous attempt to explain himself. Maybe some things were better left unsaid, at least for now. &quot;...no, I don&#39;t know what it is. That&#39;s what I came to check with Lewis. To be honest with you, I’m a little worried.

What was he doing here? <em>What was he doing full stop</em>?

Not to mention... something was different about him. On his face, Thomas found none of the sincerity and closeness he had shown at the hospital. But that was definitely Jay Gatsby. Even Sacagawea was reacting to his presence; there could be no mistake. Thomas struggled to find words to the sudden question he asked, moving closer to Lewis to try to calm his racing heart.

He hadn&#39;t found the courage to enter the memory cave. He hadn&#39;t worked through any of his problems. All in all, the Thomas who stood here today was not much different from the one Gatsby had encountered in the hospital. So of course, his answer was...

“<strong>No, I didn’t</strong>. I’m still at square one.” He paused, grabbing onto Lewis tightly for support. “What’s… what’s with the typewriter? And the flag? And that fight with Lancer… are you alright, Gatsby?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Which, judging by the way he tugged his master by his arm through the crowd just to find himself somehow lucky enough to teleport into such a large theater, leaving behind a mob of angry bystanders, it seemed to be quite easy to enter. 

When they entered the theater, Lewis found someone quite familiar, though quite obnoxious and rude. . . Nimrod. The king’s dismissive gaze was something of a threat in itself, if his words didn’t seem to fit the bill. The soldier looked back, shielding his master in the process.

“This is an American flag, <em>my</em> home! She welcomes the brave regardless of status of winner and loser, so me and Barnes are staying. And we fought regardless.”

He puffed his cheeks towards nimrod in his way of showing his upset look. He did feel bad that they loss, but they were not to leave such a place when he had been one to enter it! He was an American and there was an American flag, so clearly he was <em>supposed</em> to be here! Lea’s comment caused Lewis to nod his head fervently, agreeing in such a thing. They hadn’t even fought, and yet here they were condemning those who had lost! Her question and Thomas’s made Lewis interject, surprise on his face when they thought such a flag could be bad.

“America isn’t bad! Only heroes have America’s flag! Do you think bad people would have the best flag ever? Nope! America wouldn’t give them her best glance!”

And without saying much, only a push, he continued forward with Thomas towards the auditorium where rows of seating were empty, but a lone presence had been there, a man on the stage. Gatsby’s cheerful greeting made Sacagawea rumble once more, and yet her wielder continued to enjoy such a moment.

“Gatsby! You’re the American!? I knew it! It is good to see you too!”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049380396900556810 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049380396900556810><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Dec-22 03:43 AM">03:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Tachi#1290">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="animereader &#128141;#0413">@animereader &#128141;</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His words were of course aimed at Gatsby. He hadn&#39;t actually properly engaged in a conversation with the man. Yet he already knew he disliked him. Based off the little he saw and the praises that dog had spouted he had come to the conclusion that Jay Gabtsy was some type of fool.

</div></div>
Gabtsy had set off a change in Lea. While Nimrod disliked that he had meddled with his vassal&#39;s growth. The effects were ultimately positive. Perhaps they would have even been unachievable without him. So for that alone the King thanked him. Unlike the rest who stood in awe the King strode forward down the steps approaching the stage. He did acknowledge that something was off Gatsby but he had so little first hand experience with him that it didn&#39;t change his initial base impression of him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049446422996598784 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049446422996598784><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Dec-22 08:05 AM">08:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

Even when considering that Thomas’ disposition was clearly different from the first time they met, indicating that this was somewhat… peculiar of circumstances.

The dread of feeling all lone crept back. The situation that went beyond her own ability to control remained dire with no realistic source of help. Nimrod’s combat abilities would not take him far in evacuating the populace, after all.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t remember... no, I don&#39;t know what it is.&quot;

“I see. That’s a shame.”

A saddened whisper was the most Lea could muster in response to Thomas.

Not much after she decided to stop dawdling around, and at least try to convince <em>some</em> people of the potential danger, though, yet another familiar figure peeked out his head from the theater. The source of this playful exhibit had been—

“Gatsby! … Gatsby?”

At first, Lea happily exclaimed at his presence. But not even a second after her delight, she began to catch onto the awkward facade Gatsby had put on. After all, despite seeing yet another familiar face, she didn’t feel any more at ease.

“I wish I could say I’ve found answers, but all I’ve got are more questions, pal. So many to choose from, I can’t pick, but… I think I want to start by asking <u>what the purpose of this gathering is</u>.”

A cold sweat contrasted Lea’s forced cheerful attitude.

Something didn’t feel right.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You considered us... pals, Lea?&quot; Gatsby said, surprised. He wiped his eyes for a moment, before sighing. This made things harder. Curse Gatsby for befriending people. If only he could simply stay in this disguise for a little while longer.

Yet that wasn&#39;t possible. 

<strong>Step. Step.</strong> Gatsby&#39;s heels clicked as he turned back to the massive typewriter. It gave a sharp <strong>ding!</strong> as a page flew from the typewriter and into the sky, before dissolving into light.

&quot;Thomas, to think you could be so narrowminded. Amnesia is such a hardhanded character flaw. It&#39;s very rare that you get to see someone&#39;s character develop <strong>backwards</strong>, old sport.&quot; Gatsby whirled back around, sneering. &quot;But that does explain why you summoned Meriwether Lewis of all Servants. An immature Master for an immature Servant. I should introduce you to that little shit <strong>Jules Verne</strong> when I get the chance. You two would be insufferable together.&quot;

Gatsby plucked a pen out of the ether and began writing something in midair. His penmanship was far better than it had been when he had signed Thomas&#39;s card.

&quot;King of Babel, if only your tower reached its destination. What does it mean when a flag is placed on territory where it does not belong, your grace? You fought in many battles. <strong>You tell me.</strong>&quot;

&quot;But you four really are <strong>just a couple of Nimrods.</strong>&quot;

<strong>Tickticktickticktick...</strong>

<strong>Splatter.</strong>

To all but Lewis, pain would erupt across their bodies as various objects erupted across their bodies. Various clock hands pierced flesh, vision wavered, and bullet wounds erupted like hives across Lea, Nimrod, and Thomas&#39;s bodies.

To Lewis, however, it simply looked as if the other three were keeling over from an imaginary pain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gatsby&#39;s body became enveloped in pages as his coat fluttered in the wind. Sacagewea beeped sporadically as a new mana signature and Spirit Origin was detected.

&quot;<strong>What does it mean to have an identity?</strong>&quot; A quiet voice echoed out across the auditorium. The voice was quiet, yet sounded identical to Gatsby&#39;s.

&quot;<strong>It is a label, by which individuals can &#39;identify&#39; you as someone distinct by virtue of your personality. If that&#39;s the case, then people who perceive you as that personality make you that person. Your identity changes.</strong>&quot;

Blank checks signed by Jay Gatsby blew past the four. Yet the names on those checks began to change.

&quot;<strong>And if you are the only person to exist on Earth, you therefore have no identity, because there is no need to distinguish others. There is no need for personality, because there is nobody else to interact with. </strong>

&quot;<strong>When I hosted my first party, and announced myself as Jay Gatsby, that was who I became, because it was what people expected and wanted to see. In that moment, people thought I was Gatsby, and so I thought that I was too. I became the affluent gentleman you came to know.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>When I woke up from that hollow dream, and realized who I was...</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>There was no need to hide myself behind a personality I knew to be false.</strong>

The names on the checks faded completely, before being replaced by the signature of &#39;F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;.</span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeLKAEq98Qu3UuCobhSupSg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>AsK_0</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7lpiHRXVZ0"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">False Transmigration of the Soul ~ FGO ver.

&quot;Paganini is dead. My Greatest Work is bordering on completion. Thanks for going through my garbage like a racoon, by the way.&quot; Fitzgerald waved at Thomas.

&quot;Yet if I were to leave things like this, I would be a poor author.  Furthermore, I need to stretch my legs. How are we feeling?&quot; 

Fitzgerald asked as he leaned against the typewriter. He gave it an unceremonious kick.

&quot;Yes, it must be quite painful. Intrusive surgery often is. I&#39;ll make sure to send you the medical bill. Does the Tower of Babel have a P.O Box?&quot; Fitzgerald wondered aloud. &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a Curious Case, I&#39;ll admit. Nonetheless, if someone like me can live with it, I&#39;m certain you all can too!&quot;

Fitzgerald struck a winning smile. Was this person really <em>Gatsby?</em> He locked eyes with them. Goodness, the <strong>eyes were identical</strong>.

He looked at his body in disbelief, expecting some kind of attack to have grazed him but ultimately finding nothing. He looked around him, at the annoying Nimrod and his Master, at the crowd inside the theater… what was happening to him? Who was causing this?

And then Gatsby spoke, and Thomas’ pupils narrowed down to a single point. The words came in slow motion, yet their impact didn’t register until he was done talking. Gatsby put both him and Lewis down with enmity and venomousness, his unprovoked trash talk extending even to Lea and Nimrod. He hit all of them hard and indiscriminately; a verbal drive-by. None of his warmth remained, none of his kindness or sympathy came through. He was cold. He was distant. He was filled with hatred. <em>The polar opposite of Jay Gatsby</em>.

The checks blew past Thomas, yet he could see their content oh so clearly thanks to his gift. He helplessly watched the name Jay Gatsby fade and morph, turning into one he didn’t recognize. But the fact that he didn’t know F. Scott Fitzgerald mattered little, because to him, he was known as…

“<strong>BenjaB!</strong>” Thomas barked through the pain, his legs shaking as he struggled to stand upright. “It’s you, you’re… you’re not Gatsby. You posed as him to gather us here, you faker… you faker!”

Yet as he said those words, his mind connected the dots. These eyes, they were the spitting image of Gatsby’s. Yes, those eyes… they looked so similar to his.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“We’re quite mature, Gatsby what do you mean? That wasn’t very nice. .—“

His words seemed to all be stopped when from his peripheral, the others dropped to their knees and Thomas to his shoulders, pain manifesting on their faces. Something was wrong. The boy went to his master’s side, trying to inspect what such a thing could cause such a scene. But, as he tried to find something invisible, Gatsby continued his way down. 

Lewis tried to utter something to see what could have been the problem, but, no words could come, instead he turned towards Gatsby only to see a flurry of papers billowing about. Sacagawea began to sound off its emergencies signals. A new mana signature appeared. The questions were aimed at no one, or to the author’s dismay, no one dared to answer back. Yet, Lewis found himself having to watch between his sight of the papers forming around the servant, empty checks fluttered about the room like sheets of snow, coving the walls and floors. It wasn’t until the empty ones had finally ended that Lewis could truly get a glimpse of who it was, and finally, when the being behind the curtain of white revealed themselves.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049774585907785789 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049774585907785789><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Dec-22 05:49 AM">05:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His appearance had changed drastically, from his cheerful blonde hair to the now muddied brown look, his dapper attire changed with mundanity, and his once cheerful presence soured and rotted through.

The rider stood up, the new figure before him keeping the same smile its old body had and yet, Lewis rose a sword to it. 

“You must be Scott F. Fitzgerald, the author Gatsby spoke of. . . I don’t know what could make you try to hurt another person like my master or Nimrod and his master, but you should stop it!

As he opened his mouth to begin a retort the pain struck. He looked down in shock as his body erupted open with all types of strange anomalies. He fell to one knee, the pain being too much for him to ignore. First though he looked back to check on Lea more concerned for her safety. He saw that she, just like him, had been assaulted by this strange occurrence. He grit his teeth as his rage began to build.

His words came between gasps as he questioned what it was the writer was doing to him. He was surprised by the turn of events but perhaps not quite as much as the rest. He had from the beginning found it strange that a fictional character had been summoned as a servant. He had also noticed the lack of a master. He hadn&#39;t cared enough about the man to investigate further though. It was logical that &#39;Gatsby&#39; had been some type of extension of his own creator. Still this simply proved his intuition correct. He had disliked Gatsby from the minute he met him despite his dazzling smile and eyes  To him it had seemed rotten. More rotten than anything else he had witnessed in Alexandria. Even now something else alarmed

A myriad of items shot out of her, none of which were designed with the human body in mind. She wanted to scream, but feared to even acknowledge the situation. She distracted her own mind elsewhere. She needed to protect the civilians. She opened her eyes in an attempt to look to her surroundings. Was anyone else in the crowd affected?

Nimrod and Thomas both seemed to undergo the same pain, each brought to the ground. That made Lea realize she had toppled over as well. Pushing off the ground with all the little strength she had leftover, she attempted to get up again.

Just like Thomas could, it wasn’t much of a challenge for Lea to see through the fact that ‘Gatsby’ was just a disguise. But that wasn’t the full story— far from it. His choice of words, his actions, and his cynicism were more than enough evidence that Gatsby was no more. But Fitzgerald, the figure who most likely was the originator of this psychological attack, kept Gatsby’s lighthearted sense of humor.

Lea quite liked that casual, free-going tone. It was something they shared to a limited degree, after all. Lea grew fond of those eyes. They were humble, but showed just the perfect amount of confidence. When thinking back to it, she probably envied Gatsby’s wisdom. Wanted to be able to keep up the same carefree yet reliable demeanor as he did.

It was like all those familiar traits she liked became perverted to create this new stranger. He was so close to Gatsby, and yet nothing like him. Or at least, he was nothing like Lea’s vision of what Gatsby was meant to be like.

“Surgery my ass!”

With the slightest hint of anger, Lea yelled out.

“What, putting on some glasses made you want to play doctor or something? You look terrible in them, let me just say!”

Every word that left her mouth felt painful. But no part of her stubbornness would permit her to stop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049890996659441764 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049890996659441764><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Dec-22 01:31 PM">13:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I never asked for a diagnosis, much less from some gloomy loser like you!

It is a lie we tell each other, until we continue to believe it. Over, and over we whisper it into one another&#39;s ear.&quot;

The typewriter dinged, and another page went into the sky. A star on the flag winked into existence. With a quick count, there was only 48. To Lewis, that wasn&#39;t right. There were 50, not 48! What happened when every star on that flag lit up?

&quot;No, no. To me, <strong>you are all American.</strong>&quot; Fitzgerald smiled graciously as he snapped his fingers, heeding Lea&#39;s request. The pain vanished as quickly as it began. &quot;After all, you all have hopes. You have dreams. When I wrote Gatsby into this world, he had those as well.

As the pain left the three, Fitzgerald doubled over for a moment. His face winced. Was he experiencing the pain they were all feeling? Of a thousand symbols, from all his various works? After a moment, Fitzgerald&#39;s face hardened and he stood up.

&quot;<strong>Ah, Thomas. We shitposted together spectacularly, wouldn&#39;t you say?</strong> Shame you had to spill the ink before the page set. You would have sat here by my side. We could have saved the world <strong>together!</strong> Paganini is bleeding out somewhere, so I could always use another ally.&quot;

Fitzgerald turned to look up at the sky. &quot;I will do what this Grail Mud did, a century ago. I will do what our little King of Shinar attempted to to millennia ago. Humanity will unite within my Noble Phantasm, <strong>Write Like Fitzgerald.</strong>&quot;

 &quot;<strong>It would not have been possible without Gatsby&#39;s help, you know?</strong> You all parleyed with him, in some degree. You treated him with respect and courage, and your courage is up in the stars now. Gatsby was not real, but his <strong>dreams most certainly were.</strong> Your dreams will build his: <strong>a world where humanity is one, without pain and misery.</strong>&quot;

Nimrod, Lea, even Lewis… they all stood up against him, some more aggressive than others, completely rejecting the person standing next to the giant typewriter at the other end of the theater. After all, how could they not? He attacked them, pretended to be Gatsby to lure them in, and was a gigantic, needlessly abrasive asshole. A murderous asshole even, judging from what he revealed of the brazen virtuoso’s fate.

But even then... he was an asshole with a noble goal in mind. To counter the grail mud and unify humanity. It was hard to disagree with such a goal. Even if one could argue that unifying humanity through supernatural means was worthless, it was also far from evil. If Thomas thought Fitzgerald was an irredeemable villain when he first showed his true colors colors, after saying his piece and connecting the dots, he now had second thoughts.

<em>…you would have sat here by my side. We could have saved the world <strong>together</strong>!</em>

Maybe he would have. He too wanted to do good for the world and restore peace, before his memories faded away. Fitzgerald knew the real him better than anyone, better than himself even. What if he was telling the truth and it was what his past self would have wanted? And if he was indeed telling the truth, <em>then what right did Thomas have to question his purpose and stand in his way?</em>

In that moment of hesitation, as the pain of a thousand needles slowly faded from his body, Thomas&#39; hold on Lewis faltered and he followed the direction of Fitzgerald&#39;s gaze. He looked up at the sky, unsure if his dream really was somewhere among the stars.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He leaped. Jumping from where he was landing in front of Gabtsy. In a manner of seconds Nimrod’s new sword had been drawn and pressed against Fitzgerald&#39;s neck. He had made a dangerous statement that served to infuriate the King further. He claimed to be able to do something even he had been unable to do. An impossibility.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Heaven? Is that what you&#39;re referring to?

</div></div>
The blade slowly dag deeper into the writer&#39;s neck beginning to draw blood. His patience had worn thin of Fitzgerald&#39;s vague comments. He hardly knew what he was saying. He was truly just on the verge of killing him and being done with it. Yet he remained curious of this world he hadn&#39;t been able to shut up about even as Gatsby.

Gatsby could do such a thing to others so easily? That. . . That was what he couldn’t wrap his head around! He was going to contradict him when a flag appeared before him, it’s beautiful colors shining brilliantly on the group, but there was a flaw on such a thing. . . Of 50, there was only 48 stars, but Fitzgerald still continued on, as if the flaw hadn’t been evident.

His justification of them all being American almost sickened the boy, he was a hero! A person who fought for the people he had come to know and enjoy, and yet here Fitzgerald was trying to explain what being <em>American</em> was to him? It was like a child explain to a parent what being an adult was like! 

“If that’s the case then you’ve killed your fellow man! And any American knows that the flag has 50 not 48!”

He waited not for Gatsby’s monologue on his ideas to finish, rather Lewis shouted before he could even get to the next part. With it, he hadn’t waited to for something else to happen to Thomas them, rather once Thomas got his bearings, Lewis was quick to cut his line of sight of the author, the offer he extended to him immediately rejected by Lewis and the way he waved his blade as if defending from invisible wordings.

“Thomas has to worry about himself, and he has me, we don’t need another servant, especially one who’d hurt his master so quickly.”

His statement about trying to unite the world into a world of no suffering and pain hadn’t been something he could speak of, but he was surprised when Nimrod had his own rebuttal to the claim.  With it, Lewis nodded his head, determined that the king was correct.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050185567842877481 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050185567842877481><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Dec-22 09:02 AM">09:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="animereader &#128141;#0413">@animereader &#128141;</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Tachi#1290">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finally managing to bring herself to acknowledge it, and yet, the same ‘friend’ stood right in front of her. It wasn’t as though he died, or anything changed. She just lacked the full picture.

It seemed as though she was even more narrow-minded than she gave herself credit for. She was blind not only to her own dream, but also to those around her. She couldn’t realize Nimrod’s insecurities, nor did she even suspect just how corrupted Gatsby’s true nature had been. Even Thomas, standing right besides her— there were probably a thousand crucial things she didn’t know about him.

But, if nothing else, she couldn’t deny how alluring the prospect of his ‘dream’ sounded. That charisma, the jaded author in front of her perhaps shared with Gatsby.

“My Berserker is making straightforward sense for once. How do you plan on achieving something like that? I couldn’t even fathom it.”

She admonished Fitzgerald on the surface. But the most minuscule hope was unmistakably there in her eyes.

Forty-nine stars now floated in the sky above, all while Fitzgerald popped another vintage glass of wine. To Thomas, what Cassius had said was right. Fitzgerald could drink!

&quot;<strong>You don&#39;t? Pity. I was wondering if you wanted to be reunited with dear old Clark.</strong> Wagging his finger, Fitzgerald took a swig from the bottle.

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

The bottle smashed against the pavement, with the wine pooling like blood around Fitzgerald and Nimrod&#39;s feet. Fitzgerald looked at the blade with a mixture of concern and apathy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050269428450861107 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050269428450861107><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Dec-22 02:35 PM">14:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;With pleasure, O&#39; King of Humanity.&quot; Fitzgerald yawned as he eyed the stage. &quot;Because you were trying to reach a tangible place, Nimrod. What is a dream? Where does it come from, and where will it go? Every person has one, yet not all are achieved. If you want the truth, <strong>dreams represent our unbridled potential.</strong>&quot;

&quot;Every person has a dream, and all dreams are part of the same whole. Arthur Pendragon wanted to rule a prosperous nation. You wanted to reach heaven for the betterment of your people. Siegfried wanted to slay the dragon Fafnir. Lewis and Clark wanted to explore the world. What do these all have in common?&quot;

Fitzgerald smiled.

&quot;<strong>They all make you happy.</strong>

What?

&quot;Yes. Tell me, Nimrod. When you watched that tower reach into the heavens, did it make you happy? Did you feel joy at the better lives that your subjects would have when you reached God? <strong>Didn&#39;t you?</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>All dreams are happiness and paradise made manifest. You will help me make paradise, King of Shinar. You, your subjects, and everyone here. Observe!</strong>&quot;

The audience stood up, and Nimrod saw words had been written onto their bodies, with blank faces. They put their hands up in the air.

And magical energy erupted from Fitzgerald. More than any Servant Nimrod had encountered in that very moment. 

Yet it wasn&#39;t simply one person&#39;s magical energy. It was an incalculable number, and it was only getting higher.

There was only one thing to do in this scenario, wasn&#39;t there? Attack. Even if Nimrod&#39;s subjects had turned against him, the king would have to fight to protect their honor, to protect his kingdom!

She wanted to reject the notion. Even if it was nothing but a mask, surely there was a <em>small</em> part of Fitzgerald who did think fondly of Paganini. So she looked. She looked for any signs of hesitation, or remorse, or— <strong>anything.</strong> But Lea either came up empty, or lacked the perception to find anything deeper.

… She couldn’t bring herself to allow any wishful thinking any longer. That’d lead to her repeating the same mistakes for a second time. So with a heavy heart, she took Fitzgerald’s words at face value. Once she did, an infuriating irritation surfaced.

Unmistakably, <em>some</em> of it was genuine. But as for where Gatsby ended and Fitzgerald started, Lea was completely in the dark.

She didn’t stop Nimrod. She didn’t think she had the right to. It was hard enough to figure out how <em>she</em> should react, it didn’t feel right to tell Nimrod how he should. But once the magical energy surged around Fitzgerald, a momentary sense of fear made her question if she should have ordered Nimrod to kill the man playing god at the very start.

Even to her amateurish eyes, it was evident just how ludicrous of a process Fitzgerald initiated. It differed from her own dumb dream, formed with more ambition than it could sustain. The jaded author fully intended to rewrite the world under his vision. His dream.

“… Whatever your dream might be, you made it with a solid <strong>foundation</strong>, huh?”

It wasn’t a plan designed out of impulse. Fitzgerald’s determination and vision were both shiningly bright. Even if her every instinct told her it would be the wisest to stop him, right now…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050326962394120212 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050326962394120212><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Dec-22 06:24 PM">18:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“—Do what you want, Berserker.”

She sat down with eyes clearer than ever, refraining from using the Command Seal that would make Nimrod’s attack much swifter. Lea had made her choice, and she’d see it through to the end.

“As for me, I… <strong>I want to see through what shape his dream takes.</strong>”

Would it be too late to reverse her decision after allowing the ritual to finish? Maybe. If so, yet another mistake would pile onto Lea’s countless regrets.

But the young girl sincerely decided to give out <strong>Fitzgerald’s envisioned world</strong>, not Gatsby’s, a try with her very own eyes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The situation around them seemed to rapidly turn sour, it seemed. Controlled by Fitzgerald, the audience around them stood up and waved in the air. He didn&#39;t understand what they were doing at first, but then his attention was drawn to Fitzgerald&#39;s sudden surge in magical power. Did the audience empower him, somehow?

The exchange between Lea and the writer was painful. Thomas knew Paganini and his relationship with Gatsby. If Gatsby was Fitzgerald, or at least a part of him, then he could not have been so cruel and so heartless.  He wasn&#39;t such an asshole, Thomas was almost certain.

In that case, even if his goal was to create an ideal world, what kind of ideal world would it be without his only friend? *Without his wife? Could Fitzgerald have been so selfless, sacrificing his own happiness for that of others?

&quot;...no. You&#39;re not being honest with yourself.&quot; He muttered, flinching at the broken wine bottle that was tossed.

Thomas detached his gaze from the writer to observe his surroundings, which were currently overrun by hundreds of blank faces. He turned to look at his Servant, but it looked like Lewis was out of it after Fitzgerald mentioned Clark. That shithead sure knew how to string words together to get to others, didn&#39;t he? Thomas patted Lewis&#39; shoulder and woke him up from his lethargy, mentioning the audience with a nod.

I will immediately burn a command seal if I need you by my side, so don&#39;t worry about me... and don&#39;t let him get to you, Lewis. Show me you&#39;re stronger than that.&quot;

He hugged the Rider tenderly, then turned the other way. On the other side of the theater, Nimrod was at odds with Fitzgerald and Lea simply stood there. Perhaps she had come to the same conclusion he had, that Fitzgerald&#39;s vision was at least worth considering. That an ideal world created by his hands might be the best alternative.

...but if it was at his own expense, then it wasn&#39;t really an ideal world. And if it wasn&#39;t an ideal world, then there were indeed reasons to stop him. Thomas ran toward Lea and Nimrod, arming himself with his newfound determination with every step he took.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He agreed with Fitzgerald&#39;s sentiment about dreams. A dream was simply the unbridled potential of a human not yet reached. He didn&#39;t believe that all his dreams were actually practical and achievable for the individual. But the potential is there. Such is a part of being human. Dreams made them happy. He of course had to admit that seeing his tower grow day by day brought him happiness. A paradise on earth that brought that type of happiness would very much be like heaven, that was true. He watched as the blood like wine pooled around his feet. Yet he couldn&#39;t quite accept it. He lowered his blade taking a step back

A pathetic end for a pathetic man. Yet despite his patheticness he had a dream that brought him much joy. He wanted to see the world that you spoke of. You took his dream away from him.

He frowned as Fitzgerald&#39;s magical energy began to boom. Action was needed but his master had left his next action to his own discretion.

I already have a dream of my own. Why should I prioritise completing your dream over my own. How do I know your paradise won&#39;t inhibit the completion of my dream. The same goes for all the people you&#39;ve gathered here. They have dreams of their own; they should be allowed to prioritise their dreams. My master doesn&#39;t have a dream right now but she shouldn&#39;t have to help you. She should be allowed to focus on finding a new dream that makes her happy. The happiness you speak of comes from following a personal dream unique to you. Any happiness you could give us would be false. We don&#39;t need an ounce of it.

He didn’t know of her, he had no right! He wanted to see Clark again, but to say it out loud made him almost hate that the author was correct in his feelings. 

“Clark. . .”

The feeling made his blade of the sword loosen for a bit. He could feel the adventure, it was him at his best. He tried to snap back to attention, right to where Fitzgerald’s speech had began. The author wasn’t wrong, he could have listed off the wants and desires of people and that would have been all the truth, but to hear it, Lewis felt it was something far away. A fleeting dream. He couldn’t explore with Clark anymore, he knew he wouldn’t. And maybe that was what saddened him. That he couldn’t go so far as he wanted.

Lewis stood there motionless, curious as to what he had to say next, but as the burst of magical energy came about, and Sacagawea‘s alerts begin to sound once more, it’s screeching beeps showing all the dangers ahead of them. The audience seemed enamourer with the man, and he too felt the slight urge to want to follow about a path where he could re-experience the same joys as before. But, Rider felt a weight on him, Thomas steadily leaning onto him as he pushed the thought back. He was right. He wasn’t being honest with himself. Clark wasn’t here now. And he was here for a reason, the purchase was long past it’s time, and while he would have begged to redo it, the boy knew it wasn’t possible. It was the past.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050598642798563428 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050598642798563428><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Dec-22 12:23 PM">12:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Thomas’ command came with a swift head nod, he was to stop the audience?

“Gotcha! Let’s begin then!”

And with it, while Nimrod began his assault on Fitzgerald, he went to the audience, quick to use the blunt side of his cutlass to forcefully but precisely pound people into submission, careful not to harm them in major ways.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;<strong>...?</strong>&quot; The author looked down at his chest to see a knife sticking out of his body. He blinked once. &quot;<strong>Oh.</strong>&quot; 

Nimrod&#39;s blade dug into Fitzgerald&#39;s body, yet as he attempted to plunge it into his actual heart, it was like Nimrod had struck a brick wall. He couldn&#39;t stab Fitzgerald&#39;s heart, yet his blade had pierced flesh. Blood was dribbling from the wound. Not words, like Gatsby had bled.

&quot;<strong>Have you already forgotten?</strong>&quot; Fitzgerald asked Nimrod, waving a pen in his hand. Nimrod saw words crawling across the knife like insects.

<strong>RADTATATATATATATATATATATATAT!</strong> Fitzgerald unloaded a clip of machine gun rounds into Nimrod&#39;s chest, leaving several dozen <strong>L</strong>s across the king&#39;s body. Fitzgerald stepped away, before dissolving into words. He reappeared further up the stage.

Several pages fluttered around Fitzgerald, before flying towards Nimrod in attempt to shred his body apart. Papercuts were deadly, after all.

All the while, the typewriter continued to make noises as words appeared on the page.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They were now effectively living through their dreams, dancing to the tune of Fitzgerald&#39;s words, little more than puppets of flesh.

Then it hit him, and his face distorted in horror.

Was this the fate that awaited him and the others? Fitzgerald&#39;s Greatest Work? Thomas felt sick to his stomach. He didn&#39;t want to end up like them. He absolutely loathed the idea of being controlled by someone, even if they meant to make him happy. It was sickening, artificial, bogus... a fate worse than death, you could argue.

Suddenly, Thomas was snatched away by the blanks’ hands, unable to reach Lea and her brazen Servant. He tried to forcefully make his way through them, in vain. The damned writer had planned it all, he would not give them a chance to fight back.

But even if he couldn&#39;t physically reach them, he could still use his voice.

&quot;Is that your ideal future, Fitzgerald?!&quot; Yelled Thomas. &quot;Completely rejecting reality, trapping everyone in a fake world filled with illusions... how can you call that your Greatest Work? How can that even remotely be a good idea! It’s not what I want, and I’m convinced it&#39;s not what I would have wanted back then either!&quot;

Using his small stature and fast reflexes, Thomas tried shaking and grasping the crowd&#39;s grasp to reach the other pair and the writer.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="10-Dec-22 08:44 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was cut off as Fitzgerald unloaded his bullets into the King&#39;s chest. Pausing his assault he removed his sword stumbling a few steps back. As Fitzgerald escaped he took the chance to inspect his wounds. The bullets hadn&#39;t been penetrated too deeply. So while he was now still bleeding out he wasn&#39;t compromised. He was irritated that a simple author had landed such a hit on him. He made a clean jump straight over the paperwork refusing to allow another strike to land. He himself landed off the stage looking up at the others. He took a look around now, noticing the state of those in the theatre. As he fully realised what was going on he froze. The man had trapped them in their own dreams. Was this really the Paradise Fitzgerald had been fighting for&#160;

He roared. His rage had peaked. Lea in all her time as his master had never seen her Berserker so angry. His eyes had lit up with murderous intent, his breath had become frenzied and uncontrollable.

His words coming out fast and dripping with venom.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050904306641023057 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050904306641023057><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Dec-22 08:38 AM">08:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

He leapt forward once more. Now making use of both his superior strength and ability he shot forward closing the gap between him and Fitzgerald in less than a blink of an eye.

In fact, it seemed it wasn’t affected at all.

“It isn’t working! This isn’t fair at all! How do we fix it?”

Lewis cried out to Thomas, he hadn’t fully been able to dwell well with the fact that he wasn’t doing so hot with trying to get that typewriter to stop! He awaited an answer when he heard gunshots in another direction, having him turn towards Nimrod and his master, the king’s chest riddled with bullet wounds.

The situation wasn’t the best way to go about it, especially with how he didn’t know at all what Gatsby was capable of! He turned back to face Thomas, then back to Fitzgerald, only then to the worshipping people. There were so many things that needed to be done, and all of them needed to be done at once!

Rejecting reality while dancing under someone else’s fingertips, to the lost girl, didn’t sound like the worst thing in the world. Independence was scary, as she had recently found out. If she threw that independence away, would it make her happier?

… Her instincts told her that it would not. Rejecting control from her parents was how she got to where she was. Conversely, however, it means she had never given letting go of control a try.

A paradise that would allow her to realize her wishes in full sounded like a marvelous wonderland. Unlike Thomas, she had no reason to reject Fitzgerald’s dream strongly.

As Nimrod battled, the artificial circuits in her heart flared up. She always came one step short of getting used to this feeling. The high-grade circuits forcefully engrained onto her when she didn’t know any better, stemming from her parent’s high expectations of her as a Mage.

What-ifs crossed her mind infinitely.

If she had just listened to her parents, and lived a life that allowed her to become a Mage, would she have been happier?

If she had listened to her parents, and refrained from joining the war, would she have been happier inside that ignorance?

“Don’t keep me waiting so long.”

There was only one way to find out. Crouched on the floor while completely idle, only flinching for a moment when Thomas and Lewis began knocking out civilians, only to calm down once she realized they were aiming to incapacitate, she allowed Fitzgerald’s play to reach the next stage.

“—I think every dream deserves a fair shot.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Clickclickclickclickclickclick.</em>

&quot;<strong>That is a... precaution.</strong> It&#39;s not ideal, but I needed them to stay put. See, kings, authors, and musicians are identical. <strong>We all require an audience to maintain our power.</strong> A king with no kingdom is a beggar. An author with nobody reading their words is nothing. A musician with no listeners might as well lack fingers and hands.&quot;

Fitzgerald spread out his arms. &quot;<strong>Though our violinist might have known a thing or two about that.</strong>&quot;

The way that Fitzgerald spoke about the audience was one of resignation. However, there was a hint of tenderness in his voice, and was that <em>nostalgia?</em>

People during Fitzgerald&#39;s time were into the rampant excess. Drugs, alcohol, and parties. Being completely unconscious while experiencing happiness must be completely normal for him.

&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate. However, I need them to stay, and so they will. I will revert them shortly.

The paper still in the typewriter was plucked out of the device, and Fitzgerald pulled out a pen. He saw his warped reflection on its surface. 

&quot;I&#39;ll finish it myself.&quot; Fitzgerald whispered to himself fervently. &quot;I just need a bit of ink...&quot;

<strong>Splatter.</strong>&quot;

<strong>Thud.</strong>

Fitzgerald collapsed as Nimrod&#39;s blade cleaved him from shoulder to hip. That was odd. Nimrod meant to cleave the author in half with his sword, not merely wound him.

Yet words crawled around Nimrod&#39;s sword as well. Even with his back turned, Fitzgerald was inhumanly fast with his pen.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051229396897386698 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051229396897386698><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Dec-22 06:10 AM">06:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/V0gfc6m3qJg">https://youtu.be/V0gfc6m3qJg</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfb7SiX9k7y1LkGyepdEGdg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>J.O.E.

He was only a simple Caster. He was no Gatsby, who instilled loyalty and bravado. He was only Fitzgerald. If only he were Gatsby right now... Things might be different.

If only Paganini were here with him.

...Paganini?

&quot;Ha...&quot; Fitzgerald coughed. &quot;I guess I missed him a little more than I thought. Thank you for the ink, Nimrod.&quot;

With a trembling finger, Fitzgerald dabbed it in blood, and wrote the final sentence that Lewis had prevented.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">And to be human, is to chase that light in the harbor until it cannot be grasped.</code>

There were still numerous ways for Nimrod to kill Fitzgerald: with his hands, debris, crushing him under his own typewriter... The list went on and on. Yet before any of these actions could be realized, Fitzgerald threw the page into the air. All fifty stars in the sky lit up.

The last thing the group heard were three words:

&quot;<strong>Write Like Fitzgerald.</strong>&quot;

The final sight of Fitzgerald was his body unraveling into words, before erupting into a bright light that swallowed Nimrod. Shortly after, Lea joined her Servant, and both Thomas and Lewis were sucked into the Bounded Field as well.

Slowly, the entire <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#floating-theater</span> was swallowed up as well.

First, this theater.

Then, Alexandria.

Finally, the world.

For a time, it would all become one.
