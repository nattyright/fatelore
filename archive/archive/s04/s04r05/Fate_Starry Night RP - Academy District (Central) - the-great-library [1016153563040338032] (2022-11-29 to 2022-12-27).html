The materials are organized based on their type of medium, level of access, subject, and authorship. They are not organized by language, so the user is expected to produce their own means of translation when browsing foreign texts. An observatory takes over the top floor of the tower, with the floors immediately below them dedicated to astronomers and astrologers who are interested in the studying of planetary movements.

Aimlessly, Amelia wandered among the streets and let her eyes idly scan the signs for anything interesting. Her mind likewise wandered in on its own thoughts, circling back to a memory that wouldn’t go away, spurned on by the day’s experiences.

Her brothers and sisters, just where were they now? Still stuck on that city hidden in the mist and wallowing in their own faults or had they escaped in their own ways? It was true she was by far the most outgoing and stable of the bunch and without her, they inevitably turned inward. Maybe it was wishful thinking? Hope was good and it&#39;s really all she had to go off of, to keep that nagging thought at bay.

She should be thinking about how to help Alexandria win this grail war though, there were still two more fights left and it increasingly seemed like she might actually have to participate again for the tiebreaker. She wondered what mercenary they’d have to fight that time and how much would she have to sacrifice to raise the spirits and hopes of her home city again…

Her thoughts were broken up by a rather insistent Hannibal and her mentions of getting supplies. Right, those were good to have on hand, never know when you’ll need them.

“Oh sorry, Hannibal, what did you say we needed from the store? I was just thinking about Thomas and Simon,”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I appreciate the tea you and Benji have at the place and all, but a little variance doesn’t hurt.” Her words ended off with a soft wink towards her Master. “Besides, I think we both deserve to treat ourselves a little.” With that, Rider gave Amelia a pat on her shoulder while the two headed towards the nearest store that was open. 

While her words were true, that wasn’t the real reason she brought her along with her. As much as she hated pressuring her, Rider couldn’t bear to see her constantly running away from… whatever it was that was bothering her. Not while she could do something about it. At least, that’s what she hopes, of course. 

Nightfall was slowly descending upon the city of Alexandria. The amber painted skies were losing their colour as the moon took centre stage in place of the sun. The streetlights provided the much needed light to show the way for the pair. This would make for the perfect time to ask! That is, if Rider could actually bring herself to mention the topic.

Unfortunately, that moment never came.

Now Rider was walking back with a bag in her hand containing a variety of items. A six-pack of Alexandria’s locally made beers stuck out the most among the purchased items. She should have asked if Amelia even drank all things considered. It wasn’t that big of an issue though. There were only six of them. Something she could easily spread throughout the following days herself.

“Soooo…” Rider decided to at least break the silence that lingered in the air but immediately she ran into a wall with what to talk about. “I don’t think you told me about what you usually do in this city. I know you live with Benji but we have been so focused on so many things that I don’t think we had the time to talk about these things as much.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053509713406468206 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053509713406468206><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 01:11 PM">13:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot; Well, I earn my room by gathering all the particular reagents and what not for Uncle Benji’s mystic code making business and deliver the goods for him. I suppose it&#39;s the only way I can help him without making a mess of everything.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was possible. She didn’t doubt her abilities to get them up there with her usual path. However, Rider was a Servant! She had more exciting ways to make this journey possible.

“Eh, that sounds like it would take quuuite a bit though.” Rider put on an act and sounded as if she were exhausted. Since when did she ever get tired? Especially with someone like Amelia testing those limits on a daily basis! 

“I think I got a better idea on how to get up there though.” A smirk formed on her face as Amelia wasn’t given much time before Rider placed her arm around her waist. In one hand, she had the bag. In the other, she materialized her still partially-melted sword. “This might be a biiit cold so just a heads up.” 

“<strong>This is the impossible path that I forged!</strong>” 

“<strong>Come forth! Journey Through The Alps!</strong>”

With a swing, the snowy portal swirled into existence. Then, with a tight grip on Amelia, Rider leapt through into the snowy Alps that lay within. Once they were through, the portal closed and, for the time being, it seemed that they all but disappeared…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053511126488457236 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053511126488457236><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 01:17 PM">13:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Surus isn’t gonna - woah!” Amelia had scant time to react as her servant grabbed hold of her and launched the two of them into the alpine slopes of a different era. For a moment, Amelia found herself among the snow-capped aeries of a world long since submerged under mud and water. It was impossible for one born to hills of steel and fields of cerulean to take in for the short time inside. But she’d never forget what it felt like to stand on authentic terra firma and the way the winds wrapped around each crag and canyon, dusting her with pale powder.

This is what <em>they</em> wanted her to originally achieve, to bring this back to all mankind. Amelia’s heart stirred with a sense of satisfaction and elation that inoculated her body against the cold. This was what could be waiting for them, a world of land primal and defiant even as man made its mark on history by daring to cross them.

 She wished she could savor this flood of emotion that began to leak out the corners of her eyes. She reached out with one hand to touch the rock only for a portal to open in front of her and drag the pair into modernity once again.

Now she stood atop another mountain, white and solid like the Alps yet artificial and bending ever so slightly with the wind. Suddenly the roost she considered her special place for six months felt like a hollow imitation rather than a tribute to the dizzying heights man pursued for knowledge. The wonder and awe from before faded fast from her face, to be replaced by a rare turn of melancholy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053511411155865760 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053511411155865760><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 01:18 PM">13:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She looked down and no longer was the erratic range of mountains there but the well-groomed avenues and canals of Alexandria, neatly arranged into aesthetically pleasing patterns that facilitated the optimal flow of traffic. It had been a delightful city for six months but now she could only see it for what it tried to emulate. She took a long breath out and stared at the urban painting below, hoping some of its magic would come back. No plant could answer her call from here but one perpetual companion of hers would do so dutifully.

A strong gust from the west answered, bringing with it a pleasant scent of baked bread to warm her heart once more. The wind Favonius doing what it could in its meager powers to comfort its disciple. That was why she came here again and again, here it was that she could feel the winds the clearest, undiluted by twisting streets or gloomy seas. This was her domain and here was her home, regardless of city. And just maybe, she could feel a trace of an alpine meadow within. 

“Hannibal… What was that we just went through? Was that the old world?” Not leaving Rider’s side, Amelia looked up at her companion and stared deeply into her eyes, digging for an explanation of the miracle she was made witness to. “Because it felt right, like home, like here but the winds felt more… alive somehow.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pretty cool, huh?” It took weeks since her summoning but that confident exterior was starting to shine through once again. The look of admiration in her Master’s eyes did wonders for it. So much so that she couldn’t help but feel slightly bashful towards showing off like that. 

“Weeeell, it’s not really the Alps.” Rider helped dust the already melting snow off of her. “I can’t bring the real place back. What you saw was just how I remembered the Alps. My memories to be precise. The freezing winds. The sensation of the snow crunching beneath your feet. The valleys and sights of the different peaks. The promise of seeing our destination over the next rise. You saw all of that, even if it was just for a brief moment in time. <em>That</em> is what you saw.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“You sound amazed but this new world isn’t that bad either honestly. A lot of sights I never got to see myself here.” The city was simply beautiful to her. Even in a world that was, for the most part, devastated, Alexandria managed to maintain the beauty it once had. The Gondolas that rode down the waterways was an experience that she didn’t know she needed to have until they went during their adventures. One could easily forget that that was such an important tournament going on without even trying.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her cheeks slowly shifted in tone to more closely resemble her hair in terms of colour. She didn’t know what to do in this situation. So, before it became too one-sided, Rider returned the hug, albeit awkwardly, of course. Despite that, the warmth that came with it was worth it. A perfect treat after the short, but cold, trip through the Alps.

“Well, unless you want to stay up here in each other’s arms for the rest of the night, let&#39;s have a seat and relax for a bit. Shall we, Amelia?” She gave the top of her head a little ruffle with her hand before pulling away so she could take a seat on the skyroof. A second barely passed and she was already rummaging inside of her bag before a metallic can was tossed towards Amelia. With her own already in her hands, Rider snapped open the first drink between them.

Pssssch

“Well, this feels like a better spot to have some of these than the attic.” With that, Rider took her first alcoholic beverage of the new world since coming here. It was… decent. It wasn’t what she normally had back in her time but it was serviceable. “Say. You said it felt like home, right? Does that mean there are cities out there that try to recreate snow-peaked mountains or something?” It was a subtle attempt to ease into her line of questioning. At least she hopes it was subtle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She looked over at the carton and opened up her hands to catch a beer herself before sitting down beside Rider.

“Thanks and you’re right about that. Drinking in the attic seems depressing, like something a broken person would do. Here is definitely better,” there were an oddly high amount of desperate and worn-down people competing in this grail war, some of which were already in Alexandria. It shouldn&#39;t have been a surprise to her but then again when had she ever focused on the wellbeing of others besides those of family. It was adventures that kept her busy… and blind.

“Home? I did say that… but there’s nowhere I lived that had real mountains like that. I guess the best I could do with was the skyscrapers of Delphi or the central spires of Lemuria. No one tried to recreate nature in full where I lived, everyone had moved past that idea or maybe they had given up on it, too painful to remember for those who survived the flood.”

“No, home was steel and concrete, electric lights and sterile rooms. Only bits of nature you could find were the parks, they were nice when that’s all I knew it as. Oh and the wind too, I guess that’s the only true part of the actual wilderness I knew. Mhmm, that’s why I climb and fly. Something about being surrounded by air and only wind felt <em>right</em> to me, you know?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was depressing to hear. What’s the point of seeing the world if places were just as depressing as she described? Maybe for the chance that there could be another Alexandria out there somewhere, perhaps. 

Not like she could stay on the topic for long though. The real question still needed to be asked after all.

“Here’s another question.” Whether to create suspense, or simply to build up the courage to ask it herself, Rider took another long drink from the can before answering. “Is home the thing that was bothering you lately? You still haven’t told me what you were trying to say at the hospital too.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Delphi is a much happier place for me…” she said wistfully, letting the wind play with her hair while she took a sip from the beer. It certainly wasn’t bad, if anything drinking it alongside Hannibal did much to improve its quality. Still it could do with being sweeter. She’d have to get a bottle of wine the next time they went out. There’d be none of the bitterness then.

However, Hannibal was one to hone in on the bitterness, just of a different sort, one Amelia long tried to chase away at every opportunity. Amelia took a long sigh when her friend finally asked it and took one last taste of beer, letting it sit for a second and take in the taste, letting herself get used to it. Better that mild kind before she delved into the strong stuff.

“Home, my first home you mean? I suppose I never did tell you much about where I came from, that’s on me. There was just too much I wanted to do with you since we first met. It just went to the back of my mind, you know? But I guess that since you’ve been such a good friend, you noticed I was hiding something too.” 

She kept wanting to circle and dance around the issue and she could certainly get up and fly away if she wished, running away from it once again but Rider would track her down and ask her again, but now with a blemish to their friendship. Maybe it was time to let it all out, who else would hear them but the wind?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053512227082211398 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053512227082211398><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 01:21 PM">13:21</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Well to start, you’re right on what’s bothering me. My first home and city where I was created, yes, not born but made, is where my worries lie. You see, I have three siblings I grew up with and I looked out for them as the oldest of the bunch. We never knew our parents, so we were all we had. All we knew was the sterile labs, dull housing and pristine gardens, our lives tightly planned out and our abilities rigorously tested. We were nothing more than a pack of  lab rats to the city, meant to be observed and picked apart,” 

“It’s just, it got to all of us in different ways. Sometimes the tests too hard or the researchers too cold and mean, but we all had our ways of showing stress. Phoebe would wall herself off from just about everything, food, water, sunlight, even me and try to be a living statue, Daniel would set himself ablaze with anger and have these really violent fits, I’d do my best to run away from it all as I felt trapped, and little Walter just cried and leaned on whichever one of us was closest, wanting us for comfort, afraid of being alone.&quot;

&quot;It would be either his pleading for comfort or me returning and entertaining everyone that would ground us. ‘Just one more day and we’ll be free’ we’d say to make it easier on us, grabbing on what hope we could for a more normal life. And one day I was free…and they were not,”

“It didn’t bother me much at the time but now after seeing Simon, Thomas and even Mikhail, it just really came rushing back to me and I… I can’t stop thinking about how they’re doing. I don’t even know if they’re still alive! Because if they’ve been separated by their own, I’m not sure any of them would make it for long...&quot;

&quot; We need to be together yet I just took up and disappeared without telling them anything… I can’t imagine how they see me now.

No one would run away from a problem like that if it was something trivial. She didn’t know it was that bad though. To say it was a lot to take in would be grossly underestimating the term by far. The fact that Amelia was created was still being wrapped around her head. Was that even ethical? 

The can simply hung by the grip of her fingertips as she listened. She took a few more sips at the start but soon became too engrossed to even distract herself with something as simple as finishing the drink. 

Words failed to leave Rider. She knew not what to say to her that would raise her hopes or make it seem like things were going to be okay. No. That wasn’t what she needed to hear. She did that enough to herself as it is. Doing the same wasn’t going to do either of them any good.

Instead of answering first, Rider scooted closer so she could bring her arms around Amelia. Her cheek rested on her head as she held her in a gentle embrace. 

“I don’t know.” 

That was probably not the answer she expected to hear from her but it was the first thing that came out of her mouth since she opened up her heart to her.

She didn’t know whether or not what she was saying was working but she knew that she had to get something out. 

“I’m not a philosopher. I’m simply another sword in the annals of history. My actions spoke for me more than my words did in my life. So, I suppose having said that,” The embrace was broken as she pulled away so she could place her hand under Amelia’s chin so they could share in another connected stare again before continuing. “What you plan to do with your freedom, now that you have acquired it, will determine whether or not it was the right choice to leave.”

“I ask you this again, Master. What is your wish? As your Servant, I promise I will fight for it until my last breath. For freedom should be something everyone should have and no one has any right to take it from you.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was the knowing empathy from one exile to another, that one’s family and home were still bound to their heart and soul. She didn’t need to say anything else, only hug tighter and let the tears fall. 

Hannibal ended the tender moment, only to gently encourage Amelia to lock eyes with her and affix her with the potent flashes of unstoppable determination only the Rider of Lightning could offer. There in Amelia could find a willing reservoir of strength to draw from and think why she really came to Alexandria and participate in the grail war, risking life and limb.

“I-I’m no philosopher either, nor a soldier for that matter. Just a little songbird with too much courage and too little sense, never tied down to one place… I’ll be honest, I came to this grail war for selfish reasons. Mom has had a servant for years and the pair sent me away when a grail war started on Delphi. I wanted in on what she had, to have my own powerful companion to go on adventures with and take what I wanted. Power or knowledge were never my wish for the grail, if somehow I won, I was just gonna ask for like a few artifacts I found useful or could get rich off selling and then head out to the next city somewhere out there.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053512516791173210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053512516791173210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 01:22 PM">13:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“But somehow, the end goal of the wish never really stuck with me.

Yet how can I really run away and abandon my family?”

“That’s what my wish really is, to give people hope that they can change, take control of their lives and for me to find my family again, no matter what it takes! They need me and now I realize, I need them just as much.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She really did put her life on the line just for the sake of doing it, didn’t she? If she heard another reason other than that though, she would’ve doubted that she was actually Amelia. That was just how she was after all, at least that’s how she saw her.

With a gentle smile, Rider wiped away the tears on her Master’s face using her thumb. “Then let’s try our best to get that wish, shall we?. Not for you. Not for me. But for your family, wherever they may be. I bet they’re wishing things are going well for you despite the situation they may be in right now.”

“I mean, that’s what I’d be doing if I had someone like you out there!” Rider’s light chuckle lightened the mood around them. It took awhile but she was glad that she managed to get her to open up eventually. Now they both had a stronger reason to fight rather than just having it be for Alexandria, a city who didn’t hesitate to turn against their own first round in.

“After this grail war, let’s go searching for them. I’ll make sure that any bastard that tries to stop us gets to meet Surus personally. Besides, don’t you think your siblings would love to hear all the adventures you had so far? A grail war and getting your own Servant would make for an interesting story to tell while catching up after all.” While the embrace was broken earlier, Rider couldn’t bring herself to pull away from their shared gaze. It was comforting to say the least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There&#39;s nothing more I want to do and there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s gonna stand in our way for long. I owe it to them to make sure they can enjoy a life just like the one I&#39;ve been spending for years now, one free of fear. We&#39;ll do it together!&quot; Amelia&#39;s eyes misted over with emotion, only for those clouds to be burned away by the intensity of the ruby red flames within. She had her goal, she knew what she needed to do to get there and who she needed to accomplish it. Suddenly the distance between Alexandria and Lemuria felt much, much smaller than before.

&quot;I can&#39;t thank you enough for listening but I feel like there&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t been answered yet...&quot; She took Rider&#39;s hand in her own and softened her look. &quot;Back when you were summoned, that crazy professor mentioned something about not doing something and losing a war. Whatever it was really shook you up. Did you lose someone back in your time? Was there something you ran away from like I did?&quot;

&quot;I really won&#39;t judge you but I think if we&#39;re really partners in all this, we gotta share both ways. It&#39;s only the fair thing to do.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Although tears were built up in the corners of her eyes, the burning passion she had when she was summoned burned brightly in them again. 

The joyous mood in the air was shifted when the focus was brought back towards her. The professor&#39;s words attempted to crack the walls of her resolve once more. And they would have, but she had Amelia now. 

It would be rather unfair if she didn&#39;t pour her heart out as well after everything Amelia said. 

&quot;Yeah, I did.&quot; Before continuing, Rider interlocked her fingers with hers. A gentle squeeze was done to draw upon whatever support she needed to open up as well. &quot;Despite the victories I had against Rome and Her people, the decade long reign of terror I had over them, all it took was a single battle to lose the war.&quot;

&quot;You see, there was this Roman, Scipio.&quot; It was difficult for her to even utter their name without feeling the anger boil up inside of her. From there she spoke about how Scipio followed her in every major engagement where they clashes their stubborn heads against each other with Scipio getting closer and closer to winning their last battle. Despite her hatred towards Rome, she spoke about Scipio with an unusual level of respect.

&quot;Bastard didn&#39;t know when to give up and always found a way to escape or weasel to safety. I didn&#39;t see them for years and when I received notice that they were marching upon Carthage, I found out why. From there, we fought at Zama. Scipio even had the gall to recruit Numidian cavalry. And they said Roman Might won the day. &#39;Roman Might&#39; my ass!&quot;

Everything came crashing down so quickly. Before I knew it, I had to leave my home and wander until my last days. I never got to return to see Carthage again. I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve wanted to see it after what Rome did to it though.&quot;

&quot;You might think that my wish would be to see Carthage again, or to see Rome burn. I have thought about wishing for either myself. No.&quot; A small scoff left her as she realized just how petty her actual wish was. &quot;All I want is to find out whether that loss at Zama was a fluke or not; a rematch against Scipio. It&#39;s petty, I know. However, with how much they paraded the victory over me, I can&#39;t bear to accept the possibility that it might&#39;ve just a lucky break for them!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whenever Hannibal stopped to collect herself, Amelia gave her hands a warm and surprisingly strong squeeze. She nodded and shook her head where necessary, never appearing to outwardly judge Rider, simply content to listen and provide support where needed.

Inwards she couldn&#39;t help but draw comparisons to her own nature. Hannibal was selfless in her goal of fighting for Carthage&#39;s ideals and its soldiers, sticking it out far longer than she could ever imagine herself doing. That powerful, consuming ambition was not something she had, that was the domain of her hotheated brother Daniel. So the one crack in Amelia&#39;s empathetic listening came in the form of a grin and a snicker as apparently Hannibal was just as much a sore loser as him too.

&quot;Hey that&#39;s still your wish though, Hannibal. No matter how petty it may seem, its still one that&#39;s more likely than you may think. I don&#39;t think I could hold a grudge like you can but I can totally understand feeling slighted. You may not have Carthage anymore but you&#39;ve got Alexandria and more importantly me at your back,&quot; She let go of Rider&#39;s hand and reached around to give her a good pat on the back along with the biggest grin she could muster. Then her final words came back around to her and her face went slack for a second.

&quot;But I&#39;m one better than any city or nation as no matter what crazy thing you do, you won&#39;t ever lose my support. Why? Because you&#39;re part of my family and we don&#39;t ever give up on each other... no matter how far apart we get at times or how rough the going gets, we-&quot; Amelia thought she outran her own heart with her testimony earlier but it finally caught up with her again as she imagined her siblings standing next to Hannibal. Finally she found the big sis she never had, someone to hold the burdens she dropped

&quot;We always find our way our way back together! And that&#39;s a promise we&#39;ll never let down!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
