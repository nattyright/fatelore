Falling for an eternity. Words and pages flew past him in a blur, as if space itself on what rested within Thomas’s heart. After a few moments, Thomas stopped falling, and floated aimlessly in a void. In that void, he saw stars light up. One after another, stars lit up in the expanse until Thomas was floating in a galaxy.

Were those stars… <strong>dreams?</strong>

Was this his fate? To be some sort of overseer of the pleasantries of fate and dreams without getting to partake, himself? How had he even ended up here? Hadn’t there been… a Servant?

The stars winked out, and Thomas found himself standing on a cliffside, overlooking the ocean. Yet this wasn’t Alexandria, nor was it some other artificial nomadic city. The cliffside was rough, and the ocean was far too active to be related to the stillness of the one Thomas had witnessed prior.

Down the cliffside path, Thomas could see a small beachside town. Towns didn’t exist anymore. Not in this form, at least. These towns were nothing like what existed today. 

In the corner of his eye, Thomas saw a man who looked similar to him taking the path down to the town.

Their senseless walks and eerie whispers of their dreams shook and frightened him. How could they not.

But the writer made it clear to him, as a blinding light burst forth and engulfed everything in its path, that it was but a prelude and there was more to come. <em>Much, much more to come</em>.

The next thing he knew, Thomas was flying through the air in a maelstrom of pages and writing. He struggled for a long time, bewildered and distraught at the events unfolding before his eyes, flailing helplessly to break his fall. He looked around, and all he found was an infinite void. Eventually, stars began to appear, punctuating the vast nothingness until they formed a rich web; a canvas.

Yet... the canvas seemed distant. Utterly far and completely unreachable. A sudden unease came over Thomas, a nagging fear that something was terribly wrong with this. He reached for the stars, but they went out before he could touch them.

An unfamiliar landscape replaced them and stretched out around him. The smell of the ocean assaulted his nostrils, and the cloudy but bright sky lit his face with a soft comforting warmth. He looked around, taking in the full view of the grassy cliff and the raging waves below. Such grandeur. He closed his eyes sheepishly, reveling in the sound of the crashing ocean. The cold breeze whistling over the land, the birds croaking in the distance, the grass brushing and bending to nature’s will. After a long moment, Thomas opened his eyes, and he felt his heart tighten.

Soon, he felt his eyes moisten uncontrollably. What was going on? Why all this...

Out of the corner of his eye, he could see a man walking towards the small town in the distance. Before he could think, Thomas found himself running at full-speed towards this man. He didn&#39;t know him, but... like the scenery, a familiar aura enveloped him, and Thomas&#39; body reacted to it before his brain could place a word.

Soon, Thomas was standing in front of the man, his face dewy and glistening in sweat. Words refused to come to him, but fortunately, his bawling eyes said more than enough...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

John&#39;s jokes were absolutely... terrible. Yet to Thomas, they were the best thing he had heard in eternity.

&quot;I was about to go into town for some groceries. Will you accompany your old man on a few chores? Maybe we can get you something in town, hmm? Are you hungry? Thirsty? Come along.&quot; John said as he stood up, and prepared to walk down the road.

Yet Thomas would not move.

John looked at Thomas. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Tommy?&quot;

In front of him stood the man he had been chasing for the better part of a century. The greatest, smartest, kindest man he had ever known. 

<strong>&quot;PAAA!!!”</strong> He screamed much louder than necessary, jumping up to catch his father in a tight embrace. He continued to scream as he buried his face in the man&#39;s tender neck, feeling his warmth and the distinctive scent of his cologne, scratching his face on the prickly beard he insisted on letting grow. He was real. He was right there. In his arms.

Awkwardly, he patted his son&#39;s head as Thomas bawled into his chest. &quot;<strong>You were &#39;so lonely? Who are you now?</strong>&quot; John&#39;s dad joke made Thomas grimace internally, despite the emotions. That didn&#39;t stop him from gripping his father tighter.

Nonetheless, his jokes were terrible.

&quot;Oh, Tommy... You followed my directions so well. It was all a bad dream, all of it. There&#39;s no need to think about it anymore.&quot; John comforted his son, before standing up again and squeezing his hand. &quot;All you need to know is this: <strong>I am so very proud of you, son</strong>.&quot;

John lead his son by the hand as they went down the road. His hand. His warm, flesh and blood hand. He was real. This was no illusion, no farce. This was Thomas&#39;s father in the flesh.

It was a dream come true.

&quot;I should have never left you. I&#39;m sorry, Tommy. The Grail Mud...&quot; John grimaced. &quot;Well, it&#39;ll never be a problem again. What was it like, after I took a dive in the forbidden kool-aid?&quot;

The jokes were still terrible.

Thomas couldn’t help but crack a smile even as his sniffling went uninterrupted. Because his father was that kind of man, the one that could make you laugh even when you bawled your eyes out. And he could make you cry twice as much with just a sentence, which is exactly what Thomas did when he said he was proud of him. It wasn’t the first time he had gotten recognition for his work, far from it. But hearing it from John’s own mouth… that was like being a movie director and getting praise from Kubrick or Welles. Unreal.

He gripped his father’s veiny hand so very tightly, as if doing anything less than squeezing with all his might would see him run off and never come back. Then he obediently followed him along the road. This particular footpath, Thomas could surprisingly remember every detail of.

And not just it. Along the south west peninsula of England, right outside of Treloyhan’s suburbs to the north, he recalled the road led to his hometown. Yes, he could even see it from where he stood. A small coastal town with barely a hundred inhabitants, where everyone knew everyone and life was tranquil. Due to the nature of his work, John usually spent much of the year in London alongside with the wise and powerful of the Clock Tower, but the few times he came over were blissful and filled with joy. Again, Thomas remembered those moments surprisingly well.

Yes… it all came back to him. By some unknown force, it seemed that Thomas was now <strong>remembering everything he had forgotten</strong>. The times before the mud, the hundred years of lonely research, the tournament against Republic, Lewis. Everything was so vivid now. So clear.

The touch of England’s cold wind. The towering sun that had just begun setting. Everything he lived prior to this was so blurry in comparison. Like he had just woken up from a long dream.

Thomas barely got his act together in time to hear John’s question, visibly flinching at the mention of the mud… no, he had to be strong. That’s how John liked him to be, strong and dependable. He wiped away at his snotty face with a hand before speaking.

“Right… right after you died, it took me a while to get back on my feet. But when I did, it was the hope of <em>fixing everything</em> that pushed me. But since I’m not nearly as smart as I might look, I didn’t come up with any ideas of my own. No, I thought I could work with whatever snippets you left me behind and continue your work to reach the root. Honestly, it took me <em>dozens of years</em> to even begin understanding what you were doing back then. I think my hair started graying right as I really started getting the hang of it.”

“I… really lacked talent. I lacked <em>your</em> talent, pa.” He finally sighed, sniffling a couple of times as he tightened his grip. “The only solution I had to make up for my lack of talent was to give myself more time; to regress my body&#39;s physical age. And even that didn&#39;t go great, because it also left me with a broken memory and a brain that goes too fast. Recording everything in books, concentrating really hard all the time to use my body and make out people’s words… what a headache.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was what Thomas had strove for. All that Magecraft, all that knowledge, and what had it been for?

A simple walk between father and son. That was all Thomas had ever wanted. For all the talent that Thomas had, for all the talent he lacked, he had been incapable of creating this dream again.

Dream...?

&quot;Remember when you snuck into my workshop?&quot; John said with a smile as the town got closer and closer. He scratched his chin in remembrance. &quot;I was just like you. I broke into my father&#39;s workshop as well. I was proud on that day.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t undersell yourself. Even the greatest Magecraft takes multiple lifelines. Though, I must confess...&quot; John smiled as he clapped Thomas on the back. &quot;You&#39;re looking good for over a century of life! That&#39;s my boy! You&#39;re older than me, now. I should be calling you my teacher.&quot;

John chuckled, and Thomas was content to walk alongside him after all this time. Nothing could disrupt this dream...

Except...

A violin was playing, somewhere. Had Thomas heard this before? It was a sorrowful tune, yet it had hope within it.

Memories...

A bright portal opened up in front of John and Thomas, and Thomas saw the faint outline of a young boy. His face and identity were familiar...

But it was up to Thomas to grasp what it was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Caprice No. 3 in E minor. Melancholic and slow, but with a slight bright undertone, hopeful. In the dream, Thomas&#39; memory was sublime. He knew instantly where this melody came from.

<strong>Niccol&#242; Paganini, he lived</strong>. Fitzgerald lied, he was not dead! And judging by the way his music disrupted the dream, he seemed to be somehow standing up to the dream-hungry writer. Not only was he not dead, but he was also fighting with all his might.

...he was fighting?

Much like the dream, the melody disrupted Thomas&#39; train of thought. Up until now, he had been completely absorbed in the dream, like a spectator drifting away from reality while watching a movie. Even as he regained his memories, Thomas still put all his worries aside to enjoy the simplicity of being reunited with his father. For a few minutes, he was happy. He was carefree, fulfilled. He was living the <em>dream</em>.

<strong>And all dreams, without exception, must come to an end</strong>.

The immersion was broken. Paganini&#39;s music made sure to release Thomas from his momentary bliss. Now he was suddenly snapped back to reality. The one where he was a proud citizen of Alexandria, a scientist with nearly a century of research under his belt, the first combatant in a war between the Republic and the Neo Holy Church. There was no England, no seaside town, no John Barnes.

He looked at his father, slowly losing the strength in the hand he was holding.

&quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not a kid anymore.&quot; He said, pulling away from John&#39;s hand. &quot;And you&#39;re not really my dad, you&#39;re just what I remember of him. I was very careful when I snuck into your workshop, you never caught me. Heh...way to kill the immersion.&quot;

For some reason, Thomas found himself smiling. The tears, he managed to keep at bay, but seeing John&#39;s friendly face... it could only fill him with happiness, even if it wasn&#39;t really him. So much for being a scientist filled with rationality and logic.

Finally, the portal flared before him. He saw a familiar figure standing on the other side. The symbol of the reality he came from, the one man who had his back when everyone else turned on him. If John symbolized the ideal, the unattainable dream he was ruthlessly pursuing, then Lewis was...

&quot;<strong>The wake-up call</strong>.&quot; Thomas whispered, standing next to his father as the gate opened.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The beast’s movement was fast, faster than Lewis’ reaction which scared the boy’s finger into pressing down on the trigger than he’d had liked, which let out a deafening <strong>BANG</strong>. But, as expected, the music had already scared off the beast before any gunshot could.

The boy looked out from his bush, curious as to where this orchestra of sound could have been coming from. They hadn’t heard live music since they were back in DC! He couldn’t see anything though. . . And then he saw <em>everything</em>! A small tear, no larger than what could fit one body, had been before him, and with almost comedic look, he could see someone through the tear, though he wasn’t sure if they could see him. 

The boy was small, almost child like, his messy blonde hair almost as tousled as Jefferson’s though he didn’t hold the gait that the President had over him, nor the looks. Only the glasses seemed to mirror it. It was however, funny though, how much the boy seemed to remind him of his best of friend, regardless how they looked otherwise. But who was the boy? Lewis looked back to Clark, expecting an answer from the woman, but from what he knew, Clark was just as confused as he. And yet, somewhere deep inside him he felt like he had known the stranger’s name already. Thomas. No, not Jefferson. He was scolded on it before, but when? He wasn’t Thomas Jefferson, he went by Thomas Barnes. 

“. . . Barnes.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053465275703509012 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053465275703509012><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 10:14 AM">10:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The name felt heavy on his lips, and just by speaking it he could see a plethora of things before him, a king and his boasting of power, a woman who stood beside him with the name of Lea, an author and the many pages. It all was as if the dream he could have hoped to remember had came to him at last, and when he realized it he turned back to Clark in a hurt look. He had already explored this. He could remember the way the bears were, how the bison moved about and even the ways he’d stumble and trip and fall over loose branches. He had explored what he had, and had found an end to it. He had already known Clark when she had done such a thing too. The dream, he thought, he should known this was a dream. He had died long ago, re-summoned as a Heroic spirit and had a purpose to fulfill his duty as a servant. He had to fulfill his promise to this man so called Thomas, and here it took a moment of choosing to take the leap.

He turned to the tear, straightening the straps he had as he took in a breath, though he wasn’t scared to do so. He knew in this dream, Clark would be sad, their exploration would be undone, and the world would go undiscovered, and yet in this world it comforted him. It meant he would have to do it again in the world he had known of his master. He took his first step. But before he went any further, he parted his friend with a final goodbye.

“Clark! I promise I will explore much more than this. The purchase and America are our first lands, but Alexandria is my next. And from there I am told of places before, like Macedon, and others. I know as a Heroic spirit, I can only hope I see you again. Explore without me here, and may we find more things America has to offer!”

And so, with that, he took his leap into the void. He had to go and find Thomas.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053465322524524574 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053465322524524574><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Dec-22 10:15 AM">10:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Nimrod Alter</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A dirt road leading to a seaside town, forests and grasslands stretching in every direction, the sun half set in the distance and the sound of the ocean&#39;s rough waves as ambiance. This place had a weirdly nostalgic mood to it. A little something that made him feel at ease. It was his Master&#39;s <strong>dream</strong>, the place in time he kept trying to return to through his Magecraft.

Thomas was standing in the middle of this dream, facing the portal, both arms behind his back. His eyes were pink and slightly puffy, but he seemed otherwise calm. It seemed he had cried a lot prior to this meeting, but he smiled fondly at his Servant&#39;s presence.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you made it.&quot; Thomas said, approaching the Rider with deliberate steps. &quot;It seems we were separated when Fitzgerald used his Noble Phantasm, but fortunately we have an ally on the outside. I suppose Mr. Paganini&#39;s music also helped you break out of the dream’s immersion, Lewis?&quot;

The way Thomas spoke, the confidence with which he analyzed their situation, even the way he stood straight and alert... Lewis could see the <em>old Thomas</em> exuding from him. As if he had miraculously managed to return to his former self. Was this also part of the dream?

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. Lewis, this is my father… er, the memory of my father.&quot; He explained. &quot;He&#39;s the person I&#39;ve been chasing all these years, and the only reason I became a Mage and studied Magecraft in the first place. It was good to see him, and I would’ve enjoyed talking more about him but...we have other fish to fry.&quot;

Thomas didn&#39;t have to say it for Lewis to understand: Fitzgerald was their top priority. And there was no telling how long Paganini&#39;s music would keep them awake from their dreams. They had to act fast.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

John patted his chest, and looked around, before taking off his glasses and peering at them. &quot;A dream come true, indeed!&quot;

Thomas&#39;s expression caused John to drop his joking manner. He frowned and pushed up his glasses with his forefinger. &quot;Ah, this is no laughing matter. You&#39;re saying this is a dream? How could such a thing be possible? This is dangerously close to True Magic, son.&quot;

Exhaling, John looked back over the horizon. The waves crashing masked Lewis&#39;s thud as he fell through the portal.

John&#39;s eyebrows threatened to reach the stratosphere as he gave Lewis several once overs. Even he, a magus formed from a dream, could recognize Lewis&#39;s power as a Heroic Spirit. He looked at the portal, then at Thomas, then Lewis, then back at the portal, again.

&quot;This is... a lot to take in, Tommy.&quot; John stammered. After a moment, though, he stood tall and had his eyes gleam. &quot;<strong>If you&#39;re my boy&#39;s protector, take good care of him, Mr. Lewis. Servant. Heroic Spirit.</strong>&quot;

After a moment, John deflated. &quot;This is my dream too, you know. To see my son again. I could tell something was... <em>off</em>. My Magecraft feels so close, yet so far away. I feel like I&#39;ve been walking down into that town for an eternity.&quot;

John sighed and clapped his son and Lewis on the shoulders. In the distance, a portal opened up.

&quot;Follow the road, then. Maybe you&#39;ll get somewhere I couldn&#39;t. <strong>Good luck, Thomas.</strong>&quot;

But, Lewis <em>did</em> know that this entire sequence, was bit a dream they had not woken up from. With that knowledge, he nodded, hoping Thomas would simply agree as such. 

The introduction to the boy’s father however, was interesting. He had looked like Barnes, and had the same tone as Barnes, but . . . Taller. He was quite taller! And he had a beard! Lewis seemed surprised that Barnes had even come from this man! But, to keep himself polite, he smiled a waved as his master went on to explain who his parent was.

“Of course I will protect Barnes! It is my duty as a heroic spirit to! So, there is no need to worry. That much is sure.”

The boy waited for his father to give his farewells, after that they needed to face Fitzgerald once more and that would be the way out of this dream. With the final goodbyes to his father, Lewis made no haste to grab Thomas’ hand, the end was slowly beginning to start, and they needed to be ready for such.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1054186881560088597 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1054186881560088597><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Dec-22 10:02 AM">10:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Nimrod Alter</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thomas made sure to burn his image into his mind, no matter how futile the effort may be.

“I’ll do my best,” He whispered. “Thanks, pa… for everything...”

Then he turned away, facing the rift Lewis had come from. The tears he held back inevitably fell down, yet he looked ahead with purpose and decisiveness.

“By the power of this Command Seal, I order you.” The inside of his palm grew a bright red as he started speaking, a sudden surge of energy emanating with each word. “Lewis, <strong>break me out of this dream and take me to Fitzgerald.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sunlight and spray filtered through his fingers, embracing his glasses.

&quot;So I&#39;m not real, huh?&quot; John said to no one. 

The horizon began to turn into a bright light as the dream slowly dissolved without its host: his son.

&quot;Heh.&quot; 

&quot;Haha...&quot;

&quot;Heeheehahahaha...!&quot; 

John laughed to himself sadly as he watched the dream vanish before his very eyes. He took off his glasses and rubbed them on his sleeve to remove the spray from the ocean.

&quot;<strong>Figures.</strong>&quot; He finally said, tired. His voice lacked anger or rage. This wasn&#39;t anger at realizing that his existence within this dream was a lie. It wasn&#39;t that this world was cruel for making him so, or anything like that.

&quot;Of course this is a dream.&quot; John put his glasses back on the bridge of his nose. &quot;<strong>I felt so happy to be with my son, that I thought I must be dreaming.</strong>&quot;

A huff escaped his lips as John sat down on the cliffside, watching the dream&#39;s end creep closer.

&quot;There&#39;s never enough time. A hundred years wouldn&#39;t be enough time. Yet when I see what a fine young man he&#39;s become...&quot; John smiled to himself. &quot;<strong>I can&#39;t help but feel that this dream was more than enough.</strong>&quot;

The dream broke apart, like a bit of sea spray.
