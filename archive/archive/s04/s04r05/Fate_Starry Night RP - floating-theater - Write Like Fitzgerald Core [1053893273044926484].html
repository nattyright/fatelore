A rumor from those who inherited old money from their fathers and forefathers. That there was a man who had clawed his way to the top of society so that he could party like he belonged.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I expected when I saw that man at one of my parties. I felt like I would notice him at first sight. That, I did. A boisterous and loud man who almost fell off my balcony with his wife. &quot;

&quot;How shallow, I thought. Yet when you were about to fall, you instinctively wrapped your hands around her.&quot;

&quot;There is some good in you, old sport. Since you are so desperate to redeem yourself, I am going to ask something of you, my old friend.&quot;

&quot;Nick Carraway—Francis Fitzgerald—it has been a pleasure, and a tragedy. Please make a world worth living in, for every person.&quot;

&quot;Do not despair. I will give you my own hopes and dreams as well. Do this for me, Nick?&quot;

&quot;<strong>Ah, where did I go astray?</strong>

The center of Write Like Fitzgerald was not what was expected. Instead of some great throne, or glowing light, or anything abstract, it was an office. Light filtered through the window and curtains, and several books were stacked absentmindedly in the corner.

Nimrod had cleaved open the path to this domain, fueled by their common desire for tomorrow. It was a chance that was only allowed to come by thanks to their small, intersecting hopes for the future.

But if this reality continued to play out, many people who were unable to break out of the dream would lose that ability to hope. Hope was what made humanity&#39;s trajectory greater. If the need to hope was erased altogether, they&#39;d only be left with endless stagnation. L

&quot;Hey, long time no see, pal.&quot;

Lea put a single hand on Gatsby&#39;s shoulder and called out, with the slightest bit of hesitation mixed into her tone.

&quot;You seem busy over here. I dunno how this whole system works, but... have you been running this whole thing all by yourself?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While making a passing acknowledgement he decided to make himself comfortable. Sitting down with a sigh in one of the available seats. Crossing his arms he now stared down Gatsby as he gave a review on his work.

Everyone? No. Fitzgerald was nowhere to be seen. But he ordered Lewis to lead him to where he was. Was he unable to maintain his existence after casting pseudo-True Magic, or had he become Gatsby again? Thomas could only speculate.

He swept his eyes across the office, observing how the inside of the writer&#39;s brain worked, analyzing the place from which everything started. Very modest, quite ordinary. The stack of books in the back, did they represent his works, his botched attempts? Was this how Gatsby... er, Fitzgerald saw himself? Again, he could only speculate the answer.

Thomas moved towards Nimrod, greeting his kingly presence with a quiet bow, before turning his attention to Lea and Gatsby&#39;s whereabouts. The shameful Master&#39;s demeanor seemed to have changed dramatically since their time at the theater. He looked more like the man the King had met at the Gogh Gallery.

&quot;Ms. Krause,&quot; he said, mirroring Lea&#39;s position as he stood on Gatsby’s other side, smiling briefly. &quot;I apologize for forgetting you at that time. There were... quite a few unfortunate circumstances that worked against me. But, I can at least tell from your attitude that <strong>we both found the answers we sought.</strong>”

Unlike her, he did not place his hand on Gatsby&#39;s shoulder. He simply stood there, arms behind his back, curiously reading what he had typed on the archaic writing machine.

&quot;...Gatsby, Fitzgerald, Ben, whoever you are right now—thank you for your visit to the hospital. It meant a lot to me at the time. And... thank you for <em>that</em>. Oddly enough, I believe that the dream you showed me managed to open my eyes on quite a few things.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="19-Dec-22 06:23 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lewis took in the sight, curious as to why it was such a way when he heard Lea and Nimrod’ voice, already conversing with who seemed to be Jay Gatsby—er Fitzgerald. 

“Fitzgerald! You big butt! We want out of this noble phantasm! It isn’t real!”

Not even Thomas could stop Lewis from protesting such a thing, the boy’s cheeks did their signature air bubble, showing his need of defiance to such bad things the man had done.  It didn’t even register till then that Thomas had even thanked him! How was that supposed to be okay!

As Nimrod&#39;s shadow loomed over him and Lea&#39;s hand grabbed his shoulder, Gatsby turned around.

&quot;GAH!&quot; The American jumped out of his seat, completely and utterly startled. As he realized who had come to meet him, he relaxed slightly.  &quot;Old sports! Gatsby said, hugging Lea as he stood up. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect visitors. This place is such a mess. Francis just got rid of his wine bottles, too... Can I offer you all tea?&quot;

Snapping his fingers, a cup of tea appeared in each person&#39;s hand. It looked comically small in Nimrod&#39;s however.

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to see you all again. Francis didn&#39;t exactly give me an opportunity to say goodbye, and so meeting you all here again is truly a pleasure.&quot; Gatsby&#39;s eyes gleamed. &quot;Fitzgerald is doing a lot of work, but even I have to pull my own weight. He should be coming back soon.&quot;

Gatsby eyed the door in the corner as he spoke, as if Fitzgerald had simply went out for milk and cigarettes.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you think that, Nimrod, Lewis. I hope meeting Clark again was enjoyable, at least? Say what you will, but these are your dreams. This Noble Phantasm is meant to do good, not evil. If you got something from it, then that&#39;s enough for me.&quot;

Fitzgerald&#39;s one good eye narrowed. &quot;<strong>You may call this dream &#39;crap&#39;, but everyone else here doesn&#39;t. You have no right to declare it otherwise. You are a Heroic Spirit, born of ego. Judging humans is outside of your realm.</strong>&quot;

Despite this, Fitzgerald sighed and walked past them, putting his hand on Gatsby&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;My self-insert has been doing quite well, though. Did you know that there&#39;s a real Jay Gatsby in history? I met him, once. I envied his position, and placed myself in his shoes. This Jay Gatsby is simply me, but kinder. What an original character, he is.&quot;

Fitzgerald squeezed his shoulder.

&quot;<strong>And yet...</strong>&quot;

His hand trembled.

&quot;<strong>He was happy</strong>, without his memories. Now he&#39;s simply a narrative tool.&quot;

So Barnes had lost his memory! At the time, she fully believed that her failure to recollect him had been a byproduct of her unremarkable self. She was aware of how underqualified she was, at least.

But in spite of all her inadequacies, the one thing Lea could still believe in was her ability to trust herself. In that aspect, both Lea and Thomas were equals that navigated through a dream full of struggle. So hearing Thomas’s recognition… helped change what was formerly jealousy into joy.

“Don’t sweat it, don’t sweat it. I don’t blame you for it, Thomas. Ah, and also— tea sounds good! I’ll take you up on your word, Gatsby!”

She returned both Thomas and Gatsby’s words with pizzazz. It was the first time in a while she <em>properly</em> got to reunite with her friends. Best to treasure it while it lasted.

On the other hand…

“If the issue with Nimrod saying it is that he’s a relic of the past, then let me say it. <strong>Your dream was crap, Fitzgerald.</strong> Its not only four people, there are a <strong>whole</strong> four people who reject your dream as bogus. Pretty high rate of failure there, wouldn’t you agree?”

it wasn’t as though she hated Fitzgerald. If anything, she was fond of him, in spite of the short duration she saw him act. In spite of that, her words all erupted out with a sense of vitriol.

“A world that fulfils any fantasy is far from a perfect one. It grew old quite fast. Just like how a candy shop loses its charm after you grow up.”

Once you could realistically afford the various sweets within the shop, it stopped seeming so fantastical. Write Like Fitzgerald, at least for one individual, failed to satisfy the ever-so increasing demand of desires.

“… Oh, sorry, let me correct myself. I said that you had a failure rate of four, but that was a mistake. It actually goes as high as five, doesn’t it?”

Though, much of the vitriol began to die down when Lea reached that understanding.

“Come on, Fitz. There’s no need for you to see an eternal nightmare.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shockingly, this Jay Gatsby wasn’t an amalgam of him and the Gatsby they knew, but… just another Fitzgerald. Though… the real Fitzgerald looked pretty wounded. Couldn’t he fix himself inside his Noble Phantasm?

Moving on, the other three were quick to point out the flaws in his dream of unification through happiness. The crux of their argument he agreed with, but there were quite a few <em>nuances</em> Thomas would’ve liked to point out and discuss further. For one, he didn’t think Fitzgerald’s dream was crap. His objective, <em>the happiness of humanity</em>, was sound. Even if you could argue against his methods, you could hardly say he was in the wrong for trying to make such a dream come true.

But… this was likely not the time to discuss or criticize his methods. Paganini was trying to stop him from the outside, and more people would surely help neutralize him once they caught wind of what happened at the theater. Fitzgerald might even be <em>deactivated via kill-switch</em> if they deemed him a big enough threat to Alexandria’s safety. He was most likely working with limited time. Thomas had to make every word count, because they would likely be the last he would ever exchange with him.

“Jay Gatsby was just you but… kinder?” He repeated in astonishment. “Honestly, I would’ve never guessed. Who knew you could be such a charming individual if you just tried harder to sympathize with others. And… who knew you could reach happiness simply by being less of a prick.”

Thomas put a hand on Fitzgerald’s remaining shoulder, forcing him as much as he could to look him in the eyes. He wasn’t smiling, but he had kind eyes. 

“This is just a thought, but… if your goal is happiness, <em>why don’t you go back to being Jay Gatsby</em>? He’s you, isn’t he? So it’s not like you’d be playing a character. At least not completely.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m not allowed to dream. I&#39;m not allowed to wish.  If I did, I&#39;d lose the will to unify humanity to oppose the Grail Mud. There are too many wish-granters in this world, anyway.

“… I’m not exceptional either.”

It wasn’t some special heroism that woke Lea up from her dream. When she first heard Paganini’s violin, she ignored its familiarity. Dismissed it as something irrelevant to the sweet nectar she had been sipping.

She lacked any of the dauntless heroism, or unshakeable ideal that Fitzgerald might have expected from her. It was the simple despair that even a paradise wasn’t enough to make her satisfied.

Lea lacked the confidence to reject Nimrod’s way of thinking, but came to the same conclusion independently of his reasons.

“I get not getting to dream! I really do. At least… a little bit of it.”

Rather than not being allowed to dream, anything Lea dreamt was far too shallow. Broad wishes stemming from a childlike fantasy were simply not realistic. As she learned more and more about herself, the more her initially simple wishes began to tangle together to create an incomprehensible mess.

Regardless of the differences in method, the end result was the same.

“I still have no idea what I want to do. You still had a goal, at least, even if you couldn&#39;t dream. Well, the result of following that goal was…”

There was no happy ending she could help Fitzgerald attain. He had bitten off more than he could chew with full understanding of his ultimate demise. His nihilism that grew uncontrollably after <em>her</em> death drove him to this point of no return.

“… Anyways!”

She was really bad at this, huh?

“I hope it wasn’t all a nightmare, at least.”

Lewis stepped forward as he shook his head to reprimand the pessimistic Fitzgerald. He was using the idea of some woman to push himself forward! He wasn’t using himself! While he didn’t know much about Ladies besides Clark, he did know that even as a servant, they all wanted to reenact things that they were known for. He was known to explore vast things unknown, did he wish to see Clark again? Of course, but did he think ultimately, he’d continue even without her? Absolutely! 

“Lewis <strong>and</strong> Clark. That is what we were called! But Clark is not me! We are friends but I must move forward towards something different even if it means Clark may stay behind. You may have only received fame only through death, but that’s not how you should live your life! If that were the case, had I been manifested with the knowing of such, I’d try to keep going forward! But you’ve given up and no longer focused on yourself! So of course your dreams failed!”

Lewis moved forward even more, now he was truly upset. This poor sap looked almost as down as he had been in his dying moments! But the true difference is, Lewis had strength to keep going forward without being entirely reminded of his past! This man couldn’t fathom it!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055114823349833738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055114823349833738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Dec-22 11:29 PM">23:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="animereader &#128141;#0413">@animereader &#128141;</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Tachi#1290">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Nimrod Alter</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was more than ready to take up Gatsby on his offer. He began to turn to leave preparing to follow through before Fitzgerald&#39;s statement stopped him in his tracks. Hearing that he would need to use his noble phantasm. It made him deflate slightly. His large commanding presence suddenly was a little smaller.

The loathsome mud and this idiotic war. It&#39;s unfortunate but those things had to happen. Bad things have to happen sometimes for things to turn out the best they can in the end. It really is as simple as that. By attempting to hide these people from the truth you only do them a disservice. It is in the face of all these events they must decide whether to follow their dreams or decide on something new. It is that way they will be able to fully fulfil their potential.

His final words to Fitzgerald were another long convoluted speech. He truly did love the sound of his own voice. But it was also the case that he truly wanted to express all his thoughts to Fitzgerald. Regardless as to whether they had gained anything from it he would be satisfied knowing he had said everything he wanted to say. He now turned to face the next person he  would address the master who had summoned him here to begin with

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">My vassal… I’ll be going now.

I don’t really know what your dreams are at this point. You still seem quite undecided so I won’t push you anymore.

You will remain a vassal of King Nimrod for all eternity so don’t bring any more disgrace to my name after all…

<em><strong>I’ve become quite fond of you Lea so make sure you don’t let me down</strong></em>

His words for her were quite final. Lacking his usual confidence and arrogance. It seems he just didn’t want anything left unsaid between them. Giving her one last faint smile he turned to leave. He didn’t actually have anything to say to Thomas and Lewis. He didn’t really know them nor have any respect for them. Yet while approaching the exit he did make a passing remark to Lewis

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Rider I grant you permission to take from me whatever you need.

It was quite clear to all in the room the King was preparing to die. While Nimrod had never explicitly told Lea what his second Noble Phantasm did. If one took a look at his legend and considered his class the options could be narrowed down. A destructive force that left little surviving in its wake including the user. He was ashamed of this Noble Phantasm. He despised its very existence but despite that he would use it. He would sacrifice his own dream, his own tower for his people. He believed in Humanity’s potential and to reach it yes sacrifices had to be made. He would protect the people of Alexandria; they were his hope. One day things would improve. He had absolutely believed that because he trusted that all this had happened for humanity&#39;s own growth. Change can&#39;t be stopped so it should only ever be encouraged no matter the loss. It was with those thoughts he took a step out the door</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He enjoyed the time he spent with him in that dream, even if it was brief, and he would’ve stayed with him longer if given the opportunity. Not <em>forever</em>, but… longer than he had.

He did believe that reality would eventually catch up, but there was no telling how much time it would’ve taken. In that regard, Paganini’s interference influenced him without the shadow of a doubt. He was, as Gatsby put it, one of the ‘not-exceptional ones’. But… Thomas had another theory in mind.

Perhaps, just perhaps, amongst the four that broke away from the illusion, he was… <strong>the one person that truly dreamed</strong>. The only one that truly wished for something, that didn’t care about the methods as long as his wish was realized. Perhaps Lea was too young to know what she wanted, perhaps Nimrod was too prideful to accept having his deepest desires fulfilled by someone else, perhaps Lewis was too frivolous to even have a dream at all. It wasn’t hard to accept the idea that he desired something more than all three of them, and that that desire influenced him into accepting Write Like Fitzgerald. It was a very self-centered idea, but it at least made sense to him.

“Like Ms. Krause and unlike our Servants, I don’t have anything deep to say.” He said. “But for one I don’t think you’re unfit as a Servant, and secondly I don’t think you’re giving yourself enough credit. You said it yourself, only us four people are here, and it would’ve been three if not for Paganini’s interference. From my standpoint, while it’s indeed not failproof, <em>your dream has succeeded far more than it has failed</em>.”

He paused, scratching his head in thought as his bitter smile turned warmer and friendlier.

A dream rejected had no power, nor pressure. Nimrod would not be hindered. In the distance was a bright, where Fitzgerald had once been. His body was completely gone, and in its place was a husk, born from words. It looked both inhuman, yet perfectly human. A conceptual representation of what was once Fitzgerald.

Yet in the distance, even further, was a great shadow. <strong>Babel.</strong>

Neither of them had been fortunate enough to grow past their forties. They had died relatively young, and in despair and tragedy. The fact that Gatsby had been able to dream at all, and of something that had never occurred to either of them...

It caused Fitzgerald to cry.

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; He said, before turning to Thomas, Lea, and Lewis. He smiled at Thomas. &quot;I dreamt too. That I was human, and I was back on message boards, arguing with Librarians about adding a literature board. I dreamt that I was human again.&quot;

&quot;I did cherish our chats, Thomas. I really wanted to introduce you to her, you know. My wife. I think you two would have been good friends.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Grail Mud approaches. War will erupt, no matter who wins this tournament. It will be the Burning of Alexandria come again. I wanted to save you all from that choice, but it seems the characters have rebelled against their author.&quot;

Fitzgerald collapsed even further into his seat, breathing heavily. His eye fluttered.

&quot;The nightmare that I saw in Nirvana&#39;s archives... Maybe you are right, Lea. Maybe I&#39;ll finally get to awaken from it. Is there anything else you would like to know? As an author, I won&#39;t spoil the climax of this story. Yet nobody can blame me for leaving a few author&#39;s notes behind, certainly.&quot;

Breathing heavily, Fitzgerald made a fist. &quot;Fuckin&#39; spoilers.&quot;

I identify strongly with the whole &#39;wanting your loved ones back&#39; trope, you know.&quot;

But at the mention of Nirvana and the Mud, Thomas&#39; smile dropped and his expression quickly turned grim. While Fitzgerald effortlessly killed the bittersweet mood that was building up, the resurgence of the Grail Mud was no joke. A world-threatening event suddenly returning from a shady island that was said to be unexplorable… there was a lot they didn’t know, and a lot he could’ve asked. So much he struggled to think of even one thing.

So, as he often did, he jumped to the first questions that came to mind.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to bore you with details, so instead I&#39;ll ask about the big picture...&quot; Thomas said, approaching Fitzgerald&#39;s seat with unsteady steps. &quot;How bad was the situation? And... can we realistically expect to counter the Grail Mud without you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dreams were beautiful. Dreams helped people continue looking forwards to tomorrow. At least, those were the descriptions used to glorify ‘dreams’.

Reality wasn’t so kind, though. To grant one dream meant to ruin another. That was the inevitable truth in a world with such high independence. Some dreams were not meant to be. Some dreams should not be permitted to be. If Lea had obtained the Grail as she was at the beginning of the war, she would have wished for a weapon capable of destroying the world that she could pour her heart into researching, with no regard as to the possible consequences. Such a dream that had begun to endanger others was an example of what should not permitted to be.

Nimrod and Fitzgerald’s large-scale wishes, each designed for a paradise on earth, were examples of what were not meant to be. As noble as they were, as heartfelt their constructions had been, they engulfed and endangered others. A dream like that would cause doubts, and create those opposing it. With time, it would fall.

But in spite of their demise, Lea couldn’t help but feel a little bit jealous. Rather than someone like her, who lost a dream to be passionate about, believing in your ideals until the very last moment like Nimrod and Fitzgerald had… seemed much cooler.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055730931769561158 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055730931769561158><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Dec-22 04:17 PM">16:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Worry about yourself!”

Lea jested with Nimrod one last time, giving him a thumbs up. It was sad having to watch him go, of course. But seeing such a cool side to her Servant made it hard not to send him off with a smile. She didn’t exactly share Nimrod’s idea of her being his ‘vassal’, but…

If he was going to show such an impressive end, she couldn’t help but feel motivated to live up to his trust.

So, as Nimrod headed to his demise, she could only return Fitzgerald’s words with confidence. Different from the confidence she lost a great deal of during the ordeal known as the Holy Grail War, but a more… determined response.

“Why don’t you lay down the information for us, Fittzy? <strong>I’ll stake down my life to stop the Grail Mud.</strong> Let’s start from talking about <em>when</em>.”

That was the least she could do to live up to Nimrod’s expectations. Even if she didn’t have a dream, she could protect others’ dreams. That was the resolve she made.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His single eye gazed into the distance, lacking a pupil. Instead, his eye was simply a vague kaleidoscope of colors that reflected a distant light. A light that, even now, was so very distant.

Yet he found the prospect amusing. Lea and Thomas were so energetic, and full of hope. Had he been like that, once? His memory had all but faded completely, used as fuel for his own Noble Phantasm, yet his heart stirred slightly.

That eye, which saw things for what they truly were, saw a single symbol: hope.

Those same eyes that saw that Nirvana had made contact with the Grail Mud, and those same eyes that had determined what the Grail Mud represented... They had seen both good and absolute evil in this world.

&quot;When Alexandria summoned me, I don&#39;t think they expected me to be so useful. I see things for what they truly are. What they represent. Blame my public perception, authors never get good PR. People thought I was some masterful author, when in actuality all I did was leave reality behind, and insert myself into more fantastical stories.&quot;

Gatsby sat there, as a testament to this idea. He waved innocently.

&quot;When Nirvana touched the Grail Mud, they brought back an evil. Can it be stopped? I&#39;m unsure. Even tragedies only occur because the cast made a slew of poor decisions. Take The Great Gatsby as an example. Is reality a tragedy? If so, there may still be time.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055771867392262174 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055771867392262174><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Dec-22 07:00 PM">19:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Time for Neo Holy Empire and Republic to thrash each other apart, at least.

&quot;<strong>The world will end again. That will be that. No epilogue. No sequel, nothing. This will be the last chapter. This is unacceptable. The only way that this story ends is with me publishing it and raking in cash.</strong>&quot;

Lewis tried to think up on solutions on how he could try to prevent the world from ending again. If it was just that, couldn’t he just try to go there and tell them that it was important to be in good relations with the other? That couldn’t have been difficult. If they cared about the world at all, then of course they’d work together! Then again. . . The republic was trying to take Alexandria’s data and that showed how the republic were as people. 

“And we know plenty of people in the republic or who sided with them, so I’m sure if we talk to them, they can talk to others and boom we have a chained link to republic. . . All that matters now if going to the Neo H—Holy Empire. . ? I don’t even know what that is most of the time!”

Getting Republic and the Neo Holy Empire to cooperate... getting two of the world&#39;s most powerful rival factions, currently in the midst of a war over Alexandria’s archives, to work together toward a common goal.

Lewis and Lea were both optimistic. Lewis probably thought back to Alexander and his Lancer as the face of the Republic, as if agreeing with them meant agreeing with the Republic itself, and moved on to the other faction which he clearly knew little about without transition. Thomas was obviously a bit more skeptical of this whole cooperation thing. He looked at the Rider in disbelief, slowly shaking his head no.

&quot;<strong>...I honestly don&#39;t see it.</strong>&quot; He sighed, massaging the bridge of his nose in frustration. &quot;It&#39;s like Fitzgerald says, they&#39;re both stubborn, set in their ways, and they don&#39;t give in half an inch when it comes to their interests. I think trying to get them to cooperate might even be more difficult than stopping the Grail Mud itself. Think of it as, uh...trying to reconcile the United States and Great Britain.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was a field Lea was utterly clueless about. She lacked any meaningful connections with either side. No good reason for people to hear her out… at least, not yet.

Even without any background information at all, Lea knew just how difficult it would be to get the two factions to set aside their differences. She wanted to live up to the expectations placed on her, but that seemed almost impossible. It didn’t take long for Lea to reach the same conclusion as Thomas. Amidst such a situation, she found it difficult to keep her smile.

“But,” she continued, “we still have to <strong>try.</strong>”

Otherwise, the world they knew of would come to an end. There was no other road than to throw themselves into a fool’s errand.

“I agree with Rider’s idea. No one is going to believe us if we say that the Grail Mud is about to reemerge without a primary source, far from it. But we <em>can</em> maybe convince them to strengthen humanity’s defenses. This little fiasco can, hopefully, be an example of why a better security system is necessary.”

Both Fitzgerald and Nimrod’s deaths would leave a rather flashy mark on both the Republic and the Empire’s radars… probably. If she could leverage that had Nimrod’s Tower managed to grow even further, the destruction could perhaps reached beyond just Alexandria— exaggerate a little bit here and there— then perhaps.

Of course, anything she would be saying right now would be nothing but conjecture. She didn’t know if her words would hold any validity in the ‘real world’. Just as she entered the Holy Grail War as a complete amateur, she was doing the same into this endeavor to save the world.

“… I’d like to ask for you two’s help, if possible. I don’t think I can even come close to doing it alone… even with all three of us, its probably going to be tough. But—“

A sad finale after all Nimrod gave up would be far too tragic. If there was still time—

“<strong>I want to decide the ending to this story myself.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From Fitzgerald&#39;s perspective in this precise moment, they were nothing but fools playing at authority. Then again, everyone was. 

&quot;During the Revolutionary War, yes.&quot; Fitzgerald agreed. &quot;It will be difficult, but humanity must prevail. The greatest stories are those with uncertainty laced into the pages. With that in mind—&quot;

&quot;You must go. A dream vanishes upon waking, and you all, along with everyone, are bound to wake up soon.&quot; Fitzgerald smiled to himself. &quot;<strong>I really didn&#39;t want to wake up.</strong>

All authors hide from reality. This is the reason for fiction&#39;s existence. Yet there must come a point where all books are read, the pen is put down, and the manuscript is submitted. That book&#39;s story will then become a small part of someone&#39;s identity.

Books are, in a way, dreams themselves.

The room rumbled, and cracks began to appear in the floor around the trio.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056100371484921867 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056100371484921867><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Dec-22 04:45 PM">16:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;My fingers danced for a little while upon the keys of my character.

Fitzgerald closed his eyes.

&quot;<strong>Something more.</strong>&quot;

The floor collapsed, and the trio fell into wakefulness.

As Thomas fell into the abyss, his memories began to slip away again, as he began to wake from this dream. Would meeting his father vanish, too?

The fluttering of pages accompanied him into the dark abyss, and the small voice of an affluent gentleman—an affluent author—rung out.

&quot;<strong>The Great American Novel.</strong>&quot;

Thus, Thomas&#39;s memories filled with light.

Such a hand should have never felt warmth, yet it did as it grasped Gatsby&#39;s hand. Fitzgerald wiped his eyes with his other hand.
