A parade of trumpets, drums, and other instruments rang in the streets beneath the massive Tower of Babel as Nimrod watched. Many spectators shouted his name in rhythm. 

<strong>Nimrod! Nimrod! Nimrod! Nimrod!</strong>

It was just an ordinary day in King Nimrod’s domain. People were happy to be under his reign, to support and accept his dream. Yes, everything was as it should be. How had he gotten here? Did it really matter? His subjects were here, and it was his duty to lead and rule them, as any good king should.

<strong>NIMROD! NIMROD! NIMROD! NIMROD!</strong>

The cheering grew louder as Nimrod sat on his throne, overlooking much of his home and kingdom. Yet as he sat there, he saw a tattered man coming up the stairs towards his throne. As he approached, he bowed as low as his quivering knees would allow.

“Your grace, his majesty, King Nimrod!” The man gasped, tears streaming down his cheeks. “My entire town was attacked by raiders! They killed so many… Please, will you send justice raining down from the heavens upon these cruel men. O’ Great King, please aid us!”

The man began to weep. “Please, I beg you to enact justice. They took my wife… They took my daughter…”

Just another day as king.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051231462285914163 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051231462285914163><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Dec-22 06:18 AM">06:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="animereader &#128141;#0413">@animereader &#128141;</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A charismatic speech that left his subjects cheering even louder. Being a King was not for everyone but Nimrod had loved it for a time. He had given his all to it. It was unfortunate that his own native was crushed so long ago. As the man was led out of the room his army gathered to head to the village he arose from his throne. He walked up to a window and looked out of it to gaze at the Tower of Babel. It was his pride and joy. So he wondered if…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The crowd cheered his name, they cheered for his justice, and they cheered for him. Yes, good. This was how a king should be treated.

Thus Nimrod stood to look upon his great tower. It strained to reach the heavens, and to reach God. Had it been completed? It was so very tall, yet surely, it could be <strong>taller</strong>, no?

How far did it go? How tall was it? If he stood atop that tower, would he be able to claim dominion over both heaven and earth?

A voice roused Nimrod from his stupor and gaze. An advisor kneeled. 

&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; The man kneeled for a good while, before standing. &quot;If you may indulge this poor subject&#39;s wonderings, you seem perturbed by your great Tower of Babel. What ails you, my king?&quot;

The advisor stepped up to stand alongside Nimrod.

&quot;It grows taller still, my lord. We all await the day that you place the final brick, and reach God himself. What kind of domain does he rule over, and how does it compete with Your Majesty&#39;s dominion? What do you think, Your Grace?&quot;

Yet he had only in his wildest dreams ever imagined that it would grow this tall. He was left awe struck. In awe of the beautiful vision of his appearing in front of him. He was stunned into silence. Tears flowed down his face. It took a few moments before he was able to muster a response 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">I&#39;m happy.

Turning his back on the tower he returned to his throne. Resting his head on his fist he made a command clear and concise leaving no room for question.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">All of you, leave now. I need some time by myself

He said not a single word after. But his people would know better than to respond. He sat in silence reflecting as his throne room emptied out. It was a shame. If he hadn&#39;t just had an encounter with Fitzgerald perhaps he could have lived this beautiful lie for even a moment longer. Yet he had seen those dreaming people. He doubted Fitzgerald had time and reality warping abilities. Even an idiot could figure the situation out with this many clues. And thus it took him only a short while to break out of his happiness and reject it

He spoke casually as if in a conversation with Fitzgerald as of this moment. He had no guarantee as to what type of response he would get but still he spoke without hesitation. To the King who believed in the Human to turn dreams into reality he was inherently incompatible with a world of dreams, even his own. It was for that same reason he had rebuked Lea after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It did not even bother to verify that it was indeed Fitzgerald. From what Nimrod had known about Fitzgerald, he was a boastful man. If given the opportunity, he would verbally abuse Nimrod into the dirt, without a second thought.

Yet the dream did not answer, meaning Fitzgerald hadn&#39;t heard the accusation, or he <strong>could not respond</strong>.

Yet how was Nimrod still active within the dream? Was it his enormous ego that allowed him to retain his individuality? Berserkers were such loathsome creatures.

Yet if Fitzgerald wasn&#39;t there to respond, yet was responsible for the creation of this world for Nimrod&#39;s own benefit... What other word was there for such a being other than <em>God</em>?

If Fitzgerald was the God of this dream, then there was only one thing left to do. 

<strong>Scale the tower, and complete it.</strong>

Obeying its king, a bridge extended from the tower, directly into Nimrod&#39;s throne room. A glowing brick appeared within Nimrod&#39;s massive hand. He recognized it as a part of his tower.

A true Key of Babel. A key to complete the tower.

 After all, he was Nimrod, King of Babel.

And he would always rebel.

While it was not expressed outwardly it was a cause of some surprise. He had rebelled against this twisted dream yet had been given no further attention. Either Fitzgerald was too scared to face him or simply didn’t care. He presumed I was the former. There was little the King could do. In this dream Fitzgerald was God as much as that sickened him. So he would do the same as he always did.

<strong>He would just go and surpass God</strong>

As the Key appeared in his hand and the bridge connecting to his tower was created he had already decided what he must do. If Fitzgerald was unreachable then Nimrod would reach him. He was a Heroic Spirit that reached out to unreachable stars every day without fail. He would not hesitate or falter. In this false world God and Nimrod would come face to face for the first time. And so he stepped out the bridge and began his walk.

It was a solemn silent walk up to the bridge leading directly to the top floor of the tower. To his people it really would look like the King was ascending to heaven, his mission complete walking high above them. Inside he felt a mix of emotion. On one hand he loathed that this was a fantasy. That his triumph was still unable to leave the realm of his dreams. On the other he was fearful that the heavens would rain down judgement on him once more. And yet he was happy. He couldn&#39;t help but feel like he was finally completing a goal that had been left abandoned for so long ago. Truly it was a funny thing being a human.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053047934117224458 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053047934117224458><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Dec-22 06:36 AM">06:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
He stepped onto the final floor of the tower. It was tall. Impossibly tall. Had it grown further since the start of the dream. Was that even possible? It was a dream so those types of details hardly matter. The tower was complete. Its height could no longer be scaled. At the far end stood a door. A door quite literally leading into heaven. The keyhole sat at it&#39;s centre ready and awaiting. He finally stopped in front of that door. He raised the Key of Babel up and took a moment. He breathed it all in. His triumph, his glory, his ambition, his growth, his joy. He was disgusted that he had allowed himself to feel these feelings but he would also have to thank Fitzgerald for them. A God that was undoubtedly his enemy yet appeared as a helper. Humankind has no need for a restriction like that. He slid the key in and unlocked the door. God (Fitzgerald) would be surpassed and consumed by humanity. He pushed the doors wide open. They would enter heaven (Paradise) and devour whatever they had inside growing even further.

<strong>The King defied God and took a step into heaven for the first time. Humanity rebelled against a predetermined fate to advance further into the pages of time.</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As the doors creaked open on heavy hinges, Nimrod saw something beyond them.

Golden light. Was this heaven? As Nimrod stepped further into the golden light, something changed. He had resisted the dream, yet he had followed it to its completion. Even if it was a perversion of Nimrod&#39;s ideal and dream, it still was Nimrod&#39;s dreams made reality.

He <em>had</em> reached his goal. He had completed Babel? What more was there to do, but make his dream reality?

Faintly, Nimrod heard a violin playing in the distance. The tune was nostalgic, and similar to something Nimrod had heard before. Where had he heard a violin before in this summoning?

Then, the dream <em>shifted</em>. Not visually, but spiritually. As if, instead of sleeping on his back, Nimrod was now sleeping on his <em>side</em>.

Maybe? Dreams were weird.

Then, a gash in reality opened before Nimrod as the violin slowly grew louder and louder. Within that portal was a vague outline of Nimrod&#39;s Master, Lea.

What had Fitzgerald said? All dreams were foundations of one larger dream? Were all dreams interconnected?
It was time for him to decide.

As he left his people to save the ones that truly mattered, the entire nation of Shinar looked up at the tower that they helped build.

Each brick had been placed meticulously by Nimrod&#39;s people. From the stonemasons to soldiers to nobility to common folk, they had all contributed for this symbol, this great display of human unity.

Yet as they looked up at it, Nimrod left them. How could their king do such a thing? Had they as a people done something wrong?

The throne was vacant, and ripe for the taking. Yet nobody moved an inch.

Then, a voice rang out.

&quot;<strong>Thank you, King Nimrod! You were the best!</strong>&quot; A young boy called out, whooping aloud as he looked upon the light atop the tower.

Others looked on in stunned silence, before joining in.

&quot;<strong>Thank you, King Nimrod, First of His Name!</strong>&quot; An elderly man leaned on his cane and bellowed out.

&quot;<strong>You have shown us the path to prosperity! Thank you for your labor, descendent of Noah!</strong>&quot;

As the dream cracked under the strain of lacking a host, the people cheered for their sovereign&#39;s goal, showing their support!

&quot;<strong>NIMROD! NIMROD! NIMROD! NIMROD!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>THE MIGHTIEST HUNTIER UNDER HEAVEN AND EARTH!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>THANK YOU, KING NIMROD!</strong>&quot;

The crowd cheered loudly, and the last emotion experienced in the dream was pride in their great king.
