It had been four days since the disastrous Tourney Match, though Ā-Q&#236;ng did not remember much from that day, the pages of her memory blank after pouring all of herself into her Secondary Noble Phantasm.

She awoke later that evening, surrounded by medical staff in the emergency wing of the Asclepion Hospital, having been administered basic treatment to keep her Spirit Core from collapsing completely, stabilizing her condition enough that her Servant body could heal itself if given time. After all, nobody was quite sure whether or not Alexander had bonded to his Servant or not, meaning that keeping her teetering on death’s door would only consume his own vitality due to the bond they would have shared, complicating his own chances at survival or perhaps even outright killing him as his own familiar drained him of his life. The option of simply shutting down her Frame was there of course, but unless presented with no other option to save Alexander’s life, they were still bound by their Hippocratic Oath, even if their patient was a Servant. Fortunately Ā-Q&#236;ng was found to have never bonded herself to her Master, simplifying her procedure by prescribing her a measured dosage of Mana Batteries before dismissing her the very same day.

The same could not be said for her Master.

His armor had shattered and partially melted, seared into his flesh and threatening to tear into his organs should he have been forced to continue the fight. As a mortal, it was quite accurate to say that his condition was many times more critical than Ā-Q&#236;ng’s own, his mind drifting in comatose uncertainty for the first day until Alexandria’s best eventually managed to wake him on the second. It took three more for his wounds to heal enough for him to regain the ability to move without assistance, and although the staff had insisted that he should have stayed for at least another week, being able to stand and walk, even with difficulty, was enough for Alexander.

Thus he left and returned to his Suite.

That would be the first time he and his Servant would have met since the battle.
Though Ā-Q&#236;ng had returned to the hospital on occasion, she was denied access to his room due to the uncertainty of his condition, though it would appear her visits had been mistaken as concern for her Master’s well-being and quickly earned her the favor of the local nurses, pampering her with sweets and playing with her during their breaks. As she herself was still in the process of recovering from her wounds, her body only superficially healed on the surface, they had even gotten into the habit of ‘treating’ her with colorful band-aids and bandages, a common trick used with children to have them believe they were already on their way to feeling better.

Alexander was sitting in the leather desk chair. He was wearing a bath robe and underneath were hardened casts and braces holding his body in proper shape. Almost no skin was showing on his body, instead white gauze and baige bandages adorned his skin. A cane rested at his left side hinting that one of his legs had sustained a grave injury. 

Peeking up from his desk Alexander let out a bright smile. &quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng, I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve finally arrived. Spending the last few weeks on this island alone was rather dull. I missed our trips to the park.&quot; Alexander&#39;s breaths were labored as he spoke. It sounded like he should be on breathing support, yet he still managed somehow. Additionally he was still able to maintain a straight composure, making sure never to loose his look of confidence and bravado.

&quot;Please take a seat and we will talk. You want answers I know. Ask me whatever you would like&quot;

That she was to blame for his condition was a fact not lost on her.

Had she struck preemptively and ruthlessly, as her Master preferred for her to, they could have defeated their opposition before they had gained the chance to invoke their Noble Phantasm. No. Not just that, but she had failed seeing the attack coming in the first place as she was simply too fixated on observing her Master, waiting for signs of his admitted cruelty so that she could finally bring herself to sever her ties with him. This one-sided grudge was to blame for both their injuries.

It was impossible not to feel some manner of guilt at that realization.

And so while Ā-Q&#236;ng did not answer Alexander’s smile with her own, neither did she take his offer to sit. Instead she crossed the room to where he sat in silence, ignoring his greetings and pleasantries for the moment, before carefully placing her left hand on the center of his chest, just above his sternum.

“Hold still.”

But this was not an act of healing.
Traditional Chinese Medicine was formed around the understanding of Qi, Jing, and Shen, the three pillars representing the Spirit, Essence, and Mind. What she did now was simply stir her Master’s Qi, his flow of magical energy, and relieve him of the pain caused by its stagnation. To heal his body and flesh, she would have needed to share with him her Jing, though her current self had no interest in performing such an act despite the practice being at its most efficient in her summoned age.

Removing her hand from Alexander’s chest, it was likely that he would feel the results almost immediately, a numbing warmth spreading through his veins, or more accurately his Circuits should he be sharp enough to note the difference, and relieving him of the most superficial aches caused by his wounds. It was little more than simple pain-relief, as such was the extent of what Ā-Q&#236;ng was currently capable of due to her innate understanding of the flow of Qi without further studying its applications in the field of medicine in her young age. Perhaps she would have been of more use had she only been a few years older.

Regardless, without missing a beat she moved on to his shoulder-blades after circling around his chair, softly pressing against his pressure points with her knuckles to repeat the procedure in solemn peace. If one did not know any better, the sight could have been easily mistaken for a dutiful daughter tending to her father.

She finally spoke to break the silence, her voice quiet and neutral.

“I solve my problems by running away when it becomes hard to think. It is easy. I thought things were different as a Servant from when I was alive, so when you told me that nothing changed, that is what I did.

“I still do not fully agree with you of course, but it is not like I do not understand.
If people attack me, I hit back twice as hard. Destroying a kingdom is fine if they are hurting people, and going to war for something precious to you is fine as well.”

The examples Ā-Q&#236;ng gave were not thoughtless. She herself had supported a deliberate war effort after all, that being the Kingdom of Yue’s rebellion against the Kingdom of Wu, as well as F&#224;n L&#237;’s involvement in the war to reunite with his lover Xī Shī. It was clear that even if she normally belittled battle as entertainment, she was still aware enough of true conflict to realize its weight. Not all conflict was evil. A justification was important, a reason. And Alexander’s eluded her still.

“But you have none of those things. Neither Alexandria nor Republic hurt you, and your family is safe at home. You said you wanted to start again. Make it so that pain and ugliness and coldness don’t have to exist anymore. How?

“I am not going to be mad at you if you tell me this time. I have not seen you do anything evil yet, so that can wait until you really try to hurt someone that you should not. Right now I just want to know what you want to use me for.”</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 03:31 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The pain reduction was immediate, however breathing was still laborious and the current state of Alexander&#39;s health did not seem to increase. Despite this the pain relief was enough to keep Alexander in a somewhat comfortable state for the time being. 

Alexander couldn&#39;t help but chuckle to himself at Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s questions. She had seemed so childish and innocent upon her summoning. But now she revealed an introspective and inquisitive nature. Even though there was tension behind their conversation Alexander was happy to see this improvement in his servant. 

&quot;How I intend to fix the world Ā-Q&#236;ng is not so simple. The Vladisnov plan dates back centuries before I was born. The world was much different back then... But today there is a new age of suffering. We have returned to a world where conquest is a reality. Just look at the Republic and Alexandria. My grandfather came from a time where people no longer had to worry about being murdered by their neighbor. But Ā-Q&#236;ng, people still cried all the same.&quot; 

Alexander&#39;s speech was broken by a brief coughing fit, his hand reaching for a glass of water to stabilize himself. After calming down he would look back to Lancer and continue. &quot;I am going to create a world where strength does not over power knowledge. Together humanity will pursue knowledge, we will forget all of the superficial pain created by evil. But for this to happen we must all unite under one cause. Currently Macedon has already taken three other cities under our command. All of these places have already seen an decrease in poverty and increase in education since joining our cause. Through diplomacy and careful action I intend to build my empire even larger. I want to include the world in the golden age of Macedon.&quot;

Alexander leaned back in his chair, breaking his straight composure.

&quot;But where do you fit into it? Of the three cities that have joined the Macedonian empire one is called Adewa.

A gift that signifies the start of a better world. I would like you to help me realize my dream. That&#39;s why I summoned you and that&#39;s why your catalyst was gifted to me. I cannot make you do anything, that much is clear. So if you&#39;d let me, I&#39;d like for you to be part of making the world a better and united place.

The zeal with which he spoke was near blinding, the confidence in his belief unshakable. How grandiose his ideals were, the future he envisioned an idyllic dream he had every intent to make reality. And yet. He was so utterly convinced of his vision that he had perhaps neglected to take into consideration how it would be perceived by others. He was used to peers and politicians. Educated men and women that rivaled him in academia, or at the very least, had accumulated enough life experience to be able to process a vision of his grand scale.

Ā-Q&#236;ng possessed none of that.

Taking a step or two back from her Master, she clutched her left arm with her right as she let his words sink in. But to her they seemed no more than fantasies. Much like feeding an animal a luxurious meal prepared by the greatest of chefs, Ā-Q&#236;ng did not have the ability to digest what exactly Alexander’s plan really was. His country was doing great, and he wished to share its wealth. Fundamentally this was the core of his desire, but the nuances of his motives yet remained difficult for her to understand.
Boiled down to such a simple ideal, it was much too easy to doubt its veracity.

“I see,” her voice was firmer this time, as if she had begun to understand her Master’s character a little more, erasing the need for uncertainty and vagueness.

But then why did it still lack warmth? Not that it had dipped into a hostile chill either, the appropriate term perhaps being cold resignation.

Thus she stated her position, one which opposed Alexander’s own, but there was no desire for confrontation to be gleaned from her demeanor. She simply looked down at her bandaged wrist, picking at the white fabric listlessly as she spoke.

“The people that healed me were nice. They played with me and gave me this even though I have no need for it as a Servant, but they treated me anyway. Even though I belong to Republic. Even though I am an enemy to them.”

Her tone was soft as she recalled these fond memories, recent as they were, before suddenly sharpening as she asked a single question, “Would you have done the same?”

She allowed her inquiry to hang between them for a brief while before resuming scratching at her bandages.

“I think it is nice of you to want to help people if you can. Your people must be happy to have a leader that is so devoted to them, but what about everybody that does not follow you? The people that do not belong to you? You said before that you would torture and kill to make your dream come true, do whatever it takes, and if that is true I will never agree with you, no matter what.”

I still do not think you are right, but I also cannot say you are wrong. I am going to stay with you for now, but I am not going to go with you back to Macedon. Or Adewa.

While it&#39;s true that Alexander is a calm and collected individual, there is one thing he is willing to lose his temper over. When he does not get what he wants Alexander will do everything in his power to get it. However, his loss of temper is not met with rage and fists, instead he creates a plan to satiate his disappointment. Alexander&#39;s calm collectedness accompanied by his need to have what he wants, is possibly his most terrifying trait. A trait that Ā-Q&#236;ng was getting dangerously close to learning about.

&quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng, did I not buy you clothes, not because you needed them, but because it would make you happy ? I have shown you as much hospitality as anyone could have, even when I did not have to.&quot; Alexander&#39;s posture stiffened, his body language becoming more direct. 

His hand pointed to a small phone shaped box on the coffee table in the middle of the room. He had bought the device for Ā-Q&#236;ng prior to her running off but never had the chance to introduce it to her. &quot;Even when you disobeyed me I tried to cater this new world to you in case you should come back. My hope that we could work together never subsided, but it seems you have mistaken my actions for something else.&quot;

Alexander reached his hand to the side gripping his cane with his left hand. He pushed against the ground forcing himself to stand, his legs shaking from his own weight. &quot;Despite all of this, I cannot stop you from staying here Ā-Q&#236;ng, but you should be aware that you cannot survive without me. If you are separated from me you will not be able to sustain your body alone. Eventually you will fade away and forget everything you have experienced here. I suppose your decision is a question of what this world is worth to you now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052647948779012166 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052647948779012166><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 04:07 AM">04:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There it was. The side of Alexander’s that had once already surfaced upon their meeting with Thomas and Lewis. Cold and calculated. Pragmatic. Ruthless.
Glimpsing it was what had first shattered Ā-Q&#236;ng’s impression of her Master and compelled her to run so that she may be alone with her thoughts, and though she had planned to confirm his true nature in the Commodan, it would appear that he now willingly gave her the answer she had sought. By being nice; seeking to manipulate his Servants with thinly veiled sympathy.

But even Ā-Q&#236;ng was able to read between his lines, especially so when no attempt was made to disguise his intent.

“I see,” no anger muddled her voice, nor did it quake with betrayal as it did before when she ran from him, but instead it rang with dejected acceptance, “So you really were not lying before.”

His threat to her life should she not continue to follow him was clear as day, as were his expectations of repayment for the leniency and kindness he had shown her. There was a reason that she had returned his gifts to her the day she had left him, but it would appear that the favor she owed him was still too great. In his eyes at least.

“But you forgot one thing, Master. There is nothing for me in this life without Xī Shī. I owed you many things for the man I thought you were, and to tell the truth, I was really happy when I got to be your Servant. I never had a father before, so I thought perhaps that is what it was like. To be spoiled, and be scolded, but still be able to rely on you even when I was being bad…”

A smile. For some reason she smiled as she spoke, even despite that being the last thing she wanted to do at the moment.

“Like I said, there is no meaning in a world without Xī Shī for me, but you managed to give me some. I was not so sure before, but I now realize I was wrong too. I thought helping you win peacefully was the right thing for me to do, but if this is who you really are then I cannot allow you to win the tournament after all. I will wait until you leave, and when you have, I will probably die soon anyway. I like this city. It is warm and open and nice, so I do not want you to change it with your wish.”

Her fingers stopped fiddling with her fake bandages as she arrived at the end of her declaration, instead clenching and stretching them to shake off the numbness still persisting from the wounds she had sustained in her last battle.

“I am a Servant. Please do not disagree… Alexander.”

With her referring to him by his given name it was all but certain. Though he retained his rights as a Master, he was hers no longer.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was the natural progression of their relationship, and had been going in that direction for some time now. Alexander paused for a moment bitting down on his front lip.

&quot;AHAHAHAHAH&quot; Laughter? Why was Alexander laughing. He was on the receiving end of a servants threat, yet he showed no fear. &quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng, you are very young. In the ways you think, the way you act, the way you see the world. Whatever goals you have will not be realized via the avenue of happiness. Instead, you have to work hard to make your happiness reality. My happiness is to rid the world of pain, yours is to have Xī Shī.&quot; 

Alexander took a deep breath before taking a step closer to Lancer. &quot;It&#39;s a shame I was the one who summoned you. You remind me a lot of Aty when she was younger. I think you two would have been really great friends. Although, I think as she gets older she seems more and more like me. I&#39;m curious to see what would have come of you with age. Perhaps If you stayed here long enough, life would teach you about the ambition I speak about. It is inevitable afterall.&quot; Alexander would pause, his mind trailing for a moment as he reflected on the hardship of life.

&quot;Now then, I certainly can&#39;t take you on Ā-Q&#236;ng. But, I&#39;d be lying if I wasn&#39;t curious to see how far you&#39;d be willing to go to stay here. In the meantime I can only agree to let you stay. But mark my words Ā-Q&#236;ng you&#39;ll end up back in Macedon one way or another.&quot; Alexander turned to the side after finishing his sentence walking towards his bedroom. He had no intention of fighting his Servant. Intimidation had not worked, but still he would find a way to get what he wanted. 

&quot;One more thing. I think it&#39;d make you happy to know that I do not want the republic to win. My wish here has already been completed. I think I&#39;d much rather see Alexandria pull through.&quot;

Though it came at the cost of his Servant, he had splendidly shown off the military might of Macedon for all to see, able to overpower a mercenary of similar caliber in single-combat and even withstanding a Servant’s Noble Phantasm with his life intact. That match may have technically counted as a loss, though it was only so due to factors outside of his own control.
Investors. Officials. Manufacturers. Those he had wished to reach with his commercial act had witnessed what just a single man was capable of when equipped with Macedon’s finest. The actual outcome of the battle never even mattered to begin with.

“Tch.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng made her displeasure known, practically admitting her defeat as for all of her resistance, Alexander had accomplished each of his goals regardless. Though he had been injured, his wounds were merely temporary. He would recover in time. Even had he died, he would have become a symbol for his country, a banner for his successors to rally behind, as already he reminded his Servant of his heir, Atalanta, and the inevitability of her choosing the same exact path as her father. In time.

Despite the fact that Ā-Q&#236;ng would never lose to Alexander in a physical confrontation, in matters of the mind, her opponent had undeniably bested her.

“Never,” she declared defiantly, “I will never go to your Macedon. Not if you are going to be the one controlling it.”

To play into his plans without realizing that her every act only led to his own success? After all, to be manipulated was in her nature, both in life and in death, a flaw written into her very core by the author who penned her story.

“If you do not care about Republic winning, then leave...”

<em>“...before my magical energy runs out.”</em>

Of course the latter part was left unsaid, though it wouldn’t be hard for Alexander to guess at what his Servant attempted to omit. She was still in the process of healing, meaning that her body burned energy faster than usual to mend her wounds. To be cut off from a stable supply of Mana Batteries in this state was a death sentence, leaving Ā-Q&#236;ng with a limited amount of time to see Alexander escorted out of Alexandria before he could stir up any more trouble.
Not that he was by far the most dangerous player currently wreaking havoc, or even intending to by his own admission, but of course her determination was purely fueled by personal reasons and the grudge she bore her former Master. Once again she neglected to consider the practicality of her actions, letting her feelings interfere with her decision making when her talents would have been of much greater use elsewhere.

It was words like these which drew her ire, the condescending tone of an adult talking down to a child who had yet to walk the full length of their life’s path. Words she wanted to refute and deny with all her heart… yet could not do so without glimpsing in them a small measure of truth.

“If growing up means becoming like you and the other Republic Masters, then I would rather stay a child forever.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But, Ā-Q&#236;ng, you will at some point realize that true knowledge is far more blissful then ignorance.&quot; 

Alexander reached his hand out opening his bedroom door and stepping in. &quot;Now then I am tired and my body is still broken. I&#39;m going to rest. It&#39;s your choice if you&#39;ll be here when I wake. I&#39;m leaving once the tournament ends, but untill then I&#39;d enjoy talking philosophy with you more.&quot;

Walking away, Alexander placed his cane at his bedside,. crawling onto the mattress. He had no say over where Ā-Q&#236;ng went and what she did. However, he did know that he would get what he wanted, one way or another.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
