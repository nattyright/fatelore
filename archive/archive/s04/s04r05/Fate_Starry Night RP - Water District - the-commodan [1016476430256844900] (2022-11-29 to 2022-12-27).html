Again.

The Republic had <strong>lost</strong>. <em>Again</em>.

Nikolai cursed underneath his breath and helmet while he sat inside the waiting room. He was right to doubt his teammates. Simon. Mikhail. Alexander. Each and every one of them, worthless in their own unique way. Perhaps he should’ve hinted in when Mikhail lost against… who was it again?

Didn’t matter.

What did matter, though, was that The Republic stood at a crossroads. Down one path, a defeat that Alexandria would not let them forget. Even if Nikolai himself did not particularly care for his parent faction, the sting of loss would feel all the same. A bitter feeling for a bitter end. 

And if he won this round? The tournament would simply go for as long as it had been allowed to. They still sat a foot behind their competition, and victory would make it a tense few days before the final round. Unbearably tense. 

If the ‘man’ survived til then, that was.

He had managed to get his submission in for the fourth round, and his rounds had mostly healed. At least, Nikolai could not feel the aches and bruises that would’ve left others in a bed for a week. No, his concern was of a mental variety. Even as he sat in the dark, eyes glued to the white tile floor, he could feel <em>it</em>. 

Control slipped. 

At the start, it had been a siege. A well-fortified fortress that stood strong against its foes. Ready to take on whatever ploys and plots they had in store. Now, though… the walls had been breached, and defenses were held up in the main castle. Without this wish, he would certainly not find… Sapphire (do NOT forget).

Perhaps this explained the incessant tapping of his foot on the hard surface. A constant metronome to the ears of the pair as they waited in the dark for the announcer to make the call. Lost in space, Nikolai kept this beat steady for the entire time. It’d put an aspiring musician to awe, at this point.

&quot;<strong>Win. Any. Price. Understand?</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

1 - 2. One and two. Despite their dominant victory in the first round, his allies had come up short, squandering the lead he had so graciously given them. Worthless! All of them, pathetic and useless weaklings, incapable of even modest victory! Was Alexandria truly so unbreakable? Were the Republic so incapable that they could not rip the throat of this wounded beast?!

Fine. Fine! If his armies could not put down this rebellion, he would do it himself.

<strong>&quot;There will be no mercy.&quot;</strong>

A simple response, not wholly congruous to Nikolai&#39;s question, but one that got the same point across just fine. Both of them would fight to win, no matter what it took.

They would not fail. He would not allow it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No celebration. No panic. One morning she&#39;d received her placement in the tourney by post, and the next morning she was sitting in a gondola and being rowed along the curved waterway that led to the neighboring district.

The Commodan. She could see it easily from the workshop windows of the Dust Jackets, watched its construction from start to finish, even. The tallest, and most presence-commanding structure in the Water District, made to awe and intimidate. Today would mark the first day she&#39;d set foot onto its soil.

Why hadn&#39;t she scouted the arena earlier? Convenience had never been an issue; her own workshop was a mere few stops away. She could&#39;ve walked there if she wanted, on a leisurely, afternoon stroll. But today would be her first visit. 

And her last as well. If all goes well, Alexandria would soon no longer require its function. The Commodan, like many, man* of the other structures Alexandria had commissioned for some one-off events, would be repurposed like jars and bottles and secondhand books. Perhaps a new library would be built here. Or a new water park, maybe, something to rival the popularity of <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#waku-waku-alexandria</span>. 

She hadn&#39;t been to the waterpark in a while, come to think of it. She used to love it, demanded that her auntie take her there every weekend...

The waterway merged into the massive lake that accommodated the coliseum. Aida found herself staring as massive structures of brick and concrete passed overhead, momentarily blocking out all light from the sun. Then her vision was clear, as the imposing arched structure inhaled them into its belly like a giant beast.

&#39;Did you know that Alexandria funded an entire department of mages and architects just to make sure the Commodan stays afloat?&#39; She blurted out as if she was reciting from an encyclopedia. &#39;It&#39;s a lot of work, making sure something made of a lot of stones and steel doesn&#39;t sink to the bottom of the lake. No one knows how the nomadic cities themselves do it, of course. The runes are one part of it, the visible part. But simply copying them doesn&#39;t do the trick...&#39;

One wondered why Alexandria would spend so much effort on a monument that might mark their defeat, but it was simply the wisdom of the sage. Every action, no matter how small, needed to reflect the mind of who caused it. It&#39;s no wonder that some cities viewed Alexandrians as snobs.

Speaking of snobs, Aida was starting to be confused as one. She gave long, detailed speeches of the arena&#39;s origins, inner workings and construction process, as if she were repeating a documentary of if ad verbatim. The poor gondolier was being educated far more than they had been paid for. 

She would have kept going and going, had someone not so rudely interrupted her mid sentence. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t know that, Aida. After all, it&#39;s only about the seventh time you have told me that.&quot; Reynard spoke up with an annoyed sigh, resting his elbow on the boat&#39;s end with his cheek on top of his palm. He looked bored out of his mind.

&quot;Why does it matter if the arena can float or not? Hell, maybe it shouldn&#39;t have. Maybe you Alexandrians should have slowed down construction and waited for the Church to show up. Seems rather silly of you to-&quot; He stopped himself once he realized what he was doing.

&quot;Nevermind me. What a sweet voice you have, <em>dear!</em> Please, keep going.&quot; He said with a cherubic face and a puppy-like tone, sliding towards Aida and wagging his tail. It was rather uncharacteristic of him, but Aida had noticed this behavior of his in the past few days: Anytime he went back to his usual Reynard antics, he would immediately catch himself in the act and scold himself, before attempting to make it up to Aida with honeyed words or acts of affection. 

This had started ever since Aida called out Reynard on his hypocrisy and how he held the power of being good in his hands. It seemed like the fox had taken this to heart, showering her with much more affection than before.

...But it rang a bit hollow. After all, it was hard to appreciate him if he was acting like an impish brat just moments ago. Changing one&#39;s habits was hard, especially for a set in stone character like Reynard. Why did he have to make everything so difficult? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Miraculous! Who&#39;d have thought that a little bit of rainbows and sunshine could go such a long way!

All at the cost of feeling pins and needles on his back as the librarian narrowed her eyes behind her glasses. Reynard was so obviously bored that no amount of smiles plastered on his face would hide the twitching of his facial muscles, which were beginning to strain under Aida&#39;s glare. 

&#39;If you really want to learn more about Alexandria&#39;s history, then I can give you a personalized lesson starting with the first settlers in the city, all the way back to the early 21st century. For free!&#39; To Reynard&#39;s horror, she came back with a vengeance. &#39;It took me weeks to plow through the text, but I&#39;m sure I can condense everything to under eight hours. In fact,&#39; she tapped the back of her bare wrist with a finger, as if there was a watch on it, &#39;if we can end this match and get back quickly, we might be able to get through everything before sundown!&#39;

She replied to the fox with a bright smile of her own, though it looked several shades more ominous than usual under the shadows cast by the coliseum. A chill even went down his spine amidst all the excited murmurs that were starting to fill the stadium. 

The spectator&#39;s stands filled up a bit quicker than usual. Perhaps the audience, too, sensed the increasing pressure of an approaching end. Only two matches remain. In a few days&#39; time, the most gossip-worthy event of the year would come to an end.

No doubt the press and the staff would be waiting, their cameras and recorders at the ready to intercept the stars of today&#39;s event-

&#39;Did they implement some kind of test?&#39; 

Aida peered down the edge of the walls and at the arena. The height was a bit too much for her to jump, but if she let herself down safely...

She lowered herself until she was sat very insecurely along the edge. Should she hop down? Is there a ladder of sorts around here, or should she make one herself?

He could take solace in being on the same page as his Servant. On a normal day, he might’ve thought twice before he took the word of such a dangerous, conniving god. Unfortunately, the normal days were gone. Now, there was only confusion and despair.

At least he understood what Zahhak said. At this point, half the words went right over his head. Words he <em>should’ve</em> known. How long until even the most basic of sentences had him at a loss?

Perhaps best not to think about it right now.

Instead, Nikolai donned his shield. The familiar weight comforted the giant as he pushed himself up off the bench. He beckoned to Lancer, “<strong>Time.</strong>”

It had felt long enough. He wouldn’t wait any longer, either. Slowly, he trudged up to the gate. The crowd outside shuffled, murmured, and bided their time. Soon enough, these gates would swing open, and they’d be back in the ring. 

And the noise would be even louder. Dreadful. Awful. Even now, he felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of idle chit-chatter and footsteps. Had he heard this clear last time? He… couldn’t remember. Didn’t matter.

“<strong>Fight. Rookie? Or. Actual. Soldier?</strong>”

Before either could answer, a low hum filled the area. The gates crept open, and light cut through the dark like a hot knife through butter. Nikolai flinched at the sudden increase of sound, and placed a free hand over the side of his helmet. 

“<strong>Grrrgh… Later.</strong>”

Master pushed onward with renewed vigor and stomps into the hard dirt.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grating. This announcer was grating. Why did he insist on running his mouth like this? <em><strong>Everyone</strong></em> knew who Zahhak was. <em><strong>Everyone</strong></em> knew who Nikolai was. After what they had done during the first round of the tournament, people could not forget. Their brutality was a searing blade that carved their names into the minds of the spectators.

They had to know. If they didn&#39;t know, how could they learn? If they didn&#39;t know, how could they recognise their own folly? How could they recognise their own festering souls?

They knew. Surely, they knew.

They weren’t well. That much was obvious. Compared to their first showing, the two were barely recognisable. The subtler of the two was Nikolai, but even underneath all that armour, a keen eye could tell something was wrong. There was something about his gait that was incorrect, about his demeanour that simply wasn’t right. And Zahhak…

He was a mess. His scales were cracked and broken and shattered, his entire carapace seemingly held together solely by the will of God of himself. His flesh was stretched and scarred, every inch of visible flesh a tattered mess. Black sludge, pitch black as the night, poured forth from every wound. It seemed as though he might collapse and die any second now, as though he were mere moments from death.

There was no chorus of boos. Instead, as Nikolai and Lancer walked out, all that could be heard was a mass of murmuring. What had happened to them? Had they been attacked before the battle? An assassination attempt? Was this a set-up? What was going on.

For his part, Zahhak didn’t care. Didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Didn’t frown. Didn’t rage. 

He just stood there, staring across the expanse of the arena, towards the opposite gate.

Waiting.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He kept up his act of wagging and smiling, hoping to melt her cold, cold heart, but received more glares in response. Geez, couldn&#39;t she at least applaud him for trying to be nice?

He did receive something special though, as Aida went on to have another rant, one about the type of &#39;reward&#39; that Reynard deserved for his attitude. An eight hour lesson?! About some stragglers that nobody cared about? This was torture! The fox&#39;s tail felt brittle and cold as Aida looked at him with an ominous smile. He couldn&#39;t tell whether she was being her usual self or purposefully trying to punish Reynard, or worse yet, both! For someone who claimed to be a well-behaved, educated librarian, his Master was surprisingly good at being cruel.

&quot;You overestimate me. Surely after such a hard battle I&#39;ll struggle to comprehend your words? This is best left till later, I say! <em>Quite</em> later.&quot; Reynard tried his best to reply with a cordial smile, betraying his inner expectations. &quot;Why don&#39;t we focus on the battle first, right? No use overthinking things!&quot; He swiftly tried to sway the conversation away.

Good thing that they had arrived, Reynard being reminded of the coliseum by the sounds of spectators and ships in the distance. Their cries were quite loud, like the buzzing of flies in unison that was more than the sum of its parts. The gondola had docked and the Saber had quickly jumped off, walking in the direction of the signs-

-Then he looked back and saw that Aida was still looking in the distance, tilting her head like an owl staring into the night. Reynard looked at her, expectantly, then dumbfoundedly, watching her kneel and observe the ground like an indecisive child.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051147405027983461 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051147405027983461><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Dec-22 12:44 AM">00:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;You getting cold feet now of all times?&quot; Reynard scolded, marching all the way back to Aida and grabbing her wrist before she had the time to consent. He then pulled hard, the librarian losing her balance as she was dragged away with barely any time to think! What did Reynard think he was doing? This was an important test to complete!

<em>tap</em>

Instead, she felt silly, watching as her Servant tapped on the directional sign on a wall. The word <em>ENTRANCE</em> was written in all caps on one of the arrows, leading to a hole on the arena&#39;s impenetrable surface.

&quot;There. Wasn&#39;t too hard now, was it?&quot; He wiped his hands with a smug grin on his face. &quot;We should probably get going. I caught a glimpse of the crowd being riled up, like they were about to see poor Isengrim get slaughtered. I think-&quot;

<em><strong>&quot;LLLLLLLLLLLLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, CHILDREN OF ALL AGES! THE TIME HAS COME ONCE AGAIN FOR ALEXANDRIA AND THE REPUBLIC TO DO BATTLE!&quot;</strong></em>

&quot;Yep.&quot; The echoes of the announcer&#39;s microphone were so loud that one could catch a glimpse of them even outside the arena. &quot;Sounds like it&#39;s our call to show up. Now, my lady, if you may-&quot; He extended his hand cordially, mimicking a princely gesture. Though, coming from Reynard, there was no doubt that he intended to tease. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stared.

&#39;Since when did you become so good at following signs?&#39; She asked, still somewhat dazed. She felt as if she had been plucked from somewhere far away and dropped in front of the gaunt looking sign. The maw of the dark corridor didn&#39;t look so inviting. She could hear the echoes of her voice bouncing off the walls until they faded into silence. 

It was difficult to feel the weight of the moment. The noise from the crowd was a blur, but in the pressbox high above the rest, it was nearly bedlam. Reporters smacked on keyboards and barked into phones while the announcer deafened the audience with his booming voice. Aida had always enjoyed watching the telecasts of various events when people at the workshop bothered to pull up the screen. To experience the mayhem in person, however...

&#39;<em>Yes!</em> I&#39;m nervous.&#39; She replied to Reynard, a bit more forcefully than she had intended. &#39;There&#39;s such a huge crowd.&#39; 

And in a few minutes, thousands and thousands of eyes would be fixed upon her, studying her, judging her. What would they say if she made a mistake and messed up big time? Would the announcer go easy on her mishaps? Would the audience? Would they boo her out of the arena? She bit her lip.

&#39;It&#39;ll just be like listening to you and Mr. Von Meer&#39;s critiques. Combined. Then times one thousand.&#39; She took Reynard&#39;s hand and squeezed it like a stress ball. It didn&#39;t relax her much, but the bone-crunching feedback grounded her in the present.

&#39;We&#39;ll take your advice and follow the signs like good boys and girls, then.&#39; Reluctant to unveil her blunder, Aida took the corridor that led to the arena and emerged through its proper entrance, the gates leading into the side of the arena marked by Alexandria&#39;s banners-

The crowd had fallen silent and it made her worry: when people stopped talking among themselves, it usually meant they started focusing their attention on something noteworthy, and there was only one location inside the coliseum that was truly noteworthy. 

She&#39;d rather have an ordinary entrance. You know, like slipping into a caf&#233; on a pleasant afternoon, chatting up the locals while waiting for the barista to pour her coffee. A cozy kind of attention, not this jagged edge of suspense-filled air ripe with anticipation. It made her feel as if she had to do something elaborate in response. But would a neat trick suffice?

What would the Republican contestants do? Maybe she could take a leaf out of their book!

She continued to peek from behind the gate, her own attention now focused on the opposite end of the arena...

&#39;...They walked. Reynard, they just walked.&#39; 

To say there was not a smidge of disappointment in her voice would be an outright lie. Her opponent and their Servant walked <s>slithered</s> onto the stage as if they were out on a stroll. Perhaps a bit heavy on the footsteps, but they were also huge, man and beast.

Emboldened by her opponents&#39; lack of fanfare, Aida finally stepped out from behind the gate.

Oh. This… was yet another joke, right? A terrible, unfunny, downright <em>awful</em> joke. A poor, poor joke, almost timed as poorly as someone who tried to make a funeral parlor laugh despite the occasion. Before, it had been two men. Pathetic, inexperienced people, but people nonetheless.

This time, it was a girl and her <em>pet</em>. He could make out the tail behind the Servant as the other pair closed the distance opposite them. And the lass, another Librarian, no doubt. Who else would wear those silly clothes, into an arena, against the likes of them? Alexandria must <em>really</em> dislike their staff, if they have the nerve to send them to certain death.

Which, unless this one hid a slew of armaments in those clothes, would be certain. Even in their battered states, Nikolai held no doubt that these two would seriously succumb to whatever assault they commited. If this had been the first round, then there would be hope. But now…

A low growl escaped his lips. Pathetic. Absolutely awful. The duo slowly approached and stopped once they reached the halfway point. Despite the head start, the two pairs managed to meet in the middle at the same time. Unfortunately, they only got bigger once face-to-face.

And then… he stood there. Nikolai did not heckle or harass, nor did he offer encouragement. The steady rise and fall of his shoulders showed signs that he still lived, but little else. An invisible gaze examined the Alexandrian pair as they might’ve done the same, yet not a single thing more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051275613924773898 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051275613924773898><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Dec-22 09:13 AM">09:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Did the opponents plan to wait out the buzzer, until the Announcer gave the go ahead to begin their fight? It felt to be the case, as the announcer continued on. 

“<strong>WELL, WE ALL KNOW THESE TWO BEHEMOTHS! NIKOLAI, AND HIS LANCER! A SHIELD IN HAND AND A BONE TO PICK, HE DOESN’T PLAN TO GO EASY ON HIS FOES! NOT TO MENTION THE ONE RIGHT BEHIND, READY TO MAIM AND TEAR AT A MOMENTS NOTICE!</strong>”

To tell the truth, he was anxious as well, only not showing it so that he could be a confident anchor for his Master to latch on to. But what he found hilarious was that none of Aida&#39;s concerns matched his.

&quot;I&#39;m just here worried about being pummeled and you&#39;re thinking about the <em>audience</em> of all things? What are you, Miss Superstar?!&quot; He retorted to her comment about crumbling under a billion critiques. Aida replied in kind, squeezing his hand to the point that he felt numb.

&quot;You have been pestering me for ages about this silly tournament, so I&#39;ll be damned if I let you chicken out right now! You wanted this, so <em>own it!&quot;</em> He scolded her, but it sounded more supportive than anything else as Aida felt Reynard&#39;s crushed hand squeeze her back. It was subtle, but it felt like him saying that they sunk, he would sink right beside her.

The two then made their way to the arena itself, albeit with much effort. Aida still had cold feet, so it was a slow drag for Reynard to get her past the entrance. During that struggle, however, Reynard caught a glimpse of their opponents: A large man, clad in more armor than sense, to the point that Aida looked naked in comparison. Their Servant, an enigmatic creature. Was it a dragon? A snake? A chimera or some sorts or a demon? Regardless, it seemed like they had seen better days, unless cracked shells and torn flesh were a sign of good health.

Reynard gulped, trying to show no fear. The Master looked manageable, it reminded him of the fellow at the bazaar from weeks ago. But the Servant? It worried him. He had never seen something so monstrous just roam around the streets of Alexandria. So far his only experience had been with human-like figures, such as the bamboo girl and the brat with a turban. The fox hated things that he did not know, so to be faced with an enigmatic opponent worried him slightly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051465859509538898 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051465859509538898><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Dec-22 09:49 PM">21:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Of course, what Aida was more worried about was their entrance. Upon seeing their unceremonious entrance, the librarian almost sighed with relief, realizing that she could just enter the arena normally with little fanfare.

&quot;Yes. What did you think this was, a gala? You&#39;re certainly dressed for it at least.&quot; Reynard scoffed, Aida unable to tell whether he was praising or mocking her clothes. Knowing him, most likely both. The two showed themselves as well, shocking Nikolai and Zahhak with their underwhelming presence. After all, who would have thought that a librarian and their furry companion would be part of the tournament&#39;s last legs?

<strong>&quot;ON ALEXANDRIA&#39;S SIDE, WE HAVE TWO NEW ARRIVALS! YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER ON HER SHIFT, BUT IF NOT, SAY HELLO TO YOUR FELLOW LIBRARIAN, AIDA MORETTI! HER WEAPON OF CHOICE IS THE FOX-EARED SERVANT TO THE RIGHT! NOW, HE MAY LOOK INNOCUOUS, BUT ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE IS A SABER! WHAT SORT OF SURPRISE DO THESE TWO HOLD IN STORE FOR US?!&quot;</strong>

<em>&quot;Little?&quot;</em> Reynard narrowed his eyes a bit, staring back at Zahhak and then hovering his other arm above his own head. <em>&quot;Not by much.&quot;</em> He thought, pumping his chest out with confidence.

It seemed like the Lancer disagreed, grinding his teeth together like a bear trap and staring deep into his opponent&#39;s eyes. His words said more as a result.

Reynard stared back at him, attempting to look stern in order to avoid giving away how grossed out he was by Zahhak&#39;s mouth movements and how the beast&#39;s voice felt like nails on chalkboard. To distract himself, he paid more attention to what was happening around him, and then-

&quot;I&#39;m not the one getting booed, at least.&quot; The fox replied with a smug grin before sticking his tongue out at the dragon. He then tugged at Aida&#39;s arm lightly.

&quot;Right, Aida? Call them names!&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The audience, the press, the freshly scrubbed venue - a bit less on the flowers and carpets, but heavier on the stone and steel - the only thing it lacked were the guests, of which there were only two pairs. 

&#39;How do you suppose I should&#39;ve dressed, then? Armor and sweatpants? How do people even <em>move</em> in those?&#39; 

Aida continued to pursue the topic, though she kept her head straight under the watchful gaze of the audience, only stealing the occasional, furtive glance down at Reynard when she thought the cameras weren&#39;t focused on her. She wasn&#39;t going to sully a librarian&#39;s reputation by acting unprofessionally on camera, <em>especially</em> not after almost getting caught in public doing exactly that the other night!

So she kept her chin properly tucked and her back straighter than usual as she marched towards the center of the arena to meet with her opponents. 

They marched for an excruciatingly long time.

Either the arena was way too big for a party of four, or their opponents were taking their sweet time with the simple act of walking. Which just served to prove her fashion point even more: after all, Nikolai was the one decked from head to toe in heavy armor. If he could move faster, he probably would.

And if he could speak, he probably should. But as Aida stood in her opponents&#39; hulking shadows and stared up at their foreign faces, she could only hear a low growl emitting from the armor-clad man. 

It was the beast who spoke. Zahhak&#39;s voice rolled like thunder, his words dripping with malice, his entire body seized with dismay. If he opened his maw wide enough, he could easily rip Aida apart. As for Reynard? He probably wasn&#39;t even big enough to fill the gaps between his teeth. Such was the insignificance of Alexandria&#39;s newest representatives. They were like lambs led to the slaughter. Perhaps they should just forfeit and scamper back to their cozy library-
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051552125408260226 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051552125408260226><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Dec-22 03:32 AM">03:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;So, I was thinking...maybe we should call off this match.&#39;

Aida <em>shhhh&#39;d</em> Reynard, as if he just said something incredibly insensitive. She blinked at Zahhak, her gaze going from his head and all the way down to his tail, then back to his chest. She was sizing him up. <em>She</em> was sizing <em>him</em> up, and she looked rather troubled.

&#39;You&#39;re hurt!&#39; The librarian continued. Was that a hint of disappointment in her voice? &#39;The match hasn&#39;t even started and you&#39;re already hurt. How is this going to be a fair fight?&#39; 

It clearly was not. If she had been intimidated by her opponents&#39; towering height, she had more pressing concerns now. Half the lessons Barrett had wanted to drill into her head immediately went out the window. She wasn&#39;t going to fight a wounded animal!

&#39;Do you...maybe want to take some time to heal up?&#39; She suggested to the pair. &#39;The <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span> is only a few blocks away.

Up.</strong>”

A low, deep voice filled the space between them. Even with the oppressive roar and boos from the crowd, Nikolai sounded off loud and clear. An impressive feat, but not at all a surprise given… well, appearances. 

“<strong>If. Not. Hurt. Very. Not. Fair.</strong>”

The girl did not seem afraid. At least, Nikolai could not tell. Her words suggested there was anything but fear, even. Either she had dreamed up a scenario where wounded enemies were always weak to the point of being pushovers, or she had simply not <em>ever</em> been in a <em>true</em> fight.

There was a reason one never was eager to corner wounded animals, after all. And these ones had nothing to lose.

With Nikolai’s cryptic warning out of the way, he rolled his shoulders clockwise. His shield rose without effort, as if it weighed as little as a feather. There was little else to do, besides wait for the bell to ring and for the fight to truly begin. A muscle cramp was the last thing he needed. 

Seconds felt like minutes, which felt like hours. Any moment now, the bloodshed would be well under way. Nikolai’s heart pumped well over the normal rate, and he could feel every pulse. His body sat still, but tensed at every tendon. There was not a single other thought on his mind, despite the attempt to clear it:

<strong>KILL. TEAR. CRUSH MAIM KILL—</strong>

“<strong>LET’S GET THIS SHOW UNDER—</strong>”

<em><strong>DING DING—</strong></em>

As the very first pulse of the bell echoed throughout the colosseum, as the announcer began to start to fight, even before the crowd could react—

Nikolai <em>pounced</em>. As if a dog had finally been given the command, the man jumped foward with a quarter of the speed. A freight train that just began its commute, the black mass lurched.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051595347723558993 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051595347723558993><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Dec-22 06:24 AM">06:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

His shield, parallel with the ground, swung backward as he charged Aida. Muscles bulged and adrenaline shot through his nerves. Self control felt impossible, yet he held firm. If he could end the fight in a single blow, then further descent into recklessness was justified.

And that’s what he aimed to do. When he reached just about where he last remembered Aida to be, the black rectangle shot forward. Whether she was still there was up for debate. If she was though…

Well, best not dwell on that reality.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh yes, he was hurt. For thousands of years, he had been hurting, his bones broken and ground into a fine paste, his muscles decaying into nothingness. Oh, how it ached! It ached to live in such a squalid body! Woe, misery and woe! Woe betide him, him and his silent suffering!

But! BUT! No longer did he have to live in this agony! No longer was he bound within this shell of his true self! When he had come face-to-face with Jay Gatsby, he found it within itself to overcome that limit, to take a step into both yesterday and tomorrow. 

The past. The future. He knew the far end of both, had gazed upon beginning and ending. He heard the roar of the crowd, boos and hisses and anger and fear. Ignorant. They were all ignorant of just how finite their paradise was.

They would come to understand. They would learn the truth. He would make them know.

<strong>&quot;Once chance.&quot;</strong> Lancer growled, a hoarse rattle. His gaze had drifted down towards Saber. Was he talking to Reynard? <strong>&quot;You will have one chance to stop me. After that, <u>I will kill you.</u>&quot;</strong>

Then, stillness. Zahhak simply waited, staring at Reynard, as though expecting the fox to move. A trap set in an open clearing, without bait or concealment, without deceit or temptation. 

Surely, it couldn&#39;t be this easy, could it?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would have protested, had he not heard Aida&#39;s ideas of letting Zahhak get some urgent medical care to make the fight feel more <em>&#39;fair&#39;.</em>

&quot;Are you out of your-&quot; He growled, but refrained from continuing once he noticed a nervous twitch in Aida&#39;s feet. He instinctively scanned her after that, and almost like magic, he noticed quirks that weren&#39;t there before: Labored breath, darty eyes, passive body language unlike the assertive Aida he knew. He even sensed that her words were black, as if she were partially lying to herself. He had rarely seen his Master be in such a weak position.

<em>&quot;Are you scared?&quot;</em> He was tempted to ask, but didn&#39;t due to how near Nikolai and Zahhak were. He didn&#39;t even need to ask really, because it was obvious that the Lancer&#39;s presence was bullying Aida into submission.

The fox&#39;s blood boiled. With envy, even. Not only did he feel overshadowed as a villain, but how could he call himself a hero if his Master was being bullied right in his face?!

<em><strong>DING DING-</strong></em>

Nikolai whizzed by in a flash the moment the bell rung. Reynard saw that clearly, for the man was practically moving in slow motion for him. Unlike Nikolai, who couldn&#39;t tell if his attack would collide with Aida or not, Reynard could tell with pinpoint precision that yes, his attack would reach its target.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051945368096620664 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051945368096620664><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 05:35 AM">05:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>CLANG!</em>

Were it not for Reynard in the middle, who intercepted the blow with his hands. Despite his childish body, he was holding back the man&#39;s shield with one arm, keeping him stuck like an unbreakable wall.

&quot;You talk funny. Never read a book before? In this pothole that is Alexandria, of all places?&quot; Reynard joked, still keeping the man restrained. He smiled, but those who knew him well could tell that his jokes were just attempts at covering the anger within. He had barely known them, but the fact that Nikolai and Zahhak had already left a strong impression on Aida pissed him off. What was the point in being a fairy tale hero or villain if you were so easily upstaged?!

&quot;...You&#39;re giving me a chance?&quot; Reynard asked with a low, smug growl, looking back to Zahhak who had remained immobile and instead communicated his intent with his eyes.

&quot;Looks like I&#39;ve already created my own.&quot; He laughed, tilting Nikolai&#39;s shield slightly as he kept him in place. &quot;You can just stand there and let me get rid of your Master, if you want. Makes my job much easier.&quot; He immediately declared his intentions. Just like with Mikhail, Reynard had no qualms with taking the easy way out!

&quot;So, Master.&quot; He looked back to Nikolai. &quot;Last chance to use all those Command Seals of yours before I snap you like a twig.&quot; The fox sneered, baring his fangs. It sounded like a threat that he would follow on, were it not for one small problem.

Command Seals? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m out of my mind.&#39; Despite Reynard&#39;s best intentions to hold his tongue, Aida finished his thoughts on his behalf. &#39;I&#39;m doing things the vanilla way, thank you very much!&#39; She stamped her foot to steel her nerves, narrowly missing his fluffy tail.

So this is what it felt like, for the Master and Servant to become as one mind. Starting with being able to finish each other&#39;s sentences. Only that it sounded way more poetic in the storybooks but hey! Beggars can&#39;t be choosers, and Reynard was running out of ways to impress, now that his unique blend of villainy was paling quickly in front of two brutes who seemed to carry it better.

So size did matter, after all. Despite the Republic pair being on the opposing side, Aida treated them like esteemed guests, with none of that impudence she&#39;d often display towards Reynard. When Nikolai bore down on her with his broken speech, she even seemed to shrink a little instead of wagging a finger at him or flicking him on the forehead in her usual preppy manner. The lack of domestic abuse™️ was driving the fox mad! With envy!

...But it also meant that there was a side to his Master that only Reynard was privy to, and this knowledge seemed to light a fire in his heart. In a flurry of orange fur he was gone from Aida&#39;s side, only to reappear in Nikolai&#39;s path as he intercepted his shield with bare hands.

How valiant!

For the first time ever, Reynard had acted to protect, not retreat. For the first time ever, he didn&#39;t leave his Master to flounder, but saved her in a timely manner. Aida wished she had brought some wipes for her glasses, for the new light shining on the Saber had her completely awestruck-

<em>&#39;You can just stand there and let me get rid of your Master, if you want. Makes my job much easier.&#39;</em>

Her lips twitched into a half-smile that seemed to say, <em>I knew it, why did I think otherwise?</em> Taunting and blackmailing were some tried and true tactics that only the scums of the earth would use. But Reynard did it for her. He was fighting in his own way by using every trick in his bag, didn&#39;t Barrett say something along similar lines? 

&#39;Alright,&#39; she pumped herself up, shaking her hands loose as if she was the one who had done the dirty work. &#39;Turning a blind eye, starting now! Can&#39;t see it, can&#39;t hear about it, nope!&#39; She shook her head, then took her pen out of her pocket and started to weave it through the air. 

Ink unwound into dark threads, interlocking loop after loop into not words, but textile. Aida guided her pen like a spindle. She spun, warped, wove, cut, and sewed, extracting water from the lake and mixing in the soil from the arena when her ink was close to running out. The Commodan was unlike the bazaar. It was better than the bazaar, gifting her with a seemingly endless supply of pigments with which to paint her canvas. 

First came the bell-shaped head. Then the arms emerged, soft and plump tentacles that resembled oversized pool noodles. Aida splashed ink liberally over the emerging body of her familiar, puffing it up to a towering height.

No power, no victory. The mercenary&#39;s words were still fresh on her mind. She couldn&#39;t change the others, but that didn&#39;t mean she had to change for them. If trickery was  Reynard&#39;s power, then honesty would be hers. An honest-to-good beating from her loyal jellyfish, that seemed pretty fitting in her book!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1051969832389718017 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1051969832389718017><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 07:12 AM">07:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the superhuman strength behind the blow, it couldn’t compare to the likes of a Servant. Paganini had been the first reminder of that reality. Reynard made two. 

And try as he wanted, his arm would not budge. A small portion from the sheer shock of a gorilla swing into a rock, but mostly because Saber was damn <em>strong</em>. He pushed and groaned against the fox, yet made no progress. If anything, it seemed the fox wanted to toy with him. 

One, very small problem with his merciful offer though. Nikolai did not quite grasp it, but Reynards condition gave hid cause for concern. Thrown out of the intense, violent haze he had been in before, he slowly thought it out. His head swiveled around the arena. Aida conjured up a mighty creature. A sea animal, even. Yet…

No, no! Instead, he elected to protect his frail little maiden of a Master from Nikolai&#39;s attack. Thus, he revealed his plan - To defeat the Master, wholly circumventing the need to overcome the dragon in the first place.

A most clever plan. Except, EXCEPT! The lesser animal lacked the means to best his better! This hound that sought humanity, even with the backing of his Master, stood no chance against a human fallen to beasthood! 

Especially not after his <strong>ascension</strong>.

<strong>&quot;Very well. SO BE IT!&quot;</strong> Lancer screamed, a throat-shredding cry that echoed across the arena, and even far beyond it. <strong>&quot;Beg, grovel, fall to your knees, I SHALL ACCEPT NONE OF IT! It is time! TIME TO MEET WITH [GOD]!&quot;</strong>

<em>CRACK.</em> Like an egg hatching, cracks appeared all across the outer body of Zahhak. Detritus fell apart, pieces of flesh and bone crumbling to the ground as though he were a dying world. A great flood of black emerged from his body, more than could possibly be possessed by one of such a body.

But, it was not death. No, this was birth. This was TRUTH, WISDOM, MIGHT! This was PERFECTION! AN INCARNATION OF WHAT WAS DESERVED!

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-diff">-The time hath come to bring about the blessed end.</code>

Out from the chrysalis of destruction emerged a newborn demise. The wheel turned. The cycle carried on. The beginning would end, and the ending would begin. This was the final point of everything. The Dead End.

For this was the day a God emerged from its cocoon.

Like the bloom of the last flower. The last time you say goodbye to your beloved. The final sunset.

In this newer, greater form, <strong>[AZHI DAHAKA]</strong> cast a disdainful eye towards the rest of the battle. Towards Reynard, towards Aida, even towards Nikolai. Before him, they were all worthless. This contest would not take long.

Thus, outstretching a claw, he swung towards them. Except, there was no hesitation, no warning, no effort to control this apocalyptic might. Was he trying to take all three of them out at once? Even his own partner?!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Where had he experienced the ‘birth’ of his Servant? Nikolai pondered it for only a moment before he decided that it mattered little. Point was, he merely watched with passive interest as Zahhak turned into a truly ultimate form. One that made himself seem like a mere action figure, a toy to be played with.

Which Lancer had no intention of doing. Far from it. A massive clawed hand stretched back, then barreled forward like he had a minute prior. With the exact same reckless abandon. Damn it all to hell, casualties were an afterthought!

Nikolai took zero chances. He let go of his shield and rolled out of the way with nanoseconds to spare. The whizz of that giant claw went above his head as the first deadly attack of many to come. 

Zahhak had told the truth in the locker room.

And where did that leave him? It’s not like he needed the shield. Pretenses could be done with, if only for now. So, instead, he pulled himself back onto his feet and examined the battlefield.

The enemy Master. Her name did not matter. Her skills mattered a hair more. She had spent the deadlock on the creation of that Jellyfish, which still tried to hang around its owner. Those things couldn’t do much. Not that he remembered. They could…

Bah, pointless. Nikolai had to trust his Servant to draw the full attention of the fox. He charged forth, right towards Aida. His arms outstretched prepared to tackle her to the ground.

“<strong>Animal. Worthless,</strong>” he bellowed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Seels? No, I&#39;m not a zoo,&quot; His ears flapped. &quot;Command Seals! Do you have them or not?&quot; He stared at Nikolai&#39;s hands for a long time, but could never find that tinge of redness that belonged to an awakened Master&#39;s seal. What could it mean?

<em>CRACK</em>

Before he could continue his snooping, he heard loud rumbling from the arena, as if a symphony of eggshells were cracking in unison. What followed next was the Sun itself being obscured by Zahhak&#39;s towering height, now almost as large as the arena itself.

Forget going to the hospital, this beast was shedding?! Was the initial weakness merely an act?

He couldn&#39;t lie: Reynard felt like running with his tail between his legs. His arms were shivering and he knew for a fact that he was no match for whatever mythical beast Zahhak was. He had fought kings and wolves, not monsters!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052145835632238665 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052145835632238665><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 06:51 PM">18:51</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
It would have been so easy too with his speed, to simply drop everything and leave. But then he heard Aida pump herself up, and summon the dreadful jellyfish to boot.

How pathetic would he have looked if he had left now, leaving his Master to die to save his own skin? Besides, even if Master lived, she would have never forgiven him. He could already imagine the amount of punishments he would be forced to endure back home, especially since she still had two Command Spells...

...On the other hand, imagine the joy she would feel if they surmounted these impossible odds. Reynard would finally be what he wanted others to see him as: A hero, hailed by many, and especially Aida. Maybe she would offer up her lap to him when they got back home-

Reynard&#39;s daydreaming would be interrupted by Nikolai, who abandoned his shield and immediately ran away. The fox pondered why, until he saw the gigantic claw looming over him.

<em><strong>&quot;GYAAAAAH!&quot;</strong></em> Reynard screamed so loud that even Zahhak could hear him. The fox ran, but he had nowhere to run with how large the claw was. He was surrounded by its shadow, about to fall <em>splat</em> on him at any second. In a moment of impulse, the Saber raised Nikolai&#39;s shield, letting the claw hit it and catapult him away.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052145900224520222 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052145900224520222><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 06:52 PM">18:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Gah!&quot; Reynard felt his chest contract in pain as he rolled quite the distance on the arena floor. The shield was gone, and it had no chance of blocking a monster&#39;s attack in the first place, but it cushioned Reynard from worst injuries at least. Plus, it provided him with something invaluable: It gave him time to think.

<em>&quot;What to do? Fall back? No, we&#39;re locked inside the arena. Plus, falling back means doing nothing, and doing nothing means-&quot;</em>

It meant another one of Zahhak&#39;s swipes and Reynard didn&#39;t know if he could take one. If he couldn&#39;t, then what about Aida?

Gruesome images ran through his mind as he frowned and shook his head. &quot;Nope! Not having that sort of downer ending.&quot; He declared, as if he had the power to affect things. Even if he didn&#39;t, he would be unable to forgive himself if he didn&#39;t at least try!

He was done letting his actions be written for him.

 &quot;Hey, nice glow up, Azhidizi-something!&quot; The fox snickered out loud, trying to catch the beast&#39;s attention. Reynard then flapped his cloak, a gigantic crayon emerging from its narrow opening and hovering next to his arm.

<em>&quot;Well, if you really insist on dragging me to this stupid tournament of yours, then I might as well show you what I can do. Pass me one of those books...&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052145948484173895 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052145948484173895><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 06:52 PM">18:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He remembered educating Aida on his power, so hopefully she could take advantage of it once she saw him in action. He couldn&#39;t see where Nikolai went, so he hoped that the man was dead. The pessimist in him, however, knew that his opponent was most likely after Aida now. 

He couldn&#39;t worry about that now. If Reynard didn&#39;t take care of Zahhak, then his Master was dead anyway.

&quot;-But I notice that you seem to have neglected your nails. Care for a manicure?&quot; 

Without warning, the fox ran at Zahhak, full sprint. He was on all fours while the crayon rested on his back. Even the giant was somewhat amused, since the Servant looked microscopic to him, but was moving with such speed that he could not help but compare him to a cockroach.

In the span of seconds, Reynard had reached Zahhak&#39;s elongated claw which was still resting on the arena ground. Thoughts ran through the fox&#39;s head: What beats a giant dragon with ease? He couldn&#39;t think of many, so he just went with instinct. He jumped on Zahhak&#39;s pinky and immediately slammed the tip of the crayon on it. A pathetic display.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052146046937079938 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052146046937079938><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Dec-22 06:52 PM">18:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

<em>CRUSH!</em>

At least, until Zahhak felt his pinky contort and stretch in pain. It was horrible! Enough for him to cry out loud! It was only a pinky, but just like stubbing a toe, it filled Zahhak with hate and irritation. But how could a little fox tear his finger with ease?

<em><strong>&quot;Fee-fi-fo-fum!&quot;</strong></em>

A loud, thunderous voice could be heard as Zahhak felt something heavy walk on his claw. He looked down and saw it: A giant, brutish and thick-headed, that was probably about one-third of his height.

<em><strong>&quot;I smell the blood of a dragon!
Be he alive, or be he dead,
I&#39;ll grind his bones to make my bread.&quot;</strong></em>

The giant declared with a malefic growl before charging towards Zahhak and slinging a bone club at the dragon&#39;s groin. 

Pages fell out of Reynard&#39;s crayon, consumed by the usage of his Noble Phantasm. He stood aside, watching his masterwork unfold as the giant fearlessly (or one could say foolishly) challenged the giant dragon. 

A lone page scattered across the arena. It was the book&#39;s title.

<em>Jack &amp; The Beanstalk.</em>

Reynard then scurried around, circling Zahhak in an effort to find a weak spot he could take advantage of. He knew the giant stood no chance, because as a fellow villain, he was destined to lose! <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He doesn&#39;t have them! They are <em>Republic</em>. Their S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames run on a different energy source!&#39; Aida chided Reynard. If Reynard had wanted to deliberately confuse Nikolai, then his intent was completely lost on Aida, for his innocent question had only caused unwanted memories to resurface in her head. Oh, how many of these silly questions she and her colleagues had to endure every single day in front of clueless customers, as if they operated a service center instead of a simple repair shop!

Fortunately, their emotional damage would soon cease. Aida wasn&#39;t the only one who had taken advantage of Reynard and Nikolai&#39;s arm-wrestling match; while she toiled away on her canvas, so did the Republic Servant. Miasma filled the arena as Zahhak&#39;s body was broken and reborn, shedding its deteriorating flesh like a giant reptile shedding its skin until they revealed the pristine form underneath.

A great beast had risen. The arena felt congested with Zahhak&#39;s immense presence, while the others and their summoned creatures filled the gaps. Aida placed a hand on her familiar and felt its appendages quiver. Was it fear that it had felt or was there something else? 

...But she wasn&#39;t given any time to think. A rush of wind whipped up dirt and debris as Zahhak swept at the arena with its gigantic claw like a rake tilling a field, uncaring of who or what got caught in its path. Nikolai had also shaken loose of the Saber and charged towards her. It was at times like this that a Master and Servant&#39;s synergy was stretched to the limit, and Nikolai had certainly proved his worth as Zahhak&#39;s Master as he evaded the claw without any excess movement, almost as if they&#39;d practiced this stunt many times before.

This wasn&#39;t anything like reading words on a page, where she was allowed to digest them at her own pace and effectively bending the time in those fictitious worlds as she pleased. No, she had barely any time to come up with any countermeasures to the Republic pair&#39;s attacks, let alone command her body to move. She would need much more than a single day of boot camp at the beach in order to become a soldier!

But there was also no need. A magus very seldom prided themselves in physical prowess, because what they lacked in physique, they made up for with magecraft. 

<em><strong>THWACK</strong></em>

A slippery tendril dripping with ink whipped across Nikolai&#39;s shoulder as he emerged from under Zahhak&#39;s claw, leaving a dark streak across his armor before wrapping itself around  his torso. A second tendril shot forward as well, then a third, followed by a fourth, as many as the jellyfish could afford while it could remain standing with the rest of its appendages. The familiar had reacted in Aida&#39;s stead, lifting her to sit atop its crown in order to keep her out of harm&#39;s way-

<em><strong>THWACK</strong></em>

-only that it had failed spectacularly, as its oversized, plump body had zero chances of evading Zahhak&#39;s claw. The claw smashed into its appendages, swiping it off the ground while carrying both Aida and Nikolai with it!

Instinctively, the creature wrapped its remaining tendrils around Zahhak&#39;s claw, sticking to the dragon like a piece of gum in an attempt to prevent him from shaking it off and sending its passengers (or, <em>passenger</em> in this case, as it couldn&#39;t care less if the Republic Master fell off, hurrah!) to an early death. Its inky flesh quivered in the wind. If it had a mouth, it would probably be swearing profanities right about now-

Instead, its master screamed for the both of them. &#39;Let go! <strong>Let go of him right now!</strong>&#39; Aida shrieked with reckless abandon. She hadn&#39;t signed up for this ride!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052373665892802671 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052373665892802671><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Dec-22 09:57 AM">09:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rearing back, <strong>[AZHI DAHAKA]</strong> allowed magical energy to coalesce within their maw, before spitting it forth. In an instant, a flood of molten flame poured out, begin to fill the arena.

When he stopped moving forward, his guess was certainly not on that weird animal from earlier. Once he went along with Zahhak’s swipe, though, he then noticed the creature and its tendrils wrapped around him.

But before he could even process this new reality, there was the trouble of <em>getting down</em>. Sure, it would be easy to tear his way out of this bind and back to the ground but… Azhi something-or-other had begun a true armageddon. 

A new game had spawned during the brief moments of confusion: the lava floor game. Not quite exact, but there was little better way to describe the wretched flames that poured from his Servants maw. To drop down right below would spell an early end for either of them.

Yes, Aida had managed to come along for the ride. She very much seemed to have been an accidental passenger, the way she screamed and squirmed. Each complaint and shriek hammered his eardrums, and he couldn’t tune them out in such a precarious position. What did she expect would happen anyhow?

At the very least, he had one free arm to work with. With it, he began to pull at the tendrils. They were elastic as hell. He could move them an inch, but little more. Sheer quantity worked against him in a way he couldn’t brute force out of. 

So, he swung his arm around with reckless abandon. Within a few shakes, his glove loosened, then flew off together. Dark claws now exposed, tore into the tentacles. Like strings on a violin, they snapped off with a satisfying twinge. Before long, he had his other hand free and grabbed onto the claw that he dangled from. 

What now?

He could not see the Servant, but he did see the Master. So helpless. So exposed. 

So frail.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052634396064231444 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052634396064231444><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 03:13 AM">03:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
“<strong>Silly. Girl! Over. Head!</strong>”

With the jellyfish and his own position, he slowly crawled his way toward Aida. Nikolai grabbed hold of one of the tentacles and pulled the jellyfish she relied on ever closer. Soon enough, she would be within his grasp. It would be all too easy to coerce the fox to surrender, or even herself.

<em>CRUSH!</em>

Much like Reynard had expected, Jack&#39;s giant was about as fearsome as a beanstalk when compared to Zahhak. He couldn&#39;t even see the giant&#39;s flesh, just traces of bones and fine paste.

&quot;Some giant you were.&quot; The fox gulped, irritated at how ineffective his attack was. All it had done was break a finger and piss the dragon off even more. The only solace he had was that he had bought enough seconds for him to run away and circle around Zahhak with his superior speed. The dragon was huge, but being large also came with its downsides.

After all, could a human ever feel an ant crawling up their arm? Normally, yes, but more often than not, their multiple senses would be overwhelmed by other things that would cause them to ignore the delicate touch of an ant&#39;s legs. Likewise, Zahhak was so furious at his opponents&#39; insolence that his own anger had dulled his senses and blinded him to Reynard, who was currently hugging his leg and slowly making his climb up.

&quot;Okay, hitting the body won&#39;t work at all.&quot; The Saber started making plans in his head, navigating the dragon&#39;s scaly body with much difficulty. &quot;The scales are too tough and the hide is too dense. Maybe the head?&quot; He pondered, thinking of any possible weak point on the dragon&#39;s body. He then heard Zahhak scream, followed by his arms and legs feeling hot. No, his fur was boiling!

&quot;Gah!&quot; He screamed, being forced to jump off as the dragon&#39;s body heated up for the attack to come. A pile of flames started to fill the arena, specifically around Zahhak. He was trying to flush Reynard out and was unfortunately being rather successful in that regard. Even if he couldn&#39;t feel the fox&#39;s touch, he could certainly hear his screams.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052714802541244467 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052714802541244467><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 08:32 AM">08:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Great, just great!&quot; Reynard snarled, landing on his tail as he felt that even the ground was melting from the sheer heat. However, he didn&#39;t lose his cool, quickly placing himself on all fours and running away. After all, while Zahhak&#39;s attack had prevented Reynard from attacking, it had also failed to fully hit him, meaning that-

&quot;-I&#39;m more than fast enough to get out of here before the flames reach me!&quot; The fox smiled, before tilting his head back and turning to face Zahhak. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, my draconic friend? Are you trying to sweat me to death?&quot; He taunted and momentarily paused, raising his arm and delivering a strong slap to his buttocks.

&quot;Eat my shorts, you big meanie!&quot; He shook his butt and tail, delivering his line with childish candor: The perfect tone to piss Zahhak off. With that said, he quickly sped off like a roadrunner before he could face any act of retribution. 

One might think that Reynard had a death wish, but for each rash action he took, he had planned three more in advance.

<em>&quot;If he keeps focusing on me, then he focuses less on Aida. The less she&#39;s harmed, the better it is for me. I just have to keep running and-&quot;</em> The fox&#39;s sprint was interrupted as he witnessed a tentacled mass in the distance, dangling on one of Zahhak&#39;s claws. It was none other than Kurage, which had took the full brunt of the beast&#39;s attack. Even worse, however, was the fact that Aida was on top of the jellyfish, held by its tentacles. And so was Nikolai.

It seemed like the two were struggling to remain afloat, with Kurage trying its best to remain attached to a raging Zahhak&#39;s claws. They were dangling above the flaming hell pit that the dragon had created, the flames so scorching hot that one could easily get heatstroke from them. It was upon making that realization that Reynard noticed Nikolai getting dangerously close to Aida, braving through the tentacles and extending his arm to pull her closer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052714833629425744 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052714833629425744><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 08:32 AM">08:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;Can&#39;t go a day without you causing some trouble for me, goddamnit!&quot;</strong> Reynard shouted, throwing a tantrum as he stomped the floor and ran back the way he came from. Great, now not only was he getting closer to Zahhak (whom he had pissed off), but he could already feel the scorching heat of the flames make him sweat like a pig. In order to rescue Aida, he would have to brave the flames and jump an enormous distance to reach Zahhak&#39;s claws.

&quot;Such a waste...&quot; The fox grumbled, wiping sweat off his brow as he took out two more tomes from his cloak and fired up his crayon. He headed directly towards the flames, as foolish as it sounded. There was no other way for him to get to Aida without propelling himself from that precise location.

&quot;You need to <strong>chill out!&quot;</strong> Reynard shouted something corny out loud, perhaps to get Zahhak&#39;s attention or perhaps to simply irritate him. Either way, even the dragon would be amused to see the crayon&#39;s tip collide with the scorching floor, gigantic snowflakes emerging from it that melted as soon as they arrived. The icy winds of the Snow Queen were no match for a dragon&#39;s flames, but they were good enough to make it bearable for Reynard to pass through for a few seconds.

In the heart of the flames, he immediately struck the ground again, followed by the crayon huffing and puffing several times and propelling him upward like a rocket. Who knew that a wolf hungry for pigs could have such enormous lungs?

Now in mid-flight, Reynard was aimed to crash right into Kurage and its passengers. Of course, he needed to stick his landing, for if he collided with Aida, then he&#39;d push her off and fall with her into the flames. If he collided with Nikolai, then the same would happen, except that he would take down the enemy Master with him. If he hit Kurage, then all of them would perish most likely.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052714864260436028 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052714864260436028><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 08:33 AM">08:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Clearly, option B was the best. But Reynard, like the selfish fox that he was, sought after the fourth option. He closed his eyes and dreamed, running through his memories of various books and tales on what heroes would do. His answer was far more recent, as he remembered the elegant movements of a girl wielding bamboo.

By complete instinct, he twirled himself into a cartwheel, spinning around like a ball of fluffy fury as his tail collided with Nikolai like a supersonic whip, blinding him and stunning him as the man lost their balance and finally fell off the tentacles. The mercenary felt like they were in a furnace as their armored body was now freefalling towards a pit of fire. Was this their fate for being paired up with Zahhak?

Meanwhile Reynard, by using Nikolai&#39;s body as a springboard, had cushioned his impact and bounced off. This clever maneuver prevented him from falling down as well, albeit he now had the immediate issue of finding another landing spot that didn&#39;t involve burning to death. Thankfully, he already had one in mind: Aida.

<em>POMF!</em>

Kurage held a tighter hold over Aida as it felt the librarian&#39;s weight increase, much to its displeasure. Aida herself would be shocked to now find Reynard&#39;s arms and legs wrapped around her, hugging her tight as he stared at the flaming pit with a rather concerned face. 

&quot;Okay, you need to find a way to get us out of here <em>now</em> unless you want to end up as dragon kibble.&quot; He hurriedly screamed in her face as he shook her by the arms. &quot;Or at least, find a way to get yourself out of here! I&#39;ll find my own way out of this mess.&quot; He ordered, grumbling as he hoped that Nikolai had perished in the flames. If he hadn&#39;t, then Zahhak was soon to strike.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1052714933059588207 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1052714933059588207><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Dec-22 08:33 AM">08:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;So much for fairy tales. I don&#39;t think they can even scratch this monster, let alone defeat him. I told you I wouldn&#39;t be much use here!&quot; His eyes darted back to Aida, venting out his inner frustrations on her. <strong>&quot;How did you even get stuck here?!</strong> It was all going fine before this. Not great, but <em>fine!</em> Now we are literally in the palm of his hand-&quot;

He felt like continuing his rant a bit longer, but there was no time. Did he really want to spend his potential last minutes being angry? The fox was foolish, perhaps even dumb, but even he knew the value of a life well spent.

&quot;-Never mind. I&#39;m <em>sorry.</em> I know you were just trying to help.&quot; He sighed, nuzzling up to Aida instead and catching her off guard. &quot;But this is as far as I can go. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be your knight in shining armor. Just let them kill me and forfeit the fight. At least you will be able to stay with Cathy and the others.&quot; He dropped a double whammy on her without even asking for her consent.

The dragon continued his mad rampage, wildly swinging his claws, trying to dislodge the jellyfish and send both Aida and Reynard falling into the liquid fire below. For now, the grip of the gooey creature held, but with every gargantuan swipe at the air, that grip grew looser and looser.

It was sheer malice. Absolute rage. Did they not even care that their own partner was now falling towards that same burning death?

<em>THWAP!</em> Whether they did or not, Nikolai would be saved from their grisly fate, as amidst the flailing, the tail of <strong>[AZHI DAHAKA]</strong> slapped against him, the force of the blow enough to send him flying up, landing on the dragon&#39;s shoulder. Was it an intentional move to protect his ally? Or was it just sheer dumb luck?

Hard to say, but either way, the result remained.

And that result was not looking good for Alexandria.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But all that screaming didn&#39;t bring her anywhere near the ground. Kurage the Jellyfish was a tenacious being. Perhaps she&#39;d lifted a bit <em>too</em> much from its origin, as the presence of a new Dragon King seemed to have awaken something in itself. A memory, perhaps, of how it had been beaten, every bone its body broken, all because it had failed to serve its king. Under the influence of the Crayon of Malpertuis, Kurage had once broken free from its shackles and rebelled against its fate. But without Reynard, instinct was the only thing it had left. 

Using every ounce of its strength, the jellyfish clung to Zahhak&#39;s claw so tightly that its liquid flesh rippled, like a loyal servant begging for another chance to make things right. Its behavior brought both good news and bad news for its master: the good being that they were safe from the lava that was now overtaking the arena grounds, while the bad being that their movement had been completely restricted and their fate tied to Zahhak&#39;s pinky. Quite a dilemma they had gotten themselves into!

<em>RIIIIIIIIIP-</em>

Just when things couldn&#39;t get any worse! 

Aida watched with a mixture of anger and helplessness as Nikolai tore down the appendages binding his body. Slowly but surely he freed himself, leaving several of the jellyfish&#39;s limbs horribly mangled and barely hanging on. Bits and pieces of fibrous ink sizzled and dissolved as they fell into the lava bed and turned into dark clouds of vapor. The jellyfish curled its severed limbs. It tried to draw more water from the lake to replenish itself, but the heat from the lava evaporated most of the moisture before it could merge with its body. 

If Nikolai continued to do as he pleased, things wouldn&#39;t bold well for any of them. Wasn&#39;t he concerned about his own safety?

<em>&#39;Silly. Girl! Over. Head!&#39;</em>

What was it with mercenaries these days?!

&#39;<em>You</em> are in over your head!&#39; The urge to retort, honed by Cathy&#39;s brutal honesty and Reynard&#39;s barbed tongue and amplified by the fear of falling from great heights, bubbled up in an instant. &#39;I have every right to be here! More rights than you, in fact! <em>You</em> are riding on <em>my</em> familiar!&#39;

How dare he take Kurage for granted! Were it not for her, he would be swimming in lava right now!

Aida pounded on the jellyfish. &#39;Let him go!&#39; She shouted. &#39;You&#39;re not doing any of us any favors!&#39;

<em>POMF!</em>

For the second time of the day, she felt her mind go numb. An orange furball whizzed out of nowhere and slammed into Nikolai like a boomerang, knocking the brute away just as Aida had wished...did Christmas come early? That was twice in a row Reynard had saved her bacon like some p-

<em>&#39;How did you even get stuck here?!&#39;</em>

This time, she didn&#39;t even have any time to look at him through the heavily filtered lens of a fairytale prince, as Reynard immediately broke the character that barely existed in the first place and started picking bones with her every action. 

Yet she wasn&#39;t even given a chance to retort. Just like he&#39;d done on the boat, Reynard suddenly caught himself and did a full 180, cozying up to his Master with a string of apologies before dropping another bomb on her. Suicide? Him? Reynard the conniving fox, the slimeball who would do anything to stay alive, was offering himself up for a bargain?

Aida stared at him, her mouth agape. &#39;Who <em>are</em> you?&#39; She asked. &#39;What did you do to Reynard?&#39;

He had just prevented Nikolai from laying a finger on her and now he wanted to call it quits? Was it the Servant, then? But she had read his book. Reynard didn&#39;t have any weaknesses in the shape of a dragon. Besides...

Not in his own Servant, but the enemy. Reynard sent Nikolai to the fiery floor, and he could do nothing but watch the ground get closer. He could barely register the last few seconds, that this didn’t even feel <em>real</em>. The only way he could tell that he was indeed awake was the sharp increase in temperature for every foot he dropped.

Until Azhi hit him. A sudden change in momentum, and Nikolai felt his stomach churn. This was not normal. Regardless of the person, to be thrown around like a sack of potatoes felt and looked silly. 

At least he wouldn’t die from his own Servant&#39;s recklessness. As luck would have it, his flight took him to the tippy top of his Servant. Nikolai landed face-first onto the shoulder of Lancer, and he grabbed on with all his might. 

He lifted his head. High above the ground, with the other two… he couldn’t quite see them. Those two dots in the distance, likely. How the <em>hell</em> did he get down there?

…Could he even do so? Molten magma bubbled all over the ground. It’d take time to climb down the massive beast. Time for the Master to get free shots, or the Servant to swoop in and go for the kill. At least here, he could buy a few precious seconds as he was splattered into the scales of his Servant in an act of sacrifice. 

But…

Nikolai’s fists clenched.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053098368391454791 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053098368391454791><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Dec-22 09:56 AM">09:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He started to slip. Right as he got to the edge, he dug his hands into loose scales. The living rock wall did whatever it desired as the assault continued, with its owner on the move. Across the back of the large dragon, he shimmied and slid his way to the other shoulder. With Azhi&#39;s constant motion and exclamations of hatred, each and every step of the way felt like it could send him to the ground below at a moments notice.

Only when he got directly below the other shoulder did Nikolai begin to move upward. Azhi continued his rampage as he tried to climb, and nearly shook him off with a particularly nasty roar. 

Almost there. Just a few more feet. Keep going...

Fingers latched onto a surface that wasn&#39;t perpendicular to the ground. Finally! The mercenary pulled himself up and onto a relatively flat surface. Not right on top, but close enough.

To stable footing <em>and</em> the enemy. Nikolai was sweaty, sore, and weaponless. But very much alive.

And <strong>pissed</strong>.

He wasted no time. Once more, he increased his pace. Right towards the two enemies. Azhi was surely prepared to launch yet another attack, which would leave Aida either dead or Reynard preoccupied once more. This time, though, there was no silly animal to stop him dead in his tracks.

To the enemies, the black blob closed the distance with a steady pace.

He was fuming about Aida just seconds ago, frustrated at how everything she did kept getting her into trouble. But he took one, long, deep look at her and realized that she was simply trying to do everything in her power to help. Could he really blame her? The least he could do was offer some kindne-

&quot;...What do you mean what happened to Reynard? I&#39;m literally <em>here!&quot;</em> The fox shouted as Aida stared through his soul with her inquisitive eyes. Her gaze was so powerful that he instinctively lowered his head in submission, before snapping out of it once he remembered that they were in the middle of a life-or-death battle.

&quot;What, you think I&#39;m stupid for giving up now? Well, what other options do you have, brainiac? I&#39;m the only one pulling my weight around here!&quot; He snarled and shook around, which probably wasn&#39;t a great idea with how Kurage&#39;s integrity was dangling by a thread. Those risky actions simply showed how furious he was.

&quot;You&#39;re still thinking about the golden city?&quot; Reynard gawked at her in disbelief. &quot;You think I <em>won</em> that? No! We had to run away with our tail between our legs! It was only thanks to this stupid jellyfish that we even survived.&quot; He poked Kurage, who reminisced of its fight against Manco&#39;s meteor shower.

&quot;He had the perfect story for the perfect situation. It was like his tale was expertly made to counter that scenario.&quot; The fox explained. &quot;But this? This giant dragon?! What sort of fairy tales have heroes capable of defeating giant dragons with ease? Maybe some lesser drake, or some dragon so small and timid that it barely counts as one. But this guy?&quot; He glanced at Zahhak, who was currently screaming at the skies.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053127615319384075 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053127615319384075><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Dec-22 11:53 AM">11:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;He&#39;s no dragon, he&#39;s a <em>monster!</em> Just look at all that strength and size. How am I supposed to compete with that? How are <em>we</em> supposed to compete with that?&quot; He would have kept droning on, had Zahhak not started flailing around randomly, causing the already loose Kurage to shake as it started sliding off the dragon&#39;s claw.

&quot;No!&quot; Reynard immediately shouted, his survival instincts kicking in. His ears picked up, as he instantly shoved Aida down and grabbed her like a fireman, her body dangling from his shoulder as he jumped off towards one of the dragon&#39;s shoulders.

<em>twip</em>

Then Reynard felt something drag him down. He turned around and saw Kurage&#39;s tentacle wrapped around his ankle, attempting to use him to lift itself up. That idiotic familiar. It risked dragging its Master down with it!

&quot;You ungrateful piece of...poop!&quot; Reynard yelled, with much thought put into his eloquent insult. He could kick the tentacle away, but that required too much effort, so he simply grit his teeth and bounced off Zahhak&#39;s skin to propel himself even higher, carrying Aida while simultaneously dragging Kurage to him. They landed on the dragon&#39;s left shoulder, with the fox panting at the weight of his cursed Master and familiar.

&quot;Huff...huff...&quot; He heaved, resting on his knees as the heat and the fatigue was getting to him. He was never one for battle, not even short fights. He glared back to Aida with equal parts frustration and annoyance.

&quot;I hate it though. That the moment I try to do some good for once, you ignore me and start thinking I&#39;m being whiny.&quot; He puffed out hot air. &quot;Didn&#39;t you think I&#39;d have a good reason to offer myself up as tribute?! I don&#39;t see any way out of this for either of us, so I&#39;d at least like to <strong>save you!&quot;</strong> He screamed out, before covering his mouth in embarrassment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053127752447971358 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053127752447971358><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Dec-22 11:53 AM">11:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;-Because you being alive will be proof that I&#39;ll have saved someone, of course. Bet that pea sized brain of yours never thought of that.&quot; He said sternly, with a smug expression that screamed backpedaling. &quot;So, unless you got any story recommendations for something that can slay a giant dragon, I&#39;m at a complete loss on what to do. Besides save my Master&#39;s skin, of course.&quot;

He was being childish and very immature, but that desire to protect seemed to be sincere. What came next even confirmed it, as Reynard&#39;s annoyed expression turned into one of worry as he noticed a shady figure at the end of Zahhak&#39;s other shoulder. It was approaching them, snarling like a beast as its speed gradually increased. One could barely tell that it was Nikolai.

&quot;Aida, stay put with Kurage. I&#39;ll deal with him while you can find a way down. Maybe if I kill the Master, then-&quot; Reynard stepped forward, walking past her as he expected to cover her once again. When Aida saw Reynard&#39;s behind, she didn&#39;t just see his perked up ears or his fluffy tail, but his cape fluttering in the blazing hot wind and burning with a passion that she had only felt while reading the most picaresque of novels. Her lips were gradually reaching for the &#39;p&#39; word.

But was Reynard truly that? Or was he lying to himself just to appear cool? Maybe he was so focused on Aida&#39;s safety that he had neglected to consider just how much value <em>he</em> had. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>&quot;PERISH!&quot;</strong>

The dragon&#39;s scream filled the coliseum, and was shortly followed by the familiar gurgle of magical energy swirling within the throat. With a heave, another gout of flame was summoned within the towering dragon&#39;s maw, and with a retch, it was shot forth, a burning lance large enough to consume both Reynard and Aida with ease.

Of course, as the direct witness to many of his feats, there was no reason for her to doubt Reynard&#39;s abilities. Of that, the Saber had been truthful. But the truth became a rather difficult thing to swallow sometimes.  

<em>&#39;Let me get this straight,&#39;</em> she had said once while the both of them had been waiting in line to pay for their books. <em>&#39;You, a Heroic Spirit born from stories, need to consume other stories to power up your crayon.&#39;</em> She&#39;d put a hand to her cheek, looking both bemused and amused at her furry companion. <em>&#39;That almost makes you sound like a reader, rather than a book waiting to be read.&#39;</em>

The concept had been ridiculous then, and it was still ridiculous now. Who was Reynard but a creation under the tip of an author&#39;s pen? Who gave him the authority to make other fairytales his own? 

A few more pages fell out of the Saber&#39;s cloak as he hauled Aida and the jellyfish up Zahhak&#39;s arm. All of them had been ripped out of the numerous books he had perused in preparation for this fight, which he had stuffed down his pockets and shirt until he couldn&#39;t carry them anymore. For a fox who had always relied on his cunning intuition, the sight had been quite bizarre to see. Who&#39;d have thought Reynard had it in him to study the night before an exam? 

But such was the extent of his power. Imagination of the mind is boundless and malleable, but once those ideas have been put down in words, they become rigid and inflexible. No matter how extensively Reynard had done his research...

I can think of several, but from the look of your face, I take it that you didn&#39;t bring any of them.&#39; She lowered her eyes to a page clutched in his hand, and said with resignation, &#39;Well, I can&#39;t blame you. Stories aren&#39;t supposed to be &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; anyway. It&#39;s only natural that you can&#39;t prepare yourself for every scenario. You&#39;ll need to bring the entire Library of Alexandria with you then!&#39; She laughed in a feeble attempt at livening the mood.

Not that there was much she could do but laugh! Who&#39;d have thought that the small miracle Reynard had pulled with her familiar had been nothing more than a coincidence? Who&#39;d have thought that Reynard of all Servants would be the one who needed the most meticulous preparations in order to use his weapon to its fullest potential?

But wait!

A lightbulb flashed in her mind, almost blinding Reynard before he realized it was only a reflection of the light from Aida&#39;s glasses. He then felt a stinging pain in his rear, only that this time, it wasn&#39;t a trick of the light or his imagination, but real, tangible pain. Aida had seized the back of his cloak as he was about to embark on a voyage of self-sacrificial acts, and his tail was caught in the cloak&#39;s fabric.

&#39;<em>I</em> remember the stories!&#39; The librarian exclaimed with a sudden burst of excitement, unaware of how roughly she&#39;d been pulling on Reynard&#39;s tail. &#39;Forget saving my skin, how about you consult me first before going off like that? I&#39;ve read tons of stories and they&#39;re all in my head. St. George and the Dragon. Sigurd and Fafnir. Bellerophon and the Chimera-oh, that&#39;s not a dragon, is it? Do giant serpents count, then?&#39; She suggested hopefully.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could handle the enemy Master, but had to admit that he was surprised at Nikolai&#39;s change in movement. The closest thing he could compare it to was when a deer would switch from fleeing to fighting, a rare occurrence where the prey aimed to strike back. That being said, Nikolai was still prey. The real problem was Zahhak, who had finally caught wind of what had happened in the last few minutes. The dragon tilted his head ever so slightly, mouth ablaze as he charged up another attack.

&quot;Shit-&quot; Reynard cursed, ready to turn back and hightail it away with Aida, only to find the latter dragging him by his cloak and getting his tail tangled in the process.

&quot;GAH!&quot; He yelped, feeling his most delicate part be violated. The act forced him to turn around and face Aida, who was still all smiles and roses in the face of a certain demise. It ticked him off to no end, even though he&#39;d rather she never stop smiling-

-He shook his head and erased that invasive thought, achieving inner Zen as he then turned that into contempt and glared back at his Master.

&quot;Well excuse me, <em>princess.</em> I didn&#39;t expect a <em>dragon</em> of all things to be our opponent!&quot; He snarled, grinding his teeth through the pain. &quot;And I&#39;m glad you remember those stories, because so do I. Yet you don&#39;t see me winning. Strange, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He gave off a sarcastic laugh, before whimpering again as Aida&#39;s fingers twisted more of his tail.

&quot;Stop that!&quot; He instinctively slapped her hand, only to feel as if he had slapped steel instead. &quot;Yeowch!&quot; He looked at his palm, now red, and glared back.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688326869221386 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688326869221386><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:01 AM">01:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Memories or not, a fairy tale is only a tale when it&#39;s <strong>been put to written words!</strong> Words that can survive the elements and reach future generations. Otherwise, all you have is just a string of ideas in your head!&quot; The fox scolded her. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t everyone be an author if what you said was true? No! A story is only a story when someone makes an active attempt at sharing it with others. If they don&#39;t, then it&#39;s nothing more than idea. One so closed off and distant that it could never have an impact on the real world.&quot;

It was jarring, to hear Reynard give his own analysis on literature. Is this how the Saber truly viewed books? Or was it something he picked up from books about critique and analysis? 

He didn&#39;t have time to demonstrate that, because Zahhak had almost finished charging his flaming beam.

&quot;Shit. Shit! We need to get out of here!&quot; Reynard warned, albeit he was currently stuck thanks to Aida herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every fiber of his being told him that if they didn&#39;t run now, they&#39;d never make it out alive. It also told him that even if they did run, they would still stand no chance of making it out alive. The stories he&#39;d prepared were duds. They were dead meat either way.

At least he could drag Nikolai down with him...

&#39;Get out of here, how?&#39;

The more Reynard panicked, the more horrible their fate seemed, and the calmer Aida felt. Was it because Reynard was panicking enough for the both of them, leaving her with no choice but to be the one who asked the stupid questions? But, ah, there are no stupid questions, not even the ones that come dangerously close to crossing into moron territory! Besides, who else was there to judge?

&#39;Never thought I&#39;d see <em>you</em> act like a headless chicken when faced with a crisis,&#39; she said, trying to inject some sanity into Reynard. &#39;I get it already. We&#39;re pretty much toast if you can&#39;t find the right story, and it must be printed on a page. Is that why you were so pushy with me, making me come up with stories of my own? So you can build your personal arsenal?&#39; She raised an eyebrow. 

&#39;<strong>Well too bad.</strong>&#39; She promptly shattered his dreams. &#39;I&#39;m no author. I can&#39;t spin stories like a ball of yarn. I&#39;m not cut out for that! All my life, I&#39;ve been made to observe. The only stories I have are stories that belong to the others. None of the words I write are my own!

&#39;But oh dear, have I got some words for you right now, Mr. Wannabe Prince!&#39; She released Reynard&#39;s tail, but proceeded to jab him on the chest with each word she said. &#39;You want a story? Then how about a story of the fox who stopped doomsaying and started putting a little trust in himself? How about the fox placed a little trust in his Master? You keep jumping to conclusions about what I should do and what I shouldn&#39;t do. Even now, when you&#39;re at your wit&#39;s end, you still wouldn&#39;t talk to me and keep trying to push me away.

&#39;You want a book? You&#39;ve got a book then. Why don&#39;t you read your own stories again and remind yourself of who you are? As for me? I&#39;m not going anywhere,&#39; she said stubbornly, as the jellyfish wrapped its remaining tendrils around her legs and effectively bound her in place. &#39;Why don&#39;t you try me?

He would stay, no matter what.

&quot;Look, if you want to be cheeky, do it once we&#39;re back at home safe and sound!&quot; He scolded the woman, thinking that this would be another of her tired rants filled with complaints and childish viewpoints. Instead, he found himself surprisingly humbled as Aida dragged him down back to earth, while simultaneously accusing him of grooming her.

&quot;What? You&#39;re really thinking about that <em>now?</em> Why would I use your stories when-Bah! Forget it! I&#39;ll-&quot; He tried to flee, only for Aida to release her hold and verbally beat him down, freezing him solid. What followed was a lengthy speech about the fox&#39;s lack of confidence. Not only in himself, but his Master as well. He had already accepted a defeat and was trying his best to cushion himself for the fall instead of preventing the fall in the first place. Aida knew that well, hence why she didn&#39;t mince her words.

Reynard had some choice words of her own, fully prepared to shred her for shredding him! But that never happened, since Aida took initiative via action and immediately tossed her glasses away, letting them burn as she widened her eyes and stared at Reynard like a fish through a fish tank. He already felt violated, blushing red as his unpleasant memories from last time started to resurface.

Aida saw plenty. Plenty that she wished she hadn&#39;t seen, but at least she knew Reynard&#39;s true feelings towards her now. That was exactly why she couldn&#39;t give up on him, because she <em>knew</em> that he could find a way out of this situation. He just had to have faith in his own purpose. Why would a character be penned if there was no point to their role?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688782290956289 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688782290956289><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Stop that! You know what happened last time!&quot; Reynard shouted. Ironic, since he had mostly pleasant memories from then. Regardless, Aida didn&#39;t listen, instead continuously staring at him while Kurage advanced and wrapped itself around its Master. It attached itself to Zahhak&#39;s skin, gluing Aida to the dragon&#39;s surface as she was now stuck and immobile. Reynard tried to drag her away, to no avail.

&quot;Why are you doing this? There is no point in dying so young.&quot; The fox asked. He could never understand Aida&#39;s logic, ever since his summon. Her mind was an enigma to him, which is perhaps why she decided to be an open book. Instead of remaining silent, she goaded Reynard to come closer, revealing her true intentions: To become a living book, for him to peruse and read at his heart&#39;s content. In essence, his Master was offering herself up to him, mana and all. All to prove that Reynard could do it if he trusted in himself.

Such a childish, banal notion was rarely worth any serious thought. But childish was exactly Aida&#39;s way of doing things. She would rather die than see Reynard not make an active effort to beat their opponent. Reynard knew very well that she wouldn&#39;t budge.

&quot;...You&#39;re like a fly in my soup. A thorn on my side. <strong>A pain in my butt!&quot;</strong> Reynard flapped his gums, ears perked up and tail shaking wildly. He glared at the book that Aida now held in her hands, merely titled <em>Reynard the Fox</em>. So, that was the collection of Aida&#39;s knowledge on him, courtesy of her Mystic Eyes. Yet another version of his autobiography, except that it was written by Aida herself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688812473176146 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688812473176146><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>fssssss</em>

Zahhak had finished charging, the molten flames about to erupt and incinerate the Alexandrians into cinders. Reynard had only seconds left, so he took his crayon and proceeded to stab the tip into the book. Words flashed into his mind, working in a backwards faction. He revisited his entire journey with Aida, from their first meeting, to their repetitive spats, weeks of silence and embarrassing encounters. He remembered the first time she slapped him, or the first time he pranked her. The first time she fed him along with the time he watched over her at the hospital.

Come to think of it, what was missing back then? Why did he feel unhappy in those moments of peace? Didn&#39;t he always like simple and mundane? Then why did his heart feel so heavy whenever Aida kept insisting that neither of them had room for growth?

He didn&#39;t have the time to process that, as he was surprisingly catapulted even further behind. This time, he was in the library. Aida was there, looking as dimwitted as ever. A child approached her, asking for a book. 

Reynard&#39;s book, of course.

She handed it over with a smile. Reynard then left the library, carried over to the child&#39;s home as the boy dug in. They didn&#39;t finish all of it, of course. Children never did, unless they were fully invested. Instead, they wrote down a note before they returned it to the library. Just a simple comment on the book cover about how Reynard&#39;s plans were hilarious.

And then the same thing happened. More people coming to Aida, asking to borrow the book. Children, adults, those who hated him and those who loved him. People from all walks of life were coming to read him, seeing a little bit of themselves in every passage and leaving a message behind for others to see. For every reader, there was a different face of Reynard the Fox. One that sparked joy, another that sparked fear. One that inspired hope, another that inspired cruelty.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688845775933522 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688845775933522><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>Was this what it meant to be a fairy tale?</strong> To allow these humans to project onto you? To be a vehicle for their emotions? Reynard was frothing at his mouth. Was this the truth that Aida wanted to show him? It felt cruel beyond words! He was much more than just a blank slate to self-insert into! He was his own entity! He was-

His crayon slipped even deeper, piercing through the book and instead dragging itself closer to Aida. Reynard barely perceived the movement as he slipped forward and watched his weapon stab right through Aida. It didn&#39;t stop at the tip either, continuously penetrating her to the point that it felt like it was absorbing something. Reynard was dragged forward as well, his eyes meeting hers as Aida&#39;s Mystic Eyes tingled. She had never felt this sensation before, but it was akin to being put under a large microscope.

That&#39;s because Reynard could see her now. Everything about her, in fact. His crayon had somehow perceived Aida as a book, perhaps due to the power of her own Mystic Eyes. He voraciously read through the contents of her life, laughing at her misery and blushing at her feelings. Feeling disappointment at half of her opinions on him before feeling relaxed upon reading the other half. Feeling terrified at the amount of punishments she had stored in her skull specifically for him.

He kept reading and reading, until the Aida from now was long gone. Instead, he was greeted by the Aida from long ago, back when she had first arrived at Alexandria. He had never seen such hopeless eyes before, devoid of her usual child-like curiosity and smile. The sign of someone who had lost something very important to them. The fox couldn&#39;t admit it, but he felt pity. Kinship, even. He attempted to touch them, but the memory faded away, replaced by a distant visage of her parents and a boat. It all melted into black ink, before a white cone of light shone in the middle of the room.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688874662121494 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688874662121494><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Reynard approached it. He touched it. When he did, he finally understood what was missing. The one thing he could never understand about Aida, nor obtain from others. The piece that explained her passion for fairy tales. No, <em>everybody&#39;s</em> passion for characters like him.

After all, what would humans do without ridiculous stories to inspire them. Reynard thought himself to be a slave to his author, but it was the other way around. His author was the slave, having unleashed a creation upon the world that would affect the lives of millions. Spin-offs, deviations, spiritual successors, adaptations...Humans would keep remaking him for eternity! He was already a king to these unruly humans.

And it was a king&#39;s obligation to lead.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688896900304987 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688896900304987><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/F_d-WVTyG8E">https://youtu.be/F_d-WVTyG8E</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtLCor058P-4JWH5b6qtbIw><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Duelist's Dreams</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_d-WVTyG8E"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">1 07 遊馬のテーマＩＩ</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_d-WVTyG8E width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053688921638314095 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053688921638314095><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>KA-BLAAAAAAAM!</strong></em>

Zahhak had finally fired his flaming lance, scorching the entire area around him, including his own body, just to rid himself of the pests defiling his sacred skin. He could practically smell the stench of charred flesh in the air. Delightful and pungent! Perhaps his opponent&#39;s corpses would make for a decent snack.

It was only when the lance collided that he realized what had truly happened. He glared at his arm in awe, noticing burn marks on his skin, which was a sign that his lance had hit its target and exploded. Yet Reynard and Aida were still standing there, unharmed. What sort of trickery was this?!

&quot;A bit early for dragon BBQ, I&#39;d say.&quot; Reynard taunted, shaking his head in disapproval at Zahhak&#39;s attack. &quot;But I&#39;ll happily oblige your request, Azhiazhi.&quot; He said with a wink and then pointed to the sky.

Even Aida would be flabbergasted as to what happened. She couldn&#39;t exactly tell, since her Mystic Eyes were almost blinding in an actual fight. She, like Zahhak, would be guided to Reynard&#39;s finger and stared above.

What she saw was marvelous.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053689024277123222 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053689024277123222><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:03 AM">01:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=discord_assets/90361289-4C561.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=discord_assets/90361289-4C561.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 90361289.png (1.08 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053689058389397524 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053689058389397524><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:04 AM">01:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A gigantic, mechanical creature, hovering above ground as if the skies were the floor. Its elegant design, coupled with animal-like features reminiscent of foxes, caused Aida to immediately put two and two together. This creature had clearly been spawned by Reynard, but how? She had never seen or imagined such a beast in a story book.

But her eyes showed her the truth: <strong>This was her creation.</strong> Everything about it was inscribed with her own thoughts, her own experiences, her own emotions towards Reynard. Her current reality, her potential realities. Her disappointments, regrets, grievances and annoyances. Her dreams, passions, ideals and respect for him as well.

And this was only her side of things. The other side was Reynard&#39;s own emotions. His desire to be big, because he wanted to defeat the giant dragon, but also because he wanted others to see him as such. His desire to appear strong, because being weaker than Aida embarrassed him. His desire to have armor, because he couldn&#39;t admit it, but he thought Aida looked, by his own words, &#39;awesome&#39; while wearing Kurage&#39;s armor.

His desire to protect, exemplified by the blue flames that were ominously surrounding the gigantic fox mech. It had tanked Zahhak&#39;s flaming lance head on and instead repurposed its fire for its own.

&quot;Muahahahahah!&quot; Reynard started chuckling, crossing his arms and posing the same way a villain would. &quot;Have you counted up your sins, you wicked dragon? Because my ultimate weapon, the <em>Reynardator-XIII</em>, will mark this arena as your grave!&quot; He raised a thumb and pointed it down, mimicking the actions of an emperor at a colosseum.

&quot;And before you think about thrashing about or firing more spears,&quot; Reynard snapped his fingers. The Reynardator&#39;s eyes flashed red as it howled. The will-o&#39;-wisps surrounding it suddenly caught aflame, circling around Zahhak and turning into miniature spears. An imitation of the dragon&#39;s own technique.

&quot;BANG!&quot; Reynard pointed a finger gun and released, the hundred or so spears making contact with the beast&#39;s carapace and inflicting the equivalent of a bunch of giant hornet stings. It was incredibly painful, a sizzling feeling perforating Zahhak&#39;s skin and filling him with even more bloodthirsty ideas.

But Reynard wasn&#39;t done yet, since this was merely a distraction. The true attack came later, as the Reynardator was now several feet higher, blocking the Sun from the arena with its majestic size. It curled up into a ball and started to spin, spinning so hard that it eventually turned into a blur. It then slowly crashed downward, like an ominous meteor.

&quot;This is the true power of the <strong>Crayon of Malpertuis!&quot;</strong> Reynard&#39;s chest swelled with pride. &quot;No longer will I be confined to the paltry limits of past stories. No, I will carve my <em>own</em> stories and forge my <em>own</em> path. Do you understand now, little dragon? You will serve as nothing more than my introductory chapter. Better get used to it and put up at least a half-decent fight. Otherwise, my prospective readers will get bored, muahahaha!&quot;

Aida certainly hadn&#39;t expected this. Reynard was showing far more joy in here than any other time in his life. Sure, he enjoyed bullying those weaker than him. Sure, he enjoyed flaunting and boasting about his capabilities at every corner. That was exactly the type of despicable villain he was.

But even she could tell the obvious lie he had said. There was no way that someone as self conscious and pragmatic as Reynard would go with a giant fox mech as his ultimate weapon. Something like a dragon slayer would have been far more fitting and suitable. Then why?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053689136038547537 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053689136038547537><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:04 AM">01:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
...It was all to appeal to her, wasn&#39;t it? To stand with his back turned and inspire admiration. To have a mechanical titan that reminded Aida of him. He just wanted to be an inspirational hero in her eyes, one with a sleek, memorable design that you would see in children&#39;s toys. Not to mention, the blatant inspiration from Kurage in the outer mechanical shell.

She felt spoiled by him almost.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;m a merciful soul.&quot; Reynard giggled, shrugging as the giant mechanical fox was now about to collide with a stunned Zahhak. &quot;So, I&#39;ll make sure that you die painlessly, oh giant dragon. So, take this blow head on and be disintegrated. C&#39;mon, Reynardator! Unleash your instant kill move, also known as the, uh-&quot;

He turned towards Aida for a second, as if expecting her to contribute. She remained silent, of course, since she was too shook to come up with a name on the spot. Reynard then hurriedly turned back.

&quot;the <em>Librarians-are-better-with-their-glasses-off-beam!&quot;</em>

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Aida and Kurage flew in the air, plummeting down below after the Reynardator&#39;s meteor impact had sent them flying. Surprisingly, they had received minor injuries at most, most likely thanks to Reynard pulling a few strings. The emotional damage, however, was high. What sort of name was that for a finisher? Did Reynard really think he could get away with such an half-assed climax? Aida ought to dock him off a few points from the &#39;p&#39; scale if he insisted on dropping the ball so often.

Even worse, was the fact that Reynard&#39;s impact had dropped a far more worrisome problem in front of her instead. Nikolai had survived the blast, now shambling like a wild beast as he caught a whiff of Aida&#39;s scent nearby. Great, just great. The only saving grace for the two was the fact that Zahhak&#39;s previous flames had died out from the sheer impact of Reynard&#39;s blow.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053689181861335070 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053689181861335070><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Dec-22 01:04 AM">01:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
In fact, a crater now stood where Zahhak once was. The dragon wasn&#39;t dead. Not by a long shot. But he was resting at the bottom of the ground, water pouring in from the arena as his shell had been completely blown off by the impact, leaving only putrid, fleshy skin. It shocked, to say the least, to be harmed by such a pathetic little creature. Not only that, but the attacks he received felt <em>disgusting to the touch.</em> It was the type of energy that he utterly despised. Positive vibes that greatly outshone his corruptive force.

Just when he was thinking about that, he heard steps coming from the end of the crater. If he were to look around, he would notice Reynard slowly walking towards him, followed by the Reynardator.

&quot;Of course that wouldn&#39;t finish you off. Why would it? It&#39;s the oldest trope in the book.&quot; Reynard scoffed, joking around to make the situation feel less tense. Even though he was pumped after the initial attack, he still remembered that this was a fight to the death. He needed to make sure that the enemy Servant had been killed.

&quot;So, rejoice, for you have the honor to suffer at the hands of the Reynardator once again. C&#39;mon!&quot; He snapped his fingers and the mechanical fox obeyed, jumping in the air again and preparing for another meteor impact. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But, <strong>[AZHI DAHAKA]</strong> was not invincible. After all, even in his prophecy, the great dragon of the end was slain by a hero of legend, a saviour of the people. One who represented a new beginning. The dream of tomorrow.

Dreams... Hope... The idea of moving on, even in the face of absolute adversity. It was <em><strong>anathema to his entire existence</strong></em>.

The flames of destruction never reached Reynard. Instead, <strong>a hero was born.</strong>

<strong>&quot;What...? WHAT?!&quot;</strong>

But he had no time to make his rage known, for although he had not known it, Reynard had already defeated him. 

Lances ripped his body to shreds, and a beam brought an end to the end. The dragon could not even muster a scream as his body was broken by the true might of the Crayon of Malpertuis, leaving the husk, the one called Zahhak, collapsed in a heap within that crater.

He... he had lost?

Yes. He&#39;d lost. He had utterly, entirely lost.

The Holy Grail was now out of his reach. 

The Grail Mud was beyond him.

Angra...

Angra...!

<em><strong>&quot;ANGRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</strong></em>

As Saber looked down to taunt his fallen foe, he would not find a slain dragon, but instead, a swirling vortex of volatile magical energy, so bright that he could barely look at it. Nikolai would feel his reserves of mana suddenly drained dry. Even from a distance, Aida could feel it.

<strong>&quot;YOU MAY CALL ME EVIL! INDEED, I MAY EVEN GO TO HELL! BUT! BUT!!! I&#39;M GOING TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU WITH ME!!!!!&quot;</strong>

No... he couldn&#39;t have, could he? Surely not? But anyone standing in that arena knew with complete certainty what had happened.

<strong>Zahhak had just turned his Saint Graph into a primed bomb.</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could feel it as soon as his body collided with solid ground. He could feel it as his bones grew heavier than iron, and his eyes grew heavy. He could feel it in the air, if only as an odd sensation rather than what for it truly was.

Zahhak… had lost. Failed. In the face of difficulty, he had crumbled. Now, he had one last trick up his sleeve. A trump card to end all trump cards. If he could not get is claws on the grail, then he’d make sure these two couldn’t. If Nikolai died alongside them?

Another casualty. Nothing more. ‘Victory’ at all costs. That was what they promised each other. This was the plan. There was no way to turn back. Reality was stone. Unyielding. Cold. Harsh. It would take a monumental amount of effort to shape it in any other way.

For a normal person, there could be no change to the world they lived in. 

But. Among monsters; Zahhak. Among man; Nikolai.  His desires meant the death of one was acceptable. The death of this entire crowd? One that booed, sneered, and harassed him for simply existing? Even if he lived and got the wish, how could he face Sapphire? His hands already held enough blood. He could not wash his hands, but he could prevent them from getting any more.

Thus, he rose. His heart pounded in his chest emotions other than pure rage dominated his mind. Slowly, he shambled away from Aida. Towards the one that was supposed to give him his one desire in this life.

To crush even that beneath his foot.

“<em><strong>Would. Do. Again. Friend.</strong></em>”

The first and last words spoken to the serpent telepathically. The damnation of the only person who truly understood one another, if only on a surface level.

He did not yell, nor falter. Nikolai pointed a finger at the crater. “<strong>L. C…</strong>”

Zahhaks serial number. Given when they bonded. The end to this dismal tale. Would it work? Who knew. If it didn’t, then it didn’t. Nothing else to it. Such was the rationale of a man trapped to reality.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When the Crayon of Malpertuis touched her, Aida felt herself begin to unravel. Her hands began to fade. She was unable to feel the scales beneath her feet. This must be what it felt like to be turned into a living book, she thought, but then even her thoughts stopped feeling like they had belonged to her. 

The combined effect of Reynard&#39;s crayon and her mystic eyes pushed them both into uncharted waters. They were connected - not by Command Spells, not by bonds, but by a flood of memories and thoughts and emotions. Both of them allowed their minds to expand until memories suffused them, drowning out their individuality with ephemeral knowledge that felt too intimate and too forbidden, so delicate yet intense. For a split second, Aida allowed herself to be swept away. She was a stray leaf carried on the wind, yet if she wanted, she could control the flight.

But she did not want control. For the first time, she did not have to be the observer. She did not have to detach herself and observe the world from outside of the frame. She did not have to be the sponge, soaking up the others&#39; memories until she no longer had room for her own. For the first time, someone else was watching her.

Did they like what they saw? 

Did it matter?

That one split second of comforting bliss stretched like minutes. Hours. Eons...

By the time she came to, she was lying snugly in the corded cradle of her jellyfish. Kurage was missing most of its limbs, but by pure protective instinct it held its bell-shaped head together and cushioned its Master&#39;s fall. The heat from the lava bed had all but dissipated after the Reynardator™️ had deleted the topmost layer of the ground, leaving nothing but a giant crater in its wake.

The arena. Her corporeal body was still in the arena, with Reynard&#39;s new form towering above and in the eye of the crater, a bright, pulsating neuron star where Zahhak&#39;s fallen form used to be. A single glance was enough to make her eyes hurt. A single breath took all the energy she had in her body, as a dark crackling energy permeated the very air from the arena. 

Groaning, she pushed herself into a kneeling position, smooshing her deflating familiar in the process. Her hands instinctively went up to adjust her glasses, but then, just as quickly, she remembered that she had thrown them away. 

...Why did she even do that?

It was a spur of the moment decision, but now she was beginning to regret it. Why couldn&#39;t she have just tucked it away in her pockets like a normal person? Why did she have to take out her pent up frustration on the poor spectacles? She hadn&#39;t brought a spare. How was she going to get home in this state? The arena almost felt like a haven in comparison: with only another human (and a fox-shaped Servant) in sight, this was as close to a distraction-free zone as she could get. 

Speaking of the Republic Master...

It was getting harder and harder to see in the blinding light, to the point that the brief flashes of memories swirling behind her eyes were more vivid in comparison. Thus, she could only rely on her hearing but even that had failed as Reynard&#39;s booming voice rained down from above, drowning out even the screams from the announcer&#39;s microphone. He was in her head in both the metaphorical and the figurative sense, and it was going to drive her mad if he didn&#39;t tone it down!

&quot;Pointless of you to struggle, you overgrown lizard.&quot; He wagged his finger nearby as if talking to an impotent child. &quot;Because you see, the victors of this tournament are-&quot;

Before he could finish, the dragon laughed, revealing that his soul was as wicked as it came. If they couldn&#39;t win, then no one was allowed their privilege. Without warning, they  morphed their Saint Graph into an explosive charge of mana, one strong enough to decimate the arena grounds.

The only downside was that it was painfully obvious to see what Zahhak was planning. The catch was that even if you could tell what was going on, the chance of stopping the detonation was slim.

&quot;What?&quot; Reynard&#39;s eyes widened, his lips curled in frustration as he realized that his opponent had no intention of surviving. He stomped the ground furiously and motioned for the Reynardator™️ to hurry up with its descent. &quot;You <strong>FOOL!</strong> You&#39;ll get rid of your Master too!&quot; He shouted, but it was clear that the Lancer didn&#39;t give a damn.

The mechanical fox crash landed right into the pulsating Zahhak, slamming down the dragon&#39;s chest and digging the crater even deeper. Reynard thought that by decimating Zahhak&#39;s body and pushing him below ground, he might be able to mitigate the explosion&#39;s impact. He was so focused on that plan that he didn&#39;t even notice Nikolai attempting to disarm the dragon in the first place.

Then, nothing. Within the crater, for all to see, was <em>absolutely nothing</em>. Gone was the malice, the rage, the absolute despair contained within a shape. As if a balloon had been popped, revealed to be filled with only air. What should’ve been, no longer.

Zahhak, Azhi Dahaka… gone.

The Commodan still stood. So did Nikolai. So did Aida. So did Reynard.

Even with the roar of the crowd, the confusion, the shock, the relief– Nikolai heard none of it. Instead, his ears rang. His heavy bones filled with an awful feeling. Memories, alright. A whole bunch of them. A side effect he had no chance of knowing, resulted from a Servant-Master Bond severed in half. 

Memories of a life he had never lived. Someone else. Not of Zahhak, but… another. One who also sought his power, and at great cost. 

Another Master. Nikolai had not been the first. A blessing, and a curse. Life would be much harder with another person&#39;s memories in his head, bits and pieces scattered between the fragmented clips that grew ever harder to piece together.

But, he was not alone. A small comfort, yet all he would receive. Like many other things, it would have to be enough.

And for Nikolai, who now stared blankly into space, it was plenty. For the first time in these last two weeks, his mind stirred but sat mostly empty. Little thoughts, little feeling. Peace, perhaps. Wherever Sapphire was, he hoped she too felt this peace. Maybe life without him was better for the both of them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1054459639783239752 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1054459639783239752><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Dec-22 04:06 AM">04:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But… there was one problem. Just one. Nikolai raised his hands, and undid the strap underneath his chin. Strong fabric dug into his skin, and the relief was immediate as soon as it was undone. Then, he raised the helmet off his head. It was hard to breathe with that thing, but not because of the limited air.

He took deep, strong breaths as the helmet slipped from his fingers and stuck to the ground like glue. Warm sunlight kissed his face, and he soaked in its gentle heat. Motionless. 

“<strong>What. Now?</strong>”

His head turned slightly, and an eye met the muddled gaze of Aida. How the hell did he know she was there?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Had Reynard done the deed? Did he finally manage to best a foe several orders of magnitude in size and, for once, claim his victory through not trickery but strength and pure spirit? Had he just improvised their way to victory? 

Aida threw her own makeshift helmet aside, returning it to its plump jellyfish form. The jellyfish was missing so many body parts that it barely managed to prop itself up, but any limb was better than none at all. Aida couldn&#39;t even make a dent in Nikolai&#39;s armor, let alone subdue him on her own. At least her familiar was good at flogging-

A loud banging noise filled her ears and made her jump. Her eyes immediately searched for the source of the noise - a battered-looking helmet. Instinctively, she looked up. She had read before that throwing down one&#39;s weapon and helmet was a gesture to yield the match in certain parts of the world. So had her opponent yielded? 

Her gaze met Nikolai&#39;s, and for a moment she was silent in shock as she stared into the face that was half man, half beast. The features were human but not human enough, with wild coarse hairs that reminded her of a giant bear. 

She hitched in a nervous breath. &#39;This...this is checkmate,&#39; she said with some difficulty, willing herself to concentrate on Nikolai&#39;s features. 

<em>Don&#39;t break the focus...</em>

She cleared her throat as letters began to appear on Nikolai&#39;s skin. <em>Concentrate...</em> &#39;Reynard won, fair and square,&#39; she continued. &#39;And that&#39;s what I shall do as well...&#39;

The letters began to overflow. They crawled all over his skin and armor, pooled at his feet like geysers, beckoning her to take a closer look.

<em>No.</em> She shook her head, but her brain had already started to digest the words that jumped out at her the most. Her Mystic Eyes had already acted upon Nikolai, and once the process began-

Her expression went slack. The tension in her body seemed to ebbed away as she continued to stare at Nikolai, eyes unfocused, unseeing, but fixed in an eerie stare that seemed to go right through him. Words flashed in front of her, colored by her own vivid imagination as she involuntarily began to indulge herself in the book of Nikolai. 

&#39;L...C...F...&#39; Her mouth began to form sounds independently from her brain. From the present to the past, all that Nikolai had experienced jumped out at her.

Perhaps, too many things. With her Mystic Eyes, a new story unraveled before her very eyes. Memories crisp from the deep recesses of his mind, to where not even Nikolai could remember. She would be able to recall more things than the original person could, unfortunately.

And while sporadic in their nature, not many of them were happy.

Two parents waved goodbye as he was scurried off to an Orphanage. Then, bits and pieces from a life of crime. Numerous visits to a nurse, and scoldings from the caretakers. Fist fights, robbery, bouncing at shady locations– but never long enough to guess where. Back to the colosseum them now stood in, face to face with that Thomas guy and his own Servant.

To piece together when one memory stopped and another began was impossible. A jumbled mess, much more like a ‘Choose your Own Adventure’ novel than any proper book.

And then, a scream. A woman decked in a hotel room. The man beside her, bruised and barely able to stand, screamed at him. Told him secrets. A curse. After a flicker, stood over his lifeless father.

Then, he was outside. This time, a much younger girl berated him. Flames danced all over the lobby, and she blocked the door. Magecraft swirled in her hands, ready to strike him down like an animal.

Once more, the memory jumped. Nikolai reached out an arm to her, as the building came down. “<strong>SAPPHIRE–</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055197835131359283 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055197835131359283><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Dec-22 04:59 AM">04:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Right after, jumped to a starry night sat down in a run-down barn. A hand reached up to the heavens, Zahhak right by his side. Then, the arm dropped. “<em><strong>Only. Stars. Nothing. More.</strong></em>”

Then, he was atop a roof. Sat at a table, with two others with him. A much older man and a younger girl with blue streaks in her hair. Each one of them had a glass in their hands. The other two stared at the city below them, while he stared at them.

“<em>A week from the tournament</em>,” the girl said. “<em>Not too late to back out, you know?</em>”
“<em>Smarter, too,</em>” the man chided. He took a sip from his beer, “<em>Don’t want to ruin something good while it&#39;s here. Could forget all about–</em>”

“<em><strong>No.</strong></em>”

“<em><strong>Must. Find. Her. Make. Things. Right.</strong></em>”
“<em>And die in the process.</em>”

The girl smacked his arm, “<em>Oh, hush! If you’re sure, Nikolai, then… I guess I gotta support you, yea? That’s what friends are for!</em>”

Silence, then he too looked to the city. The beautiful, sparkling lights shone brightly in the dark. The world tilted before his head shook. “<em><strong>Hmm.</strong></em>&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="22-Dec-22 04:59 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055198124836147210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055198124836147210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Dec-22 05:00 AM">05:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
And then—

It stopped. Memories lasted a second before they went somewhere else. The flow of times past disrupted, thrown into even more disorder than before. Something must have happened in the real world.

And something had. Nikolai stood in front of Aida, a hand firm on her shoulder. He shook her once more. “<strong>You. There?</strong>”

His body stood tense. It was clear to see despite the heavy layers he wore. “<strong>Wake. Up.</strong>”

“<strong>Day. Dreams. Can’t. Change. Reality.</strong>”

He motioned back to the crater, where his Servant–, no, the frame– still sat at the bottom. “<strong>How. Win. Square? No. Muscle. Won’t. Dent. Nikolai. Fight. Over.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Aida&#39;s Mystic Eyes granted her a very specific pathway to a person&#39;s mind, but it was a proximal effect, meaning that the closer she was to that person, the more she could see. Standing right in front of Nikolai pushed the efficacy of her ability to its peak, and she was being shown so much in the deepest recesses of his mind that she almost felt as if their minds had become one.

But then it was all over. A jolt on her shoulders shook her out of her reverie, a sudden interruption in the flow of words drawing her in, like turning off a tap or cutting of the power to a light bulb. The experience was disorienting. Everything vanished. All the words and imagery and sensations that gave her goosebumps were suddenly severed from her. She returned to the present, to her own body where she was just Aida Moretti, a librarian, a Master, and an Alexandrian fighting for the rights of her city.

She was steps away from ending the fight. Steps away from claiming victory. Except that Nikolai&#39;s got his hands on her shoulders, her own neck mere inches away from being snapped like a twig. The mercenary wasted no time in seizing the moment. While she had been distracted, he had positioned himself for checkmate instead - it was nothing short of cold-blooded murder.

Or was that really the case? 

Aida didn&#39;t know how long she&#39;d been &#39;out&#39; for, but surely Nikolai had ample time on his hands to do more than shake her shoulders? The fact that she was still alive, conscious even - that was proof enough that the mercenary had acted out of character. Was he the type to always want to address his prey before going in for the kill? Perhaps not all mercenaries that wear masks were as trigger happy as that gunsmith.

Words, rough and gravelly and merciless hung over her as if they were tangible things. The mercenary was trying to reason with her! Or was that his final warning before he completely shut down her vitals? 

She&#39;d seen similar scenes play out over and over again in stories. She knew that if there was any miraculous turnarounds, she needed to make them happen now, or she&#39;d miss the narrative window permanently. A trick up her sleeves. Some kind of divine intervention. Her Servant! Her familiar! Anything! Hell, maybe she could suddenly throw a decent punch of her own!

But instead-

&#39;I&#39;ll pry your armor off you, piece by piece if necessary. Then you&#39;ll lose your protection. <em>Then</em> we&#39;ll be even!&#39; She reasoned nonsensically. How lame. A battle of words? Now?

But words were familiar to her. Unlike throwing punches or swinging swords, it was where she drew her strength. Even when her knees felt weak and her body too heavy to move, even when the fear of defeat began to overwhelm her. 

Words taught her more than she ought to know.

Even now, they swirled in her vision, threatening to take over her consciousness again. She drew in a deep breath and concentrated on the present. &#39;What I&#39;ve wanted,&#39; she spoke resolutely, &#39;What I&#39;ve wanted for Alexandria. It was never a dream to begin with-&#39;

She drew in another deep breath. She&#39;d seen too much, heard too much. 

&#39;-because I know what I must do to make it a reality, even if I can&#39;t do it perfectly. I&#39;m not the one who needs to wake up. I&#39;m not the one living in a dream.

Nikolai stood still for a few moments, until– a laugh. A hearty, ugly laugh flowed from his fuzzy mouth. It filled the area, and threaten to overtake the arena. Spittle flew from his mouth in all directions as. 

It was short, it was terrible, yet it was full of life. “<strong>Can’t. Dream. No. Time.</strong>”

Only now did he let go of her shoulder, “<strong>Actions. Louder. Words.</strong>”

A finger dug itself into her forehead. “<strong>Many. Words.</strong>”

How could one such as himself be in a dream? The metaphor went over his head, and by a healthy margin. He was more awake now than he’d ever been. The sun felt real, this interaction felt real. His loss–

Equally as real. 

“<strong>Not. Dreaming. Not. Help. Nikolai’s. Goal.</strong>”

The pressure on her head doubled. “<strong>Or. You.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was nothing like the flicks Reynard had administered when he thought she was being stupid. In other words, it hurt! Aida briefly wondered if her forehead was going to bruise the next day. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be the most glorious badge of honor, that was for sure. And her words certainly didn&#39;t seem to help her situation.

But since when had she ever backed down from anything? Since when had she been properly challenged on that front? By Cathy? By her auntie? By Reynard? She had been told &#39;no&#39; plenty of times in her life, and she would do everything in her power to make sure that Nikolai wouldn&#39;t be the last. 

To a spectator, what she was doing might as well have been a pointless struggle. But Aida was hanging onto her own words like a safety thread. If there was any chance of her surviving this...

&#39;Actions speak louder than words, but thought precedes actions!&#39; She said calmly - or at least, that was how she wanted to appear to the Republic Master. She clenched her own fists to tense her own body. &#39;Have you ever stopped to think whether your actions have brought you closer to your goal?&#39;

She closed her eyes for a moment, but the silhouette of that young girl did not fade. Sparks of flame danced behind her eyelids, as vivid as real fire that could eat through books and reduced each page to ash. 

&#39;You won&#39;t find her here,&#39; she began to cast her gaze downward, carefully avoiding his eyes. &#39;Winning the tournament won&#39;t get you any closer to finding her. Sapphire - that&#39;s her name, isn&#39;t it? She...&#39;

She was acutely aware of how close to death she was. 

&#39;She&#39;s gone.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055624787386454036 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055624787386454036><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Dec-22 09:16 AM">09:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Deep, heavy breaths followed suit. The finger that threatened to put a hole through her skull shook and wavered with every heave of Nikolai’s chest. Aida had chosen the perfect time to look away, yet it hadn’t been enough to ensure safety.

That much became clear as his entire hand grabbed ahold of her head. 

“<strong>You. Lie. How. Name?! How. Know?! Can’t. Lie.</strong>”

And then, the ground disappeared. Her entire head was forced upward. Whether she chose to look or not, Nikolai leaned ever closer. Now, the horrid breath flooded her nostrils as his eyes bore daggers into hers. 

“<strong>How. How. HOW?!</strong>”

Even in his own mind, this couldn’t possibly be the truth he so desired. Everything he’d done, the good and bad, towards a goal that would never be realized? What was the point of it all, if there would never be the end he wanted? Nikolai shoved his foot in the metaphorical sand: this cruel joke would come to an end, one way or another. If Aida really knew what happened to Sapphire, then–

“<strong>Tell. Nikolai. NOW.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Aida gasped, feet kicking and grimacing as tears stung in her eyes. She was forced to look at Nikolai, something that she had wanted to avoid at all costs. She couldn&#39;t meet him in the eyes. She didn&#39;t want to do it - not that she was guilty, but she did feel guilty, because every time that she did, it only reinforced all the twisted imagery that had burst from the mercenary&#39;s mind. Bitter, painful memories that she hadn&#39;t asked to pry.

Nikolai&#39;s anger had thrown her into confusion. His denial clashed horrendously with the forbidden knowledge that she had glimpsed. She could even feel the vibrations of Nikolai&#39;s voice in the air and feel his breath on her face, like a beast who was ready to pounce and tear her to shreds. His eyes gleamed madly. Did he not realize-?

&#39;I read your memories,&#39; she cried out loud. &#39;I can see—I can only see what you&#39;ve seen! I saw her—I saw you—<em>oh,</em> don&#39;t you remember?! She—&#39; She asked him, then reached out her arm the same way she&#39;d seen it through Nikolai&#39;s eyes as the building came crashing down. Even more tears welled up in her eyes, but she didn&#39;t know whether it all came from pain, or pity, or both.

&#39;She&#39;s dead, Nikolai.&#39; For the first time she spoke openly of his name, as if hoping to stir the memories that were far better left alone. &#39;It seems that you have buried her - along with your memories of her - in that hotel.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1055653397426077766 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1055653397426077766><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Dec-22 11:09 AM">11:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If Aida could really see memories– better than he could– then…

Nikolai’s grip loosened, then all at once he let go. His arms sank to his side, his fists clenched as could be. He couldn’t even feel his ungloved hand start to trickle blood, a product of his claws that sunk into flesh.

Sapphire was dead. Of course she was. Why would he remember that? It’d be too convenient. Reality never worked as simple as that. At every bend and corner it had worked against him, desperate to make every step a monumental effort. It didn’t owe anyone a damn thing, so why would it start with him?

Every beat of his heart sent another wave of emotion through his body. Frustration, annoyance, anger, the works. No sadness, no guilt. His Origin progressed too far to allow for things like that. Only the absence or presence of rage. Little else. 

And reason; what little remained. Like before, he took numerous deep breaths in and out. One, two, one, two– 

“<strong>Nikolai… Sorry.</strong>”

“<strong>Not. Fault.</strong>”

A deep, deep sigh. “<strong>Don’t. Remember. Anything. Cursed.</strong>”

Acceptance would take time. With any luck, it wouldn’t take long. Perhaps he could grow slightly before it was dashed against the rocks. After all, Sapphire did have the peace he longed for her to have. Besides, what else was there to do?

“<strong>How. Deal. Memories?</strong>”

Nikolai turned the tables back onto Aida. If she could glean such information from people, then life must’ve been a hell much like his own. How did it feel to intrude on everyone’s personal moments, voluntary or otherwise?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She landed on her gelatinous familiar, who was quick to knead itself into a cushion. Aida massaged her head, which felt like it was going to split. If not a bruise, then she would be carrying a migraine for days, it seemed. 

Nikolai had backed off. For someone with little eloquence in speech and mannerisms, he was a surprisingly sensitive fellow. Apologizing? When she heard it at first, Aida almost thought she had been hallucinating. Even at the workshop she worked at, with clients who were much better dressed and much more articulate, it was rare to be on the receiving end of apologies. But then came Nikolai - what was he even apologizing for? For manhandling her? 

&#39;We <em>are</em> opponents, after all?&#39; She said with no small amount of confusion, which only deepened when Nikolai asked her a question of his own. A curse? Was he comparing his condition to her own? 

She stared at him, unsure what to say. Even now, words jumped out at her. If she didn&#39;t replace her glasses soon, she would be in danger of getting swept up in his memories again. 

But to think of her Mystic Eyes as a curse?

&#39;No! No,&#39; she quickly said. &#39;It&#39;s not - it&#39;s not as bad as you think. Reading people, I mean. It&#39;s just like reading a book! And I love reading,&#39; she added, as if concerned that she wasn&#39;t doing a good job at explaining herself. &#39;I love stories. I love to imagine myself in them...&#39;

Just that sometimes, some stories hurt more than the others.

&#39;It&#39;s a lot to take in,&#39; she admitted. &#39;Too much, even. The more I read, the more I&#39;m at risk of forgetting myself. But...&#39;

There was a reason she&#39;d been born with these eyes. Same as her mother. Same as her mother&#39;s mother, and everyone else in her mother&#39;s clan.

There it was. A faint future. One that would last long beyond his time. It was almost too good to be true. Nikolai looked at the ground, then turned back to the crater. Over there, two Servants still sat. One alive, one now dead. Both from the past, but both here in the now. 

“<strong>No.</strong>”

Even in his debilitated mental state, the parallels were clear.

“<strong>If. Worth. Remembering. Then. Happen.</strong>”

“<strong>If. Not. Not.</strong>”

What he did not share with Aida, though, was the other harsh reason for his decision: the people he truly cared to be remembered by were dead. Saria and Three would maybe mourn, but they would move on. Everyone in their line of work did. Otherwise, they’d all be nothing more than sorry, worthless sacks. 

With all his family dead, then he saw little reason to try and preserve his life experiences for future generations to ‘learn’ from. To be yet again a tool for others to benefit from was a fate worse than any death he’d find. Anything he did from now on, it’d have to be strictly for his own gain. Speaking of…

“<strong>Master. Live. Own. Life.</strong>”

“<strong>Make. Own. Story.</strong>”

Nikolai looked around the arena. The announcer had yet to announce who ‘won’ this fight. The crowd still sat on the edge of their seats. Each and every person seemed invested in what the outcome would be. For the person that it mattered most, the task to be invested seemed impossibly monumental.

So, he turned to the exit. The gate he had entered earlier. 

“<strong>Thanks. Everything.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

...on charting your own stories?

But she couldn&#39;t finish that thought. It wasn&#39;t that the notion was foreign, though she&#39;d never considered herself to be a participant. What little longing she had for adventures had died a long time ago.

But she turned out okay. Her mind was all over the place all the damn time, but the reality was nobody had it all figured out, not in every area of their life - not in <em>most</em> areas of their lives. Even storybook characters weren&#39;t exempt. Once they&#39;d been plucked out of the comfort of book pages they, too, would become a floundering mess.

Maybe that&#39;s what it really meant to live a life!

But that nugget of wisdom wasn&#39;t hers to behold. Not yet. After all, she&#39;d never had it &#39;bad&#39;. Reading about the grief of the others and experiencing them for herself were completely different matters. She wanted to relate. She wanted to understand. She wanted to partake in the gravity of the words Nikolai had said! Make her own story. 

You mean like make decisions that you think would be in your own best interests?

She raised her pen and tapped into her mana reserves. Nikolai turned away.

&#39;...Um?&#39;

Arm already half-raised and ready to drop more ink creations on the field, her mouth puckered in confusion. The Republic Master had just...but you can&#39;t just...

&#39;We&#39;re not d-&#39;

<em>&#39;Thanks. Everything.&#39;</em>

&#39;You&#39;re not serious?&#39; She mumbled after the mercenary. He was clearly heading towards the exit! Was he throwing the match? You can&#39;t just throw a match!

Confusion turned into indignation. She was upset. She didn&#39;t even know why she&#39;d be upset. Was this what he had meant by &#39;making your own story&#39;?

He was pushing his arms down in a hurry, attempting to signal for the Reynardator™️ to bury itself even deeper. Even a meter more could mean the difference between life and death. How big was the explosion of a Spirit Core in the first place? Was it impossible to survive one?

&quot;You&#39;re an abysmal loser!&quot; The fox shouted. If he was going to die, he might as well throw as many insults as he could. &quot;Not even <em>I</em> would give up on my Master like this. What excuse do you have, you scaly bas-&quot;

A flicker of light surrounded the crater for a moment, like a dim little oil lamp. After that, the demonic presence was gone. No longer did the arena smell like a miasma of evil incarnate had surrounded it. Not any more evil than Reynard, at least.

&quot;H-He&#39;s gone?&quot; The fox gulped, calmly peering over the edge of the crater. He could see the Reynardator™️ down below, but nothing else next to the gigantic mech. Zahhak had vanished.

He didn&#39;t know if his plan was a success or not, but all clues pointed towards one truth.

&quot;I won? We won?&quot; He placed his arms on his knees in disbelief. His tail was limp from stress and fatigue. Since when had his crayon gotten so awesome, to the point that he could barely stomach using it? He felt like he could eat a whole flock of sheep with how tired he felt.

He was so distracted that he stared aimlessly at the crater for a bit longer, until hearing the announcer blast his sensitive ears. They flopped around, irritated as the fox growled. He wanted to shut the announcer up, until he heard some key information.

&quot;Wait, thirty seconds?&quot; Reynard&#39;s head perked up. &quot;The guy is leaving, <em>what-</em>&quot; He turned around, seeing Aida staring at Nikolai in shock as the latter was now officially outside the tournament arena. A clear sign of defeat.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056342195726192711 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056342195726192711><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Dec-22 08:46 AM">08:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Reynard remained silent for a bit. His eyes were wide and his mouth was agape. In a few seconds, he had the biggest grin possible on him as he cackled like a hyena.

&quot;Aida. <strong>AIDA!!!</strong>&quot; He shouted like an excited puppy. &quot;We won, we won! We beat them, we&#39;re done with this!&quot; His tail wagged left and right. He was swimming in delight, already thinking about how much free time he would have now that this Grail War nonsense had been sorted-

<strong>&quot;Stop!&quot;</strong>

That illusion broke once he heard Aida&#39;s shrill voice, followed by her dogging him to the crater and towering above him. She pleaded for him to do something unthinkable.

&quot;Eh? Shut them up? But why-&quot; He was confused. Aida could have silly ideas at times, but this? This went beyond any form of expectation he had. Why would she ever look at a gift horse in the mouth like this?

He was tempted to stand his ground. Simply say &#39;no&#39;. What could she do? Beat him up? Sure, but it would definitely last over thirty seconds. She held no power over him in this situation.

And yet, her panicked voice, followed by that all enthralling gaze of her bare eyes, were enough to remind Reynard of the reason he chose to stick around with this bratty, demanding girl.

&quot;Okay, fine, fine! Sheesh!&quot; The fox replied, fifteen seconds left on the clock as he raised himself and placed his finger on her lips. &quot;You owe me a favor. You can pay me back once we&#39;re done. Heh heh.&quot; He grinned maliciously.

&quot;I just need to shut him up? No problem.&quot; He looked down at the crater. &quot;Reynardator™️! Time to give your master a little lift.&quot;

The mech rose up, ten seconds to spare as it grabbed Reynard&#39;s cloak with its mouth and tossed him upward. The announcer didn&#39;t even know what was coming as all they saw was a red haired brat riding a gigantic crayon.

&quot;I&#39;ve got just the perfect story to derail the plot-&quot; Reynard cackled, knowing that whatever he did next would be evil. But if Aida had given him permission, then surely it was good?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056342230819946666 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056342230819946666><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Dec-22 08:46 AM">08:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bah. He didn&#39;t care for the minute differences. He would let Aida sort it out for him.

<strong>&quot;STOP THE COUNT!!!&quot;</strong>

He crashed right through the glass on top of the arena, where the announcer viewed the stage and commentated the fight live through a large microphone. Five seconds were left as Reynard jumped into the man&#39;s lap and took out a small book.

<em>Korean Folktales</em>

<strong>The Farting Daughter-in-law</strong>

His crayon consumed it. He then proceeded to place it on the microphone and smiled.

<strong>&quot;H-Hey! You can&#39;t do that, kid. No, Saber! C&#39;mon, go back to the aren-&quot;</strong>

<em><strong>&quot;BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP&quot;</strong></em>

Aida didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or weep at whatever had transpired. What she did know, however, was that Republic&#39;s loss had yet to appear on screen. Whatever outcome the announcer had intended had been cancelled.

After a few minutes of revolting fart noises, security finally tossed Reynard out as the shaken announcer reclaimed his rightful throne.

<strong>&quot;...AHEM, APOLOGIES FOLKS. WE SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME...TECHNICAL ISSUES IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES.&quot;</strong> They cleared their throat. <strong>&quot;NORMALLY, WE WOULD DISQUALIFY SABER AND THEIR MASTER FOR THIS UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. HOWEVER, REPUBLIC&#39;S MASTER HAS ALREADY LEFT THE ARENA PREMISES. THEREFORE-&quot;</strong>

They paused for a second, as if waiting for lines to be fed to their earpiece. None of the spectators could see them, but their eyes widened as they realized what was going to happen. Truly, the world of show business was a reckless and bold one.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="26-Dec-22 07:07 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056342281193521172 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056342281193521172><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Dec-22 08:47 AM">08:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;-WE HAVE DECIDED TO CALL THIS MATCH OFF. IT WILL HAVE NEITHER VICTOR NOR DEFEATED. INSTEAD, THE FATE OF ALEXANDRIA SHALL DEPEND ON ITS NEXT ROUND. WHAT AN UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS, FOLKS!&quot;</strong> They laughed, thinking about their next fat paycheck in the back of their mind.

Did Aida feel relieved at that news? Or was it despair at the thought that she might have possibly doomed her own city? Plus, what <em>even was Reynard&#39;s plan there?</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
