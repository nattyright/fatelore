We ask that you have your boarding passes ready and begin boarding the ship as we set sail from Alexandria. The world is your oyster, and so it comes as no surprise you should choose to explore it with us!</em> 

The message bleats out against the steady throng of people eager to leave Alexandria. To say for most of them this Holy Grail War was a disappointment...well, to be fair, exaggerations of what such a war looked like were greatly stretched. After all, who would have thought that in this new age of the world, death was an outcome most sought to avoid, given how the sad state of the world made every human life count. 

Of course, the urge might have been there for some participants. It certainly was for one Simon Despierro, as the boy sits on a shunted column, watching another effort to leave slowly begin to turn its engines and pull away from him once again. He wouldn&#39;t leave. He couldn&#39;t, even if he wanted to. For one thing, Saber had taken off to collect more &quot;treasures,&quot; of which would undoubtedly consist of poorly sculpted wood figurines and bobbleheads. The boy resolved to simply wait behind, as their food rations were manageable for the time being. After all, they wouldn&#39;t be here much longer. <em>His turn in the tournament was next.</em> 

The embassy had reached out to inform him, their representative clearly displeased by Simon&#39;s chosen venue for the tournament. He hadn&#39;t shown much promise, and so they remarked that the current round would hopefully conclude the whole debacle. It seemed Nikolai wasn&#39;t the only one that was hoping he would drop out...

He sighs heavily and melts over his seat, watching the ship pull out and the newly arrived visitors and scholars thin and fade into the city, leaving only murmurs of conversation. 

He had meant every word beforehand. He realizes that now; he can&#39;t give up just because his chance to prove himself was here.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sitting on a bench nearby was an older man. He was dressed in heavier casual clothing to protect from the sea breeze. In one gloved hand he held a book from which he was reading. At his feet sat a large suitcase. His appearance seemed familiar to Simon.

“People can sense the incoming danger. Those more fortunate pack their things up and skip town. Hoping to avoid the troubles that lie ahead. Others see opportunity in times of uncertainty and rush headlong into the fray, hoping to come out on top. The rest are the unfortunate, unable to escape or take advantage of the changing times. Hoping just to survive.

I wonder then…”

The man closed his book and looked up towards Simon.

“Which one are you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man in question had a stature that was not lost on the boy, his attire only doing so much to hide the power that lies beneath. His face...his face was familiar, but not so much that he could place it. In fact, the more he thought on it, the farther away the answer seemed, leaving Simon only to consider the perfectly innocent question. 

&quot;...Uh, w-well...I guess, if you had asked me that some time ago, I would&#39;ve have said survival. I mean, in a war like this, you kind of just hope it doesn&#39;t devolve into a blood bath. I&#39;m guess I&#39;m thankful there&#39;s not many masters looking to cause mayhem...well, except for that snake,&quot; Simon remarks, shuddering at the memory of Zahak and his deadly battle with Saber. Not even Nimrod, despite imposing a literal tower, seemed interested in just pure death and dismantling. 

&quot;But recently...well, I don&#39;t know how to describe it.&quot; 

It felt nice to just unload on a stranger. One without the judgements from Saber or even his prior opponents. It felt so much easier now to just try and connect with someone else, to reach out despite their difference in stature. Even now, the familiar dread of what he was didn&#39;t seem to matter...if Amelia could be happy with what she was, why couldn&#39;t he? 

&quot;I guess...it&#39;s growing up where you figure that stuff out. Did you ever have a moment like that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He leaned comfortably back in his seat.

&quot;Back in my younger years, my older brother was set to inherit the family business while I was...around. You know how it is.

I never really excelled in the same areas as my brother so I pursued my own interests. I was a bit of a wanderer and a hooligan back then. No aspirations or future.&quot;

The man then leaned back forward.

&quot;One day, I found a hobby. A small pastime that drew my undivided attention. Every single day I practiced my craft. Honing it till I was an expert in my field. I then took a long look at my life and my position in it and came to a decision. I bid farewell to my brother and set off on my own path. It&#39;s been a long hard road, but I&#39;d say I&#39;ve done pretty well for myself so far.&quot;

The man turned back to Simon.

&quot;What about you kid? You find your path yet?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An interesting choice after the previous excitement they had at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-fallen-greatsword</span>. It seemed that Saber did not give proper credit to this small portion of Alexandria. 

There were stalls and stores as far as the eye could see. Many people attempting to simply swindle the new comers to the island, or those who forgot to collect a keepsake from their journey to the City of Scholars. 

It amused The Matriarch greatly. Having collected the necessary items she wanted, no needed for her trove. Including an umbrella, with a novelty canopy meant to look like the binding of books. 

The child however, seemed to have made a friend. &quot;Child.&quot; Saber simply spoke as she was now nearer to both Barrett and Simon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Leaving only a sea that bled into the sky above, as both stretched and spread an azure sheet across his gaze. Endless. Waiting for travel. 

&quot;...I think...I want to survive so that I can find a hobby.&quot; Simon thinks back to any of his likes...and it was hard. What truly gave him joy...not purpose, but joy? That seemed a good place to start. 

Saber&#39;s voice caused the boy to turn, eliciting a slight smile at the sight of the Mother of Grendel in the shade of a rather childish umbrella. It even looked a bit too small for her, as her legs clearly were still enjoying the blaze of the sun.

&quot;Saber, you look like you found a good haul,&quot; he said, nodding to her before turning back to the stranger. 

&quot;This is Saber. I&#39;m sorry if I bored you in anyway. I figure you and her might actually be able to find more common ground than with me.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to show my hand this early, but I think I have a decent enough grasp of the situation Simon Despierro.&quot; The man calmly spoke.

&quot;I knew about you and your daddy Faustus, but what I didn&#39;t know was how you fit into this whole War. Are you the prodigious son looking to prove himself and increase his standing in the family or simply a pawn in the cruel world of mage family politics? I&#39;m guessing more of the latter.

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Barrett Von Meer, mercenary for hire. Security, escort, sabotage, assassination, I can do it all. And I want you Simon, to throw the next round of the Holy Grail War.

In exchange, I&#39;ll do any one job for you, free of charge. Also, as a bonus...&quot;

Barrett took off his glove, revealing a red three pronged sigil. One of the prongs was faded, the remnants of the command that felled the King of Macedon.

&quot;I&#39;ll use one of my command seals to help with your job if need be.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was one of the many characters near the water, who up until now was simply watching the ships go and leave. 

But now he was storming right towards Barrett, angrily pointing at his chest once he caught up to him. &quot;I&#39;ve forgiven you your first use of the command spell, since I was obviously going to fight him eventually and you mainly used the spell to give me a little boost. Not that I needed it of course, I could have beaten the two of them without your help.&quot; Mehmed quickly added before continuing his rant. 

&quot;But if you start using command seals willy-nilly like that or even start offering them to others as if it was just a gold coin or something similar, we will need to have a serious conversation now. That was not part of the deal and I won&#39;t tolerate it. So take that offer back right now.

Barrett von Meer. Alexandrian mercenary, joined by Archer of the Faction. He&#39;d be surprised if he wasn&#39;t more so beset by that same dejection that came from Nikolai&#39;s own speech. He was just here for his father, so why wouldn&#39;t he simply comply? Leave, throw it all aside and spear his own path? 

Because this wasn&#39;t about his father anymore...about Faustus. Simon bristles as Archer berates his master, Servant not even acknowledging him. Neither really acknowledging him the moment Saber came. As if he was just an extension of her...as if she was the real one they were extending an offer to. 

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Simon interjects, holding a hand up to Archer, before turning to Barrett, hoping to hold his gaze as he slides off of his makeshift stool. &quot;I&#39;m not taking the deal anyway. I won&#39;t throw a match, and I don&#39;t need your services. I&#39;m &#39;finding my hobby.&#39; You know how it is, right?&quot; The boy throws Barrett&#39;s own words back in his face, tossing his head back to Saber to search her own thoughts for a moment. The slight shine of his eyes, however, looked like a dog searching for approval.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Barrett went silent as Simon gave his answer. It wasn&#39;t a boisterous one but the conviction, however slight, was there. Barrett was silent a moment before he spoke again his tone dour and serious.

&quot;Yeah, I get it kid. I get it all too well. Back plan partner, we kill Saber.&quot;

Barrett&#39;s metallic arm lashed out, quickly striking towards Simon&#39;s gut.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mehmed quickly summoned a cannon, aiming right at the giant. He hesitated for a second however, staring at her and tilting his head a little to the side, before coming to the conclusion that one small cannon wouldn&#39;t be enough and summoned two more. 

&quot;Now be a good girl and disappear for good.&quot; And with that, he fired right at her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Things then began to escalate. 

The man was a mercenary. Threatening both her and Simon. To boot, he had a servant. 

The Servant was now hellbent on taking action. Grendel&#39;s Mother dropped her new umbrella. 

&quot;Foolish child. Picking a fight you will soon regret.&quot; As soon as the cannons were summoned a blade came to her hands. There was going to be no hesitation, not when faced with the barrel of a weapon. A quick glance to Simon. Expressing one thing clearly. &#39;Do not falter&#39;. 

Cannon fire then occurred. 

The Matriarch lunged into action in equal measure. 

Three shots fired, and the blade was flung with full deadly force right for Mehmed. All the while water began to draw up around Saber and cover her. Freezing to be a barrier between the woman and the projectiles sent by the king. 

Two cannonballs were kept at bay, but the might of what brought down the walls of Constantinople broke through. Striking Saber and sending her backwards from her frozen barricade. A loud crash was heard as her body made contact with the waters below.

Barret&#39;s arm caught the words right in Simon&#39;s gut, the rest strangled into a wheezing cough as Simon keels around the fist. A small mist of blood washes against Barret&#39;s forearm before Simon slides back, shaking from the blow and gasping for air. What was likely meant to be a simple blow left Simon on all fours and fighting against the urge to lose consciousness. 

The shards of ice blowing forth from Mehmed&#39;s assault on the ice kept him from slipping under, enough for Simon to catch Saber being blown back and into the sea. He knew that wasn&#39;t enough to stop the Matriarch; if anything, that was likely to bring down a far worse hell on Archer&#39;s head. But now wasn&#39;t the time to clue them in on that. 

&quot;SABER! Y-you...<em>bleck</em> you can&#39;t do this...I&#39;m not going to <em>let</em> you just do this!&quot; Simon says, holding an arm up weakly as mana flows around his palm. A shimmer of air spreads before him, forming a thin sheen before it pushes itself forward, aiming to throw Barret back. Simon takes the moment to throw a pebble between Archer and the water, and a thin <em>crash</em> manifests a pallid sword that beelines for the opposing Servant.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And as soon as he saw the glimpse of the battle, he hid behind the corner of one of the cargo crates nearby. He saw bubbling in the water and ice on the edge of the dock as a familiar looking servant with cannons stood nearby, as well as a small boy and another familiar face. Mikail recognized the Alexandrian pair from watching footage of the previous tournament round, and so he knew who to protect and who to attack, and the information he could collect from the enviroment allowed him to find out that an allied servant was thrown into the water.

Then he turned around to look at Manco and started quietly speaking. &quot;I have a plan for this. I will ambush our enemies. Could you please create some distraction? Attack the enemy master, the one with a metal arm. He&#39;s called Barrett from what i know after watching tournament footage. Also protect that white-haired boy, he definitely shouldn&#39;t get hurt. Meanwhile i will jump into the water and swim around them and attack from behind. Alright, time to do this.&quot;

Mikail proceeded to move around the dock right outside of view of the four people fighting. Then he got to the edge of the docks on the side around the corner from the place where Grendel&#39;s mother was sent to. So he jumped into the water before swimming to the corner, staying right outside of view of the allied servant, just in case that servant considers him an enemy. And so he waited for the next thing to happen, ready to jump into the battle when a good opportunity arrives.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;What is this, some sort of water nymph?

With a swing of his own sword, Mehmed managed to shatter the sword before getting hit. 

&quot;Kid, if you truly wish to start a fight with a servant, I can gladly humour you. Ceasar went down with 23 stab wounds I believe and I refuse to fall down to any less than that.

There was also the white haired boy he gave his Condor more order, making sure to keep the boy safe as he did as his master ordered. 

He would fly towards Simon and remained close 

&quot;Mama Cocha&quot; he said as a sphere of water emerge from the ocean and floated till it reached his hand. He would hold the sphere before throwing it at Barret as if it was a bullet. 

The sphere would fly towards the Master but it would never land as from the beginning Manco never tried to hit him, he just wanted his attention. The sphere would open a small hole in front of Barret, Manco make it really easy for the magus to notice it and could track that missed attack on him. Manco made no attempt to hide after all. 

&quot;Well this is really disappointing&quot; he said as she move towards all the chaos. &quot;All this time has passed and people still resort to the same tactics. Are women and kids all you are capable of fighting?&quot; 

As he said that, from the water tentacles emerged, the moved fast as they moved to restrain the master using the opportunity of his servant being busy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then he poked his head out of the water for a couple seconds and looked around to see the situation and calculate his next actions, before submerging himself once again. After that he cast an explosion aiming upwards at a specific angle, splashing water into the air, eventually soaking Barrett, Simon and a big area around them in water.

Then he quickly jumped out of the water and pulled out his Uluu Toion pistol before firing a freeze storm shell aimed at Barrett&#39;s holstered rifle. This caused the rifle to freeze to Barret&#39;s water covered body, temporarily blocking him from shooting. Then he quickly fired again, this time aimed at the enemy mercenary&#39;s feet, also causing his boots to freeze to the ground.

He turned his head to look at Grendel&#39;s mother trying to beat up Mehmed. &quot;I&#39;m on republic&#39;s side. Beat up this Julius Caesar LARPer, details later.&quot;

His next move was to cast a powerful high-heat explosion into the same water that he swimmed in, causing a lot of it to evaporate in an explosion of steam. Then steam would quickly cool down, creating a giant cloud of fog around himself, Mehmed and Grendel&#39;s mother. This resulted both blocking Barrett and Mehmed from properly aiming to kill Mikail and creating good cover for the matriarch to retreat to in case the sultan turns out to be good in melee combat.

After that Mikail proceeded holster his shotgun-pistol and stealthily jump back into the water, and thanks to the fog he created, this made him practically disappear into nowhere. Now that he was concealed again he started waiting for another good opportunity to create more chaos.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Damn kid, your constitution is weak as shit isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Simon capitalized on Barrett&#39;s momentary destruction the blew him backwards with some type of air magecraft. Then everything went to shit.

Saber went monstrous and to make things worse someone else crashed the party. Barrett caught the sight of that Caster that Mikail had summoned. Before he could register that fact, Barrett was ambushed, his suitcase and feet frozen to the ground and a smokescreen thrown up.

&quot;Goddamn, just my luck.&quot; Barrett sputtered in frustration.

Barrett then slammed his frozen suitcase against the ground, breaking it apart and freeing his rifle. With his metal hand Barrett then tore apart the ice holding his feet in place.

&quot;Consider yourself lucky kid, I got someone much more dangerous to worry about at the moment.&quot;

Barrett gave these parting to Simon before taking out two grenades from his coat. With a small click he tossed both of them into the foggy water.

&quot;Alright you quick bastard, where will you pop out next?&quot; Barrett raised his rifle and began scanning the area.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He heard the brisk words &quot;Republic&quot; and while he could piece this new master and Servant were friends...or the closest thing he could amount to a friend...he was left puzzled as everything surged around him. Crackles of mana and the crisp breaking of ice were all he could make out as he slowly distanced himself from Manco, desperate to find Saber in the mess. Barrett was the one that posed a threat, but even he was worried about Grendel&#39;s Mother. She was a beast, but he had the feeling that Archer was not a mere king. She might be in danger if he didn&#39;t get a handle on where she might be.

&quot;Saber...Saber!&quot; He calls, swimming through steam and doing his best to stay out of any crossfire. He found a lump of shade in the covering, and the twisted and mangled maw of the Matriarch overtaking her prey.

Coming to the conclusion that his sword would not be helpful in dealing with her, Mehmed instead summoned 3 if his cannons yet again, aiming right at the creature and blasting on at its back. &quot;Sure you beast! Let&#39;s make it a challenge then! Who will have up before? Will I succumb to your claws or you to the barrage of hellfire I can create?&quot; As long as Grendel&#39; Mother was right on him, it would be easy to dish out punishment like that after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still while he didn&#39;t care for all the chaos his options had become quite limited now. The fog made it hard for him to aim and while he could shorten the distance between him and the other two servants he didn&#39;t had enough confidence on his hand to hand combat to risk it. 

Another option would be to just blast his way without caring about friend or foe but that was not even an option for this old king. Truly while his master was smart and it was quite the ingenious way to keep himself out of danger it truly make things harder for him. His master wasn&#39;t the only one, Simon yells were enough to tell him where he was. I was then when he though about it, sound was another way to tell where the enemy was, he would still need to get closer but it was better than walking aimlessly. He would follow the boy voice as flames came from around his body. 

&quot;Inti&quot; he would say as the heat of the golden flames began to make the fog dissipate a bit. 

&quot;Don&#39;t go running on your own kid&quot; he said with a strict tone as he would reach for Simon and stop him before he were to get too close to the two servants fighting. Part of him wonder why was the kid so worried about it servant.  Was his servant the type which didn&#39;t do so well in close combat? Something to ask Simon later.  

His eyes widen as he how how Mehmed was being attacked by a monster. The sight which would normally scare other make the king chuckle as he prepare his actions.

&quot;Having trouble already brat?&quot; he said as the flames around him grew hotter dispelling the fog a bit more. He taunted unsure he was even needed as Grendel&#39;s mother seemed to have everything under control at least till Mehmed summoned more of his cannons.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had no way of stopping Mehmed from retaliating against Saber he just hope she was as tough as she looked. 

Instead of rushing right away he would drop a golden rod into the ground. The distance was more than enough and a golden circle would appear around him as he set up his territory. Everyone present would feel a new surge of magical energy as the old monarch focused. 

&quot;Pacha Mama&quot;

As the name of the mother earth was spoken rock hands would sprout from the ground and move towards Mehmed&#39;s cannons. Caster doubt to be able to crush them so he just focused on moving them, shifting their position so that even if fired they wouldn&#39;t hit Saber. Although, due to the time he had needed to set it up not even himself was sure how many times had those cannons already being fired already.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He immediately casted a small knockback oriented explosion, causing one of the grenades to fly high up into the air.

Then he grabbed the other grenade and jumped out of the water with the help of another explosion under himself before desperately throwing the grenade back at Barrett over the cloud of fog. And the proximity of Simon&#39;s voice let Mikail know the kid was no longer near the enemy mercenary, making him be sure that this action was safe to do. 

But due to how little time he had to do this, instead of completely reaching Barrett, it exploded in the air close to his enemy. While this wasn&#39;t as dangerous to the sharpshooter as it could have been, it also created a small smokescreen right in front of him, making it almost impossible to see anyone approaching. And as this happened, the other grenade high up in the air exploded at the same time, adding even more noise and chaos to this battle.

After that he casted potential energy reinforcement onto himself, jumped into one of the the still not dissipated parts of the fog cloud feet-forward before casting an explosion from the upper part of his back upon landing, resulting in him sliding on the ground at superhuman speed. 

Just as the smoke from the grenade cleared, Barrett could see Mikail right in front of him, that is if he was looking at the ground. Mikail proceeded to suddenly get up with the help of a small explosion, push away Barrett&#39;s rifle with one hand and attempt to land a powerful punch with the other.

&quot;Good tactics, Alexandrian mercenary! You would&#39;ve killed me right now if i wasn&#39;t a proper fighter!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Which angle are you going to hit me from?&quot; Barrett speculated. &quot;Above?...or maybe from belo-&quot;

At that instant, Mikhail had closed the distance and lashed out against Barrett.

<strong>CLANG!</strong>

Barrett&#39;s metallic had arm swung out and deflected the devastating blow of Mikhail. A slight grin on Barrett&#39;s face. This opponent was no mere street gangster and wouldn&#39;t go down so easily.

&quot;Same to you Republican Gun-for-Hire!&quot; Barrett shouted as he rammed his forehead into Mikail&#39;s gasmask.

Barrett rapidly followed up the blow by taking a quickstep back, raising his rifle, and taking a quick shot to Mikail&#39;s center mass with speed that would put an trained marksman to shame.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The strike was deflected, however a small dent appeared on the mechanical arm upon impact. 

Then Mikail attempted to quickly go for another punch using the momentum he got from having his attack deflected, but instead he had to quickly redirect it to block Barrett&#39;s headbutt. After that he tried to hit the sharpshooter in the gut with his knee, but Barrett evaded it just in time by taking a step back.

&quot;Oh shit.&quot; The masked mercenary was then threatened by the possibility of a rifle round shooting him in the chest, however his other arm was still there, in position to push away the gun once again. With the help of potential energy reinforcement, he reached the barrel of the rifle just in time to redirect it, managing to turn a likely death into a minor grazing wound on his side. 

&quot;You&#39;ve been in a lot of fights before. I can tell. So why did you get into such a pointless fight? I don&#39;t think that white haired boy did anything wrong.&quot;

Even though normally holding the barrel of a gun that fired just a second ago would be way too hot to touch, Mikail&#39;s hands were already burned from frequently casting explosions to the point of lacking nerve endings to feel anything. 

So he took a step forward and pulled at the rifle as hard as he could in an attempt to yank it away from the enemy mercenary. And because of Mikail&#39;s reinforcement, it would be a big challenge for Barrett to keep holding the gun, as it was the equivalent of trying to catch a shark with a fishing rod.

At the same time as one of his hands was in the process of removing the rifle, the other hand moved back out of its defensive position and reached out towards Barrett&#39;s chin in an attempt to land an uppercut.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The barrel of Barrett&#39;s rifle suddenly disconnected from the main body. Barrett took the opportunity to pull back from Mikail&#39;s uppercut. Quickly Barrett put a short distance between the two as he slammed a shorter barrel in place of the missing one on his rifle. He then briefly put a hand to his chin, his goatee and mustache visibly ruffled by Mikail&#39;s barely whiffed blow.

As Mikail&#39;s potential energy reinforcement ended, the barrel of the rifle suddenly disconnected. 

&quot;Nice rifle by the way. As a gunsmith, i appreciate that.&quot;

He proceeded to use the barrel as a melee weapon and swung it twice at Barret, first at the jaw and then at the kneecaps. It seems Mikail was already the aiming to beat up his opponent by using the rifle like a club, so the sharpshooter&#39;s maneuver didn&#39;t change the plan of action.

Shortly after that he proceeded to quickdraw the Abaas pistol with the other hand while speeding up his arm with several tiny explosions, making it almost inhumanly fast. Barret may be a better shot, but Mikail is faster.

Then he immediately fired it at the enemy mercenary in full auto, not bothering to properly aim and just relying on his proximity and speed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Seeing how the fight continue between Simon Saber and Mehmed if the fight were to escalate he was the only one who could stop them. To honest seeing how she was no letting Archer go even when threatened with cannons he has some doubts he could stop them but it was better than doing nothing. 

&quot;Kid, if I give you a chance can you call off your servant and run away.&quot; he said as he didn&#39;t stop staring at Saber and Archer. Mikail had told him to keep Simon safe, while the tournament was none of his concern having this kid life in his conscience was. Then again none of that meant anything if Simon and Saber were willing to fight this to the end. 

&quot;I have a way to contain him and to help you get away from here.&quot; he looked at Simon with a serious face as he began to focus his mana. &quot;But its your choice kid&quot; 

He began to form two more rock hands in case Saber were not in a listening mood and even if she were he needed more hands to deal with Mehmed cannons.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Thanks, I worked hard designing it.”

A surge of mana shot through Barrett’s body as he moved not away from Mikail, but straight towards him with super human speed.

<em>BANG</em>

A shot rang out and Mikail felt the barrel in his hands suddenly break apart.

With the two moving towards each other at faster than human speeds, Mikail was only able to get a few shots off before Barrett passed by him completely. Barrett came to a stop a good distance away before stumbling a bit. His metal arm had taken some hits and a few stray grazes tore holes in the side of his coat. However only one bullet had managed to find its mark in Barrett’s side.

“Ugh, I’m getting too old for this shit.” He complained before dropping a familiar looking pistol slide to the ground.”

Looking down Mikail realized that his pistol was now missing a slide. Barrett turned back to look at Mikail for a brief tense moment before shrugging.

“Alright, let’s call this a draw.” Barrett casually suggested. “Neither of us are going to get much out of this anymore and we fellow Mercs know when to balance risk with reward.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that it matters, I can deal with the two of you!&quot; And with that Mehmed pulled out his Kilij from the sheath, now that he was once again able to move his arm. 

&quot;You! You are a king, aren&#39;t you? I can sense it, so don&#39;t try to deny it! You shouldn&#39;t have come here! You coming here is going to give me the edge to smite you both to smithereens, you bloody oaf!&quot; 

And with that Mehmed would start his counterattack. He&#39;d first attempt to stab Grendel&#39;s mother with his sword right in the neck, hoping she&#39;d either let him go thanks to the pain or at least cause some long-lasting damage. At the same time he would manifest two of his dardannelles, one aiming at Grendel mother&#39;s back and the other right next at Manco Capaq! He would need more than just a couple of hands to incapitate a cannon of this caliber. 

&quot;This might be suicidal, but I trust you&#39;re more than sturdy enough, you damn fish. Now face the cannons that tore down the roman walls! And if you can still stand afterwards,you will at least have earned my respect.&quot; And with that both cannons started charging, ready to shoot their blast. For safety reasons (Mehmed and Barrett)  the explosion that would follow would be a lot smaller than usual, however that meant that the attack would also be more concentrated on a smaller scale. Meaning one shouldn&#39;t get hit directly or else they were in a world of pain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was rather simple, for Manco other recognizing he was a king was something  so obvious he didn&#39;t care much about Mehmed words. A dangerous mix of arrogance and confidence. Yet even when ignoring his word Manco didn&#39;t ignored Mehmed actions. As he saw him summond more of those deadly cannons he called up water, creating a small dome around him and Simon. 

&quot;Cocha&quot; 

Just as with his fight with Rider the water dome around him began to spin at incredible speed. While in Mehmed eyes his actions were foolish for Manco there was no other option than taking the strike head on. 

Inside that circle his magecraft became something capable of even harming the knight classes. So for him victory was mostly dependent of staying in his territory. The moment he stopped thinking that way, the moment he began thinking of hidding or dodging he may as well be dead. That was the dangerous balance between his arrogance and mentality. While arrogant he understood his abilities better than anyone. 

He left Saber on her own, he was already keeping her master safe and had already helped her doing more would not be in character for him. 

The cannon ball would touch the dome but just it would be slowed and absorbed into the spin slowly changing its trajectory. Normally Manco would not care where he send it but with his master still fighting sending it on a random direction was dangerous. The spin of the dome changed slightly slowing down before speeding up again. Slowly moving the cannon ball up into the dome before sending it up into the sky
 
&quot;Well is that all you got brat?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With her hand still gripped into Mehmed, Saber swung his body. Tossing him like a rag doll, right into the path of his own cannon aimed at the woman. “Fall to your own foolishness, Pitiful thing.” Saber growled. 

This placed her in a way to see Simon. Safe, for now but he needed to be out of this area. “The boy, give him to me.” She yelled to Manco. Ready to run when she saw the sign too.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead, the cannon started to move a little bit, redirection his aim instead. He felt a bit more relaxed, now that he had some more distance between his foes again. He believed in his close quarter skills, but he was still a archer first and foremost. 

&quot;Now these are some pretty arrogant words for a king that&#39;s hiding behind a wall of meat and a wall of water. It must be pretty easy to act so smug when you can hide behind a bunch of walls like that. But no matter. I can tear down any wall.&quot; 

The cannon was now aiming right at Manco. Or rather, just shortly below below Manco. It seemed like instead of attacking directly, Mehmed was going to blow the spot in front of him up, sending rubble and pressure towards the Inca king. And not only that, the cannon was charging a lot longer than the first one. The blast was definitely going to be a lot bigger than before. Mehmed didn&#39;t have to hit them directly to cause some serious damage this time. Hopefully disrupting the water dome like that would work. 

&quot;You, wench. I will need to pay you back as well for how you treated me. You savage thing!

At the very least, both mercenaries put themselves at a stand still, but who knows if the same was for Simon. Barrett seemed like the kind of character that would not let up, so it was for the best to make themselves scarce...

Their Servant, Archer, was not the same. Simon stared down the eye of the barrel, his own fear being swallowed as he simply raised his hands. But the typical shimmer of air didn&#39;t wrap around Simon, or Manco...in fact, nothing happened at all. Had the boy simply lost his mind? Given up hope? 

No. 

A whistling sound was heard, a air being shoved aside as a shadow formed over Mehmed. The cannon ball. The one Manco had redirected into the air. Just what did the boy do? How did he do it? A simple tap from Barrett had brought him to his knees, and yet he was able to bring a cannonball back onto his head? The shadow was getting larger, threatening to crater the king. The boy had some spunk, willing to play a proverbial game of chicken as he stared back at Archer fiercely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While those were his words for Manco the status of a king and being worthy of being a king were two different things. Even if he were to know that Mehmed was a king he wouldn&#39;t stop calling him a brat, Reynard calling himself a king but Manco didn&#39;t recognize him as one either yet in his eyes Hannibal could easily be a king and honestly to him it didn&#39;t matter she wasn&#39;t cause she saw what a king must be in her. It was a logic that even if were to try and explain it no one would truly understand besides himself. It was a way of thinking forged through the many people and experiences he had lived. 

The situation has changed to his favor, with Saber and Mehmed now apart he had more room to use different strategies without having to worry with hurting others. He stared back at Saber after her request,

&quot;Don&#39;t order me around...&quot; He started, ready to tell her off but then he saw how Mehmed prepare himself to unleash a barrage towards them. &quot;...Tch.&quot; As he though what to do as he was unsure in how to stop all those attacks and keep Simon safe in was then when he saw the cannonball falling over Mehmed. 

His eyes widen as he let out a laugh and make the dome around them disappear. He was gonna do another of his gambles, only question was if he was gonna make it on time. 

&quot;You are amusing kid, there is no way I can let ya die here&quot; the monarch said with a smile as he a rock hand grabbed Simon and throw him into the air. 

&quot;Inti!!&quot; he yelled as he unleashed a Fire ball into the falling cannonball.

It wasn’t meant to stop him, it was just meant to distract him even if only for a few seconds. 

The red condor flew at great speed and grabbed Simon into the air and flew away from the area. Its crimson feathers turned golden as he sped up, making it easier for both Mehmed and Saber to see where he was. 

Another distraction for Mehmed, probably wouldn’t work on Saber as she would probably follow and maybe kill his familiar but that was something he will have her answer for later. He needed her away from Mehmed to unleash the final part of his plan.

<em>Follow the path of the Mother, she will guide you
Her arms are the roads and her tears the rivers.
You will lose, You will despair
And more than once you will doubt the reward.
Yet despite all that, one must still aim to reach it
That which waits you at the end
The city of the gods will descend
Fate would no longer bind you
You will be the one who shall give them a new beginning</em>

As Mehmed cannons fired Manco unleashed his final triumph card, a golden light engulfed both him and Mehmed and if Simon were to turn around he would see them disappear in a flash. Mehmed would find himself inside a city made of rock and gold, it was majestic. The young king would witness the glory of a city that no longer existed in this world and at the top of the highest building Manco stood proud with an arrogant grin on his face, looking down on everyone who was now inside of his domain. The city itself was divided in levels with Manco being at the very top while Mehmed was at the very bottom.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1053178598728667186 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1053178598728667186><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Dec-22 03:15 PM">15:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yet this didn’t stop the cannonballs they moved through destroying the many buildings that were in between the two kings. How many buildings did the Mehmed attack destroy, 1? 5? Manco stared at with an angry expression. 

“You&#39;re gonna pay for those 20 buildings you destroyed.” he said as he walked forward. Mehmed would be able to Manco was not alone, figure were near him. This city was his greatest achievement after all. 

“You think you can break my city? Well feel free to try, no matter how many walls you bring down our will won&#39;t be shattered so easily. Why? Because I am here.”

At that moment Mehmed would be able to hear the chants of the figures, and they would keep chanting Manco’s title. 

<em>Inca! Inca! Inca!</em>

It was something he as a kind could understand, Manco right now was not alone. In this city the will of his subjects and the history of its culture reside.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wanted to pay Saber back for damaging his sword and causing his injury, but this self-declared king actually managed to get even more into his nerves. 

&quot;You do not have to explain to me what a king is and isn&#39;t! Do you think I have not lived my life as such? Why would I stand here if I was not the great emperor I was in life? Do not insult me like that, bastard! I&#39;ll have you quartered and dragged along the four corners of this city.&quot; And with that, Mehmed was hit with Manco&#39;s reality marble. 

Before him stood a city, as majestic and golden as the sun.The intimidating aura of the city was imposing, however shortly after the appearance his initial attack that was deflected by Simon and shattered by the Inca king destroyed this picturesque scenery.  

Mehmed simply chuckled when he saw that. This did eventually turn out to be a fun match at the very end. &quot;I must admit, this is a beautiful city, Inca King. But it still is nothing but just a golden spectacle to the capital of the world, my Konstantiniyye! But no matter. I will defeat you and show my strength to that golden city of yours.&quot; 

And with that he remanifested all his cannons, his 6 smaller sized ones and the two dardannelles, aiming at Manco and his army. &quot;I brought down several kings to their kings and conquered their lands. What&#39;s one more?&quot; And with that Mehmed shot his load.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead however, he found his pistol lacking a slide as his opponent moved past him and stumbled after getting shot in the side.

Still expecting danger from Barrett, he dropped the pieces of the gun barrel he intended to use as a melee weapon and pulled out the Uluu Toion pistol, pointing it at the sharpshooter&#39;s head. But as Barret talked, Mikail lowered the gun in a relaxed manner.

&quot;You don&#39;t seem to be lying. Sure, we can call this a draw.&quot; He then holstered his big shotgun-pistol, approached the pistol slide on the ground and threw it up into the air with his foot before catching it and reattaching it to the Abaas pistol.

&quot;I&#39;ll let you know that if you wanted to do a fake draw and backstab me, you would&#39;ve died here. That big pistol i have automatically shoots when someone is lying in front of it. Pretty nifty, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Then Mikail also holstered his automatic pistol, showing his trust.

&quot;Since words didn&#39;t work, you should&#39;ve just walked away. Republic are pragmatic guys, they would&#39;ve just replaced that boy with someone more dangerous if you incapacitated him and his servant for long enough. Doing that would actually give a disadvantage to Alexandria.&quot;

After that he would turn around to see Simon and his servant making sure they&#39;re alright and looked back at Barrett.

&quot;You&#39;re probably asking yourself why didn&#39;t i let you do that if i&#39;m on Republic&#39;s side. Let me tell you, i&#39;m not really on any side at this point. I just didn&#39;t want that white haired kid to get hurt-&quot;

Suddenly Mikail realized that something was off and did a double take. Mehmed and Manco were gone.

&quot;Oh fuck, i think our servants are currently fighting in a reality marble. If Manco dies after this, i&#39;m going to kill you several times over. You&#39;re the one who started this unnecessary battle after all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Honestly even if he had been wondering about it for hours he really wouldn&#39;t had it coming. Then again, to be fair Manco knew little to nothing about Mehmed so honestly his perception may be wrong but right now he didn&#39;t felt like it was 

&quot;Disappointing...&quot; was all he could say. &quot;If you were truly a king you would know that isn&#39;t something you should boast about.&quot;

It was hard to tell for Manco the era Mehmed was from, was he an older king than him? Was he younger? Well he didn&#39;t care much about his opponents identity, but he was curious about his opinion if only a bit. Not because he saw him making a nuance of sense nor because there was a fair point somewhere. at least not in his eyes, but due to the sheer immaturity he seemed to exude with his words and actions. 

&quot;Was all you did for your own glory then? Tell me how much did it cost to shatter those walls, how many of your subjects were lost in order to make those kings bend their knees in front of you.&quot; That was unusual for him, was this anger? For him who had fought nail and tooth to create a place for his people to be able to live, for him who had put down many enemies for the sake of giving his city a better future; yes he found his words annoying to say the least. 

130 buildings remained, in a flash 30 more disappeared crumbled into rubble before transforming themselves into 2 gigantic hands, each standing as tall as a house. They moved fast aiming to smash Mehmed into paste.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mehmed would watch a couple of the buildings disappear, crumbling and falling down and turning into gigantic stone hands.  His initial barrage managed to scrape a couple of the buildings down, but it was still more enough to cause some serious damage. Well, he&#39;d just do it once more. 

Mehmed did not move an inch, instead opting for his cannons to blast the hands asunder once more. &quot;A lot of kings were written down in history for leading a life of peace.

Wanting your land to grow is part of a king responsibilities. But really you don&#39;t know anything do you??&quot;

Manco could tell from how he acted and spoke. Mehmed had experience taking the role of a king and for a bit Manco&#39;s opinion of him improved.  But they were fundamentally different as one was a king who started everything from nothing while the other was one whose work was to keep the kingdom going so their values and mentality would never be able to reach a common ground. 

The massive hands continue to advance, they were slowly obliterated by Mehmed cannons with ease. Yet that much was okay,  Manco had one last way to finish this.

&quot;You know this city wasn&#39;t as big when I created. It current look is something I never witness by myself, so why is it that appears this way when I call for it...&quot;

Most of the remaining buildings dissappear. And for a moment Manco stood into a desolate land. 

&quot;...is because it evolved past my time. Peace or war at the end are only paths, the destination for any king is to leave something for the future so they can improve of it even more. Expand; lament the losses and mourn them and respect their sacrifices and use them as stepping stones to create something even better.!&quot;

The buildings reformed in the sky as a barrage of meteors which fallen over Mehmed. With this Manco had used almost of his buildings this was his final attack. A golden meteor shower.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Before the boy could continue with his own scolding, he was cut off as a red condor gripped his shoulders tight between its fierce but gentle talons. They soared into the sky, higher and higher, with the boy not taking the gift of flight nearly as gracefully as he could have...

&quot;SABER! SABER SABER SABER SABER HELP! HELP ITS TAKING ME AWAY, WHERES IT TAKING ME, WHERE-&quot;

I would have loved nothing more than showing you the strength of the cannons that could destroy even the walls of babylon... But I must admit, this attack does have something beautiful to it.

Manco stared back at the other king, quite surprised he had survived his final attack. The question remained what to do now?  He had spent a lot of energy already, he could still fight but he was unsure if he could win. Mehmed cannons had not came out unscathed, the mark of the many rocks were quite visible it was hard to imagine them being able to fire. 

For better or worse they had reach an stalemate, he took a moment to look around the other pair they had helped was already gone. He had fulfilled Mikail order although he was sure his master may have some complains about the way he used. 

&quot;Well I got bored, lets pick this up some other time brat.&quot; he said as he turned around and began to walk away.  &quot;I&#39;m not in the mood of dying trying to end you.&quot; Yes that was the conclusion Manco had arrived, if they continue probably either or both of them would disappear. But while part of Manco was okay with that another was not, he wanted to see more before dying for a second time. 

Both sides retreated, their fight was over as the reason of fighting was already long gone. The masters explained the situation to their servants and each went their own way. 

Simon would be fly away for while, a new experience and a new fear would leave its mark on the boy before Saber finally catch up to them. The familiar would fly lower before letting the young boy on the ground before disappearing. The chaos had ended but only for now, and just as easy it could start all over again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
