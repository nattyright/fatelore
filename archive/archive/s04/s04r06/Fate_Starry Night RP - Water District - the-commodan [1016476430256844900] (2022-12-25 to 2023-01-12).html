It was finally here. The moment that he had been dreading since he arrived, and had been preparing for the past few days. The announcement had come out, that the last match had been decided as a Republic victory. Nikolai and Zahak had taken the win, the irony itself not lost on the boy. He was now here to finish what he and the other Republic Masters had started. Alexander&#39;s last fight had ended in failure, but the boy couldn&#39;t blame him for it. After all, too many factors were at play to ensure victory. Even if he had Saber by his side...

&quot;Saber,&quot; Simon says, patiently sitting in the small waiting room, back straight and hands folded comfortably in his lap. The air was stale as they waited for the throngs of Alexandrian citizens to settle in place in the stadium, leaving the boy to listen to the jeers as they leak through the cement walls. <em>Tear em a new one! This city is ours! Hold up our honor!</em>

&quot;They&#39;re ready for me to lose,&quot; he said simply, quivering as each roar and the slightest hint of microphone feedback cause him to wince. No one prior had died, but it wasn&#39;t really his life he was concerned with. No...this was it. After this, he would return home, and no matter what, explain the journey he went on to his father. He thought that he was prepared to face him, but now that the moment was a fight away...he started to wonder if he could. 

&quot;Saber, after all this time...I have to ask why you didn&#39;t leave me. Why are you still here? You hate me, don&#39;t you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This battlefield was meant to be one she stood upon. It was her purpose in this pitiful war of men. Whether as Grendel’s Mother, or Gabia. Saber was simply a pawn, just as Simon was. 

The boy. Had grown. Even her apathy had melted towards him. 

The small space was uncomfortable. Saber barely being able to sit comfortably within the confines of the waiting room. Staring towards her master, not an uncomfortable silence like they were used too. 

Simon spoke breaking it. “I thought about it. Initially.” Grendel’s Mother spoke. Her eyes meeting his. “But, hate. Is not the word I would use.” 

“Child there is potential within you. Your being tethered to your father holds you back.” Saber then bent down. Coming face to face with the boy. “Just as my own son was weakened by his bond to me. So are you.” Her finger then poked his heart, before retracting. “You have the potential, my one true spawn had.” A smile almost broke on her face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It did nothing to boost the morale of Rider. No. All it did was remind her of the venom the City had. 

Her singular eye locked its gaze with the ceiling while she laid on her back upon one of the benches in the waiting room. Her hands were behind her head providing a bit of cushioning for herself as she had one leg over. Over the weeks she spent on Alexandria, she found it increasingly difficult to care about the City. The mistreatment of their own contestants was something she would never forgive. They found more respect from their opponents than they did the people they were fighting for. Except for Benji. Benji was cool in Rider&#39;s books. He got a pass.

Hell, if she had a choice, she was tempted to throw this match for a little revenge for Thomas and Lewis! The thought made her snicker a little. Man, that would be quite the stunt to pull!

But alas, that could only ever be a thought in her mind. There was no way Rider could do that. Not because of her honour, nor her respect towards the opposition, but due to the promise she made towards a special someone...

&quot;Hey.&quot; Rider broke her gaze with the ceiling to turn her head towards her Master. &quot;Are you ready for this, Amelia? Whoever stands before us next will be the last obstacle in our path.&quot; She left her spot and made her way towards Amelia. &quot;We can&#39;t hold anything back against them. Not because of Alexandria, or the importance of this match, but for your siblings. They&#39;re counting on us after all. They just don&#39;t know it yet!&quot; The grin that Rider showed off gleamed with confidence. It took her awhile but, thanks to Amelia, she found her spark once more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1057132960354152458 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1057132960354152458><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Dec-22 01:08 PM">13:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She could feel it under her feet more so than hearing it. Alexandrians, Republicans, it was impossible to tell the difference from here. She cared not for them, listening instead to the draft that came through with the air conditioning. A tamed wind biding its chance to bounce around the halls and eventually break free into the open skies. Not too much different from her. 

If she focused her senses on the draft long enough, she could taste the rich, promising aroma of baking bread. A vendor no doubt but still it was better this than the worries that clipped her wings on her first fight. She took a few long draughts of that precious scent, nodded her head and began furiously cramming every type of seed and trinket she could into that heavy coat of hers.

Mikhail for all his oddities was right, she had been tying herself down to Surus and let herself get put into a corner she very nearly never left. Already the ideas were swirling around like a storm in her head for how she could mix things up. This was the fight that mattered after all and she&#39;d need to bring everything for this.

Amelia&#39;s head snapped up at Rider&#39;s call.

&quot;Oh just about as ready as I&#39;ll ever be now. A little heavier than before but I&#39;ve got a little something for everything they could throw at us,&quot; She matched Hannibal&#39;s confidence with a fae-like devilish grin as she shook her coat.
&quot;And you&#39;re absolutely right. This fight isn&#39;t for the city but for us to win. I&#39;ll give my family something to look towards with this show!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1057313645383667802 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1057313645383667802><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Dec-22 01:06 AM">01:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had found the same within him, no longer fearing the next words out of her maw. There was a comfort instead at hearing what wisdom she had to share. 

&quot;...I only have that potential because of you, Saber.&quot; He continued. Why did it sound like she was telling him something...as if she was trying to leave something for him to remember. &quot;My father...I thought I would always be beholden to him and his desires...but I have my own. I have people I can look back to, that I can cherish...and that&#39;s thanks to you, Saber. I always needed you. And...and I need you now. More than ever.&quot;

In that brief moment of warmth something clicked.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1057887439009632407 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1057887439009632407><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Dec-22 03:07 PM">15:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDVZW-m6a-o&amp;list=PLAs1Kha_R9dLkWgTjRNXxCJC4YvVycF33&amp;index=25">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDVZW-m6a-o&amp;list=PLAs1Kha_R9dLkWgTjRNXxCJC4YvVycF33&amp;index=25</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JBLsqZeZBW3pNlB9St3_g><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Video Games Music</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDVZW-m6a-o"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Midna&#39;s Theme - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDVZW-m6a-o width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1057887512124727406 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1057887512124727406><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Dec-22 03:07 PM">15:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Something revealed itself to Simon. A vision of a past. Ancient beyond comprehension. 

A woman, ethereal in her beauty stood staring towards the ocean. Tall, imposing. Skin a much fairer shade of slate than what it would become. Within her arms, gently rested a blade. Silver and gleaming in the seaside sunset. “Child.” A smile was upon her face. 

Then time seemed to accelerate. The woman’s form deteriorated from her godly beauty. Into one more familiar, more monstrous. “You have shown that there is a chance to regrow what was lost.” 

She then moved forwards and an embrace was given. A series of numbers and letters imprinted themselves onto Simon’s memory. 

“A gift. For if we part ways.” 

<em>SBSC060177</em>

Reality came back into focus. The curtain call was soon. Grendel’s Mother stared towards her master. Simon and her were finally equals it felt like. “Let us meet our foes head on.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were doubts in her mind but now she can&#39;t help but feel foolish for even humouring the thought. 

&quot;That&#39;s what I like to hear!&quot; Rider gave her a pat on her shoulder. Perhaps a bit <em>too</em> hard given her whole hollow bones situation and all. &quot;Got to be prepared for whatever they plan to throw at us. Who knows what kind of tricks they might pull on us in order to try and secure that last win.&quot;

<em><strong>&quot;THE FINAL ROUND OF THIS GRAIL WAR IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE!&quot;</strong></em>

&quot;I suppose we better get going, huh?&quot; There was a hint of hesitation in Rider&#39;s movements. There were still plenty of things that needed to be said between them. If only they had the time. Well, if she had to choose...

&quot;Hey, before we go out there,&quot; Rider placed both of her hands on either shoulders of her Master locked her gaze with hers once again. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare go and do anything foolish out there again, you hear me? I made a promise to save your siblings and I&#39;ll be damned if you make me see it through alone.&quot; 

A hand was lifted off of her shoulder so they could lift up her helmet slightly. This made way to allow Rider to plant a gentle kiss upon the forehead of her Master before planting her own forehead against the same spot. &quot;I never felt the pain of losing a sister before, don&#39;t make me find out how that feels today.&quot; As if to lighten the mood, Rider gave her a smirk before materializing her sword into her hand, with her broken spear in the other hand. The path was open for them to take their spot on centre stage.

&quot;We can&#39;t keep them waiting forever now. So, shall we, <em>Master</em>?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1058037239478763541 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1058037239478763541><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Dec-22 01:02 AM">01:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Mhmm-hmm, there&#39;ll be no repeat of last time. As long as we keep running around, its gonna be awfully hard to beat us! And especially with the tricks I have in mind, they won&#39;t know what to expect either,&quot; She shook her jacket again for emphasis before glancing down at her left hand.

The lack of battles outside the tourney had given them an advantage they rarely thought about beforehand, but Amelia knew it was their hidden trump card. Supposedly Republic frames were stronger but two good bursts from the command spells at the right time could be the key to victory.

The announcer called out and Amelia turned to leave, giving a moment to pause in case Hannibal had something to say before being dragged along by her master and she was glad she waited this time. 

She felt absolutely bathed in Hannibal&#39;s warmth, a tenderness she hardly felt this strongly before. It reminded her a great deal of the brief quiet moments of love she had with her siblings in Lemuria. They didn&#39;t need to say much back then, the closeness was enough to convey the message. They&#39;d always be there for each other, despite whatever happened next. That was what family was for after all, a source of strength in its own way. 

Amelia blushed as Hannibal kissed her forehead and responded by pulling her closer into an embrace, taking in her warmth and scent, committing it to memory just in case. 
&quot;You know I can&#39;t quite promise you that, Hannibal. But for you... I can make sure the risks I do take are ones with the least chance of me not being there at the end. It&#39;s going to be chaotic out there no matter what, so the least we can do is enjoy it and make the best of it by going out there and taking it for ourselves together.&quot;

She patted Hannibal&#39;s own sturdy shoulders and nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m ready, Sis. Let&#39;s give them a storm to remember.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sight that met Rider and Amelia was the sight of greenery this time around. Tall, faux, trees were scattered around the arena with towering rocky spires to give the illusion of a mountainous region. Magecraft even allowed for a slight mist to linger close to the ground. A certain monstrous Saber might even feel strangely right at home here. Was this the Republic&#39;s way of pulling strings in their favour again? They even had a small stream flowing through the middle. Truly, they went all out on making this final match as much of a spectacle as they could.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1058083944546975807 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1058083944546975807><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Dec-22 04:07 AM">04:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...We&#39;ll get through this, Saber. So don&#39;t say goodbye yet.&quot;

The walk through the stadium entrance was a long one, not at all helped by the loud droning that swelled with the arrival of their opponents. The greenery greeted them at the end of the tunnel, Simon himself being stunned at the sheer size and lushness of the mountainous region. To think all of this was hiding inside a mere stature of stonework. Though that wasn&#39;t nearly as shocking as the announcement of their opponents. 

&quot;Amelia...i...I have to fight Amelia...?&quot; 

Simon turns to Gabia, searching her face for a sign of amnesty or some form of friendly rivalry. He and Rider team left on better terms than Saber after all...

Quickly, Simon pulled a Jewel from his pocket, holding it tight as he searches rhe thick underbrush. Rider team so far was hidden, but he knew her magecraft would make that a short order. He had to start planning now...

&quot;Saber, the stream...if I&#39;m near water, I can be of more help to you. Rider has lightning on her side, but if I get to that stream, I have a chance against Amelia. I don&#39;t think they know what I can do yet. We&#39;ll use that to our advantage...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, that was rude. Not unwarranted though. The announcement might have shaken the boy to his core prior...but with Saber by his side, he was fine with being labeled non-human. Even monster was fine by him.

All they had to do was wait and see who and where they&#39;d be fighting. And as the gate halted, it opened up onto a truly ancient landscape of granite crags and burly pines encased in a creeping mist. No doubt about it, this was the setting of a horror novel of the old world. 

Height would be key to this fight and the landforms lended themselves well to someone with an athletic build. Amelia couldn&#39;t help but grin as she ran through a few stretches, already hearing the wind that would soon whistle past her at dizzying speed. 

Then she heard who they were to fight and her smile grew wider.

&quot; Ooh, Hannibal! Its my friend from the barn, I hope he&#39;s grown a bit braver since our last run in. I want him to make good on that promise we made if we ever fought. What do you think, eh, Hannibal?&quot; She moved back towards Rider to aggresively nudge her servant in the ribs. 

&quot;Think you still remember all of Saber&#39;s tricks and how not to get stuck in my tornado?&quot;  At that, Spriggy crawled out from Amelia&#39;s helmet and tugged on her ear. &quot;Ooh ooh, I get it, little guy! Battle is important, I know, but we gotta get our strategy in order!

To Grendel&#39;s Mothers hands came a simple blade. &quot;You have grown, also. Show them that.&quot; Saber then began to step forwards. &quot;I&#39;ll draw the rider. Your support will be most appreciated, worst case. Distract the Fairy.&quot;

It felt as if they stepped into another world entirely. They even managed to get the smell down as well! She had to hand to them. They seriously knew how to pull out all the stops. Then she heard the names of their opponents.

A sense of relief came over her when she saw her Master&#39;s response to the news. She wasn&#39;t sure how she was going to react but at least her resolve remained strong. 

&quot;Yeah, he must&#39;ve found some courage if he made his way here.&quot; Rider did what she could to defend herself against the assault of her ribs from Amelia&#39;s aggressive nudge. &quot;We never saw what he could do beyond that barrier thing he made so be careful with him. He might be your friend but he&#39;s still our opponent. Don&#39;t let your guard down.&quot; Rider joined forces with Spriggy and pinched her cheek to make sure she listened to her words. She <em>was</em> the strategist between the two after all!

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about Saber. Surus and I got her. This time, I know what I&#39;m fighting for after all.&quot; She gave her cheek a rest before giving her a wink when she finished her sentence. There wasn&#39;t much time after that before Saber made herself known to them. &quot;Remember, keep your distance from me and Surus. I wouldn&#39;t want to clip your wings by accident.&quot; One more reassuring smile and pat on the shoulder was given as Rider made her stride towards Saber. 

&quot;OH, DON&#39;T WORRY, SABER! I DON&#39;T PLAN TO HOLD ANYTHING BACK THIS TIME AROUND!&quot; With her words spoken, a thunderous crash came down into the tree line. Dirt and smoke shrouded Rider as she approached a clearing to meet Saber upon. Her silhouette revealed that she wasn&#39;t alone as the monstrous elephant followed behind Rider with surges of lightning arcing between the two of them. &quot;YOU WON&#39;T SEE EITHER OF US HOLDING BACK AGAINST YOU!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1059227632526442571 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1059227632526442571><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Jan-23 07:52 AM">07:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She moreso, but at least he could use the waterfront to aid in his constructs. 

He found it moments later, just as the crowd broke into a surge of applause at the sight of both Rider and Saber, their attention more focused on the explosive confrontation than on the mere battle between two children. Simon approached the water, pulling out half of his jewels and dropping them in the water. It worked against Nikolai, maybe he could do the same thing here. He turned back to the sky, waiting for his own opponent.

Easy on the face you guys! I get it, I get it!&quot; Amelia squeaked, flinching under the two-pronged assault by her companions, pretending to swat them away though even with her discomfort, it was hard to hide a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll fly high, hit fast and circle about. Hopefully that tires him out before me.&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t get twisted by the winds in my wake either. Still, I&#39;ll keep an ear out for your crashing about. You gottem, Hannibal! See you soon!&quot; Amelia shot rider a thunmbs up while her other hand fiddled with the strap to her helmet before donning a pair of goggles. She knocked on the top of her helmet before speaking again. &quot;Hang tight Spriggy. We&#39;re about to take off!&quot;

One shake of her back was all it took for the wing pack to unfurl, rolling out to a wingspan easily double that of Amelia&#39;s own height. Another shake primed the canisters of enchanted air packed close and a simple yank of a cord saw her shoot off into the sky like a feathered rocket. The nearby high rocky outcropping was a good height to aim for on a first launch. 

Within seconds she surpassed that height, sampling an instant of weightlessness as she crested to a peak above the forest, the wind briefly stilled with only the crackle and boom of Rider&#39;s charge breaking the calm as the audience waited with anticipation for the match to really begin.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1059689582595166210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1059689582595166210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Jan-23 02:28 PM">14:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Just as quickly as she reached the height, she left it and plummeted, gaining speed as the forest canopy rushed back towards her. The wind howled with glee as it welcomed its prodigal daughter back to the thrills of flight. This was the excitement she missed from the last battle, now she was the one that could soar about unimpeded and start the battle on her terms. Speaking of which, she needed to find Simon. He was small, for sure, but with the features they shared, it would be easy to pick out that white down he called a hairstyle. 

Pulling up with only a second to spare, she opened her wings and shot forward across the forest, heading towards the center stream, only to spy that familiar shape of a boy. Was he more confident, more capable than before? How could she tell at this height, binocular vision was sadly not a trait she inherited from her unique conception. She&#39;d need to get closer, much closer to really tell. A tuck and roll was all it took to change her direction and turn herself into a guided missile locked onto his dimuniative frame.

&quot;Hey Simon! Didyamissme?&quot; She blurted out as loud and fast she could as she closed the distance in the blink of an eye, only to try and hit him in the eye with several seeds fired out of a bell-like plant. &quot;Showmewhatyougoooot!&quot; 

Her voice distorted as she flew back up above the canopy, leaving behind a few potato-sized-and-looking lawn darts to hurtle towards him. Amelia herself ended up perching ontop the tallest pine tree she could find and with the ancient forest the arena was emulating, the one she chose would really strain Simon&#39;s neck to crane up towards her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A graceful sweep and bow through the winds, Amelia glided through the air towards him. Her mesmerizing show of approach was only juxtaposed by the wild nature of her greeting, which was a mixture of yelling and...speech? Along with a slew of seeds that aimed to pluck the very sight that caught her from his eyes. A shimmer in the air sprung before the boy, the seeds caught at the lip of a concave surface that guided them towards the top, firing the seeds right back at her. His glare gave the impression that he planned that maneuver, but in truth, it was merely a last second attempt to capture Amelia off guard. Not quite instinct, but more a momentary grip of terror that spurred action. No longer could it lead to inaction, but rather, it sparked <strong>reaction.</strong>

Simon didn&#39;t even dare to talk back, instead holding his arm aloft and firing a puff of air after Amelia. The shot managed to scatter the seeds, possibly as a mere show of his new focus and force, as Simon fired several more in the air. Was he simply trying to use the slight invisible nature of his attacks to throw her off guard? He knelt down by the river, keeping his eyes traced on her. It seemed more than anything he was trying to keep an eye on what she would do, and not take any chances. 

<em>Amelia is my friend...I can accept that, but I also have to accept that if I want to make something of this life, that I have to fight. I have to try as hard as Saber does in every conflict we&#39;ve been apart of. I won&#39;t be the excuse to leave on a draw anymore. I&#39;m just as good as she is. Amelia told me as much, so I have to prove her right!</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She thought to herself that the first strafing run could have been better. Somehow Simon could anticipate her plan already and wasn&#39;t afraid to show off his trump card, one that could easily invalidate most of her offensive capabilites. Worse yet, he didn&#39;t even have the deceny to say hi, wave back or even shoot off some one liner. They were supposed to be friends! Who doesn&#39;t greet their friends?

Still the moment allowed her to realize the big dart-like tubers she threw were back up in the air and that Simon preferred the company of the nearby stream. Was his magecraft more water based than it was on wind? She really didn&#39;t know but there were sure ways to find out. Well ones that didn&#39;t involve her involuntarily losing her balance and falling out of that very tall perch of hers thanks to a rather rude gust of wind. 

Simon&#39;s attack worked at knocking off his friend&#39;s game. The only problem with that was now Amelia was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the rooty projectiles she first lobbed at him. It was calm for a moment, well besides the crackle of lightning and clash of blades in the distance. Only an odd, almost melodic wind whistled among the trees, flitting from his left to his right and back again. There was a precious moment for him to plan out his next move.

The thunder roared in again and with it came a sudden breeze. Branches swayed and leaves rustled, the wind whistling between them. Then several snaps could be heard as the tubers shot out from the treeline again, hurtling towards Simon at double their previous pace. From the other side flew a much larger projectile, one the size of a young woman, gaining speed herself as she hurtled along what seemed like a rapidly assembling rail line of vines.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060066898890473493 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060066898890473493><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Jan-23 03:27 PM">15:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;HeyagainSimon!

Of course, when he brought up his shield once more, he was met with a bit more than just seeds, as Amelia had come rushing once more to his side, accompanied by a flail of-holy crap what was that, that wasn&#39;t a plant! 

&quot;H-hey, tha-&quot; The words catch in the boy&#39;s mouth, his shield just barely ballooning outward to catch the brunt of the attack before shattering, sending Simon back and rolling across the field, stopping inches away from the stream. He struggles to his arms, the force easily having bruised his ribs and leaving him with a flaring braise on his forearms. Blood had started to drip from his nose in a thin stream, he carefully wiping it against his shirt before turning back to Amelia. This wasn&#39;t fair...she wasn&#39;t even taking this seriously! 

&quot;I&#39;m trying to focus! This is the last round you know, and I can&#39;t afford to get distracted! I have a lot at stake here too, Amelia! You could at least treat me like I&#39;m worth fighting!&quot; Simon shouts back, throwing down a jewel at his feet. A crackle of lightning presents an azure blade, one that spins lazily in place before firing off at Amelia, it&#39;s edge aiming for her shoulder. It seems Simon didn&#39;t notice the irony of not aiming to kill or maim at this point, though it seemed he was attempting to fight against whatever Amelia could potentially throw at him. While she didn&#39;t know the extent of his abilities, the same was true the other way around. He only had an idea of her magecraft, though already he was learning there was more to her than simply flying. He opened his palm to the dirt, holding his arm steady as a disc or air cut along the ground, throwing up a plume of dirt. He managed to trap the cloud in a pocket of air, creating a wall between him and Amelia. A physical smokescreen!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Both blades rung in the air until they clashed together. Rider&#39;s falcata was holding its own but the difference in strength between the two meant that the blade was slowly being lowered towards her shoulder. 

The panicked trumpets of Surus already had her in a difficult situation when the water froze over his legs. There wasn&#39;t any time for him to stomp his way out, nor was his trunk strong enough to shatter enough off. The beast was stuck.

&quot;Surus!&quot; The blade inched its way closer until it threatened to cleave through Rider&#39;s armour. One glance back was all she needed to see just how grounded Surus was without her. However, when she glared back at Saber, there was no hesitant nor fear in her eye like before. Only a blazing fury within.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you much more than that, Saber!&quot; Rider spat out her words before lightning formed around her legs and her spear-dagger. A quick swipe was made towards the wrist of Saber in hopes of loosening her grip enough. There was a chance that her spear would be made useless afterwards but she needed to take this chance. After that, her feet was placed upon Saber&#39;s midriff so she could use the speed boost from <strong>Mana Burst</strong> to use her as a platform to leap back towards Surus.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060081071716323401 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060081071716323401><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Jan-23 04:23 PM">16:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lightning met the rushing flow of Water. Monster and Hero face to face again. Saber bearing down further and further. Trumpets of that beast began to grow louder and more panicked. 

Yet the eyes of Hannibal. They were full of passion. Full of Wrath. Her fury was known, and being shown in full force. &quot;Excellent.&quot; Grendel&#39;s Mother spoke with a hint of passion to match that of Rider&#39;s. 

Lightning struck again as Rider bursted forwards. The spear cut at the Matriarch&#39;s wrist and blood was let loose. Burning away the tip of Rider&#39;s spear, but the gambit was successful in what Hannibal needed. The blade of Saber soon slipped, and soon enough the Rider was free. 

Grendel&#39;s Mother stood where she was. Arcs of electricity coursed off of her body. &#39;<em>Child. Allow me to grant you a gift.</em>&#39;. That simple blade remained upon the ground as Saber took another step forwards. A sharp increase in her Mana Signature was noticed. 

&quot;Slain. By the King of Geats. My one true child. Become as they were my trusted Master. O Horrid Grendel. Come Forth. Destroy these wretched pests before us.&quot; Something began to change in Simon&#39;s own physiology. Feeling more fluid. More free to allow him to shape and twist his being as how he saw fit. Hannibal and Amelia would notice Saber&#39;s form did not change and that release of mana from a Noble Phantasm seemed to dissipate. 

Another step forwards, and Saber&#39;s form began to grow monstrous. &#39;<em>The freedom is yours. Do what you wish with this gift.</em>&#39; Teeth grew into long fangs. Hands morphed and twisted into wicked claws. &quot;Now Rider. Let us keep the momentum we have.&quot; She Then broke into a sprint, closing the distance once again. Leaping to tear not into Hannibal but her trusted Surus instead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her grip tightened around the handle of her blade as she pointed the tip towards the sky. If Saber wished to use a Noble Phantasm against her, then she would answer in kind!

&quot;No longer is my mind shrouded with doubt, Saber. No longer do I feel shame for the sole loss I bear upon my name.&quot; Arcs of lightning surged around both Surus and Rider. Orbs of condensed Mana rose from the ground into air which the lightning used to create more arcs upon. Clouds formed over the Commodan, darkening the sky above. There was no time to worry where Saber&#39;s own Noble Phantasm went. It was now or never. &quot;FOR I AM THE SCOURGE OF ROME! I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE ROME BEND HER KNEE! I. AM. HANNIBAL BARCA! LET&#39;S CRUSH THIS SABER TOGETHER, <strong>SURUS, FAITHFUL STEED OF LIGHTNING!</strong>&quot;

Piercing through the clouds came down an awe-inspiring, massive bolt of lightning which easily engulfed both Hannibal and Surus. Serving as the conduit for this mighty strike from above, Hannibal kept her sword high in the air as the blast completely obliterated the area surrounding them in an ten metre radius. Rocks were shattered. Water evaporated instantly. The ground cratered. The brilliant light was too blinding for her to see whether or not it struck Saber. All she could do was hope as the blast dissipated, revealing the devastation she brought forth.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060151394092470302 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060151394092470302><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Jan-23 09:03 PM">21:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

First real hit of the game was hers and it was sure worth trading speed for power. His shield was down and he was too... oh, OH

&quot;Ohmygod! Are you alright, Simon? You can still fight right?&quot; Amelia dropped her weapon as her hands involuntarily went towards hiding her mouth. She wanted to get the upper hand but it really wouldn&#39;t be the fair fight she promised him if she knocked him out in one blow. Her eyes got big and watery like a puppy as she watched Simon skid to a stop.

&quot;Oh hey, you&#39;re back up already! That&#39;s a relief. I almost thought tha- OWWWW!!&quot; She lurched back as the disc carved  a thin red gash into her shoulder, instinctively mashing a heavy glove onto the injury. That shock of pain also came with the shock of realization as Simon seemed to think Amelia was just messing around. That stunned her more than the pain, did he not remember what they agreed on back at that dinky old shack? 

&quot;Simon... you know I&#39;m not that much of a fighter right? <em>This</em> is about as good as I can do. We&#39;re lucky we&#39;re fighting each other and not the mercs the cities hired! So like I said, show me what you got and I&#39;ll do the same for you, buddy!&quot;

Amelia braced for the next attack Simon would throw at her, only to have him shut the metaphorical curtains on him. That was a little disappointing but still small jolts of excitement shot up from her toes and fingertips as Simon undoubtly was hiding something big behind it like a present for her to unwrap. Would he need more time for that though? Hmmm, there was playing fair and then there was just throwing the match. She couldn&#39;t just sit there and bandage herself up. No but there were already some sticky vines left from her assault. What if she could hit two birds with one stone?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That turned out to be quite a few and the pressure from so many crammed in so small a space made the gun release a crack so loud Amelia felt dizzy from the blast as a whole party&#39;s worth of streamers shot over and around the solid wall of dust. No doubt Simon would be spooked by the big ole sticky mess that would keep him busy. Now? She waited five, ten, and then fifteen seconds and nodded to herself. Time!

&quot;Alright Simon, your time&#39;s up! I&#39;m coming out, ready or not!&quot; A deep, long breath in aaaand...

CLAP 

A second blast echoed around the vale, only Simon would feel this one as a high pressure wave easily sent the shield sliding backwards, its bottom rim pivoting upwards. The ends of the shield shivered, swirling the air, dust and debris in large, churning eddies while Amelia slid underneath them with characteristic speed. This time she did not have the flail in hand but rather another long rope-like weapon, a real, bonafide lasso. It swung wide before flying over Simon and settling at his feet, Amelia yanking it taut and imagining how he&#39;d fall face first into the awaiting sticky vines.  Wait, was this another cruel prank of the fairy child?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No doubt the shield at least would have broken before; it seems Simon had been practicing. Was it all for this moment, against her? 

&quot;I <strong>did</strong> fight those mercenaries,&quot; Simon called out, retorting against the vines that now wrapped around his feet. Amelia had him in her grasp, and yet there wasn&#39;t even a falter, a stutter of embarrassment or desperation? 

&quot;They wanted me out, whether it&#39;s because I have to assume they thought I was an easy target...or they were on my own team and thought I was a weak link.&quot; 

The lasso tightened around his ankles, and as he fell, Amelia could catch a glimpse of the shadow that hid within the dust. His shade seemed bigger, a funhouse mirror facsimile of what Simon really was. A bending of his frame. 

&quot;I had Saber with me both times...she&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m here right now. She wouldn&#39;t let me quit...so I owe it to give it my very all!&quot; 

His legs rippled before thickening, ripping through the vines as they bulged, claws tearing through his shoes and kicking off to meet Amelia. As his body shifted once more, enlarging his arm instead, the boy realized what Saber had given him. Trust with her own son&#39;s image. This was a bonding. 

The dust cleared, leaving an outstretched, monstrous hand reaching for Amelia, with a boy attached to it. 

&quot;So don&#39;t worry about me...if you do, I won&#39;t forgive you, Amelia! I want you to fight me like you have to! Because I&#39;m doing the same!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Come then, show me your lighting. Why you deserve your moniker!” Grendel’s Mother have a low growl as she lunged. Hannibal’s Chant complete. 

A resounding <strong>CRASH</strong> came ringing through the Commodan. 

Light blinded her. Pain surged forth through saber’s body. Yet Grendel’s Mother remained standing once Rider’s sight came back. “A worthy… strike…” The Matriarch gasped, before her second wind came forth. A shaky step forwards, from her monstrous frame. “You are worthy of my name. Gabia.” A more firm step forwards. 

Her footing was back. Then she lunged. Tackling Rider off of her mount. Claws piercing into skin as they toppled together to the ground. And her terrible maw gripped down into Rider’s Shoulder. Threatening to rip and tear apart bone, muscle, and sinew. In an indiscriminate manner.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was the only thing flowing through Rider&#39;s mind as she was tackled off of Surus.

The Noble Phantasm struck Saber. The damage upon her monstrous form made that apparent enough to her. However, despite that, she still stood tall. Not only that but she had enough strength left to lunge after her. To think a <em>monster</em> such as Gabia herself would be put low so easily; that was Rider&#39;s mistake.

Air was sucked through her teeth as the claws dug into her flesh, drawing forth a crimson spray which covered both of their bodies. Her forearm was placed just above her chest to keep some distance between the two while they struggled. She failed to create enough distance for what came next though...

&quot;<strong>AAAAAHHHH!!!</strong>&quot;

For the first time in either match, people heard the bloodcurdling scream leave Rider&#39;s mouth. Even with the pain being dulled thanks to her skill, it was still enough to deliver that sweet sound to Saber. Her feet kicked and dug into the loose, charred earth in a frenzied attempt to escape the jaws of the monster. Her fists slammed and struck back but it was useless.

Each movement made her feel more of her flesh tear and bones crack under the pressure. She even felt her frame begin to bend within. Pain spiked throughout her body in devastating pulses. Her time was running out.

<em>Squeeze</em>

Something tightened itself around Saber&#39;s waist. It was Surus&#39;s trunk. In an desperate cry from the beast, he attempted to pry her off of his friend as he slowly stood upon his rear legs. 

&quot;Kick her ass, Surus!&quot; Rider&#39;s words were gargled from the blood that flooded her mouth, staining her teeth red. Reaching from behind her, Rider pulled out the curved sword that was gifted to her by Saber. With it, she attempted to jam it inside the maw to create a wedge to make sure that not much of her came with Saber, should Surus succeed, of course.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060490189581066271 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060490189581066271><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Jan-23 07:29 PM">19:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As if enticing her to dig further. Deeper.   Dig into that sweet fruit which was hidden just beneath flesh. Savor that which hide inside of bone. 

It was satisfying to do so. 

Become debased. Monstrous. 

However. Now was not the time to lose oneself to such indulgence. Hannibal fought tooth and nail. Striking Saber in the face, chest, really anywhere to have her loosen her grip. 

But it was futile, until Surus intervened. Two against one.

It could be a loosing battle. 

The blade wedged itself into that horrid maw, allowing for Surus to rip Grendel’s Mother form free from its rider. 

“A package deal.” She growled low, and savagely. The beasts grip growing ever tighter. 

Saber’s form returned to that of a humanoid, as a gleaming silver blade now rested within her hands. With all the might she could muster the blade swung backwards. Severing Trunk from Elephant. Tossing Saber back to the ground, blade bloodstained and dragging behind the Matriarch. All the while a portal emerged above Hannibal and that giant fist came straight down, aiming to drive her in the ground repeatedly. “I doubt your beast has any tricks to regrow that limb.” Grendel’s Mother called as her eyes glared towards Surus, before turning back to Rider.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If it wasn&#39;t for Surus, it would&#39;ve been a quick trip to the Throne for her. The price for such a rescue was steep though...

The pained cries of Surus as his trunk was cleaved clean off made time slow to crawl. Rider&#39;s gaze was fixated on the blood that flew from the severed appendage from her close friend. It was Zama all over again. Again she remained helpless to help him just like before. Surus barely stood on his rear legs, threatening to come toppling down.

&quot;SURUUSSS!!! YOU BI-GAH!&quot; The rest of Rider&#39;s air in her lungs was forced out of her once the fist from above struck true. 

And again. 

And again.

And again.

Each time more blood was spat out of her mouth. The crowd was deathly silent as they witnessed what they saw; Rider and Surus were being treated as if they were nothing compared to Saber. Was this the monster the Republic was hiding from them? 

&quot;Not again!&quot;

<em>sink</em>

The slams stopped. A curved blade was sunk into the hand while Rider held onto it to keep it there as the blade slowly dug deeper. There was a pained expression in the bloodshot eye of Rider as bloodied teeth were ground together, some threatening to crack the others from the pressure.

&quot;I will not lose him a second time! Not while I can still do something about it!&quot; Mana poured from her being as they fueled their weapon to send a burst of Lightning through the sword she impaled into the giant fist. Only two things could be imbued by her <strong>Mana Burst</strong>. So what was the second thing imbued? 

&quot;Surus! NOW!&quot; The pained cries from the Elephant turned into ones of fury as he glared with tearful eyes at Saber. Surus&#39;s feet was the second thing imbued as they were brought straight down upon Saber with a thunderous payload of lightning to add to the already destructive force of the incoming stomp.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060574852186120294 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060574852186120294><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jan-23 01:05 AM">01:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Way to go, Simon! You really have grown, this really is gonna be a great showdown,&quot; Amelia smiled  back, giddy not only from the excitement of a fair fight but also Simon&#39;s newfound confidence and prowess. This was quickly growing into a real enjoyable time for Amelia and she got to spend it with a friend too!

&quot;I fought another mercenary earlier in this very stadium myself. It nearly broke me and all this tournament I saw broken people, haven given up on their dreams or hiding from some problem they face. It was terrible seeing the world in this way but in some way I was no different. I had been running away from something for a long time.&quot;

Amelia pulled as hard as she could on the lasso, hoping to regain the advantage she had at the beginning of the fight and put Simon in a tangled mess of vines and dust. Yet something was odd about him, his shadow twisting, his body rippling like a reflection in a pond after someone tossed a rock in. She couldn&#39;t help but feel the hairs on the back of her neck raise up from the spectacle. He was part homunculus, was this perhaps some hidden program within him?

&quot;Rider too had her own problem, but together we were able to face our problems together and emerge unbreakable! She got her confidence back and I realized that regardless of how I left my home, my family still needs my help and I <em>will</em> find them again and make sure they get the same shot at freedom and pursuing their own dreams as me!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060612839410253824 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060612839410253824><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jan-23 03:36 AM">03:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The fog cleared and revealed the blessing of the Matriarch on Simon or rather an iteration of that mythical beast from the legend of Beowulf.

Her wing pack unfurled and beat dramatically several times in response to his challange and ruby eyes gleamed free of fear.

&quot;Mhm, I&#39;m not just fighting against you today, because I&#39;ve got family that I know I need to save! I fight for my siblings, Daniel, Phoebe and Walter!&quot; As she called out their names, the wind returned with a howl that would match any beast. Simon may have torn her vines to shreds but the pieces were more than plenty to dance in the wind and tangle with each other until they constituted a large net that folded up and around him on all sides.

 As it collasped over him, arresting his movement for a moment, she clambered back over his shield and blasted its corners, sending it spinning like a coin on its end back at its owner. Hopefully it had enough speed and mass to send Simon reeling from another blow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This power was new, but it wasn&#39;t altogether unwieldy. He simply had to get used to the idea of having his own body as a potential weapon, rather than a liability. 

The sight of his shield did bring a level of concern, of course, as he quickly disbanded the air, allowing dust to fall over both of them while the corners unfurled into wind...

And left 3 swords dangling in midair, all of which shot forth to skewer Amelia&#39;s wing pack, all while Simon&#39;s arm shrank and his jaw unhinged. Fangs appeared as his eyes bulged, the boy&#39;s new visage working to chew through his entanglement as Amelia dealt with his onslaught. 

<em>That&#39;s it...we both are fighting for different reasons, but for one reason or another, we have to. She has to win...that&#39;s the only difference...what do I have to win for, beyond just rubbing my father&#39;s nose in the reward? It&#39;s not like I gain anything...it&#39;s all just for him. 

But I won&#39;t let it be!</em> 

The vines snap beneath the clack of his teeth, Simon&#39;s body unfurling and coiling like a reptile as he used Gabia&#39;s gift to shrug off the net, looking to keep track of Amelia. Well, she was right to keep him at bay, but she may find that harder than she first anticipated. Especially once she catches a glimpse of Simon floating towards her. His shields...he found a way to fly by using his shields like a vehicle!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet she had other pressing concerns at the time, namely keeping those teeth and claws that put her flail to shame from digging into her. Same for the jeweled daggers threatening to skewer her. Using the air to slam against the flat of the blades proved good enough to get a glancing blow on her back or dodge outright. 

Importantly her wings were still intact and somehow Simon was now starting to float towards her. Now that was seriously freaky. Still it seemed like in his new form, he was growing cocky with his abilities. If he wanted to challenge Amelia in the sky, he was more than welcome to try but she sure wasn&#39;t going to be responsible for any broken limbs he was going to get.

&quot;That&#39;s the trick you wanna try?  Alright, lets see if you can keep up with my pace. Imma warn you, I don&#39;t ever go under 60 kph! Good luck, Beast Boy!&quot; Amelia chuckled as she flaunted her wings again, fired off a few seeds at the approaching magus&#39;s eyes and shot out a vine to launch her up towards a rather large tree like a catapult. 

She almost seemed to hover at the tree&#39;s crown before rocketing off with a particularly dense blast of air behind her like a jet engine roaring to life. She climbed above the canopy in no time and soared into the open sky, searching for a thermal to ascend upon while she waited to see if Simon&#39;s trick was more than just that.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

```&quot;No, this is!&quot; Simon called back, his ascent halting as he dropped to avoid the vines, desperate not to get caught in Amelia&#39;s plant growth again, though at the same time holding his hands together for another beat altogether. His legs morphed to take up the majority of the fall, but as he ran forward, the soft whistle of something cutting through the air catches Amelia&#39;s attention. 

<em>SHWING</em> 

A swift stab and cleave through the air caught a few strands of her own silvery hair, their locks fluttering slowly through the breeze while another attack barely misses her outstretched palms. The glow of azure...the swords were still coming. They were cracked, edges worn slightly from her own counterattack, but they were still attacking her! 

<em>I figured it out...if I can catch them in a bubble...I can suspend them in a swirl of air. They&#39;re constantly moving forward because air is constantly flowing around them to keep them in place. I can catch them and shoot them back at her, long enough to do THIS!</em> 

Simon reaches the tree, his arms morphing back to elongated, muscled creature&#39;s limbs as he grabs the base of the tree, and begins pulling himself up. His arms shoot forth and grip the branches wildly, the motion almost second nature as he pulled himself towards his opponent. This was what it meant to be a monster, and now the boy knew: he liked it.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="06-Jan-23 01:47 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Can he even really fly with that monster body of his now? Did he dupe him, did she dupe herself? These were not the thoughts she should be having but after imagining the high octane race between trees with him in hot pursuit, anything was welcome to make up for the lack of stimuli.

The swords included. A good thing they were already starting to show wear. A quick blast or two and they’d find themselves embedded in that tree that was growing back towards her. Wait was it getting closer or Simon getting bigger? Ooh he’s climbing up the tree, then that’s perfect actually. Everyone knew what they said about the bigger your opponent gets…

She traded every bit of speed she had left to gain more and more height until there was no tree or ridge in the arena that matched her. Honestly she could swear she was on the same level as the stadium lights even. Now Simon looked very small indeed. She took a deep breath at the apex of her flight and held on tightly to her flail.

Then she let everything go limp and let gravity do its magic. She slowly turned on her head and began plummeting back towards the earth. She lazily rolled over to orient herself with Simon and pressed her wings as snugly as they’d go against her frame. In a few seconds the audience watched the other contentest shapeshift from a precocious girl into a diving falcon, even if her prey seemed a bit big for her talons.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060820216961052672 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060820216961052672><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jan-23 05:20 PM">17:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For her attack, mass mattered little and velocity meant everything. She could feel the moment she became nothing but a blur for everyone else, her form merging with the wind to create a mirage swooping downwards for the trees and fog. Everything for her ran automatically, corresponding to the shifting pitch of the wind ramming itself into her ears.

Simon and the tree he clambered up on got progressively larger until they took up all of her forward vision and she did her best to change direction and leverage all of that speed and mass into her flail and while the side attack would certainly be punishing, the problem about sudden movements at high speed is things love to continue going one way, especially when Gravity is pulling that way.

She felt her stomach and gut ram down into her side, sinking as close to the skin as possible. Her arms started to feel real heavy and her vision blurred. Her head went fuzzy. She knew she was tumbling now but was it down, to the side or up? The tree seemed to spiral around her. There was some discomfort, like something being in a place it shouldn’t but it was impossible to discern in that dizzying moment</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grendel’s Mother still continued her approach. Heavy blade dragging behind her, like an executioners blade ready to cleave. “Lose is something all should be willing to experience. The time comes for all things to end, at some point or another.” 

A sharp spike in Rider’s Mana consumption happened once again. Her Mana Burst was activated. But not on her being, rather her elephants. 

The foot traveled downwards with an incredible amount of force, to which Saber responded holding the blade horizontal and pushing back against the brutal strength of the beast. 

Electricity coursed through her body, as Surus threatened to crush her.  Grendel’s Mother hung on by a thread, keeping the beast’s foot from completely trampling down on her body. “Allow… me.. to… demonstrate.” 

Water began to gather near Saber and Surus before swirling together in a rapid frenzy, and striking up through Surus freezing just as it broke through to the other side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, open air and stadium floodlights was not part of what he anticipated, nor was the awe-stricken gasps from the crowd as they reacted to something he himself wasn&#39;t seeing. He scanned the sky once more, eyes squinting as his deformed arms held him tight to the treetop. It was too late when he saw Amelia rocketing towards him, and now he could see the true folly on trying to match her in the air. She had the freedom to attempt such reckless behavior; he did not. 

He erected a shield, just moments before her own flail could impact with him, and his body morphed to cushion the blow...but it was still a powerful one. His ribs cracked and his mind went blank as he fell from the treetop, his monstrous chest breaking the young ones fall and allowing him to focus on trying to get his breath back. The pain was far too much, and his mouth gaped open and close like a fish as he tried to regain himself. This was something he could take, something he could overcome. But he could not deny that it did, indeed, hurt like hell. 

And Amelia fell, fell to the ground, her wings still clutched tightly against her as the river opened up and took the plunging falcon into itself. The waters whipped about her, the waves pushed against her nostrils and mouth, but it was a safe landing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060931179588620308 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060931179588620308><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Jan-23 12:41 AM">00:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=h_WgDFuAk2I&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE">https://youtube.com/watch?v=h_WgDFuAk2I&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYdYWYhlrmivLomprHOqJg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Minedor Music</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_WgDFuAk2I"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean - Stone Ocean Theme (Official...</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_WgDFuAk2I width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1060931394546696354 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1060931394546696354><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Jan-23 12:42 AM">00:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>FSSSSSSH</em>

Or so she thought. 

Swords. All arranged carefully by his magecraft, all held suspended in the water by Simon&#39;s bubbles. He had been keeping them here this entire time...did he...plan all of this?

The bubbles burst, and the swords shot forth to skewer the girl.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her wings felt locked for the moment and her head still foggy. That changed the instant she found herself underwater, doused in the cold stream. Her wings were water-repellant so that wouldn&#39;t be a problem but her legs and back took the brunt of the collision. A safe landing it may have been but a soft one it was not. 

There was a lot of bubbles in the water, that was to be expected by such an energetic splash, yeah?

That instantaneous moment when your life flashes before your eyes and the world freezes around her. She wasn&#39;t about to make it out of this stream alive, this was the surprise Simon had been planning all along. Only thing worse was if it was deep underwater or underground, places no wind can touch. 

She though back to her siblings in that moment, the way Daniel could always come up with a game, fully fleshed with rules, on impulse even if it would ultimately favor him and subsequently melt down when he lost, the way Phoebe could always provide them with extra snacks from one of her many stashes and yet how despondent she&#39;d be in her frequent attempts to  shut herself in, and finally the way Walter supported everyone else with absolute loyalty and boundless love regardless of the situation yet become disturbed and histeric at the littlest things that bothered him.

They were her first family and she was about to fail all of them, without her, there&#39;d be no balance and they&#39;d all fall away to their own vices. She couldn&#39;t let that happen yet it sure seemed like maybe it would. In that moment she didn&#39;t feel like running away from it it but rather huddling up in the corner, crying like little Walter would as the swords came spearing through the water. 

And yet, she thought in her last moments of the fun they&#39;d have in the pool together, splashing each other with tidal and wind-drawn waves, competing for who could make the biggest wave. She remembered how frothy the water could get in those contests and the truly huge crests and waterspouts they&#39;d make. This stream was almost as aerated as those good times. It would be a good way to go...

Wait that meant there was still a chance, there was plenty of air still left within her grasp. She&#39;d still be stuck like a hedgehog, but pain was something she could tolerate if that meant a shot at a better tomorrow, a future with her family free.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061005788925149255 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061005788925149255><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Jan-23 05:38 AM">05:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She blew out as hard as she could, cuffing her hands around her mouth, creating a rapidly expanding bubble of air that&#39;d grab onto other similar bubbles to make a real pocket of air for her to escape.

One sword dug into her thigh, man it stung and then ached unbearably. More air escaped her lungs involuntarily. She had to start the chant now. 

&quot;Whispers of hope, words of change, carry my dream above the waves...&quot; A single leaf began to dance around in the bubble as the pollen on it began to glow with a golden light even as a murky cloud of red seeped from her leg. 

&quot;Let the wind of chaos churn the azure lane, let the wind of freedom dive to rescue its child...&quot; Another sword dug into her back and her lungs contracted further. Already she was drawing from the hollow crevices of her bones for more fuel. 

Two more pierced her arm and one of her hands, the bubble shrinking as her concentration slips and her blood oxygen depletes. The edges of her vision were getting dark again. Yet she couldn&#39;t stop here, not when she was so close to victory. She drew on every last little pocket of air left within her and brought them out with one huge heave of her chest.

The stream&#39;s constant flow then halted and began to circle in on itself, chasing its own tides in ever-decreasing radii. Leaves began to float up and dance on the violent stage, a sickly yellow haze soon joined in. 

Lastly was the mournful howl of the wind, swooping past the banks and diving into the waves before uplifting them in a funnel that grew and grew.  A shadow began to rise with it. 

Within the cyclone, Amelia felt the swords began to sway back and forth within her flesh and she screamed in agony, wishing them to be gone. Forever her guardian, the wind obliged and in an uncharacteristic feat of rage and strength, snapped the jeweled blades into pieces and gathered them among the growing swarms of debris tossed around by the waterspout.

She howled again and the wind only magnified it into a truly terrifying roar before lurching forward for a collision course with Simon&#39;s monstrous form. It sounded almost like a freight train barrelling towards him, the ground even shook and it  began to hail. First serrated leaves, then pebbles and then the fragments of the swords he used in the beginning. 

There was no more running away from her problems for Amelia anymore, there was only one way forward for her and that was through Simon. She no longer seemed fully human, with her wings ruffled, her hair glowing with streaks of chlorophyll and her eyes blazing orbs of rubied rage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Amelia&#39;s trip into the water surely would end this; she at the very least would find herself incapable of fending off so many of his father&#39;s swords. He was certain she wouldn&#39;t die, at the very least, but that the bleeding would potentially leave her unconscious for him to fish her out-

The forest grew alive. And it grew furious with the boy.  The river itself raged, swirling into a conglomeration of torrent and waves, the wind itself giving it shape and twisting it around Amelia as he heard her screams punctuate the howl of wind. Leaves cut against his skin, pebbles pelted his body, and finally, his own swords fragments slid across his body and left trails for open wounds that  sat as thin red lines, only to gush with blood. His body retaliated, morphing against the blows and leaving him as a shell of Grendel as he desperately fought back against the pain. He let out a roar of his own, arms outstretched as Amelia burst forth. No longer the fairy child, but rather, an avatar for the rage of this forest. He had pushed her, and now, he was about to be pushed back. 

The blow deflates his chest, Simon&#39;s form bending underneath Amelia&#39;s ram as they both flew back, deep into the forest, before slamming against a tree trunk. His eyes bulge before a growl settles in his throat, Simon gripping Amelia&#39;s body and craning his neck to bite into her shoulder, attempting to steer her into the sky and away from the debris below. It didn&#39;t seem to matter though...everything was her domain, and it seemed not even a monster could stand against her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A smirk formed on her face before it was wiped away as quickly as it came when Saber made her next move. &quot;No...No. NonononoNONONO!&quot; Rider screamed in desperation as if doing so would spare her friend from their fate. Her chest yelled out in pain in response as well from the repeated slams, but she didn&#39;t care. She would rather be the one getting impaled than to witness Surus being ran through by Saber&#39;s magecraft. Rider got up on her knees and reached out for her friend but, by the time she could muster up the strength to push through the pain do so, it was already too late...

The water pierced through unarmoured underside of Surus where only his tough hide protected him. While the hide wasn&#39;t anything to scoff at, it still wasn&#39;t enough to hold back against Saber&#39;s attack. A pillar of ice now stood inside of Surus, having tore through vitals with ease. The weight of the beast made the pillar impale itself further into Surus as he fell onto his knees. A weak trumpet was all Surus could muster before the eyes stared blankly in front of him. Any amount of life in them left along with the last tears to dampen his hide.

Tears came crashing down her cheeks as the horrific memory of watching her friend get impaled upon the fields of Zama replayed in her mind. The parallels between that painful memory and the new one being formed in front of her were all too similar. Whether it was from spears or Magecraft, the result was the same; her best friend was <em>killed</em>.

You can&#39;t do this to me again, Surus! Get up!&quot; The flakes continued to remove more and more of Surus from this world despite her pleas. &quot;Saber&#39;s still standing! We still got to fight!... Please don&#39;t leave me again...&quot; Rider made her last plea as Surus couldn&#39;t even return her tearful gaze before returning to the Throne without her. She wasn&#39;t even afforded a simple farewell to her friend before she saw them leave.

&quot;<strong>SURUUUSSS!!!</strong>&quot;

Sobs came from a seemingly broken Rider as she had her head against the ground while on her knees. Her fingers dug into the earth from her fists clenching tight. The loss of her friend inflicted a wound far greater than whatever Saber did prior. The cries went on for awhile until she spoke up again.

&quot;Saber...&quot;

When her head began to lift up, the next words to come out of her mouth sounded like they would be a plea to end her as well so she could have this pain end. However, even as the tears flowed freely, her gaze held a fury which burned with such intensity that it seemed like it could bore a hole straight through Saber herself.

&quot;No... GABIA!&quot;

As she cursed her name, the sight was no different from that accursed Roman, Scipio, smirking at her after the death of her friend compared to the appearance of Saber standing before her. To her, <em>they</em> were the same. They were both people she <em>needed</em> to kill, even if it costed her own Spirit Core doing so.

With a shaky footing, Rider managed to stand with her falcata in her trembling grip before finally an outburst of lightning erupted from her. Mana poured out of her haphazardly as if it were a way for her to vent out her emotions for her slain companion. It struck and surged wildly and without reason around her while she emptied out her lungs at her opponent, spraying forth more blood as she does so.

&quot;<strong>I&#39;LL KILL YOU!</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061020764280729621 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061020764280729621><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Jan-23 06:37 AM">06:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every threat towards Amelia&#39;s ascent was to be treated in the same merciless way. Branches raked his back as he grappled with Amelia. She&#39;d bat her wings against his face, attemping to slap it from side to side.

 Yet against his own monstrous force within the envelope of her wind, Amelia could not prevent those dagger-like fangs from digging into her shoulder. They slid in too easy against her flesh and she could feel her bones shiver and her stomach quiver as the teeth struck bone. Like a harpist, all Simon had to do to make Amelia sing her cantata of wildland fury was pluck the sinewy nerves.

Already, she could feel the winds of the tempest start to lose their swell. If Simon wanted to redirect the two of them towards the sky, so be it. She&#39;d be more than happy to oblige him in the eagle&#39;s dance, talons reaching for eachother as they tumbled in the sky. But first, she&#39;d need more force to launch them both. She had not the time to develop some elaborate catapult or slingshot from vines. She had to draw upon the untamed wind again, even if it risked compromising her lungs.

&quot;Wind, wind, spirit of freedom and chaos, lift my pain to the heavens!&quot; She grunted through the searing pain from her wound as Spriggy slipped from under her helmet and lept onto Simon&#39;s head and began gnawing on it.

&quot;Stir it with the desperation of nature unbalanced and rage of ideals trampled!&quot; 

&quot;And bring down the tempest to break all monsters of humanity&#39;s evil!&quot; The wind whirled around the two with a renewed force, even as Amelia felt her chest began to warm up beyond what the mounting stress already saddled on her. Still, she took some relief from the lacerations the boy would suffer as she forcefully launched them both through the woodlands at an angle towards the open sky.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061124660693061733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061124660693061733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Jan-23 01:30 PM">13:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She found it hard to breath as they crested the canopy for a second time, her body working overtime to suppress the pain, struggle against Simon, maintain the tempest and look for Hannibal. At least the last task would be answered with all the subtlety of a cascade of lightning erupting from a recently formed clearing. She was in trouble! There was no other meaning to how uncontrolled the burst of lightning was. Her heart winced in sympathy even as her chest burned ever hotter. 

&quot;Hold on Hannibal, I&#39;m coming for you!&quot; She cried before gathering the wind around her for one final burst of speed, sending the pair rocketing towards their servants. Amelia used the gusts of wind to pivot on Simon&#39;s much larger and irregular form to ensure he would cushion her landing with all that extra mass he suddenly had at his disposal. 

As they got closer, Amelia felt her heart catch up to the pain her lungs were under as the last pieces of Surus faded away in the wind, a crude bloody block of ice left where he&#39;d been. Hannibal was doubtlessly driven mad by the whole thing while the Matriarch stubbornly still stood. They&#39;d need to end this soon before the power of their storm soon passed.

Just a moment before they crashed into the ground, Amelia closed her eyes and focused on her left wrist, imagining the leafless tree that represented her remaining command seals. The trunk would have to go this time. Its power would be given to Hannibal, all that were needed were the right words...

<em>Hannibal, its time to prove one loss can&#39;t define you. Make the Roman bend the knee.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her rage was truly equal in both events that one would be hard-pressed to determine which burned hotter.

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn about your feud!&quot; Rider, regardless of the pain her body caused her for moving, lunged forward to meet Saber head-on. The violent crash of lightning and force rumbled the Commodan. Rider&#39;s falcata trembled in her hand as she attempted to withstand against Saber&#39;s might again. 

But this time was different. A surge of power entered her body, allowing her the strength to stand upon equal grounds with Saber. They were now at a standstill. The ground cracked and cratered from the weight of their engagement. The victor would be determined by who causes the other to break first.

Rider remembered this familiar sensation. One glance to her side and she saw her. <em>Amelia</em>. That crazy girl. She thought she told her to...

The sight of her winds brought upon her an idea. A way to break this stalemate. 

&quot;AMELIA! QUICK! TOSS ANOTHER SEED AT US!&quot; There was no time to explain any further. All she needed was another one of those tornados.

“You misinterpret my words. This is not yours, or mine. This is ours, Rider, Hannibal.” Gabia pressed further in. Face shifting away from her human visage, catching sight of Simon. Her master now bruised and battered. “If you think the fae child can save you, then let us see.” That terrible maw formed again as she pressed further and further in. Threatening to tear into Hannibal’s flesh, it was now a matter of time. 

In Simon’s mind he would hear her voice. ‘<em>You used the gift well, child. Fought valiantly. Do not forget what you have learned in this land, in this petty conflict of men.</em>’ Her voice then became audible, as the maw grew closer to Rider. “Do not let your self worth falter again.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she wasn&#39;t as battered and broken as Simon, blood still seeped from where she was stabbed and the wound on her shoulder looked like a bear had mauled her. She could barely move her left arm now and her legs felt like they were turning into jelly.

&quot;I-I made it back, Ha-hannibal! I&#39;m still in this fight!&quot; She did her best to wave her little plant gun in the direction of the Matriarch, though she was starting to hope the command seal was all that was needed. The battle so far had been quick and intense and her stamina was waning. If this was exploration, she&#39;d still have plenty of energy to go around.

&quot;Huh? But it barely- Ok I&#39;ll do it for you, sis!&quot; Amelia protested meekly as she felt her breathes come in short, shallow bursts. Her circuits were really working to compensate for the intense usage of mana and any big surge could jeopardize her lungs. Still this was a moment that could spell victory for them and give her the best shot to have the resources to find and free her family.

No! There wasn&#39;t any room for any more doubts. The timing of this needed to be perfect! 

&#39;<em>Thank you, Sis...</em>&#39; The chant was finished and the leaf flew towards them. Small but pivotal to their final gambit. Now the next steps were hers to mess up. 

&quot;Our feud or not, I&#39;ll never forgive you for what you did to Surus!&quot; The wrath in her eye matched that of a certain hero who stood behind Saber in another time past, even if for a brief moment. Rider did not falter, even as the maw came down upon her. 

The ticks of a clock could almost be heard as everything was coming into place. The leaf did its best to fly towards the Servants but the maw was ahead of it.

The teeth dug and tore off her eyepatch, revealing a dulled sapphire-hued eye underneath as Saber gave her a new set of scars upon her face. Both of them shared the same flames within.

Before the winds could pick up too much, Rider released her grip of her sword to break the stalemate between them in hopes of setting them off balance enough for her follow-up. In her other hand held the curved sword, gifted to her from Saber, as it came rising up in an uppercut motion. The blade was imbued with everything her lightning could muster for this moment. When it crashed against Saber&#39;s blade, the force was enough to cause the curved sword to shatter upon impact. In doing so gave Rider the opportunity needed in this parry of theirs as Saber&#39;s blade was freed from her grip once more.

This time, Rider allowed herself to freely get taken away by them as both swords, both intact and shattered alike, and Servant flew into the air together. 

The first few attempts to grasp onto the silver sword was met with failure, both thanks to the winds and her muscles relaxing. It wasn&#39;t until she reached the apex that she was able to grasp onto the sword with both hands. Time appeared to have froze in place. This time, she was prepared for the memories to flood through her mind once more. As they passed, Rider saw her target below her. So, with both hands upon the handle of the blade, she reeled it back behind her as she spoke the chant before she could begin her descent back to the earth. The air surrounding her became dense with Mana which illuminated the entire arena. Her eyes shined a bright silver once the activation of another Noble Phantasm was made. 

&quot;Oh Ancient Blade. Lend me Your true Strength. For you are now As Nameless as its Wielder! <strong>Nameless Giant&#39;s Blade!</strong>&quot; She let loose everything her lungs would allow her in one final warcry after she finished the chant. The blade erupted with a blazing stream of Mana as Rider released it all in a mighty swing towards Saber. The Commodan was enveloped in a brilliant display of power as the beam came crashing down from above, tearing through whatever was unfortunate enough to lay in its stream of destruction.

Afterwards, Rider landed upon the ground on her feet. Although she had the strength to stand up tall after the landing, albeit shakily, she knew that she was running on empty by this point. One more step would cause her legs to buckle immediately. If Saber managed to survive this, there was no way she could defend herself. All there was left to do was see whether or not their gambit paid off...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061404123007832086 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061404123007832086><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Jan-23 08:01 AM">08:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The maw of Grendel’s Mother came down closer and closer. Gnashing away at the eyepatch of Hannibal, revealing what was hidden underneath. 

Then the gifted blade was given a looser grip. Before being followed up and shattered by the ancient blade of Saber. Then the world became upside down. The fairy child’s wind had successfully become a whirlwind. 

Blade and servant alike brought high into the air. Both servant reaching for the one which had remained intact. 

Rider came up successful. Fury present in her eyes. Just like that of Beowulf. 

“Strike me down again, great hero.” A chant was heard from above, the chant of her own Noble Phantasm. As Silver flashed above in the sky. 

In that moment Simon would witness a memory. 

Beowulf, laid low. Before Grendel’s Mother as she took another step forwards. He had been struggling against this monster. Needing a miracle to even survive. 

The blade. Called towards him. Beckoned almost. If She had chosen to wield it, there would have not been a chance for this to happen. Her child would be avenged. “Great hero.” The Matriarch’s voice was like a low growl as she continued forwards. “You killed one I loved. You are prepared for these consequences.” Her short sword raised high. 

Then a flash of sliver that which could rival the beam of light which shone through the sky. A pained gasp was all that escaped from there. Grendel’s Mother falling to her knees. Reaching forwards for Beowulf. Struggling but being unable to even articulate a word as he moved away, severing the head from her Child’s corpse. Tears welled in her eyes, before a warm embrace of darkness filled her vision.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061410646115233942 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061410646115233942><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Jan-23 08:26 AM">08:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFVSclD_uc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFVSclD_uc</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm54E8Hlf_z1GIpVUChBTQA><div class=chatlog__embed-author>The Walters</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFVSclD_uc"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">The Walters -- I Love You So</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwFVSclD_uc width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061410715589677086 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061410715589677086><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Jan-23 08:27 AM">08:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As the dust settled and the bright silver light cleared.

Torso was severed from her waist. Cut through by that beam of destructive and beautiful light. “You did wonderfully…” A smile creeped upon her face. “I am afraid… but you have grown… strong…” Gabia made little effort to move, instead seeming to beckon Simon towards her. “Do not forget…”

But what had started as a swirl of fury and retribution subsided into a low whistle through the clearing. Leaves fell back to the earth, graceful and slow, as blades of grass lay there flat ends against the plucked spots of the earth, shuddering as their forms flattened against ground. 

Simon continued to crawl. He sought her form, expecting Saber to simply shudder in frozen fury at the attack. She must have been badly hurt, and that would only surge the rage of the beast inside. He had to find her to calm her down. While he had given his all, Saber&#39;s all could very well kill Amelia, and that was something he couldn&#39;t forgive himself for. He had to try and calm her-

His leg gave way, replaced only with the human ache of his own fatigued body. He looked back, only to see his other cloven foot shrinking back to his withered and thinning leg. What was happening, was he losing consciousness? This was no time to pass out, Saber needed his help! He tried to call back the power of Grendel, but every inch he crawled only made his clawed hands recede to bloodied fingers, and his maw shrink to a quivering whine that already knew the truth that he could not face. He couldn&#39;t forsake her gift like this, she needed-

<em>C-child</em>

He found her. Lying in the earth. Her body twisted, her torso gone...her form fading. 

&quot;No...N-no, Saber, what are you doing? You&#39;ve gotta get up...you&#39;ve gotta...&quot;

He tried to rationalize it. He tried to bargain with fate. He tried to think of some means of how he could help her. But the pit in his gut, the burn in his chest told him the truth, and it wouldn&#39;t allow him to protect his fragile heart. 

Saber was dying.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Flashes of his father, Nikolai, Zahak, Nimrod and Lea, Barret and Mehmed...none were surmountable without her. Without her...he never even considered it. What would come next. Life without her. 

His hands fumble against the dirt, shakily grabbing onto Saber&#39;s palm, staring deep into her slate grey palm as he fought for something to say. He knew what, but in this moment, could he bear to be so pathetic and forsake her? Hadn&#39;t he done enough already by not saving her? By not being there by her side? 

&quot;S-saber...Saber, I-...&quot;

His head bows, his matted white hair shielding the his eyes from the crowd, but the soft, warm droplets of tears against Saber&#39;s skin told the Servant what she needed to know. Better than his words ever could. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...I-I&#39;m sorry, Saber, I couldn&#39;t...I&#39;m a f-f-failure...you even gave me your son&#39;s frame, his power and I lost. I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m sorry you ended up with me, Saber. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be what you needed...

Those were the last words he would hear. Grendel&#39;s Mother pulled him closer in an embrace. It would be more apt to say that Gabia was the one who chose to show him this last bit of affection.

Every breath felt like she was inhaling sulfurous fumes that charred her lungs and every exhale felt like she was pushing sandpaper up her throat. Tears streamed freely from her eyes as she struggled for air against her overheated circuits. Her legs were wood and her arms felt like iron weights.

She watched as Hannibal and the Matriarch flew up into the air and looked away, closing her eyes to shield them from the intense light that drowned out even the stadium&#39;s floodlights with the luminance. When she opened them, Hannibal still stood on her feet while Saber lay in twain. 

She saw them but her exhausted mind did not fully register the consequences, instead plodding towards Hannibal to support her one last time if need be. They were family and she be darned if she gave up on the newest member. Her wings could block at least one blow, that&#39;d give her the chance to strike down any surprise attacks, right?

Instead, the Matriarch began shedding golden flakes, like Surus did a moment before. This was the end of the whole fight. They did it, they finally did it. There was nothing else that they had to do. Victory was theirs! 

&quot;We did it, Hannibal. We actually won this whole thing...&quot; She let every word drift out of her mouth with an exhale as she made it to Rider and let her body lean against hers. She winced when Spriggy returned and began lapping at the grizzly shoulder wound, doing his absolute best to begin cleaning it. Though that pain was minor compared to watching Simon grieve the loss of his own found family. She really wanted to comfort him in that moment but her body simply could give no more at the moment. She had to be content with only giving Hannibal an opposing weight to lean against for the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet it was enough for Alexandria to see far more support than it ever had in recent memory. The attention it received rivalled that of what it had obtained since its inception. The city was a beacon of hope for many. A sign of the older times, where the pursuit of knowledge was not only encouraged, but had become commonplace. Something that many seemed to have forgotten in the Dark Ages period of the early post-apocalypse.

&quot;But now, decades later, Alexandria has grown. Strong enough to even resist the influence of Republic.&quot; A man of short stature and wrinkly features spoke from a mahogany lectern. The ceremonial victory acceptance speech had been going on for around five minutes. The Alexandrians who had participated in the tournament were asked to remain seated several steps behind the Grand Archivist, who had promised to keep their speech going for at least ten minutes longer. Masters and Servants alike who had survived the tournament had been brought back for one final farewell, wearing ceremonial regalia as was the Alexandrian custom. Those who declined to appear, or had been unable to, were instead replaced with artistic portraits of them stacked on top of ornate chairs. 

&quot;What this victory means for us is not the end of our struggle, but the new beginning of our triumph. We have proven that our conservation of the past has borne fruit to lead us to a new future. It is with great pleasure that I declare the <strong>City Grail War of Alexandria to be officially over.</strong> In addition, we have received words of encouragement from our neighbors, along with promises of support from faraway cities. Republic themselves have admitted their defeat gracefully and promised us a treaty of peace for the foreseeable future. See this as a chance to forgive, but not forget-&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1062492065486864555 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1062492065486864555><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Jan-23 08:04 AM">08:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The archivist stroked their beard, licking through the pages of the speech on the podium that they had written in a hurry in the past sixteen hours. Who would have known that word of Alexandria&#39;s victory would have spread so far and wide in such a short timespan? It felt odd to him, but he wasn&#39;t one to look at a gift horse in the mouth. In fact, he would rather let others indulge in the display of his prized horses.

&quot;But of course, our future was brought to us by these valiant warriors, who fought for Alexandria&#39;s survival.&quot; He turned to his side, giving the crowd at the Commodan one final look at their participants rising up from their chairs. Some had grown throughout their struggles. Others sook to improve even more. Regardless, it was by putting faith in unknown talent that Alexandria had managed to thrive by the skin of its teeth.

&quot;A round of applause for the true victors of the Holy Grail War!&quot;

<em><strong>clap clap clap clap clap clap</strong></em>

The afterparty was like a blur, with various people mingling in the crowd. The smell of festivities and prosecco littered the air as April 3rd was officially deemed a holiday for the city of Alexandria. This would be the last day the Commodan would be as active, as Republic had already promised its aid in deconstructing the structure and returning all usable parts and components to Alexandria as raw salvage. Despite losing, the enigmatic city was nothing but a good sport of it. It had obeyed all of Alexandria&#39;s demands in the original treaty and even gone as far to suggest that a future business partnership was still possible, but only if Alexandria willed it.

Who could say? Elephants never forgot, but Alexandrians? Maybe.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1062492108851793930 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1062492108851793930><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Jan-23 08:04 AM">08:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Regardless, the contestants were allowed to party as they pleased, though the ones wondering more about their wishes were met with an odd silence. It felt suspicious...until they realized that it had simply been Alexandrian tardiness at work. Things felt a lot more sluggish after the post war celebrations, as if everyone wanted an excuse to skip work for the week to enjoy their newfound freedom.

All of the contestants would receive a letter congratulating them for their victory, along with a lengthy description of what their reward entailed. It was still a wish, of course, but one with many conditions and rules attached to it. In Alexandria&#39;s case, it was all about availability: They promised the victors the chance to peruse any form of data. Even those that were not shown off in the public librarians. However, some were off limits, requiring forms to be filled out and requests to be made. The usual bureaucratical ball ache. At the same time, nothing in the letter implied that the requests would be declined.

Those looking for something a bit more valuable were encouraged to contact the Alexandrian treasury, but also warned that anything that would tank the city&#39;s budget would be strongly declined. Instead, the letter recommended that they contacted the Neo Holy Empire instead, since as one of Alexandria&#39;s main supporters, they promised to handle any sort of issues that the city had, monetary or not.

For more specific wishes, the letter came with a form asking the contestant to write out a detailed description of what they wanted, along with instructions on mailing back. Expected response time ranged from a week to two. Perfectly in line for a city that was now far bustling with activity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1062492147523260457 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1062492147523260457><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Jan-23 08:04 AM">08:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The good news was that there was no rush. All Alexandria asked from its saviors was to be patient and wait. After all, could they really be blamed for focusing their time on their newfound freedom? Like a bird that had left a cage, they cared only about flying far away. Perhaps the winners should indulge as well. After all, they were practically on the same level as Heroic Spirits there!

<em>And so, the spring of 2105 started with a most bombastic celebration. Republic had been slighted, for the first time in what felt like a century. Alexandria had left its mark on the world and was now being championed as a new, promising upstart in global world matters.
