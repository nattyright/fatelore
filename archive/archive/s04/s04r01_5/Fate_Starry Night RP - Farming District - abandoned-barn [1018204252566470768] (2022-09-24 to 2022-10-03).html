<strong>THUMP!</strong>
&quot;Oh...&quot;

Small beams of early morning sun became swaths of rays as the barn door fell before Simon&#39;s slightest touch, pouring in and illuminating the floating particles of sawdust that swirled amidst them. The musty air catches both Simon and Saber, gripping them along with the pure isolation that came from the vacant lair. 

Simon had realized after their encounter in the Culinary Bazaar that if they were to build a workshop within public quarters, they&#39;d only find themselves running into trouble more and more. Whether that be from the general public, or from Alexandrian Masters. His original plan of seclusion became more of a necessity; to keep themselves hidden and to garner time to prepare, they would need to lie low to find the other Republic Masters. Hopefully the rest were strong, though he only had two real names to go off of: Lex Stravos and Alexander Vladisnov. While he couldn&#39;t find much on Lex Stravos, Simon found it easy enough to learn about Alexander, and the fact he had an actual leader of a nomadic city gave him a bit more confidence that he would be the man to talk to. If there were any candidates to lead the Republic side and potentially find the rest, it would be him. 

But, for now, Simon needed to find a location that would best suit both his and Grendel&#39;s Mother&#39;s interests. Unbeknownst to Saber, Simon had done some digging the previous night on her legend, taking into account the type of environment that she might enjoy. It wasn&#39;t blackmail or buttering up or anything like that. It was more...appeasement. The more he could stay on her good side, the better off they might be in the Grail War. They weren&#39;t off to a great start, admittedly, judging by the blank stares and admonishing she continues to assault him with, but he was hoping a change of scenery would placate her otherwise abrasive personality.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023758480303194235 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023758480303194235><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Sep-22 10:50 AM">10:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em> 
This barn didn&#39;t seem promising. Not only did the light illuminate a smog of dust, but it also revealed the years of worn wood that groaned and begged to be split just from Simon&#39;s anxious stares. The barn definitely had space, as evidenced by the vast open floor and broken down pens for what must have previously housed various farm animals. Small cracks gave way to more beacons that brought the smallest hints of morning into the darkest recesses of the barn, while the upper level had only a shabby and misleveled ladder leading up to it. The hanging boards and loose beams above didn&#39;t do much to convince Simon of the structural integrity of the house, nor did the dampness of the wood when he placed a hand against the broken down door. The wood must swelled along with the moisture in the air, complements of the surrounding marshland. It had been a short trek through it, as evidenced by the wet cuffs of Simon&#39;s new...<em>green</em> jeans. In addition to the new location, the boy had attempted to get a new wardrobe to better blend in. And while Saber may not fully comprehend modern fashion...it was abundantly clear that Simon had never actually dressed himself in his life. He wore a cream colored shirt with a rather garish image of some blue horned man holding a gun, along with a jacket that was just a bit too big for his frame. Nothing inherently ridiculous, but just off enough that it only accentuated the diminished form beneath. 

&quot;...We may have to keep looking,&quot; he said, though the dejection in his voice only pronounced how long the pair had been looking. The last barn didn&#39;t even have any walls, and before that they found a spot that seemed to have a stench that was more akin to an outhouse...

&quot;There should be a few more vacancies out further east. I asked around on some chatrooms, and it looks like a lot of this area couldn&#39;t be used for more traditional agriculture. At least there won&#39;t be many other people out here.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not inherently ideal, but it was workable to become a den. It seemed as if Simon did some reading on the servant he was paired up with, as long as it wasn’t from <em>her</em> book thinks would be okay. 

While Simon wore a rather foolish outfit, Saber’s style remained almost wholly unchanged. Aside from the addition of a pair of round rimmed sunglasses, sat neatly upon the bridge of her nose.  Another miscellaneous piece added to her collection in this new life. 

“I think this location can suit us well.” Saber spoke. Contradicting her master’s words about looking further for accommodations. Walking into the barn itself, she felt comfortable inside of its decrepit interior. “Unless you truly think we should search further, child.” She prodded testing to see how exactly Simon may respond to her words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His boots clomped over muddy terrain as he brushed cattails aside with his right hand, his left hand holding a phone to his ear. Alexander had been out running some errands, mainly picking up some useful supplies for his servant, all while scouting out the less mapped areas of Alexandria. This was a common procedure for Macedonian missionaries. While Alexander wasn’t a missionary, it would still be useful information to report back home. Alexander considered it vital to learn how other cities operated; this was essential to keep Macedon thriving and adapting to the world climate. This behavior was observed earlier with Alexander taking Ā-Q&#236;ng through the leisure district.

Pushing through a line of brush, Alexander would find himself staring at a rundown barn; It looked to be abandoned for some time. Certainly, no one was living there. His curiosity goaded him towards investigating it. However, it was probably a bad idea. Alexander had told Ā-Q&#236;ng to stay put while he ran some errands, but he was unsure the energetic child to keep herself contained for this long. On the other hand, the conflict hadn&#39;t been officially rung in, so perhaps some curiosity of her own would do well. It was decided Alexander would investigate the barn.

As the king walked towards the entrance of the barn, Simon and Saber would hear his wet boots stomping into the grass, a voice coming from the same direction. It sounded like someone was talking on the phone. “Yes, Aty, Alexandria is very pretty; no, you can&#39;t visit me, I&#39;m here for work. No, dear, you can&#39;t run the kingdom while I&#39;m on leave. Listen to what your mother says. Goodbye now, Aty, Daddy has to attend to some stuff.” A click could be heard as Alexander hung up the phone. A sigh left his mouth. Atalanta was just as high energy as Ā-Q&#236;ng. Work was getting rather taxing between wrangling one and answering constant calls from the other. At this point, Alexander wo</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024130077929250876 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024130077929250876><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Sep-22 11:27 AM">11:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>uld be coming up on the entrance to the barn.

It would have been noteworthy for Simon to craft his own response. However, the rustling of cattails in the distance took hold of his attention, as ripples in the shallow marsh roll through the brush to announce someone&#39;s arrival. Had they been found already? So easily? After all of that planning...

&quot;I...think this will have to do, now please, we have to hide,&quot; Simon whispers. He takes a look about, frantic before resting on the ladder leading to the floors above. He scurries forward, musty hay rolling beneath his feet as he grabs the rungs and hoists himself to the higher floor, all while looking back to Saber to do the same. She was hard to read before, but now with those sunglasses, he had no idea what she truly was thinking. 

&quot;<em>Saber, come on!</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Albeit wholly sinister coming from the matriarch&#39;s mouth. 

&quot;You hide, Child.&quot; Taking another step towards the front of the barn, she peaks out. Catching a glance of a red haired man, dressed rather out of place for being in such a muddy environment. &quot;I will not.&quot; Grendel&#39;s Mother&#39;s face became more monstrous while she held the brutal blade at her side. Ready to ambush Alexander the moment he stepped into the barn. 

However, with her face shifting. The Matriarch&#39;s new glasses no longer fit just right. Causing them to fall to the floor and making the slightest noise of glass cracking. Something that may clue the ever vigilant Alexander into others being within the barn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The clink of the glasses hitting the floor rang in his ears. Was someone there? In the middle of nowhere? He’d call it crazy, but after all, he was also investigating the run-down barn. Taking a second to think, Alexander decided it would be best to approach the entrance with care. His left hand reached behind his jacket gripping his shotgun, keeping it concealed in its back holster. His right hand cautiously grabbed a fine-cut diamond from his coat pocket, caressing it between the gaps of his knuckles.

“If someone is there, I am not coming to disturb you; I was simply taking a stroll” Alexander spoke up, rounding the corner of the barn. His eyes met Saber’s, his grip on both his concealed weapons. His worst fear may have been coming true. Despite how unlikely it was, did he come across an opponent? 

Alexander would wait for Saber to make a move. He was correct to have prepared a defense. If Saber wanted to, she could lunge forward and strike him before a word was even uttered. If this was a servant, Alexander was unsure if his diamond could repel her attack. His best hope was for Saber to be called off; however, he saw no sign of a potential master.

Then eye contact was made. And that tension in her body released. A full lunge as she moved towards her prey. Blade raised but stopped just centimeters away from him. “Friend. Or foe. Name yourself, intruder.” As saber’s face came into view Alex would notice its monstrous appearance. Terrible fangs came from her mouth along with other terrible features. But now being this close he could smell a faint scent of the ocean’s breeze. Her stature tall, imposing. Like a pillar of slate and obsidian. Blade rested in her hand a brutal chunk of iron meant for nothing but inflicting pain on others, just centimeters from meeting his flesh. 

“I said to speak.” Her tone was cold, apathetic. Most certainly one which fit such a monstrous visage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned slowly as his hands reached for the top, taking a look at their would be attacker...

&quot;FRIEND!&quot; He called back, abandoning all attempts at stealth as he waved at Saber, nearly falling from the ladder as it wobbled dangerously beneath his quickened footfalls, each ominous creak presenting a battle between caution and panic over Saber&#39;s tightening grip on her blade.

Just as Alexander was about pull out his weapon a voice cut the tension. &quot;FRIEND&quot; echoed through the musty barn, Alexander&#39;s eyes moving from Saber to Simon. Was this a Republic team? They knew who Alexander was and called off their attack. He had no reason to doubt Simon 

Alexander let out a deep breath, releasing the grip on his weapon, the diamond sliding back into his pocket. He stepped sideways away from Saber&#39;s blade, his eyes fixated on the apologetic boy. He looked... Young, really young. What situation would lead a child to participate in the war. Alexander tried for a moment to imagine one of his children doing his job. He shivered at the idea that any of them could do his work better. 

&quot;It seems you&#39;ve done your research. You&#39;re a Republic master I assume?&quot; Alexander stepped closer, his right hand reaching out towards Simon, gesturing for a handshake. &quot;Please introduce yourselves.

&quot;S-Simon. Despierro. I&#39;m the representative for my Father&#39;s house.&quot; Was his father famous enough to warrant an introduction? The boy had never really seen his father&#39;s name prop up in news media...if anything, he wondered if the Despierro name was more reclusive than anything. 

He shook the though, motioning towards Saber. &quot;This is my Servant, Saber. She-&quot; he began, but looked back to her, already feeling the potential mistake of addressing her in such a way.

And perhaps you can convince me to do more.” Her voice was cold towards her master as he and the Macedonian introduced themselves to each-other. 

“Yes. Class container is saber. My name is not of any importance to you.

Alexander&#39;s presence alone had caused the boy to stutter. Simon also appeared to be wary of his own servant, Alexander viewed this as a problem that needed to be fixed if Simon had any intentions of winning. 

Alexander had a habit of taking mental notes on every person he met, trying to work their personalities into his mind. This tendency was something the ruler picked up through countless negotiations. Knowing the crowd, both friend and foe, was a necessary skill for a cunning leader.

&quot;Well then Saber and Simon, it is nice to make your acquaintance. As Simon seems to have mentioned, I am Alexander Vladisnov, leader of my family and Macedon.&quot; Alexander stepped back as he introduced himself giving Simon some room. He positioned himself so he could see both Saber and her Master.

&quot;I must say, I am rather surprised to find someone else out here, let alone a teammate. I don&#39;t mean to pry but what exactly are you two doing here?&quot;

It was a tactical advantage, clearly. A lone barn in the midst of a wasteland of unusable crop and farmland, what else could it be but the perfect place to perform research and plan future strikes against the Alexandrian team? 

A bold faced lie, that would be. And by far, lying was not one of Simon&#39;s strong suits. No, to say something so abhorrently false would sour Alexander on him completely. And he couldnt have that. This man was the closest thing he had to a lifeline out here...

&quot;...I figured I&#39;d make it easier on my team if I stayed out of the way.&quot; Simon didn&#39;t even dare to look Alexander in the eye, nor could he turn to face Saber&#39;s bored reading. He didn&#39;t know if she was actually absorbed in the text or if she was pretending. Either way she gave off such a placid air that he couldn&#39;t bear to face. 

&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m not very...I&#39;m not cut out for this war, Alexander,&quot; he states. He would just have to be blunt...lay it on the line for the man. At the very least he could potentially relay the information to the rest of his team. &quot;My father sent me here as a test...one I&#39;m not sure I can complete. I don&#39;t even know why Republic wants the data from the archives, or why my Father&#39;s interested in it, but...it&#39;s better if I stay out of everyone else&#39;s path. I saw on the list that my father even mandated I go last. I guess, if nothing else, to make the match inconsequential. By that point, the tournament may be decided. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for, anyway.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yes, what Simon needed was purpose. 

&quot;You are not here on your own accord?&quot; Alexander brushed his hand through his beard thinking about how to console the boy. &quot;Do not think of why you are here, instead think of what you should do to leave. If you are afraid to die, Simon, you must fight. If you cower you will expose your weakness to the enemy.&quot; As Alexander spoke he stepped closer to Simon, his eyes gazing intensely through his glasses. 

&quot;We have spoken for less than a minute, yet you have exposed your weakness to me. You must remedy this weakness by finding your ambition! Tell me Simon what will you do after the war, what is your goal?&quot;

The world was already so vast just from coming to Alexandria, but even this hasn&#39;t done much to quell that initial desire. The sights were unnecessary to his goal, so he hadn&#39;t bothered to explore them, or even think about them as worthy of himself to see. Why should he enjoy himself, after all? This isn&#39;t a fun trip through Alexandria, this was a Holy Grail War. What use did he have for museums or night clubs? What was waiting for him after this war? That mansion, more training by his grandfather, Caster&#39;s sneering glances and his father&#39;s back turned on him...Priscilla&#39;s blank stares.

However something in the conversation drew her in. The talk of conviction.  Ambition. What did Simon wish to see himself become. And the boy spoke meekly. “Child.” Grendel’s Mother broke her silence and looked at Simon. “Speak it again. More conviction.” She almost ordered but her tone still seemed disinterested.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;ve never really had to think about what I want, Alexander. It was either told to me or...I just wanted to want something, I guess. I figured it was just part of what I am...&quot;

His eyes turn back to Alexander, not wanting to face it but feeling the potential for judgement in his gaze. Did he know...would it change things? He wasn&#39;t human.

&quot;I think I understand how you feel Simon... At least somewhat.&quot; Alexander would release his gaze from Simon, alleviating the intensity. He would make his way over to a pile of dusty wooden crates, dusting them off and taking a seat. 

&quot;I lived in my father&#39;s shadow for the better part of my childhood. My magecraft, the way I speak, even the way I think are all parts of me that were meticulously crafted by that man. It was only later in life that I broke from my shell. Forming my own ambition, learning to seek what I wanted... Saber is correct, you need to speak with more conviction.

&quot;...I don&#39;t know if I have the ability for such things, Alexander,&quot; he speaks, gazing at another corner of the barn, deciding to rest down in the shade amidst the molded straw. &quot;I mean...I want to.

Strands of white swing in the gentle breeze from his bangs, veiling his vision. He absently rubs a few between his fingers, letting the sheen of silver color the barn before he violently plucks them away. He glared at them before letting them drift softly to the barn floor, plucked and wilted strands blending into the faded straw.

&quot;So what!&quot; Alexander spoke with a ferocious intensity.

You can think just as well and learn as all others do. Life is not decided at birth, it is you who decides what kind of life you lead.

Should you choose to strive for greatness here and now, then there is no way to know if you would have made the same decision if your life was any different .&quot;

Alexander spoke of &#39;ifs&#39; and &#39;whats&#39; his personal philosophy mimicking that of a Cartesian thinker, such was the Macedon way. &quot;Simon, you hold onto what you think you know, but consider that everything you know about is through the lens of your father. To look inward, unlearn what you have been taught, shed away the biases of yourself and learn what you are really capable of.&quot;

Alexander continued to lay out the Macedon ideology. Everything was full of biases that clouded our knowledge. Truth was only achievable if we unlearned that tainted knowledge and began again.

In this moment, with the fading rays of morning finally receding behind the barn...

It was the one thing he needed to hear the most.

&quot;...I can try,&quot; Simon says, not entirely sure how to respond to the leader of Macedon. It was either this or spend the entire war hiding, so at the very least he might as well attempt some self-discovery. Would it linger? Time will tell...

&quot;I&#39;ll definitely try. Though...I&#39;d rather stay in this spot. I think it&#39;ll be easier to do that unlearning without enemy masters coming for me...actually, speaking of, why are you even out here, Alexander?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was certain that with the right guidance, Simon could become a reliable asset in the war. Just like Ā-Q&#236;ng he saw potential that needed to be fine tuned. Alexander would make sure that this war went the Republics way, he needed to for his people.

&quot;Why am I here?&quot; Alexander repeated. Repeating questions was a habit of Alexander&#39;s, he always filled the room with words to give himself time to formulate a response. &quot;I was doing a bit of scouting around Alexandria. Even though the city is well mapped, I figured it would be a good idea to see the areas for myself. Should trouble arise outside of planned circumstances, then I want to be ready. I have come fully prepared to win this war and I will do everything I can to ensure that happens.&quot;

She was a nice girl who wouldn&#39;t purposely make Alexander mad, but he also didn&#39;t trust her to stay in one spot.

&quot;My Servant is currently staying back while I Investigate.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a lie, but definitely a stretch of truth. Alexander had really told Ā-Q&#236;ng to stay behind because he knew she would serve as a distraction to his protocol. Mapping out the city was important and any interference surely would have frustrated him. 

&quot;Speaking of which I should probably get headed back.&quot; Alexander stood from the box, dusting off his pants. He pulled a business card from under his jacket approaching Simon. &quot;This has all of my contact information. If you need me, just let me know. I look forward to working with the both of you.&quot; With that Alexander would turn around and make his leave. He would walk as fast as he could, a strong suspicion led him to believe that Ā-Q&#236;ng didn&#39;t stay out of trouble.
