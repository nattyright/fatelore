The Nightlife District grew brighter by the night. Gatsby&#39;s parties had spread across Alexandria like wildfire, spread further by Niccol&#242; Paganini seemingly taking up residence in Gatsby&#39;s manor to play every evening. 

While they came for Paganini&#39;s music, they stayed for the broad array of food, beverage, and to interact with one another. In a way, <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#this-side-of-paradise</span> had become another bar on the block.

Alexandrian officials were left completely flabbergasted by Gatsby&#39;s sudden appearance. It was like the character had been lifted from the pages of his novel, and plastered right in their backyard. When confronted, Gatsby just laughed and invited them in.

There were even rumors that members of Alexandria&#39;s tournament board had visited the party. In fact, there was a rumor that they would be visiting <strong>tonight.</strong>

Yet the mansion still hosted a party, and Paganini strummed his violin absentmindedly, playing one of his personal tunes. However, at the entrance to the manor were a pair of troublemakers. What would they get up to, this time? Would the punch bowl be safe? How many macrons was it socially acceptable to stuff into your pocket for later? 

These were the questions society would soon find out...

It started off super strong with the whole heist and fight late at night and that early morning wasn’t bad either once Hannibal started talking again (Sorry but I’m still going to call you that in here, I don’t think we have to worry about mind reading. I hope, anyway…). 

The tapering off as the day went on wasn’t bad. A mid day nap took care of any tired feelings creeping up on her and she’d need the energy for what she had planned tonight. Yes, it was going to be big and it was going to be fun. Yet her mind wasn’t on another big steal. Now that she got her own treasure by her own work and not out of charity, she had to increase its value as it already was depreciating itself. Luckily for her, she knew someone who knew how to make everything shine brighter.

“Come on, Rider! We can’t just wait for anything to come our way. In this world it’s all about making it or breaking it and I’m not about to let you break yourself!” Amelia said, basically bouncing around the attic as she sifted through scattered clothing and tossing one or two on her bed. 

The whole process looked like she was picking out pieces at random, a fluffy brown canvas jacket, a green sundress, mismatched stockings, etc. Yet when she put them all on, they worked together oddly well. She had not put together a similar set for Rider and had turned to face her rather quizzically.

“Hey are you going to pick something nice to wear? I’m not sure how the host would feel if you wore armor to a fancy party. That’s right, we’re going to live it up tonight so make something nice for yourself! There’s probably something for you in one of those trunks. There’s a lot of stuff the family’s collected and it would be good to put it to use.”

Later that evening, they came upon the mansion and Amelia tugged her servant along as she weaved through the streets and lines before they reached its gates.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023861501553037334 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023861501553037334><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Sep-22 05:40 PM">17:40</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Alright Hanny, sorry Rider.

Mr. Gatsby really knows how to make the place live up to its name…” Amelia blissfully sighed, her eyes already awash with adoration and anticipation.

“And hey who knows, they say anything’s possible here, and honestly I believe it. You know one time they actually got bonafide servants to throw on a big show, fought each other and then as you’d think they die, <strong>POOF</strong> they turn into a shower of all kinds of goodies for people to keep.

While it seems like she wanted to get a head set in the competition, with a rather unusual set of clothes but she wasn&#39;t going to judge, the truth of their next move came at such a surprise to Rider. 

&quot;Hah?&quot; A party? She can&#39;t be serious! Aren&#39;t Grail wars suppose to be taken seriously! Why are they going to a party out of all things?! 

She took a quick glance at the trunk she was meant to procure her outfit from before trying to reason with Amelia. &quot;Surely you can&#39;t be serious about this. There are plenty of other great options we could do inst-&quot;

&quot;...This is going to be a long night&quot;

No amount of words could have convinced Amelia to change their course of action. So, despite Rider&#39;s attempts to stop her Master, both of them were at the gates of the party.

Hannibal wore a sleek black suit with purple accents after the initial dress choice was met with an ill fate, definitely not caused by a sword of some kind. Her hair was let down opposed to her usual ponytail style. This allowed her crimson hair to flow freely even in the gentlest of breezes. Even with the drastic change in appearance, the eyepatch stayed.

Hey, at least the place looked pretty nice.

&quot;Um, sure.&quot; Rider sighed as she rubbed the bridge of her nose as Amelia went on about the place. &quot;Just try and keep a low profile. We don&#39;t know if our enemies are lurking about.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024151587125469214 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024151587125469214><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Sep-22 12:52 PM">12:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A massive table was loaded with delectable treats, ranging from stuffed pastries to thick gravies to perfectly seasoned meats. A true continental breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

Amelia didn&#39;t need much motivation, but Hannibal...

The musician completely disregarded the two—it was likely he couldn&#39;t even see them from his perch—as he strummed at his harp. The expression on his face was similar to those of the Roman soldiers Hannibal fought against in life: a man on the cusp of barely restrained violence at any moment. He was a descendent of them, and yet his expression was wrong.

Unfortunately, his visage was ruined slightly by a pair of bright pink fuzzy earmuffs. What a fashion statement!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why would we want to lay low, I want to meet Mr. Gatsby!&quot; Amelia shot back, her mind already fixated on the music that was beckoning her from within the mansion. If Hannibal tried to keep her in place for any longer, she&#39;d be able to see her physically vibrate in place from the anticipation as for what was to come. 

What was inside was well worth the wait and Amelia&#39;s eyes swelled at the feast laid out before them. It smelled absolutely heavenly, looked absolutely delicious and was no doubt absolutely free to be stuffed into her pockets and gorged upon later.  And of course she already had a kebab in one hand and a pastry in her mouth. 

While she was picking out the choice bits to save for later, her body was already letting the music flow through her and give her movements a matching rhythm. First it was her foot tapping along then it was her hips, little movements in her arms and then her head nodding along with the tune while a little hum mimicked it. 

Without looking behind, Amelia wandered off into the crowd surrounding the musician and dancing all the while. Sometimes she was dancing alone, skimming the edges , other times picking a partner that caught her eye and dancing and flirting in a carefree way that only a child of the wind could do.  Regardless of the situation, she was always in motion and always moving to a new section of the room, taking in the flood of sensations.

This truly was paradise for her and it was hard for her to imagine this party ever ending. It could have easily been one of the vivid dreams she had after finishing a novel or a week&#39;s adventure. Now all she needed to do was meet the man who made such a dream...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024494316888006717 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024494316888006717><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Sep-22 11:34 AM">11:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For Hannibal, it was almost if her master was flying around the place.

The only way she could notice her at this point was her high-energy attitude. 

With her face in her palm, Rider let out a disgruntled sigh before the musical tones slowly started to affect her. Something about the tones in the air helped her to settle down a little. The work of a Servant? Probably that bard with the weird headwear. It doesn&#39;t seem malicious in nature so she didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. Besides, there was something else that caught her attention even more.

A few sniffs of the air was all it took for her to recognize the familiar smell. 

&quot;Hey, is that...?&quot; A cloud of disbelief befell Rider as she made her way to the banquet table with caution. Even upon seeing what was laid out on the table, it was still hard to believe. There were pastries from Carthage set out as snacks. She never thought she would see them again, let alone experience them. These had to be illusions. Only one way to find out though. 

<em>crunch</em>

The flaky texture of the pastry provided a wonderful first bite of a time long gone. One inhale after the bite and, for a brief moment, Rider was back home. Who knew when she could experience this again? With that in mind, there was only one real option.

Thanks to Spriggy, she was able to keep Amelia within her sights. Oh yeah, right. The Grail war. 

&quot;Ahem. Um, thanks. I lost myself for a bit.&quot; Rider cleared her throat after she swallowed the rest down.

Gatsby wore a pressed white suit with gold thread that somehow remained immaculate despite Hannibal&#39;s shower of crumbs. One landed on his collar, before <em>hopping</em> off and rolling onto the ground. 

Was this man the mana signature Hannibal was sensing? He was so faint! Compared to her, he was nothing! Of all the Servants in the party, this one certainly had the weakest Spirit Origin. How was he even manifested here?

&quot;Sorry, how rude. I&#39;m Gatsby! Thank you for coming to my party.&quot; Gatsby said casually, almost standoffishly. However, he kept looking at Spriggy.

&quot;That eyepatch of yours is quite exotic! I knew I recognized you from that list I got to peek at! To think someone as awesome as you would show up at my own party!&quot; Gatsby&#39;s eyes sparkled. Hannibal could almost see little sparkles and stars form around the American.

&quot;This is rude, but may I pet that little creature?&quot; Gatsby asked?

He wanted to pet <strong>the</strong> Spriggy? Gatsby? Spriggy was quite cuddly, who knew that all it took to draw out Gatsby was to have a fuzzy critter. Hannibal would have to take a note.

He definitely had the bearing of a servant, and it wasn&#39;t just the way the music enchanted everyone in the party. No, she couldn&#39;t quite place it but even with his baggy attire, something about his body proportions seemed off. She&#39;d tried her hand at guitar before and there was no way anyone normal could play that number and range of strings. 

It was both awesome and weird, not that those two were exclusive in any way. If anything, it just added to the appeal of the performer. That and the earmuffs were pretty cute too...

While Amelia was dancing and wandering around the mansion, she was blissfully unaware that the main person she was seeking out was just chatting it away with Rider and her familiar. 

This was Spriggy&#39;s night, undoubtedly. All he had to do was occassionally raise his nose, sort out Amelia&#39;s scent and nudge his mount towards her a little ways. Then he could sit, sneak a bite of Hannibal&#39;s pastry and hog up the attention he rarely got. 

One man (Not-man? Mana scent off. Too strong for human, weak for servant, not hurt. Must sniff.) approached the would-be pirate and her enterprising fluffy parrot and showered them in attention. The fluffy little <s>frog</s> <s>hamster</s> <s>flattened parrot?</s> critter tilted its flat head to the side as it regarded the man from his lofty perch. Man-Not-Man seemed friendly enough so he bowed his head and offered the mottled ridge of his neck and back to be petted.

Of course when Gatsby would accept the offer, Spriggy would press up against the hand and sniff at his wrist with a moist nose that tickled the skin. His fur was silky and had a scent not unlike fresh thyme. It was a warm and invigorating presence almost purpose-made to keep up with its master.

When Gatsby was done, Spriggy made a pawing motion in the air and then nodded towards the snack bar. The little critter was bold enough to demand payment!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024868647744839771 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024868647744839771><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Sep-22 12:22 PM">12:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;<strong>Wherethehelldidyoucomefrom!?</strong>&quot; Her words were shot out in rapid succession. She tried her best not to jump from her spot too much from the sudden Servant appearance. Unless he was there this whole time and she was the one who came up to him first. Gods, Rider hoped that wasn&#39;t the case. She&#39;s more preceptive than that! She swears!

Then the man introduced himself. 

Did the eyepatch really give her away that easily? No. He said he looked at a list. If he had a list then he knew her True Name already. &quot;Damnit...&quot; She cursed under her breath as there wasn&#39;t any way to get around it. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you as well, Mr. Gatsby. I&#39;ll be honest. Your party is a lot nicer than I thought it would be.&quot; Was that an underhanded compliment or simply the best she could come up with? Who knows!

Luckily, Rider didn&#39;t need to linger on that thought much longer as Spriggy became the centre of attention. Thank you, Spriggy! 

&quot;Oh? This thing? Well, I&#39;m not reall-&quot; Before she could finish her sentence, Spriggy took the initiative and offered to let the man pet them. Then, for what might be the first time since she got summoned, Rider let out a small genuine chuckle at Spriggy&#39;s bold demands. &quot;Looks like you got yourself a tough customer, Mr. Gatsby.

He couldn&#39;t help himself. Gatsby picked up Spriggy and rubbed their cheeks together. &quot;Aren&#39;t you the cutest little thing!&quot; He hummed, sparkling. After several moments, he returned Spriggy to Hannibal, and coughed awkwardly into his fist and clapped his hands together, bowing in apology.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! That was extremely rude! Please forgive my impudent act.&quot; After a few moments, he opened his eyes, as if expecting Hannibal to lop off his head. After she didn&#39;t, he sighed in relief and stood up.

&quot;If my party is considered excellent by <em>the</em> Hannibal, then that&#39;s good enough for me.&quot; Gatsby said proudly, before looking her over. His eyes lingered for a moment, and he looked away. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize so many Heroic Spirits were the opposites of what they were in recorded history. There&#39;s always more to learn about this world. It&#39;s exciting!&quot;

How did he know who she was? A true mystery. 

&quot;You say it&#39;s better than you expected. Are you not the partygoing type? if there&#39;s anything I can do to make it more accommodating, please let me know! The same goes for your Master. Speaking of...&quot;

When he was returned to his crow&#39;s nest aboard the S.S. Hannibal, Spriggy stood proud and satisfied, blessing both servants with a melodic series of chirps. And when Gatsby submitted himself for judgement, Spriggy staid his hand and urged Hannibal to do the same, pressing against her cheek for emphasis. Man-Not-Man was a good snuggler and deserved to live for the potential for more headpats. 

The only things that could bring him down from his little Cloud Nine were the lack of food offered before him and the lack of Amelia within eyesight. At this dismay, Spriggy folded his front paws ontop of his flat head, or at least as much as he could manage. He mewwed weakly for food, half-heartedly doing the same pawing motion as before, now only his eyes flicking over to the food table. What an unfortunate turn of events...

Meanwhile, Amelia felt carried on wind and song, drifting, swirling through the halls and humming the musician&#39;s tune as it grew faint. Like an Olympic torchbearer, it was her duty to keep the flame of song alive as long as she could, or at least until she found another fire to oogle over.

Fortune had it in for her for so many valuables lined the halls only to be reflected as energetic glimmers in her wide eyes and fanciful objects in her mind. Very few were around, she could take one or two, couldn&#39;t she? They would be hers and if anyone said no, Hannibal could knock them out!

Couldn&#39;t they speak up? She was trying to learn a new secret! This was like in those spy movies where the heroic main character discovered something that would throw their worldview for a spin.

Maybe they were discussing Alexandria&#39;s secret capabilities as a mecha! Maybe a secret weapon to defeat Republic with? Oh! Perhaps it was the summoning of a new Servant! So many possibilities...

As she pushed her ear closer and closer, she heard a faint discussion.

&quot;<strong>That man is nuts, wanting to participate in the tournament. Why did you push me to agree with it, you dunce!</strong>&quot; One man moaned, voice scratchy. &quot;<strong>If Republic finds out we&#39;re using two Servants as Master-Servant candidates, they&#39;ll eat us alive. It&#39;ll be over!</strong>&quot;

Amelia&#39;s ears perked up. The tournament? Her gears turned. Oh, the tournament. Two Servants were competing together as a team? Was that even possible? Or even allowed?

&quot;What&#39;s the big issue? Are we sure that man is even the Jay Gatsby from the old stories? I&#39;m not even sure he&#39;s a Servant.&quot; Another man with a deep voice scoffed. &quot;<strong>His mana signature is a joke. Last I checked, there isn&#39;t even a Jay Gatsby in the archives over at ServantPedia™️.</strong>&quot;

&quot;There is, though.&quot; A third voice, light and energetic, interjected. &quot;It just showed up a few days ago. It hasn&#39;t even been verified by an admin, yet. Someone probably just summoned him, realized he was third-rate, and cut him loose.&quot;

To poor Amelia, it seemed like these three were bashing Mr. Gatsby! How cruel!

&quot;His personality is polite. I wouldn&#39;t mind taking his core once this tournament is over and putting him to work. Unlike his Servant, hah!&quot; The second voice said, chuckling. &quot;How that man managed to convince that music-obsessed lunatic is beyond me.

Waste of a frame. <strong>Could give the people a martyr to fight for.</strong>&quot;

Silence.

&quot;That&#39;s the only reason this idea is worth considering. Paganini is the lynchpin. Using him to boost the morale of Alexandria is a clever thought. Gatsby thought of everything.&quot; The third voice said, voice amused.

&quot;How does he even know half the things he does?&quot; The second complained. &quot;Look at this.&quot; The sound of something being removed from the table could be heard.

&quot;It&#39;s an &#233;clair.&quot; The first voice said, as if talking to a child.

&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s gluten-free. I only mentioned that I couldn&#39;t eat gluten in passing, and he made sure to put out food for me anyway! Not even the secretaries for the rest of the <strong>tournament board</strong> do that for me!&quot;

The other two voices laughed.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="01-Oct-22 05:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025666776924688434 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025666776924688434><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Oct-22 05:13 PM">17:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While the question of how did he knew about her True Name was still in her head, the festive mood of the music kept her at a more calm state, albeit embarrassed from the praise.

&quot;You really don&#39;t need to be bending over backwards just for someone like me. I mean come on, I lost after all.&quot; Rider rubbed the back of her neck after she finished that last bit. Thankfully Amelia wasn&#39;t around to hear any of this from her. 

&quot;Just one of Rome&#39;s many victories.&quot; 

That last bit wasn&#39;t spoken to Gatsby specifically. It was more so to herself. The greatest general Carthage has ever known to grace Her lands was such a mood killer! Even at one of the greatest parties being held in Alexandria! 

The sad mewls of Spriggy caught attention shortly after however. Once glance around the room was all she needed to realize what could be the issue. Wait a second, where <strong>is</strong> her Master actually?

The excitable ball of wind and energy should be easily noticeable in this crowd, especially with her outfit, and yet she saw none of it. Damnit! She knew if she looked away for one second this would happen!

&quot;Where has she gone now?...&quot; Like a frustrated mother, Rider sighed with her hand on her head. Looks like she might have to start a little search party.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025864811449438258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025864811449438258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 06:20 AM">06:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There seemed to be three? people in there and they were talking about the very person she wanted to find. How exciting! She really was a spy today though no spy had the same fashion sense as her but that was fine. Only would make them less likely to think she was one!

It seemed Gatsby was actually posing as a master for the musician, that was new... (Hey wait! I just had that idea yesterday, joking with Hannibal. Mhmm hmmm, clearly I have more good ideas than I thought.) The legality of the matter didnt bother Amelia, only the novelty of the approach and the potential it had drew her interest. It could be a big advantage for Alexandria. That would make, what, two Zerkers. Very cool!

The people held mixed opinions of their host and badmouthing him like that made Amelia want to barge in and show they what&#39;s what. However the mention of food made her anger dissapate as she reached into her pocket to grab a pastry to snack on as she continued to listen. She was about to take a bite when the smell hit her. Wait, how did Gatsby knew she liked Chamolile-infused Sweet Rolls? Did she tell him that in the past or could his NP be that his house could read her mind and recreate anything she desired? 

it was a pretty wild idea that spooked and fascinated her to no end. Next time she came, she&#39;d have to test that theory out or wear some type of foil covering...

She did pull out one of her Swiss Army Roots and began absentmindedly shaping it into a wedge. If those rude people ever detected her, at least it would buy her another second to escape maybe. But she hoped that wouldn&#39;t need to happen. They just needed to keep yapping away and let her take their secrets.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025884176873947138 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025884176873947138><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 07:37 AM">07:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wiped a tear from his eye.

&quot;Sorry, you remind me of that musician.&quot; Gatsby nodded to Paganini, who was strumming his harp. &quot;Letting the failures of the past define you. Here&#39;s a pearl of wisdom that might get through your head. I&#39;m unsure if he just doesn&#39;t listen, or if it&#39;s because he&#39;s a Berserker:&quot;

&quot;Defeat is the fertilizer of hope, Hannibal.&quot; Gatsby said, plucking two glasses of champagne from a passing familiar, sniffing one, and passing the other to Hannibal.

His tone was thoughtful, as if musing something that had happened during his life. Gatsby was a fictional Heroic Spirit, allegedly, stemming from a book written over a hundred and fifty years ago. His entire existence could never be verified.

&quot;You were one of Rome&#39;s only great adversaries! Even if you were defeated, you placed <em>hope</em> in the arms of every person who ever opposed a foreign power.  Every person who fights against a larger nation will have your name on their lips!&quot; Gatsby paused, sipping his champagne, before swirling the glass thoughtfully.

&quot;Okay, well, maybe not <em>truly</em>, but they will have your motivations in their heart! You had freedom to fight, to live, and to die! As someone who existed as words on a page...&quot; Gatsby trailed off, ashamed of his next words. &quot;...<strong>I&#39;m envious of that freedom.</strong>&quot;

Coughing to hide his embarrassment, Gatsby took another sip. &quot;At every moment of every day, I feel compelled to ask my actions are the results of <strong>event flags</strong> from one of those visual novels or choose-your-own-adventure books. It&#39;s a terrible headache, I assure you.&quot;

A look of confusion painted her face as she wondered what was so funny about the situation. Before she could open her mouth to ask that very question, it was already answered for her not moments after.

A champagne glass was soon placed in her hand. The subtle aroma of it just barely breaking the others caused by the banquet table. Whether through an Noble Phantasm or not, Gatsby surely spared no expense when it came to his party, if there were any, of course.

With her words plucked from her mouth by Gatsby, she listened to what he had to say.

&quot;Hope, huh?&quot;

Hannibal stared into her glass to gaze upon her reflection. One of Rome&#39;s greatest adversaries. While doubts still flowed through her mind, such as the fate of her People due to her defeat and letting down those who believed in her, Gatsby&#39;s words managed to find a faint ember inside of her. It was a slow progress but, thanks to him, there was something there.

<em>&quot;<strong>...I&#39;m envious of that freedom.</strong>&quot;</em>

Those words from him brought her attention from her reflection back onto him. A scoff then left her lips. A sound that was proof that whatever Gatsby said was working, slightly. Well, in terms of her mood, at least. 

&quot;I am curious now, what would you do if you had the freedom you desired, Mr. Gatsby? Would you still throw parties?&quot; A rhetorical question, of course. Neither of them had the means to know after all. 

&quot;If you were given the chance to wish upon a Grail...&quot; A swig from the champagne glass threw suspense in the air on what her next words could be until she spoke once more. &quot;...<strong>would that be your wish?</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026068525305045052 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026068525305045052><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 07:49 PM">19:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She waited and waited and waited... Yet they never touched on anything that seemed remotely exciting. That initial fascination evaporated and was replaced by a suffocating boredom. Sure they were talking about their personal lives but there was like zero gossip, no controversy, nada. Just ancedotes that would get like a snort at most. 

She ended up banging her head against the wall from the mind-numbing conversations, like it was basically lulling her into a trance. Of course, hitting one&#39;s head tends to knock them right out of that and with the curiosity of the people inside piqued, this was the perfect time for her to leave. Yet not before she jammed the wedge-like root into the door frame and giving the guests a challenge.

Thus she flew away, walking at a slightly faster pace. Her steps felt lighter, like there was less weighing her down. Wait, there should be some weight on her. Where was Spriggy? For that matter, how come Hannibal disappeared too. She thought Riders were supposed to be the quickest servants around yet hers couldn&#39;t keep up? There was training she would have to give that Carthaginian.

The music would end up being her guide, like Jason&#39;s string letting him retrace his steps through the Labyrinth, leading her back to the heart of the party and the refreshments. There among the crowd stood a particular redhead in a purple suit and eyepatch, and a particular fluffy mascot on their shoulder. OK there was no one else that could possibly, especially in her mind and so she made her way over, deciding to weave amidst the crowd, doing her best not to be seen until it was too late.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026260859649019995 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026260859649019995><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Oct-22 08:34 AM">08:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Hey Hannibal, I missed ya! Shoulda come out on the dance floor with me, would have been great!&quot; Amelia said, bouncing into view at Hannibal&#39;s side and giving her a light ribing with her elbow. &quot;Or we could have toured the mansion together. Mr. Gatsby&#39;s got some fascinating stuff.&quot;

&quot;Oh hey you got a friend here already! That&#39;s perfect. Have you seen why I wanted to drag you along to this? Maybe feeling better already eh?&quot; She looked over Hannibal&#39;s companion, nodding at his taste in clothes and general vibe. Very slick, very cool, definitely had drip to his fit.

Seeing Spriggy, she gave him a good long headpat, a light rustling and a few pretzel sticks to chew on. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t think I forgot about you little guy.&quot;

&quot;We all good to go?&quot;

He couldn&#39;t blame her. His story was not popular. He was not famous outside of fringe circles.

&quot;I have to, don&#39;t I? If I don&#39;t host these parties, how will my Daisy know that I am here? The idea of the love of my life missing me by a hair is almost too much to bear!&quot; He shuddered at the prospect, before looking out over the party. &quot;Look at these people, Hannibal.&quot;

&quot;They are the subject of an invasion. At any moment, Republic could betray their word and invade Alexandria at the snap of a finger. Yet what are they doing? Laughing and enjoying themselves. See, my wish is simple: <strong>I want everyone to be happy. For her.</strong>&quot;

That seemed obscene, especially to a conqueror like Hannibal. There were always winners and losers in history, who were killed mercilessly in a field that would be long forgotten.

Yet Gatsby expressed such hope in the prospect of a brighter tomorrow, compared to any other person the conqueror had met. He truly believed that she, and everyone else deserved nothing but the best in life. That was not possible. How could any person harbor that much benevolence? 

Choking on his champagne as Amelia appeared, Gatsby started choking for a moment. His eyes watered as he looked down at Amelia, and his eyes brightened.

&quot;You must be Hannibal&#39;s Master. You&#39;re adorable! You have a very good Servant, little lady. You&#39;re lucky. Very lucky indeed!&quot; Gatsby nodded to Hannibal, before straightening his suit. &quot;I must be going. There are things to be done! Contracts to sign! Tournaments to win! Feel free to stop by, any time! Especially regarding the tournament. I think we could think of something truly spectacular!&quot;

Gatsby disappeared into the crowd as Amelia dragged Hannibal away. However, one question remained in the conqueror&#39;s mind as Amelia dragged her off.

<strong>Just who was Jay Gatsby?</strong>

And thus, the curtains closed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
