A city that <em>revived</em> passions that were once lost. Crystalizations of human knowledge took shape and nearly gathered themselves onto this Stella Maris.

There were no hunting grounds, of course, nor a lush greenery that could serve the same purpose. Human progress seeped into every crevice of the district.

The city was massive. To tour the whole thing wasn’t a task that could be completed within a day. Lea’s role as a tour guide extended into the night— even if she was doing a rather… terrible job at it.

“And before us, we have the Gogh Gallery!”

Barging into the public gallery with no tact, she introduced the building to Nimrod. Even if her attention was divided between her new Servant and her phone.

 “This place is… well, as you can see, honestly. Its just a place with lots of paintings. It’s not a very fun place. Don’t really get the charm myself.”

Lea considered herself a historian. At least, in the sense that she was invested in preserving history. But… she didn’t perceive much interest from paintings. Paintings couldn’t be used in warfare. The world could digitally be captured by cameras.

It was worth preserving, obviously. But—
 “Don’t really come here often. Anything in particular catch your eye?”

She <em>was</em> a tad bit curious as to how Nimrod perceived the place, though. The Hubric King made it a point to get his obsession over human progress known. Where this art gallery would fall in that lens was at least a little attention piquing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024147566327242792 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024147566327242792><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Sep-22 12:36 PM">12:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Oh, and that aside… you don’t mind if we meet up with some guests now, do we?”

As soon as her summoning finished, she posted a picture of Nimrod online. She left out the True Name, of course… even if the risk of his general identity being narrowable by his outfit was very present, she would rather have the gratification of boasting about her shiny new toy.

The other party claimed to be a fellow Master from Alexandria, which meant she had little to no reason to hold herself back: Might as well show off a little!

 Her preparations were perfect, after all.

&quot;Look good, Nimrod.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It went without saying that <em>anyone</em> with access to ServantPedia™️ could easily deduce the identity of a Servant through their appearance, even without prior knowledge on Servants or history. The wonders of the CWW allowed one to find great deals of information through but a simple picture, and that went doubly so for Alexandria&#39;s CWW, as it hosted the one and only <em>master copy of the ServantPedia™️ archives</em>.

As such, when Thomas caught whiff of a certain Servant&#39;s picture floating on the <em>Alexandria image boards</em>, he wasted no time and immediately contacted their Master. If Thomas was right about their identity, which he was 99% sure he was, then that Servant could be <em>key</em> to win their next tournament fight. But to make sure it wasn&#39;t a fake, he had to meet the person behind the username &#39;wardoc_1&#39;. Hence why he and Lewis were walking across the streets of the Academy District, liberally strolling towards the rendez-vous point.

Usually, the blonde wouldn&#39;t go that far just to get an extra edge in battle. Meeting a stranger from the CWW... nay, a <em>Master</em> which so casually displayed and boasted about their Servant&#39;s identity, was a risk he was uninspired to take. Only, this was no regular fight. Thomas had taken any chance he could get in order to win, even if it meant allying himself with a pompous Master with little to no common sense.

As they approached their objective, Thomas got his phone out and unlocked it with a finger.

There was nothing fun about still pictures, or portraits, or flowers, or anything of the sort. If anything, Jefferson would have liked this stuff a lot more than he did, the boring silence that would consume his time for the . . . Hour or two that they’d be there. 

Thomas’ question of his expected behavior elicited a sigh from his servants mouth, his face dropping to mimic his dower attitude at the idea that they had to visit an art museum. When he didn’t give much a response, he felt the urge that silence would have meant the trip would have been over. . . And we’ll, adventure wouldn’t have been fun if they stayed at Barnes’ home forever. He looked at the ground, disappointment in his voice.

“Don’t touch the paintings. . . But do we really have to go here? Can’t we go to Waku Waku Alexandria? The signs say there’s a boat ride across the waterfront! I don’t want to go to an art museum with snobs, I’m not Jefferson.”

His snide comment would have meant something if the lad had known Jefferson in life, but to Thomas <em>Barnes</em> this couldn’t have done anything but paint a picture he couldn’t even give life to. Meanwhile, as they ventured closer and closer to the place they needed to be, Lewis dreaded more and more the boring exhibit.

On the whole the King had found himself impressed by the city. Considering the state of the world he had been somewhat unsure of the sight that would greet him. Thankfully he had been welcomed with the wonderous signs of human resilience. It wasn&#39;t all comparable to when he was alive. A true metropolis. A hub of humanity. A city an idea he had come up with at the dawn of time. Humanity excelled when united.

He rebuked his master who seemed disinterested in the gallery before her whilst the Berserker placed his utmost focus in inspecting every piece seemingly understanding the hidden complexities and messages put into each one.  Even this was a sign of human progress he would hardly turn his nose at it he held the utmost respect to those that honed their craft and shared their gifts with the world. He seemed to be miffed they weren&#39;t any pieces based off him in sight though. He was inspecting what seemed to be the Mona Lisa when she asked her question his head turning to face her

In many ways, Lea’s comments were crass. Insinuating Nimrod’s culture to be barbaric was quite the bold claim, one that she obviously could not back up. Still, a momentary flabbergast at the unexpected insult made Lea spit another back.

“—Also, don’t just so casually throw your True Name around!”

Completely oblivious to just how open she left herself by posting that picture, she still attempted to desperately conceal her new weapon’s title, flailing her arms around as to disperse Nimrod’s voice and make it harder to carry over.

“Here, I talked about photographs just now, right? Here you go— a pic of you. Took one earlier when I first summoned you.”

In a last-ditch attempt to calm Nimrod down and shut him up, Lea threw the phone in her hand towards the king’s general direction. The fading blue light of the summoning circle dimly lit up his face in a clear but mystical fashion. Sunlight covered the rest of his body in all its glory.

It was an amateurish photo, of course. When compared to the other paintings in the library, it had no finesse put into them. But as rudimentary as it was, it was hard to dismiss how good he looked.

In the short while Nimrod took to her phone, though, she caught a glimpse of a yellow tinge in the corner of her eye. Got her feeling just a little bit excited at the prospect of managing to show off herself.

“You just stand there looking cute then! Impose your presence by just standing there, your majesty!”

Walking past the Berserker for a short bit, she turned to gesture over to the other two. Though, considering how loud she was, she was difficult to ignore to begin with.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024435508975239210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024435508975239210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Sep-22 07:40 AM">07:40</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Taking a deep breath, she called out.

“Hey hey hey! Is the person with the weird username you? Time lord something! Welcome to the most boring place in all of Alexandria! You wanted to see my Berserker, right? For today only, touching is a free service, but you’ll have to pay an extra million if you want the True Name!”

A loud voice shouted across the whole gallery.

It was… flat out embarrassing. It disrupted the other patrons and made it easy for any eavesdroppers to get a general picture. Even setting aside the bold marketing technique of allowing you to look at the Berserker for free that would surely appal many, the Gogh Gallery was home to many people invested into the paintings. To insinuate the place as boring would not be received well, of course.

Most importantly.

She was completely oblivious as to just how easily Nimrod’s True Name was deducible.

All of Thomas’s concerns seemed to be proven right.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why don’t you help me locate them—”

But it seemed the pair didn’t need to look much further, as a bombastic voice came to flush the Master’s voice out. Fortunately for them, that voice belonged to their meeting partner…

But unfortunately, just as he predicted, <em>this Master completely lacked common sense</em>. Thomas’ fast senses watched the scene unfold in an agonizingly slow manner, his eyes rapidly drifting from left to right as he caught wind of every aristocrat and every art-sensible person in Alexandria turning to the woman with an eyepatch with a puzzled look, and ultimately to him and his Servant as she got closer to them.

Part of him wanted to leave now and never come back. He would’ve lied if he claimed the thought wasn’t alluring. Right now, just a few days after meeting with Mr. Barrett, the least Thomas wanted was to throw himself in yet another public-grabbing situation where he would need to painfully explain himself and calm everyone down to have a proper conversation.

Thomas pinched the bridge of his nose in anticipation of what was to come, then deeply inhaled before stepping towards the eyepatched woman.

“First off, let me decline your offer in the politest of ways. A million is unfortunately a bit out of my budget right now.” The blonde kid quietly spoke, the expression on his face a blend of resignation and exhaustion. “Secondly, I’d like us to drop our usernames for the upcoming conversation as using them will only strengthen my desire to leave. I’m Thomas Barnes, and this is my partner and Servant Rider.”

The two of them didn’t look older than fourteen, but something about them said they were no casual teenagers. Their aura, or perhaps the way they stood themselves made them stand out from your typical kid.

Lea had agreed to meet quite the peculiar duo, it seemed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His command had been followed with Lewis quick to reach in his bag, ready to locate the duo before some lady had said something crazy about a Time God? Time Wizard™️. . . No, Time Lord! 

The woman had been quick to expose herself, having Lewis stare at her in confusion. He had brought him here to meet another person? That couldn’t have been too bad. . . Lewis straightened up his posture, trying to seem happy and entertained to be there. But, really he looked deflated like a balloon trying to keep the little it had. 

“A million dollars? That’s a lot for a servant. . . Could a servant be so cool they need to make people pay to know them?”

Lewis questioned her methods, which only seemed worse with how Thomas had phrased his opinion on it. His name as Rider wasn’t much an introduction than a coverup but he kept his peace with it. His master had told him before to not say his name all ‘Willy-nilly’ and such. So, the boy stood silent, allowing his master to go and introduce himself.

Her plan had proved successful the King had been completely distracted by the digital picture of himself. Falling silent as he admired his own handsome face which stared back at him. The paintings lining the walls didn&#39;t hold a candle to his ability as a muse. He didn&#39;t even look up to acknowledge the new arrivals who were loudly greeted by his master.

It was a joke! I don’t <em>actually</em> expect a million dollars. Not like someone would be able to pay that much anyways!”

Everyone, including Nimrod of all people, made some comment against the price tag she put on his True Name. Even if Nimrod’s estimate went higher, not lower… though, she should have expected that by now.

They were meeting in a location as formal as an art exhibit. Of course the types of people to show up would be formal and stuffy, unable to take a joke— or so Lea concluded. Despite her being the one who sent the invitation out.

Albeit, as much as she smiled it off, something about the blonde Master’s calm, almost snobbish attitude bothered her. ‘Strengthen my desire to leave’… what made him better than her anyways? As much as she smiled it off, she… didn’t do a very good job of concealing her disdain, leading to a rather mixed, eerie grin meeting Thomas.

In comparison, his Servant felt easier to talk to.

“The million <em>was</em> a joke, but as for whether or not he would be worth the price… why don’t you see for yourself?”

Lea pointed to the Servant who was putting his vanity on full display, unable to take his eyes off of the reflection in the pool. His confidence, easily bordering on arrogance, was evident. Almost as obnoxious as the Master herself, but unlike Lea, his confidence very much seemed backed. Even without a peek into his Parameters, his body was clearly one that was well-battle trained.

“My name is Lea Krause. I don’t really care what you decide to call me, though! Wardoc’s pretty comfortable for me too. That aside— what are your first thoughts? Regarding <em>my</em> Berserker, I mean.”

Boasting on another’s merit was… not the prettiest sight, but still— as humanized as Nimrod was, Lea still held the perception that he was <em>her</em> weapon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The pictures didn’t do him justice, as his exalted aura violently washed over his onlookers like the ocean against reefs. He was, to put it frankly, unignorable. It seemed only his overly-energetic Master failed to notice his commanding pressure as she nonchalantly put him on display for the world to see, like a little girl proudly showing off her drawing.

Thomas met the woman’s eerie smile with a straight face, composed as ever. On the inside, he felt a tang of relief. That Servant was the real deal. It seemed <em>Lea Krause</em> wasn’t just a showoff. They struck gold.

“Ms. Krause,” Thomas started, fixing his hair and glasses as he spoke. “The first thing to strike me would be his fluent speech despite his not-so-verbal class. You’d think that a Berserker’s clouded mind could only conjure up ramblings and incoherent sentences, yet both his mind and personality seem healthy. You’d think he was a Saber.”

Thomas walked a few steps around the group, his azure eyes examining the Berserker in a methodical manner, much like a professor would a problem. The Servant looked undoubtedly strong, with heavy muscles quite befitting of his high strength parameter. Thomas stopped his circling as he approached Lewis, standing beside him as he nodded to himself with a self-satisfied smile.

“Yes, it seems that <em>King Nimrod</em> truly is a good fit for you, Rider. How much stronger do you think you could get if you swapped with him?”

…cat’s out of the bag.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lewis cocked an eyebrow of childish wonder. Was he going to grow that tall? He couldn’t help but wonder. To nimrod, Lewis seemed like a child out of place, and the way him and his master looked at him, one methodical and one as if he were reading from a storybook could easily tell he was the true youngster of the group. He was worth one million dollars? It could seem so. Barnes’ inquiry made his servant look back to Lea as if he’d been asked to steal. He wanted to see if he could swap with him, if he could trade it. But, to even do that, he wanted the woman’s consent. With his attention to her, in his very much “not cute but very cute” serious voice, he tried to sound professional in his response to his master and to her. 

“I don’t know what I’ll get from him, but ma’am, can I trade with your servant? I don’t have much, but I can make it worth your while!”

The boy dug into his knapsack, fishing around for the contents he felt suitable for such an offer. After a moment of going to find something good, he pulled out a string, two paper clips, a piece of the glass he had kept from his trip to the sword museum, and a colorful post it note he sneaked from Barnes’ bedroom. This. . . This was what he could offer for a trade of her servant. It wasn’t one million dollars like she could have wanted for his name, but it was what he had. For a moment, it could be seen as cute, how he tried to navigate trade between these two, almost as if a kid had been selling lemonade and force the offer onto any patron nearby, until he actually did. Lewis pushed the content into her hands, kept together by a small amount of knapsack lint as he looked towards Nimrod who had been their subject of trade.

“No take backs.”

That was a test, a test! To see whether or not you did your research before coming or not.”

Through all of Lea’s loud bolstering, a single sweat trailing down the side of her face revealed her panic.

The Master and the Servant were uncanny matches. An unparalleled arrogance over their own abilities overtook them. If there was a difference, it would be that Nimrod showed little doubt— unlike Lea, who could be easily seen regularly doubting herself as Barnes revealed more information.

In contrast, the well-prepared Master in front of her easily kept his composure, only threatened by Lea’s appalling lack of tact every now and then.

“I was surprised at how fluently he spoke too, but hey. More Command Seals for me! His explanation was… something about how his glory couldn’t be bound down by madness. Or something. I’ll be honest— I don’t remember very well.”

A complete lack of attention to detail.

No tension directed towards the War at all.

… Was Alexandria so desperate for Masters that they had to pick <em>her</em>, out of all people? At the very least, like she spoke of— she hit the jackpot with the Servant she summoned.

Still, fully aware of her own shortcomings, Lea knelt down towards the other Servant eagerly attempting to barter.

“Sorry boy, you heard him. Though… what do you mean by ‘trade’?”

Lea pat Lewis’s head with a bit of a rough touch as she looked towards Barnes, subtly asking for clarification. The fact that she could be subtle at all felt like a miracle.

“Ignoring the big guy back there, if it <em>is</em> worth our while, I wouldn’t be against it. I’d want to read the terms of service first, though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What, did she not expect him to know although she posted his picture on the CWW? It seemed she knew little about her own Servant’s abilities too, or perhaps she just didn’t care enough to remember the details. Was she an airhead? If so, just how was she able to summon Berserker?

Two explanations came to mind. Either she was in possession of a catalyst, or her Magic Circuits were top-notch.

Both cases implied she was no simple airhead.

“Rider was known to establish grand and influential trade routes in his life,” Thomas answered her inquiry, crossing his arms. “As a Servant, he now possess the ability to temporarily trade <em>parameters</em> with other Servants. If they willingly accept the trade, of course. As you can see, Rider’s young body greatly limits his strength, which is why I wished to meet you: in order to eliminate this flaw through your Servant’s overwhelming strength.”

Thomas purposefully kept silent about the reason why, instead turning to meet the angered King’s glare with his own eyes, a stark calmness emanating from them.

“Rider means no disrespect, King Nimrod. His actions are motivated purely by his curiosity, and he is as frank and pure as a child can be. His etiquette is understandably lacking, but know that he genuinely and earnestly wishes to trade with you. The lint is just the prelude, a salutation of sorts. I will personally smoothen the deal once we’ve come to an agreement.”

The reasons behind their meeting were now laid on the table. It seemed the two kids meant business by coming here. But a question lingered still: what were their motives?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was what he had to offer, other than his own valuables that wouldn’t have worked for the king anyways. But, no matter how gilded he tried to make his offer look, it seemed like the king wouldn’t budge. Maybe he didn’t like trading after all. 

“You sure? I got it from the source. The glass was even from a sword container! It’s origins are pretty rare, and . . . The sticky note is from my master’s room. . . The paper clips I had from my friends though.“

Lewis tried to elaborate of the special qualities of these things. But he didn’t even seem interested in the niceness of his things anyways! He was being such a prude. Lewis  puffed his cheeks in childish exasperation, trying to show he didn’t like how his offer was being ignored. Not by a longshot. He was good with trade, he managed to take Jefferson’s candied peaches before, and he was friggin Jefferson! What could King <em>Nimrod</em> have on Jefferson, the most powerful person on his turf! 

Barnes had been quick to help show his biggest asset in the trade. It was his skill. <em>A Way Around A Trade.</em> He looked at the King again, though he wasn’t as happy that his first offer of things wasn’t as good as what he thought the later information could be, he knew he could barter again. 

“I’ll give you a big boost if you want! I’m really fast, and and I’m pretty good with my Mana circulation! You can have that for our trade too! I’ll give you that and the stuff I had for my deal and your stats for yours! Plus your master has my stuff, so now it’s your turn! It’s fair and a deal almost no one would offer!”

He said it so confidently. Proud that he could even brag about his speed and mana. But the last part was something crucial. He could offer what he needed, and if anything, this was something crucial. A way to help boost parameters in the midst of something, it could have helped Alexandria win, right?

Despite possessing none of the acute awareness one would expect from someone who pursued Magecraft with all their soul, Lea Krause was born with the fortune of inheriting incredibly high quality Magic Circuits.

It was clear she made little use of it, however. Whatever talents she had were going to waste.

Though, she at least had <em>enough</em> sense to fumble at the Berserker’s demand.

“H-hold! Hold on, your majesty, let’s reconsider that offer.”

Rapidly looking around herself, she attempted to see if anybody else other than the four present caught wind of Nimrod’s comment. She was wild, but she was no criminal.

“I mean, you heard the boy, right? We <em>can</em> get some benefits from this trade to begin with, and plus— if Alexandria wins, its good for us! You saw how important the city would be throughout today already, didn’t you?”

Nimrod had yet to reach a conclusion as to what shape his wish would concretely take. So whether he would wish to concretely help Alexandria in specific or not… would come down to how much he valued Alexandria in the continuation of human history.

“Remember back to how cool this place is! You can learn just about anything you want from the libraries, there’s a lot of exhibits that you can go to when you’re bored, and… and…”

That being said, his Master seemed to fail at painting a good picture as to why exactly Alexandria was important. All of the pros she listed benefitted the individual, not humanity as a whole.

That was of little wonder. Lea’s motivations for joining the war were clearly selfish, after all. Even if Barnes could not tell what exactly she desired from the war, her nonchalant, borderline uncaring attitude told him that much, at least.

… Nimrod likely thought of every painting in the gallery as his own property. As was befitting of a king as blindly possessive as he was.

His Master failed to understand that.

Perhaps another would prove to be more convincing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was non-negotiable. The two kids came to borrow King Nimrod’s strength, but if it was at the expense of the very thing they sought to protect, then the deal was done. One embarrassing and attention-grabbing moment in The Great Sword Museum was enough, Thomas and his Servant didn’t need to further dirty their reputation in this gallery. It wouldn’t be long before they were banned from every cultural place in Alexandria.

“Rather than that, I did say that I would smoothen the deal.” He went on, pulling a notebook out of the inner pocket of his lab coat before writing on it. “I’ve studied your posting history on the Alexandria Online message boards, Ms. Krause. It seems like you’re quite the weapon aficionado, aren’t you? Meeting you, I suspected you would be some kind of old retired veteran or perhaps a neckbearded weapons nerd. Truthfully, I was a little taken aback by your appearance.”

He tore the page down, then presented it to Lea with a dignified smile.

“What I offer you is a meaningful contact with one of the city’s most influential arms dealers. It’s been a real pain getting to meet him but he turned out quite interesting, so I say you value this contact information highly. Just in case, tell him Thomas vouched for you. You should be able to easily get in touch and meet him through this phone number. His Servant will probably get along just fine with yours, too.”

“I gather you’re on Alexandria’s side, are you not? If I may assume your stance on this war, it would be to see their enemies, and therefore <em>your enemies</em>, suffer in agonizing defeat. This is precisely our aim when we ask for your absolute strength for <em>tomorrow</em>.”

Tomorrow would be March 13th… that was the scheduled day for the first fight in the City Grail War. Were those kids about to fight in the very first round against Republic? Thomas dropped his smile, respectfully lowering his head as he spoke his last words.

For him and for his master. He’d been told to not touch anything in the gallery for the strict fact of what had happened in the museum. Lewis let out another sigh. He’d failed another trade with this king again. That in itself was a horrible, god awful idea. Was this what berserkers were? Did they just hate the ideas a trade?

“No stealing.”

Soon enough, there was Barnes’ attempt to try to sweeten the deal with the duo on how they could have a good advantage to them, via the man with the metal arm. But for Lewis, who was starting to feel a tad tired for how the berserker continued to reject his trading, he kept quiet. He went into further detail, finally revealing that the boys would have been the first to fight in the Alexandria Vs Republic tourney, and with that it, the trade would have been crucial for these two, if not, then for <em>Alexandria</em> to attempt to start off correctly. Lewis let out one more tired sigh. This was boring. With a berserker who continued to make things more and more tedious, he didn’t find fun in this trading at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was disappointed to say the least. They hadn&#39;t even considered it. Not a moment of hesitation. Did they not possess a single bone of adventure in their bodies. It was those who went against the norm that truly stood out to the king. They had utterly failed to do so. He had never encountered such a boring lot in his life. He was about to leave there and then but the child master had said some things of note

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Have I not already made myself clear? Regardless of weather you suffer a humiliating defeat or miserable death matters none to me or the fate of Alexandria.

</div></div>
At the end of the day the King did not see this as a trade. They was simply nothing they could give him that he would view as an equal and fair trade for the borrowing of his ability. The mistake Thomas had made was approaching this like a trade. Ultimately this was a Berserker simple reasoning would rarely work. Although it&#39;s most likely the King would be like this in any class. But by changing the phrasing  to that of a plea aimed at a king a different result was possible

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Contentment you say? Hmm I suppose you make a good point child. There is nothing I need from you but as a King it would be improper of me to abandon one who is directly asking for my aid. Fine I accept and will lend you my strength. I have graced you with the greatest honour of your life so if you end up disgracing yourself that disgrace would also fall onto me. And that would be an unacceptable crime worthy of execution
</div></div>
With that threat(?) he turned and walked away. He had lost all interest in the pair at this point. They lacked a noticeable spark in the end. Change was ushered in by those who possessed such a spark. And inherent sense boldness and adventure. He needed no further time spent with such a dull pair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn’t the best of thinking up of long-term sustainability, although that might have partially been due to his class. On the other hand, he was excellent at encouraging high-risk evolutions, even if the same greed was what caused his fall during life.

Someone like Barnes and Lewis, who carefully looked over the situation and made assessed judgements, were a poor match for the Mad King.

On the flipside, however—

“… Man, you’re one hell of a guy. In both good and bad ways.”

Unable to keep up her high-tensioned facade of stability any longer, Lea took a long exhale, before donning a smile back on at Barnes’s offers.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025790788162048112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025790788162048112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 01:26 AM">01:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As silent as she remained, Lea’s overall impression of Barnes had been poor. Not due to any fault of his own, of course. Unlike Nimrod, it wasn’t as though Lea’s criteria for judging people were skewed to an inhuman degree. No, rather, Barnes was too competent.

Had an immediate answer prepared for every turn the conversation took. A thoroughness Lea, admittedly, lacked. To begin with, Lea wasn’t exactly the studious type, so seeing Barnes so composed was almost irritating.

Although, whether or not she found him annoying on a personal level aside, Lea couldn’t help but respect his abilities.

Not just in information gathering, but in how well he managed to handle Nimrod. She hated to admit it, but most likely better than she herself could. Focusing on revering his status as a king, giving him something he wanted— an ability the prideful warmonger lacked— Barnes managed to build a convincing case for both Lea and Nimrod to pay attention to his words.

“Alright then! You seem like a good contact to form an alliance with. You better not lose your first round after speaking such a big game.”

Smiling wide, Lea extended out a hand, inviting in the contact information offered.

“You even got Berserker to agree, so you saved me a Command Seal to make the trade go through. So as much as this is a ‘trade’, I clearly still owe you. Reluctantly.”

How Barnes and Lewis saw it was a whole other story, but at least in Lea’s eyes, this trade favored her much more.

“In exchange— I’ll repay it in the battlefield. I’ll make sure to give you some publicity after I get famous!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It ultimately worked, but the amount of elbow grease it ultimately took didn’t fail to exhaust the blonde. He sighed in relief as the king turned away, and turned to his Master instead.

She had it tough. Berserkers never were easy to handle, but this one had a peculiar difficulty to him. His obstinance felt like that of a fickle Lancer, the Servants past Thomas was most concerned by according to his notes. They were the kind to rebel against their Masters on a whim, unpredictably acting up whenever they felt the urge to shake things up. They had a randomness mindless Berserkers didn’t have.

“You’re nothing usual yourself, Ms. Krause.” He responded to her snarky comment, showing a hint of a smile. “To think that you owe me when I’m the one who’s indebted to you and your Servant, I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or polite…”

Thus, the very fact that she chose to keep and manage him was enough to blow his initial expectations away. Again, Lea Krause was no simple airhead.

Then he nodded the two goodbye, crossing once again his arms in his peculiar thoughtful manner.

…though, the pouty and dejected Lewis eventually broke him out of this position. As opposed to Lea or him, the effect of the king’s words weighed heavily on him. It seemed denying his genuine attempt at trading left his mood in shambles. He didn&#39;t like being denied, yet he was denied twice in quick succession. Thomas went to his side.

“Cheer up,” He said, putting a hand over the Servant’s shoulders. “We ultimately got them to agree to the trade, so it’s our victory.”

Thomas looked at his watch for a few seconds… and sighed before continuing.

And with each no, the boy could feel the frustration of not being able to reach a desired solution. Barnes wanted him to establish a trade, and he was doing it, but the dumb berserker wasn’t allowing any trading to happen! It wasn’t even fun to speak to him! He was being. . . <em>Anti-Fun</em>! 

After what seemed like little effort to Thomas though, he had finally gotten the massive berserker to consent to an idea he offered. To feed his ego. Which, though it was effective, it wasn’t something he felt fair. What was fair was trading something for another, he traded his glass piece, his sticky notes, his paper clips, and his fuzzy lint for something like a parameter, but now the woman and man were getting that, and contact info for the cool one armed man <em>and</em> an ego boost. It wasn’t very fun for Lewis and Thomas at all then. All they had were no’s and had to continue to offer more.

Lewis took in a gloomy breath. Berserkers were not to be traded with. <em>Ever</em>. At least, not with dumb ones like Nimrod and his master. He’d make a mental note of it and forever keep it known. But, as for the trade, the moment the man had given his idea on it, Lewis was sure to also quietly tell himself, <em>No Take Backs.</em> Now they had a trade route. It was just a matter of accessing it when needed. 

As pleasantries and gratitudes were exchanged and they parted ways, Lewis kept his mouth shut. His disdain and upset silence something Thomas could feel as they made their way out of the Gogh Gallery and out into the crowded streets of Alexandria. And in a surprising moment, Thomas had done his best to console him, the scientist going about how they both had achieved their victory, and it being all that mattered, which in a way he was correct about.

“No take backs, okay? Time to go ride the boats! I want see where they take us!”

He grabbed Thomas’s sleeve, and with his quick feet, the boy pulled his master into the crowds. So, maybe this day wouldn’t have been so boring.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
