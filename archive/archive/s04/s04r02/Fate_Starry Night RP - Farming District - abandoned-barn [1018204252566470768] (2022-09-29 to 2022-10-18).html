Alexander&#39;s grip tightened on his shotgun prepared to pull it out at any second. Was it possible that the servant was waiting for him, or would they have attacked anyone who entered the barn?

Just as Alexander was about pull out his weapon a voice cut the tension. &quot;FRIEND&quot; echoed through the musty barn, Alexander&#39;s eyes moving from Saber to Simon. Was this a Republic team? They knew who Alexander was and called off their attack. He had no reason to doubt Simon 

Alexander let out a deep breath, releasing the grip on his weapon, the diamond sliding back into his pocket. He stepped sideways away from Saber&#39;s blade, his eyes fixated on the apologetic boy. He looked... Young, really young. What situation would lead a child to participate in the war. Alexander tried for a moment to imagine one of his children doing his job. He shivered at the idea that any of them could do his work better. 

&quot;It seems you&#39;ve done your research. You&#39;re a Republic master I assume?&quot; Alexander stepped closer, his right hand reaching out towards Simon, gesturing for a handshake. &quot;Please introduce yourselves. You&#39;re the first teammates I&#39;ve met, I&#39;d hate to get off on the wrong foot&quot;

It did only bolster the boy&#39;s confidence, however, as his thrust forward his own hand, it being practically swallowed by the palm of Macedon. 

&quot;S-Simon. Despierro. I&#39;m the representative for my Father&#39;s house.&quot; Was his father famous enough to warrant an introduction? The boy had never really seen his father&#39;s name prop up in news media...if anything, he wondered if the Despierro name was more reclusive than anything. 

He shook the though, motioning towards Saber. &quot;This is my Servant, Saber. She-&quot; he began, but looked back to her, already feeling the potential mistake of addressing her in such a way.

&quot;...She can introduce herself,&quot; he mumbles, shrinking back slightly to give her the floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her face returning to that uncanny valley it rested in as she bent down to pick up her slightly damaged sunglasses, replacing them upon her nose. “Speak like that more, child. And perhaps you can convince me to do more.” Her voice was cold towards her master as he and the Macedonian introduced themselves to each-other. 

“Yes. Class container is saber. My name is not of any importance to you. So simply refer to me as ‘the saber of monstrosities’.” That wicked piece of iron and steel remained at her side, as she stared upon the boy and the man.

Alexander&#39;s presence alone had caused the boy to stutter. Simon also appeared to be wary of his own servant, Alexander viewed this as a problem that needed to be fixed if Simon had any intentions of winning. 

Alexander had a habit of taking mental notes on every person he met, trying to work their personalities into his mind. This tendency was something the ruler picked up through countless negotiations. Knowing the crowd, both friend and foe, was a necessary skill for a cunning leader.

&quot;Well then Saber and Simon, it is nice to make your acquaintance. As Simon seems to have mentioned, I am Alexander Vladisnov, leader of my family and Macedon.&quot; Alexander stepped back as he introduced himself giving Simon some room. He positioned himself so he could see both Saber and her Master.

&quot;I must say, I am rather surprised to find someone else out here, let alone a teammate. I don&#39;t mean to pry but what exactly are you two doing here?&quot;

It was a tactical advantage, clearly. A lone barn in the midst of a wasteland of unusable crop and farmland, what else could it be but the perfect place to perform research and plan future strikes against the Alexandrian team? 

A bold faced lie, that would be. And by far, lying was not one of Simon&#39;s strong suits. No, to say something so abhorrently false would sour Alexander on him completely. And he couldnt have that. This man was the closest thing he had to a lifeline out here...

&quot;...I figured I&#39;d make it easier on my team if I stayed out of the way.&quot; Simon didn&#39;t even dare to look Alexander in the eye, nor could he turn to face Saber&#39;s bored reading. He didn&#39;t know if she was actually absorbed in the text or if she was pretending. Either way she gave off such a placid air that he couldn&#39;t bear to face. 

&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m not very...I&#39;m not cut out for this war, Alexander,&quot; he states. He would just have to be blunt...lay it on the line for the man. At the very least he could potentially relay the information to the rest of his team. &quot;My father sent me here as a test...one I&#39;m not sure I can complete. I don&#39;t even know why Republic wants the data from the archives, or why my Father&#39;s interested in it, but...it&#39;s better if I stay out of everyone else&#39;s path. I saw on the list that my father even mandated I go last. I guess, if nothing else, to make the match inconsequential. By that point, the tournament may be decided. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for, anyway.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The monarch understood the feeling of being pushed around by a father. At one point Alexander had lived in great distain for his life, suffering at his father&#39;s hand before finding his purpose. Yes, what Simon needed was purpose. 

&quot;You are not here on your own accord?&quot; Alexander brushed his hand through his beard thinking about how to console the boy. &quot;Do not think of why you are here, instead think of what you should do to leave. If you are afraid to die, Simon, you must fight. If you cower you will expose your weakness to the enemy.&quot; As Alexander spoke he stepped closer to Simon, his eyes gazing intensely through his glasses. 

&quot;We have spoken for less than a minute, yet you have exposed your weakness to me. You must remedy this weakness by finding your ambition! Tell me Simon what will you do after the war, what is your goal?&quot;

All he wanted was not to die. To live. He knew that on a base level, but the lowest of animals even have the same drive. To live. But where would that take him? The world was already so vast just from coming to Alexandria, but even this hasn&#39;t done much to quell that initial desire. The sights were unnecessary to his goal, so he hadn&#39;t bothered to explore them, or even think about them as worthy of himself to see. Why should he enjoy himself, after all? This isn&#39;t a fun trip through Alexandria, this was a Holy Grail War. What use did he have for museums or night clubs? What was waiting for him after this war? That mansion, more training by his grandfather, Caster&#39;s sneering glances and his father&#39;s back turned on him...Priscilla&#39;s blank stares. The rest of his father&#39;s servants wandering through that mansion, their thoughts, wants and desires aimless...

However something in the conversation drew her in. The talk of conviction.  Ambition. What did Simon wish to see himself become.

More conviction.” She almost ordered but her tone still seemed disinterested.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His eyes turn back to Alexander, not wanting to face it but feeling the potential for judgement in his gaze. Did he know...would it change things? He wasn&#39;t human.

&quot;I think I understand how you feel Simon... At least somewhat.&quot; Alexander would release his gaze from Simon, alleviating the intensity. He would make his way over to a pile of dusty wooden crates, dusting them off and taking a seat. 

&quot;I lived in my father&#39;s shadow for the better part of my childhood. My magecraft, the way I speak, even the way I think are all parts of me that were meticulously crafted by that man. It was only later in life that I broke from my shell. Forming my own ambition, learning to seek what I wanted... Saber is correct, you need to speak with more conviction.

&quot;...I don&#39;t know if I have the ability for such things, Alexander,&quot; he speaks, gazing at another corner of the barn, deciding to rest down in the shade amidst the molded straw. &quot;I mean...I want to.

Strands of white swing in the gentle breeze from his bangs, veiling his vision. He absently rubs a few between his fingers, letting the sheen of silver color the barn before he violently plucks them away. He glared at them before letting them drift softly to the barn floor, plucked and wilted strands blending into the faded straw.

&quot;So what!&quot; Alexander spoke with a ferocious intensity.

You can think just as well and learn as all others do. Life is not decided at birth, it is you who decides what kind of life you lead.

Should you choose to strive for greatness here and now, then there is no way to know if you would have made the same decision if your life was any different .&quot;

Alexander spoke of &#39;ifs&#39; and &#39;whats&#39; his personal philosophy mimicking that of a Cartesian thinker, such was the Macedon way. &quot;Simon, you hold onto what you think you know, but consider that everything you know about is through the lens of your father. To look inward, unlearn what you have been taught, shed away the biases of yourself and learn what you are really capable of.&quot;

Alexander continued to lay out the Macedon ideology. Everything was full of biases that clouded our knowledge. Truth was only achievable if we unlearned that tainted knowledge and began again.

It was the one thing he needed to hear the most.

&quot;...I can try,&quot; Simon says, not entirely sure how to respond to the leader of Macedon. It was either this or spend the entire war hiding, so at the very least he might as well attempt some self-discovery. Would it linger? Time will tell...

&quot;Why am I here?&quot; Alexander repeated. Repeating questions was a habit of Alexander&#39;s, he always filled the room with words to give himself time to formulate a response. &quot;I was doing a bit of scouting around Alexandria. Even though the city is well mapped, I figured it would be a good idea to see the areas for myself. Should trouble arise outside of planned circumstances, then I want to be ready.

&quot;My Servant is currently staying back while I Investigate.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a lie, but definitely a stretch of truth. Alexander had really told Ā-Q&#236;ng to stay behind because he knew she would serve as a distraction to his protocol. Mapping out the city was important and any interference surely would have frustrated him. 

&quot;Speaking of which I should probably get headed back.&quot; Alexander stood from the box, dusting off his pants. He pulled a business card from under his jacket approaching Simon. &quot;This has all of my contact information. If you need me, just let me know. I look forward to working with the both of you.&quot; With that Alexander would turn around and make his leave. He would walk as fast as he could, a strong suspicion led him to believe that Ā-Q&#236;ng didn&#39;t stay out of trouble.

He stared. He probed. 

Deeply. He swam through a pool of dark pits, his eyes searching through a black void of paint that only invited cessation of thought. There was a...peacefullness to it. Simon might even have found a tinge of jealousy bubbling over at the ease with which the Maneki cat could just sit there, lazily. All the wealth in the world in one of its paws, and yet it had the advantage to remain blank faced. Fully content. 

No matter how he tried to rationalize it with philosophy, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Grendel&#39;s Mother saw any of this within those eyes. She seemed like the type that might scoff at human psychology...or the attempt to explain it, as Simon second guesses whether any of what he described was accurate. There&#39;s only so much he could really gather from reading...

He craned his neck back to Saber, who simply...watched? Studied? Her eyes were nearly as blank as the Maneki, but it almost seemed like there was a spark of admiration hiding behind her bent sunglasses. Her find was marginally less important than his own: The plastic maneki cat, a toy dragon and a tote bag, likely one that came free with the purchase of both. Simon himself idly unpacked their own supplies, lowering water into a plastic cooler along with some provisions. He even managed to put together the desk kit he had bought for his workshop...study...thing. It may not be exactly in line with his surroundings, but at least he had a spot to work...on whatever he ended up working on! The sky was the limit. Alexander said as much of course, and Simon was letting himself bel-

<strong>SLAM!</strong>

The desk, much like his very aspirations, proved built on cheap Foundations as it fell apart. He sighs, bending down to pick up the pieces, though he can&#39;t help but stare back at Saber&#39;s collection. The disparity between her and this beginning...hoard? It was just too far for him to leave alone, despite how much he truly wanted to let it be and not engage with the Matriarch.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027408867132461086 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027408867132461086><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Oct-22 12:36 PM">12:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But he had to get some sort of knowledge from it. 

&quot;...Uh...so those are um...cute toys,&quot; he says, keeping himself bent over his shambles that once was a desk. He wanted to avoid looking into her eyes if possible, if only to avoid her scorning hatred. &quot;Do you l-like toys then?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not of that mattered now though. The presence of a Servant so close to one&#39;s lair was unmistakable.

To preserve the look for as long as she can, she chose to remain in this outfit rather than her battle attire until she needed to change.

Then a loud <strong>SLAM</strong>

Erupted from behind the matriarch and her intense study of the cat statue. Breaking her concentration upon its unique, and somewhat useless design. Her eyes glanced over her shoulder before returning to her intense study of the porcelain creature. 

That would be the case if two things did not again break her focus. The boy talking, and another servant. “These are not merely <em>toys</em>, child. They are a start to a great collection. A hoard to rival that of even the most fearsome of dragons. It seems as if there is one here to disrupt such a beautiful achievement.” Saber spoke, standing up. Her form drifted towards then past Simon, in a threatening manner. Her body and face contorted, becoming more akin to a beast or monster, something that goes bump in the night. 

“I believe we have been followed.” That same apathetic voice found itself wrenched from her monstrous visage. She took another step to exit the barn, and confront these new foes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The chair legs slip from his grip, gracing Saber with another clatter of laminated wood. But the boy did not follow. 

Silent trembling gripped him as he hunkered by his makeshift project. Not daring to even turn. The odds of Alexander visiting again so soon? Abysmal. Impossible. Though worst yet, while an enemy was a frightening thought, Simon didn&#39;t want to turn for another reason. That reason was on its way out of the barn, and was poised as a monster to tear apart whoever was there. He had imagined Saber&#39;s strength would bring him comfort in this war. Security. But as he nestled deeper in the barn, his only focus was on how hard his heart was beating as blood gushed through his ears, or the hollow feeling in his gut that made vomiting a close reality.

You are a servant after all so just I dunno, snap your fingers?&quot; Amelia may have been focused on the boy in the barn but to hear a famed general complain about a little mud caught her off balance. She could afford Rider a brief glare for that one. 

&quot;As for them, hmmm. He could be both. Take one look at me and ask yourself the same question, Alexandria or just <em>some weird kid</em>?&quot; She gave a second for Hannibal to take that point in before continuing.

&quot;I didn&#39;t see any faces like his on the list and he seems out of place compared to most Alexandrians. Still I can&#39;t say who he&#39;s with for certain. Oh hey, maybe you could distract the servant for a little bit while I run around the back and chat the kid up with Spriggy&#39;s help? Sounds good, right?&quot; 

There was little chance to respond as Amelia already began to trudge through the wetland in a wide arc to get around to the back of the barn. It was a little slow but it felt like little time passed for her, thoughts pre-occupied with thoughts of the boy&#39;s true identity, of his story, of who his family might just be. 

Getting in to the rickety old barn would take much less effort from the girl, a simple burst of air launched up her through the rear hayloft door and onto a couple piles of spare hay. A soft quiet landing but she hoped that the Saber was already pre-occupied with Rider because otherwise she&#39;d be toast in a second. A precursory look down into the center of the building revealed no such servant but also no such kid. Looked like he&#39;d already gone into hiding, poor little guy.

Oh well, finding things was a speciality of hers and Spriggy was the best man for tracking down anything with a mana signature. Plus maybe seeing the cute little guy would make him more willing to talk and start things off on friendly terms. 

&quot;Alright Spriggy, I&#39;ll keep watch up here in the rafters. Just go track the kid and give him snuggles, a kiss or two if he&#39;s nice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027669637657268255 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027669637657268255><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 05:52 AM">05:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With a pat of encouragement, Amelia held her familiar out in front of her and let him fall down to the ground, bounce twice and start sniffing the ground around him.

There were two scents here. Spriggy hated one of them already, big monster, soggy musk. Too much mana, danger. Red Rider handle this one. The other was of man cub, but not? Different than golden Man-Not-Man, much more timid, afraid even. He should not be afraid, Spriggy will make him not fear.

With his round, flattened snout to the ground, the familiar walked a drunkard&#39;s path around the barn, tracing the boy&#39;s steps, honing in on the stench of man-fear. Deep in the barn it oozed and there the critter went until he saw the boy with his own frog-like eyes.

&quot;Maaaa...&quot; It asserted with a confident mewl as he approached the boy, his little stubby tail fluff wagging as much as he could make it. His wings/ears were slack and folded against his body as he rubbed his soft, fluffy fur against the boy&#39;s leg and assured him with a purr.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh dear God, was it a wolverine or something? Do Masters have Wolverine familiars? 

He had no choice...he would have to look. Brace the potential carnage. Maybe he could call for Saber, but that morbid curiosity was going to kill him before the actual creature did if he didn&#39;t. Just. <strong>LOOK!</strong>

He opened his eye, slowly, rolling his vision to discreetly catch a peek...

&quot;...Wh...what <em>are</em> you?&quot;

That wasn&#39;t a rat...wait, was it? No, definitely not. He may not have seen that many animals, but he was fairly certain nothing like this was in his study material at home...

Face no longer resembling something akin to a human being. “Reveal yourself.” Her tone was forceful as she called out towards those who had followed them to the barn. A terrible claw hand reached forwards, wrapping itself around the exterior of the building.

A Caster?&quot; Rider retorted while pinching her outfit, returning the glare back at her. &quot;I can clean my original outfit but this isn&#39;t my armour.&quot; No amount of complaining would make it clean so it was mainly just to vent. 

At least her mood has improved, slightly. There were moments of silence still but at least she wasn&#39;t closing herself off.  Baby steps! 

&quot;Alright. Point taken.&quot; Rider rubbed the back of her head while she listened to Amelia&#39;s plan. Wait, isn&#39;t she the strategist here? Just because she&#39;s her Master doesn&#39;t mean she can jus- And she&#39;s gone. 

&quot;H..Hey!&quot; It was pointless though. Amelia has already left her side and went off like the wind, leaving Rider alone. &quot;I swear I should have kept my hand on that girl when I had the chance...&quot; Maybe a leash might be a smart investment to make with her. The only thing she had to worry about at that point is whether or not she can keep her contained afterwards. 

There wasn&#39;t much time left to ponder that thought however. Just as she expected, her presence was noticed not too long after she arrived.

What she didn&#39;t expect was that the thing she saw wasn&#39;t the Servant but something else entirely.

A genuine <em>monster</em>.

Out of pure instinct, Rider materialized her sword and got into a defensive stance to defend herself. Now she understands the location choice. 

<em>&#39;Deep breaths. Calm yourself.&#39;</em> Rider thought to herself before taking a few steps forward into view. Her posture more relaxed. The tight grip she held on her sword showed a level of caution towards her though.

&quot;<strong>Rider!</strong>&quot; Rider yelled in response to Saber&#39;s demands. &quot;Are you Saber or merely the guard dog of Saber&#39;s Master?&quot; The tip of the blade was directed by the monstrosity. However, no words were spoken on whether side Rider originated from.  Such information is too valuable to brazenly reveal like that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027701925384294492 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027701925384294492><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 08:00 AM">08:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Saber. Indeed.” The voice was still forceful in tone, yet Hannibal could now sense the apathy with which this Saber typically speaks. “I am no <em>guard dog</em> for that <em>child</em>.” Venom dripped from those words. A servant who could care little about her master. Little about that boy’s safety? 

Another step was taken by Saber towards rider. “Are you scared?” The Matriarch almost laughed out towards rider, seeing her summon her own blade.  “That <em>toothpick</em> will look quite lovely in my collection.” Another step forwards. The gap between the pair was slowly closing. 

Alexandrian or Republican didn’t seem to matter to Saber. There were trespassers. They must be dealt with in a fitting matter. After all, they invited what would come by simply encroaching upon her den.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To think someone that young could be that unlucky with their Servant. 

Rider made no steps towards her opponent. Each step Saber made towards her was one away from Amelia. This is what she wanted. The further this thing was away from her the more safer she was. Besides, Rider needed the space to fight properly. 

&quot;I faced an adversity far worse than some monster from a storybook, Saber. You will see no fear from me.&quot; Despite her words, her grip tightened around her weapon. <em>&#39;Faced and lost in the end though.&#39;</em> Rider&#39;s self-doubting thoughts were mixed with a slight smile. But even then, Gatsby reminded her that even a loser can do something with themselves in the end. She needed to prove that by keeping Amelia safe.

&quot;Tell you what. I will let you keep it.&quot; Suddenly, a shroud of lightning encased Rider. A roar of thunder erupted from her as the arcs of mana-infused electricity coursed through her body. Rider chose to change back into her armour in the same moment. Her outfit was no more, much to her dismay, but she doubted that Saber would allow her to walk away unscathed anyways. &quot;All you got to do is <em>claim</em> it!&quot; Rider spat back as the lightning settled on her blade and legs.

&quot;Sprrrgggyy&quot; it purred out as best it could with its animalistic throat as Simon laid eyes on the critter. He was being acknowledged. This was good, yes. Boy seemed kind, boy seemed gentle. Perfect place for nap. Master can take sweet time finding him and boy.

A jerky nod was made in response to Simon&#39;s comment before letting the boy touch his little wet nose. Cold and moist it was, perfect for tracking down scents and prompting a sleepy master to get up and out of bed on the off chance they didn&#39;t feel like it. 

Spriggy took advantage of the boy&#39;s curiosity and pushed his wide head up against his hand, making it rub down his fur and touch his neck.

It wanted pets, and by jove, it was getting pets. Simon approached with ease, being perhaps a bit too gentle to really be much of a rundown through its fur, but the innate joy in skritching a creature behind the ears did give Simon a moment of calm. Security. Maybe this is all there wa-

<strong>THOOOOOM</strong>

Thunder roars against his ears and shakes the Foundations of his barn, the boy himself feeling the roll of it through the very earth. He turns to look outside, noting Saber&#39;s adversary. Her stature was that of rippling power and oozing confidence, Simon shirking just from her presence as they launched their offensive against Grendel&#39;s Mother. Their weapon, and even themselves, were wreathed in lightning that danced across the earth and licked at the scorched marshland between them. Going out there would be a bad time for him...

&quot;Where did she come from?! Wait...&quot; 

Simon looks down at Spriggy, eyes bulging as a dangerous prospect entered. Was...was this thing...the Master? 

...

No, that was stupid. But, the Master must be close by as well...maybe even in this very barn. 

&quot;Uhm...you wouldn&#39;t happen to know if someone...else is here, would you?&quot; He asks the critter, not even expecting a genuine response, but rather a chance to reflect on the situation and any potential information he had to work with. It was easier than panicking.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Then claim it I will.” In the next moment the battle began. A strange portal appeared next to the monstrous saber, as a giant arm shot forwards. Looking to wholly close around Rider and crush her. 

While the Saber herself moved in at a different angle. Claws and fangs barred. Looking to rip and tear deep deep into that armor. As if she was trying to reach the flesh in a ripened fruit, and partake joyously of the harvest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was good, real good. Roars of monsters and cracks of lightning did not matter to him in that moment. He was safe, the boy was safe and Amelia? Presumably still here. Spriggy not want to lick up splattered master. 

Spriggy shook his fat head. He familiar, not master. Boy silly for such thought. Purpose to keep master not dead and in hunting stance. Impossible task yet no failure yet. He attempted to crawl into the boy&#39;s lap to try and get his mind off the whole matter. Also boy much gentler than master. 

And so when Simon spoke again, Spriggy froze mid-climb and exhaled, eyes closed and wings limp. Sure he was just an animal but was it possible it could feel disappointment?  Whatever the case, the critter gathered a bit of Simon&#39;s pantleg in his mouth and yanked it towards the center hall before letting go and walking ahead. He&#39;d turn around every little bit to see if the boy followed.

___

For a moment, it was really starting to get boring for Amelia. There was no sound of Spriggy or the odd boy from earlier nor the servants beginning to spar. This was the worst part of any plan for her, that anxious coiling of muscles constraining her stomach as she could only wait and trust that the others could pull off the plan. 

And to her credit, she heard first the muffled conversation of what she could presume to be the boy talking to someone. She tried to pull the wind to make it intelligible to her eyes only to almost lose an eardrum as the wind brought the incredible pressure of thunder directly to her head. The whole thing made her slip and hang upside down from the rafter she decided to roost on. <em>Alright, this is where the fun begins!</em> She eagerly watched Rider and Saber posture very coolly as they sized each other up.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028792352069931108 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028792352069931108><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Oct-22 08:13 AM">08:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Woof, woof!&quot; went Spriggy as he caught sight of Amelia dangling like a primate, eyes glossy with excitement at the servants outside. Stupid master could break limb or clawed by Soggy Monster-Lady. She needed to get down and see this boy she dragged Spriggy and Red Rider towards.

&quot;Huh? Oh hey Spriggy! I thought I lost you there! I was going to start looking for you again but hey first time seeing servants fight in person is an experience you only get once!&quot; Amelia adjusted her grip to turn and face her familiar only for her eyes to widen and gleam even brighter as they glanced upon Simon.

 &quot;Ooh and you found a friend too! Gimme a sec and I&#39;ll be down.&quot;

With an acrobatic twirl, she began to swing back and forth before launching herself around the rafter and down towards the ground. The breeze circulating through the barn picked up in speed at the same time, coalescing around a single spot in the hall. Amelia disappeared into the growing dust cloud with a poof and the wind began to return to its normal pace, allowing the dust cloud to settle.

Out walked from it a girl that appeared biologically cut from the same cloth as him. Pale white skin, bleached white hair, a slender constitution and red eyes. Yet there was something about those traits that was off. That hair curled with green, fluorescent locks, a full foot of height on him and her eyes were a gleaming ruby compared to his dull red. And that wasn&#39;t even to start on her odd, modern outfit.

&quot;Hiya there, little guy! Pretty cool little trick wasn&#39;t it? Oh and I&#39;m Amelia Ipomoea.  What&#39;s yours?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...I-I&#39;m...I&#39;m...are you real,&quot; he asks, unable to get past the pure white in her locks or the crimson in her eyes. But if she was like him, what was she doing her? More importantly, where did she come from?

&quot;An extra arm or two isn&#39;t going to cut it!&quot; Rider spat out as she brought down her blade upon the encroaching arm to strike at it with all of her might, backed up with her <strong>Mana Burst</strong> skill. The surging electricity crackles through the air in the arc she made before it crashed against it to stop its advance. 

This dealt with one of her attacks. The other, however, was going to be much more difficult to counter. Thoughts of her next move raced in her mind. For each two ideas followed a cloud of doubt, slowing down her thoughts. Hesitation painted her movements as she chose to simply raise her weapon against Saber in hopes of deflecting some of her blows so she could regain some of her footing.

She smiled as she watched her familiar and used to to collect her own thoughts.

 Sure she had the luxury to digest the information there was someone like her far longer than Simon did but being face to face made her mind bubble with all kinds of questions. Who was he? Who made him? Was he from Lemuria too? How&#39;d he get roped into being a merc for a corporation? Too many questions to be honest.

Ah two simple questions, she could handle this!

&quot;Oh Rider? Yeah she&#39;s pretty awesome! And the story behind how I got her is just as wild! And for hurting you? Nah, why would I hurt you? I thought the whole point of the Grail War was we let the Servants knock each other out and the last one standing wins. Nothing says master assassination is on the table. And besides why would I kill family?&quot;

Ok that last part was a guess but that was a easy hook to catch him on. Might even get him to spill his guts.

The word did stick out, just as Amelia had wagered, but not in the way she figured it would.

The logistics didn&#39;t match up, but that wouldn&#39;t be easy to explain to the hitching in his chest as he stared wide eyed at her. 

&quot;I don&#39;t understand, why would...did father send you to kill me? Why, I haven&#39;t even fought yet, no one even knows I&#39;m here, why would he...was he just playing a game with me? Tell me the truth, did father send you? Does he not trust me with the Despierro name?&quot;

This Rider. She was hesitant. <em>Timid</em> even. Holding back in a sea of doubt. Claws and blade clashed, some struck through others were easily deflected back. Blood of the Monster and Blood of the hero were spilt. 

“You are holding back on me, rider.” Grendel’s Mother let out in a growl, strangely still carrying her apathetic tone.

The properties of ones were much more different than the other however. In the midst of the pain that she felt from her wound, she saw Saber taunting her as her weapon slowly melted from Saber&#39;s blood.

&quot;Just gauging what you can do is all...&quot; She spoke through gritted teeth as Rider fought to regain control over her weapon. However, it wasn&#39;t a battle she would win soon. Besides, time wasn&#39;t a luxury she had at the moment. Both her weapon and her life were in danger with Saber&#39;s moves. 

Like a predator with their prey trapped in place, Saber saw to it to extinguish her life right then and there. A quick, and embarrassing, death. 

Soon the sounds of another weapon materializing took to the air and golden light took form in the shape of a spear in Rider&#39;s off hand. A thrust was made towards Saber. Though it wasn&#39;t made to trade blows again, this time she meant it to intercept the jaws of death that sought to snuff her out. 

Regardless of how much time she managed to buy herself, she used whatever she got to placed her foot against Saber&#39;s midriff to pry her sword free and create some distance between the two of them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029230342508384367 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029230342508384367><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 01:13 PM">13:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fangs gnashing, ever closer to that horrid death. But her quick thinking saved her. 

A spear was thrust forwards. Forcing her to maneuver her face away, at the same time Rider pushed hard off her chest, sending herself backwards and into a relatively safer location than right in the jaws of Saber. Leaving Rider with a partially melted blade and a bitten in half spear. 

In the next moment the visage of Saber returned to something that looked more human. Existing in an uncanny valley. The servant that rider spotted back in the shopping Mall. “Gauging what I can do is a dangerous game to play.” There was a heavy pause between the pair. A moment of respite for Hannibal. “You should always be prepared to meet any force with the utmost degree of violence.” The Matriarch took another step forwards. Her loose, provocative clothing swaying in the wind, slightly tattered from her and rider’s scuffle. “Perhaps, you need to learn more about this lesson.” 

No weapons were within her hands. They remained less monstrous in this moment. Instead moisture from the surrounding marsh began to lift up, and freeze. “Do not disappoint this time, rider.” With a wave of her hand the icicles were shot forwards, all looking to impale the rider. 

Who was this woman? What allowed her that monstrous form? And this magecraft ability? Could Rider actually triumph and protect Amelia from saber?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was no blood and gore for her, there was no family by blood. No one dominating figure but rather a group of people who banded together by circumstance to support each other no matter the consequences. It always brought a warm, bubbly feeling to her mind. Ms Calloway and Toulouse risked their lives to give her a shot at normal life even if she was abnormal and proudly so.

So she leaped back when Simon began to break down at the word. Somehow such a good word had been twisted into a trigger and that thought racked her heart. This father figure must have been a real monster. Even the cold clinical detachment of the researchers that monitored her didn&#39;t do that...

&quot;Father? I don&#39;t know what you mean. I never had a father and I don&#39;t remember any Despierros in Lemuria,&quot; She said, softening her voice and keeping her palms where Simon could see them. In that moment, the boy in his pitiful state reminded her in a way of her younger brother, afraid of the massive world around him, fearful it would grind him down into nothingness, always paranoid the monitoring team saw him as defective.

&quot;But hey, they aren&#39;t here, whoever he is. He can&#39;t get you here. You can do whatever you want. This is a free city and you&#39;re a free person. You got a pretty neat servant to protect you too, right?&quot; She kept eye contact, taking care to even lower herself to Simon&#39;s level and only get closer if he consented. 

&quot;If it makes you feel better, I can tell you where I <em>did</em> come from. My name is Amelia Ipomoea and I&#39;m the oldest of four from a city named Lemuria and I grew up in a lab until my nurse/mom Ms Calloway and Dr. Toulouse took me to Delphi to live. Now I&#39;m here and so are you! I take it you&#39;re not from either city though?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh,&quot; Simon says simply, with just a hint of disappointment. She seemed...nice. Much like the creature named Spriggy, it didn&#39;t seem like there was much incentive to harm him.

&quot;Ah...I uh...no, I&#39;m not. I-I&#39;m sorry, my name&#39;s Simon.&quot; He stood back up, revealing his <em>interesting</em> fashion sense as he dusted straw and must from his pant legs before leveling both palms at his sides. Stiff as a board, without an ounce of slack as he searched for what to say next.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was just uh...being cautious! Wasn&#39;t sure if I could trust you, you know, especially with that commotion...&quot; 

He peeked outside, as the sounds of combat rumbled between them, the boy himself unsure what to make of the situation. So...she just wanted to meet him? Smash their Servants against each other like action figures? Seems a little shallow.

She threw the useless weapon aside in frustration. She had no hidden arsenal to draw upon besides those two weapons so all she had left was a partially melted blade. At least it was still sharp. She could still use it to some degree.

&quot;Charging in blindly is just as dangerous of a game. One that arguably costed more lives than the other.&quot; Rider said as she caught her breath. The gambit she made gave her the time she needed at the cost of her weapon. Her options were being limited each move she took. 

The moment of respite was over. Icicles formed from Saber&#39;s ability launched towards her. Just who was this woman?!

&quot;Damnit!&quot; Rider deflected one with her sword and used her <strong>Mana Burst</strong> skill that were still on her legs to dodge the remainder. However, a sharp intake of air slipped through her teeth as she held her side. One of the icicles almost impaled her but left its mark nonetheless. She was getting sloppy. 

Despite the wounds and supposed pain, Rider still stood without bending her knee in the slightest. Great. The Throne has decided to grace Saber with a stubborn opponent. Was it cruel fate or just unfortunate coincidence?

&quot;Unfortunately, unlike you, I&#39;m the one standing with tricks still up her sleeve, Saber!&quot; A bluff to be sure but she couldn&#39;t allow her to see just how small of a hand she had remaining.

The shroud of mana and dust hid the steed until it reared up and slammed their front legs onto the ground, dispensing the shroud. A deafening trumpet came from the animal clad head to toe in ornate armour and Royal Carthaginian colours. Rider&#39;s mount was a war elephant standing at 12 feet at the shoulder. The imposing mass could make short work of something like Saber&#39;s lair. 

Rider hopped on and stood tall on the shoulder of Surus as she held the reins in her free hand. Rider let out a warcry from her lungs which were quickly overshadowed by the stomps of Surus charging forth. What Surus lacked in speed, they made up for with devastating power as they sought to trample Saber into the ground.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029480249248985138 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029480249248985138><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:46 AM">05:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She glanced outside at the sounds of commotion and whistled as she saw Saber beating Hannibal down as the two drew closer and closer to each other. &quot;Hey, you got this Hannibal! Go get her!&quot;

&quot;Oh sorry there, Simon.

That is for certain. Still battling on even when it seemed as if the cards were stacked against her. Then Rider summoned her mount finally. A terrible beast from Africa and Asia. Something which would rival the size dragons, albeit younger ones, this thing before her was an <strong>Elephant</strong>. Brought to an even higher station thanks to their association to this red rider. 

“This… is what I wished to see from you, <strong>Rider</strong>.” In an odd twist saber’s cold monotonous voice held a hint of passion. “You and your beast, together.”  The novelty of humanity, to tame such a beast. To control it. Befriend it. Conquer upon its back. Exhilarated  Grendel’s Mother to no end. 

The matriarch then in one fluid motion, materialized a beautifully brutal blade into her hands. Long, sharp, and towering. Adorned with intricate carving of old giant runes, Hannibal would easily be able to tell this was saber’s own Noble Phantasm. “Now come. Let us see who will survive this.” Her facial expression grew intense as it shifted away from her more human like appearance back to that of a monster. Sword drawn and ready to strike towards rider and her beast.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A distraction? No...this looked  like a bit more than that. Rider&#39;s steed trampled the marshland, Simon able to feel every pounding step through the earth, along with the pull of Mana from his own body as Saber brought forth her blade. Glittering in the sunlight, a living legend that sent rays bouncing off of the runes etched into its hilt. 

This was more than just a distraction now. Both Servants were utilizing their strength, their utmost strength. This was going to rock the Foundations of his barn...but more importantly, what ifs play through his mind. What if this wasn&#39;t enough...what if Rider managed to deflect this, or brace through such a powerful attack? Would she retaliate in kind? Kill her? 

<strong>Do us all a favor, should you fail...do not return to this mansion, Simon. There will be no room here for you any longer.</strong> 

&quot;Saber...Saber, STOP!&quot; Simon shouts, tossing Spriggy back to Amelia, scrambling from the barn door, witnessing Saber&#39;s monstrous form. He pauses for a moment, considering that visage turning on him...but the potential alternative was far worse than any rage she might have. 

The air shimmers around his hands, Simon&#39;s skin blanching further from the new drain of power as something flows through the air. His intention was to block the blade...but the burst from his magecraft blew off his aim, causing a hard wall to collide into Saber&#39;s wrist, throwing the conflict between her and Rider off balance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The shroud of lightning soon encased Surus as the momentum of the charge rose. The same method Rider used to grant her a quick burst of speed was being applied to Surus. A terrifying aspect given the mass of the beast. 

There was an issue however...

<em>&quot;Saber...Saber, STOP!&quot;</em>

A kid. 

She won&#39;t able to redirection Surus nor slow down their momentum enough to avoid him. Even if he could stop Saber, that wasn&#39;t the main issue. It was <em>her</em>.

&quot;Damn kid...!&quot; There was no time to think. One course of action came to her. So, without waiting for another idea to come into her head, Rider brandished her partially melted sword to her side as it began to glow. A surge of mana burst forth from Rider as a Noble Phantasm was activated.

&quot;<strong>This is the impossible path I forged! For if we can&#39;t find a way, then I will make one!</strong>&quot;

<em>&quot;<strong>Journey through the Alps!</strong>&quot;</em>

After the chant, Rider sliced the air in front of her to cause a snowy portal to form. It was there for a second before it engulfed both Surus and Rider inside of it. Then silence fell. There was no stomping, lightning arcs, or deafening trumpets. Just the breeze in the air.

Such a state of peace could not last forever though.

<em>Crash</em>

The portal resurfaced to an empty patch of marshland aiming at Saber&#39;s flank. Reappearing from the portal covered in a thin layer of snow was Surus and Rider charging at full speed towards Saber. The kid was safe. Saber, however, wasn&#39;t.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029885155013304401 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029885155013304401><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 08:35 AM">08:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Let them fight!&quot; Amelia called out to Simon as he grew panicked looking at some sight behind Amelia. Who did he think he was running off mid-conversation? There was so much she wanted to know about the kid and he was only making it more enticing to learn about himself with how evasive he was being. <em>I&#39;ll show him!</em>

Pivoting on the spot, it didn&#39;t even take a second for her to catch up on the fight. Not when the ground shook, horns blared and both servants brandishing noble phantasms to end the whole bout right here, right now. It was so... cool! 

Hannibal had a giant war elephant and she didn&#39;t think to tell her about that? Well it was a welcome surprise to her and would be perfect for rides later. And Saber entered some kind of beast mode? and summoned a huge sword? Simon was lucky to have someone like her protecting him though she&#39;d have to work on her awareness considering how easy it was for Amelia to slip in the back. 

<em>So you&#39;re going to stop Hannibal, eh? Well watch how a real pro steps into the fight!</em> She smiled to herself as she rushed forward to throw her own hat into the fight. She took a single powder coated leaf from her wild, curly hair and began to mutter something under her breath  as Simon could feel the wind begin to pick up beside him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029975511209873438 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029975511209873438><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 02:34 PM">14:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Wind, wind, spirit of freedom, answer my prayer.

Blow down every barrier that stands in your way, cast each tyrant to the far corners of the earth and deliver the child of yours to the skies once again!&quot; Each phrase punctuated by a melody blown on the leaf as if it were a whistle and with its end, Amelia cast it to the air.

She intended for the gust to carry it towards Saber and blow her away yet it would be her own servant&#39;s impulsivity, not her own, that would change its course. The leaf began to leave a trail of pollen and small green specks behind it like a floral comet&#39;s trail, growing, growing into a long yellow-tinted cloud of sharpened leaves.

The first one danced upon the wind until it smacked Hannibal right on the forehead and clung to the surface for dear life as the rider began to hear the wind howling behind her, matching the volume on her mount. Then she began to feel pulled in every direction as the wind circled around her. Innumerable spores began to settle down around her, whispering their drowsy chemical tunes to the rider and her steed. Leaves swarmed around her like biting locusts, tearing away at fabric, bouncing off armor and cramming themselves in every crack they could find.

&quot;Oh no, where did she come from? Hey Hannibal, get out of there! I can&#39;t stop it once it starts! I&#39;m sor-ry!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Happened. At. Once. 

Chaos. In its purest form. 

The elephant charged forth. Ready to meet The Matriarch head on. A veritable contest of strength. 

But two interlopers chose to disrupt this clashing of forces. One, familiar and meek. The other wild and fairy-like. 

A blast of air disrupted Saber&#39;s practiced stance. Simon screamed, insisting that she must stop. Balance now thrown off, and grip severly loosened upon her famed blade. &quot;Child.&quot; A scream of what could be assumed as rage was heard. Directed towards her master. Along with a deathly stare. 

In the next moment her attention snapped into a different direction. Rider&#39;s Elephant, and herself had miraculously appeared in a more opportune position. Grendel&#39;s Mother held a feud with this Rider for now. Thanks to Simon&#39;s interference, she was now helpless against the onslaught of the charging titan, and the lighting general who commanded it. 

Then a sylph deemed it necessary to interfere. Crying out. The winds moved in response. Along with the name of this rider... <em>Hannibal</em>... A powerful surge of wind then blew forth. Spores threatening to relax Saber, while the wind itself whipped up into a righteous fury. Ripping that blade straight from her already loosened grip, and sending it flying away as the matriarch struggled to keep her ground and not move an inch. 

Claws erupted again from her hands. Digging deep into the ground. Eyes, focused intensely upon those two who chose to interfere upon this most ancient of rites. Then she launched herself forwards. Using the momentum gained from the swirling winds to help boost her forwards movement. Largely now ignoring her own sword and Hannibal. Instead focused upon her own master, and by proxy... Amelia. 

&quot;Fairy... Child... How... Dare... You... <strong>INTERFERE</strong>&quot; With her trajectory, she was bound to land, claws first upon Amelia. Threatening to clasp, then tear apart the green haired girl.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The same shimmer of air ripples before Saber, sheathing itself in front of her trajectory and acting as a brief wall. A thin sheen stands between her and Amelia, slightly cloudy and opaque. 

&quot;Saber, don&#39;t! She&#39;s not an enemy...not right now, at least,&quot; Simon says. The air shield would not hold against the slightest effort from Saber. He knew that much, but even now he stood against her better judgement. Even now he tried to reign her in?!

Where the hell did that come from? There wasn&#39;t any sources nearby that the leaf could come from! There was just... <strong>wind</strong>.

<em>&#39;Oh no. She did not.&#39;</em>

That was all Rider could think before the onslaught of powerful winds sought to tear her from Surus. Quickly, she wrapped the reins around her arm and held on tight. Surus planted their feet firmly on the ground. Nothing was going to move the elephant. The same couldn&#39;t be said for Rider though.

&quot;Damnit, Amelia! This wasn&#39;t a part of the plan!&quot; Just as Amelia&#39;s words struggled to cut through the winds to reach Rider, the same could be said for hers as well.

Thanks to the relaxing properties of the Magecraft used, Rider wasn&#39;t able to keep her feet planted enough as she flew in the air like a kite with the reins keeping her from flying off completely. There she was able to witness Saber taking the opportunity on her Master&#39;s life. The boy seemed to be acting as her guardian proxy. Does this boy have a death wish?!

As she was trying to think of how to escape the vortex, she saw something else twirling around in the wind. A sword. More specifically, it was <em>Saber&#39;s</em> sword. Her blood couldn&#39;t affect her own weapon! At least that&#39;s what Rider figured. Otherwise, why would she risk using it while bloodied. 

&quot;Come on...&quot; Rider&#39;s words were strained through gritted teeth as she held out her hand to grasp onto the sword as it flew by her. &quot;Got it!&quot; A move she didn&#39;t realize how dangerous it was until she managed to grab the handle. She could have easily lost an arm! It was a damn sword flying towards her after all! 

Now to save those idiots!

Images appeared within Hannibal’s mind. 

A flash. A hooded woman, and a Giant. Both holding the blade. A pact was formed between these two beings. Humans and giants both cheered.

Another flash. That woman was now solitary. In the deep dark depths of a cave. Silver blade remaining within her grasp. Golden tears streaming down its intricate carving of runes.

Another flash. The blade is now stationary upon the wall of the cave. The hooded woman has started a collection around it. Ignoring that noble blade. 

Another flash. There was now a small creature, along with the woman. She was teaching it something. Perhaps about the world. 

Another flash. The woman stared upon the blade. Questioning whether or not to use it. Before leaving the cave. Rage flowing from her. 

Then a final flash. A hero brandishing the blade. Slit the woman’s throat. She lay bleeding out upon the floor of her own cave. Another body not far away, that of the little creature from earlier. 

A voice then spoke. “You have touched me. Hero, speak those words which have now been engraved on thy heart. When you touch my blade again, it may be of use.”

Stimuli all demanding she react in different ways. Regret from subjecting Hannibal to her most potent storm she could brew, surprise at Simon for protecting someone he just met and fear at the monster that loomed over them both, a cold glint of murder behind its eyes. 

Yet that fear also gave rise to a stronger rush of excitement and pleasure to her body than any sane human should ever feel. It was that tingly feeling in her toes, her spine and palms that made her ready to pursue it further. It flooded her mind with all kinds of reckless ideas on how to dance around the beast and tempt further strikes. She felt and thought all these things yet there was also something weighing her down that countered the impulses.

Simon was risking his life to save hers. She barely knew him and he her. Only one person did that before and she called that person mother now for better or worse. Simon may not be related to her but he looked so similar to her in all the ways she stood out. Worse yet, he reminded her so so much of her brother she had left behind in Lemuria, timid but compassionate.

In that moment when people could see their lives flash before their eyes, Amelia saw a single moment wherein she had stood between her youngest brother, Walter, and a particularly hated researcher of the four siblings, who always had some twisted scenario to test their nascent minds and bodies with in vain effort of teasing out some mythic perfect human.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030304954482696194 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030304954482696194><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Oct-22 12:24 PM">12:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Walter had just gone through several experiments, he was crying, begging not to go and Amelia stood between the man and his prey.

Amelia did everything she could to stop the man from taking him that day and when he would not stop, she volunteered herself. It was better she took the punishment and was fully prepared to accept the consequences if it saved him the pain.

She knew what she had to do and even if she did not know Simon like her brother, he still did not deserve the twisted punishment his servant had in mind for him just being brave enough to speak his mind for once. So she pushed the boy out of the way and made her own attempt at a wind based shield with what little time she had, incorporating a few vines to make it more of a netted structure that would hopefully slow the blade. She doubted it would help much.

&quot;Hey you can&#39;t call your master that! Call me whatever you want but Simon doesn&#39;t deserve your anger. He&#39;s just as brave as my servant and <strong>I won&#39;t let you hurt him!</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Amelia&#39;s push had sent Simon back on his rear, his brief flailing splashing the boy with mud and marsh water. He truly did come across as some insect, drenched in filth, far from Saber&#39;s pristine skin. He hardly seems worthy of praise. Yet she heaped it on. Stood between him and Saber&#39;s sharp tongue. Defended him? 

&quot;...why...are you doing this. She&#39;s right.&quot; he says. Mud streaks and smears across his face as Simon tries to wipe it away, only leaving his visage smudged further. The only thing that could wipe it clean were the small rolling tears that left pure white trails in their wake. 

&quot;I&#39;m supposed to be fighting for my father&#39;s sake. For my house. But I freeze...I hide...because she&#39;s right. I know it, but I let myself get tricked into thinking otherwise. I&#39;m not an ant, though. I&#39;m not...not anything.&quot;  

<em>Do I dream when I sleep? All I see is a pile of bodies, one that beckons me to join. Do I feel the draw to others? No...no because I know I don&#39;t belong with them. Do I know what love really feels like? No, all I&#39;ve ever felt is this horrible emptiness...</em> 

He wanted to tell her the truth. That he wasn&#39;t worth saving, or connecting with. Not with how much effort she was putting forth. But he couldn&#39;t find the words. Not the intricate ones, at least. 

&quot;I&#39;m not what you think I am...I stopped Saber because I was afraid Rider would survive. Kill her. And leave me with nowhere to go. If I lose Saber, my father tosses me aside. I&#39;ll have no purpose...and no life. You shouldn&#39;t have to die for my sake...I&#39;m not even really alive,&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That couldn&#39;t be the case. Rider was back just as quickly as she left from the looks of it. 

Yet, again, time wasn&#39;t a luxury Rider had as the winds were dying down. Gravity would soon take its hold on her again. 

Now she had a new problem. She needed to protect both Masters from Saber from the looks of it. Damnit! Why couldn&#39;t she be summoned for a normal Grail War! Things would be so much simpler! 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Surus. I&#39;ll get you new ones I promise.&quot; Rider spoke with a pained heart as she used the sword to cut into the reins so the winds would carry her up. She needed the updraft to give her enough leeway so she could land on, or at least near, Saber. 

A shadow formed over Saber as she held the sword overhead with both hands. The glimmer of the sword, along with Rider&#39;s body being silhouetted by the sun, made it difficult to tell whether it was Rider or <em>that man</em> descending upon her. That&#39;s until she spoke, of course.

This time the Fairy chose to stand up for Simon. A wall of vines and wind now stood between her and her quarry. 

The blade raised up. Then brought down with a brutal efficiency. Smashing through this next barrier. “This is necessary for him to <em>learn</em>.” The Saber then took another step forwards. Blade raised to kill, once again. Her choice of words… sounded confusing. 

Especially to Simon. Why go with such a word as ‘learn’.  Was there another meaning to that cruelty she showed him? Or did she truly wish to show her master that he meant <em>nothing</em> to her. 

However that chunk of iron, which could be called a sword, never struck at Amelia. Rider. Hannibal. Had entered the fray once again. That preternatural sense of where those she feud are located. 

However… something was wrong. He was holding the blade again. Or at least that’s what the heroic silhouette of Rider, made Saber believe.  “<strong>BEOWULF</strong> HOW DARE YOU INTERFERE!” Her voice raged, breaking her telltale apathy. The one enemy who ended her existence, had the GAUL to come here. 

That was the illusion at least, until rider spoke. Grendel’s mother responded in kind. The piece of metal raised and attempted to parry away her own Noble Phantasm now turned traitor. It made quick work of the non magical blade. Creating a clean cut right into the Matriarch’s skin. But this placed her just in range to grab at Hannibal’s throat, and free her noble phantasm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Tendrils whipped around wildly as the wind dispersed, several striking Amelia&#39;s face and arms. She rolled back and continued to stand between Simon and his servant, ready to pull the same trick again if she needed to. 

<em>Learn? What was there to learn from this? What good could beatings or death give the poor kid?</em> &quot;You&#39;re crazy, Saber! Abuse won&#39;t teach him anything other than to hate you. That&#39;s <em>not</em> gonna work!&quot;

As Amelia continued her stubborn defense, Hannibal launched into the fray and tore the monster&#39;s attention away from the masters, if only for a moment. Good to know that the Untamed Wind couldn&#39;t her own servant down for long and gave her a sword to boot too.

But as the heat of the battle drew away, Amelia heard something drip from Simon&#39;s mouth that almost made her prefer the blunt end of Saber&#39;s sword. <em>&quot;I&#39;m not anything... no purpose and no life&quot;</em> She could feel her heart shrink upon itself from that. It was like she was face to face with Walter but if she didn&#39;t save him that day. Broken, utterly broken by a cruel world, one that saw him as nothing more than a soulless experiment.

Two thoughts wormed their way into Amelia&#39;s mind. Would she have been the same if Lemuria didn&#39;t put so much on her siblings existence or are they falling into similar states now. Amelia had been long gone from that city and her siblings no longer had her to inspire and entertain them. The thought of dooming them because of her own desire to be free began to coil around heart and mind.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030913084803534910 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030913084803534910><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Oct-22 04:40 AM">04:40</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She knew she couldn&#39;t just stand there but she was almost deathly still for a few seconds, skin loosing its sheen and eyes wide and unfocused, staring generally in Simon&#39;s direction.

The cold wet earth snapped her out of her daze but could not remove those lingering thoughts.

&quot;No, Simon. I refuse to believe that. Everyone has value, even if they don&#39;t know what it is. I don&#39;t care what your father says, you should do what makes you feel something, anything. Even if it&#39;s fear, that will prove you are alive, that you have value and that you can have <em>some</em> control over your life,&quot; she told Simon, crawling over to him and covered in the same much as him. She wiped off her hands and put them on his shoulders.

&quot;You can feel my hands right? Why would I comfort you if you don&#39;t have value? I don&#39;t talk to tools and I certainly don&#39;t do this to jump start them!&quot; She fell onto Simon, wrapping him into a close embrace, hoping that her warmth would make Simon feel warm too.

His body tensed almost on instinct, as Simon believed Amelia was about to throttle him...but she didn&#39;t. Far from it. The warm embrace...he felt it. Despite the cold slime from the marsh, he could feel that what she said was true. She did care about him...even if they just met, she cared. What should he do? Should he...hug back? Would that be weird? What if she didn&#39;t feel anything back, what if that was all...

For the first time in Simon&#39;s life, he stopped thinking, his body acting on its own as he returned the hug. That emptiness in his chest slowly filled, heat billowing inside him as he considered what this meant. Did he deserve this? Was she lying?

...

Was she an enemy? 

That last thought hit him suddenly, the fuzziness in his brain clearing as he thought about what was going on. What if...

&quot;...A-amelia...are you...in the Grail War too? You wouldn&#39;t...happen to be...with Republic&#39;s team, would you...&quot; 

Did he just doom this alliance already...oh why couldn&#39;t he have just let this pass...

The roar of battle, Thunder and Magic clued him back in as to why. Right. Saber...

&quot;They&#39;re going to keep going...i-i don&#39;t think Saber is the type to give up. I actually don&#39;t know much about her, if I&#39;m honest...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;<strong>Beowulf</strong>, huh? Now those visions make sense. You&#39;re that <em>thing&#39;s</em> mother. To think something like you earned a spot on the Throne.&quot; A strained chuckle squeezed through whatever shortened airway Rider had left. Was she really in a position to trash talk her opponent? 

&quot;You think you have the upper hand here, Saber? You must be foolish to think that. Remember. <strong>I&#39;m a Rider!</strong>&quot; Her words were forced out but still retained their weight. Suddenly, the roar of an elephant&#39;s trumpet shook the ground as the massive trunk of Surus sought to slam into the side of Saber in hopes of freeing their Rider from her grasp. 

Due to Rider&#39;s grip on the weapon, this also provided an ample opportunity to retrieve her weapon before Rider could speak the chant.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030925479387078726 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030925479387078726><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Oct-22 05:29 AM">05:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grendel’s Mother stared coldly. Deep into rider’s eyes. “That is right. Hannibal. Don’t believe I exist upon it just because I am their Mother.” Saber Leaned in speaking, while with her free hand she tore her blade back into her own grasp. 

Then that blow of the war horn happened once again. The trunk of that beast appeared again. As she was knocked away from Rider being sent tumbling away and releasing Hannibal. Not without her claws leaving one final slash across her face and neck.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They could take that trust and step on it, beat one up or just run away. Amelia was concerned about the first and third happening, that Simon would overload and lash out or sprint away, never to be seen again. Fortune did however favor the bold and she soon recieved a nice hug back from the boy. It was soft, unsure but still eager in its own way to take that warmth.

Her fears melted away as she scored what she considered her first triumph of the Grail War, befriending an enemy master and giving the oppressed a taste of freedom. The worries reduced to nothing but idle whispers easily deafened out by the fight in front of them.

As they pulled away, Simon, forever a worrier, did have to pull Amelia back down to the ground and into cold reality. 

&quot;Well yeah, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have quite the nice servant if I wasn&#39;t involved. But as for the team, uhhh... I was kinda hoping you were on Alexandria&#39;s too...&quot; She awkwardly looked to the side, glancing out over the battlefield and seeing the battle draw to a close, hopefully. &quot;But that changes nothing between you and me. Once you have me as a friend, its pretty hard to get rid of me, ehe!&quot;

&quot;Hey Hannibal, you finishing up over there? Come on, get over here by me! I think you did awesome today!&quot; She stood up and called out to Hannibal as loud she could and waved as wildly she could. It also gave her mind to process what she just said to Simon. She thought for a second, realized how that might sound and decided to follow up with something that might put him more at ease.

&quot;Ok, ok how about this, I solemnly swear not to use our friendship against you for any reason and any future fights are honest and fair. Let&#39;s pinky swear on that!&quot; She held out a pinky, almost sticking it right in Simon&#39;s face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The blood that poured wasn&#39;t a pretty sight still. A hand was placed on it to hide the gruesome injury from both Masters and stem the flow of blood.

&quot;You monstrous bitch...&quot; Rider got up from the ground bloodied but the punishment Saber dealt still wasn&#39;t enough to make Rider kneel over in pain. Either she had a really good poker face or something else was at work here. A skill perhaps? 

Then she heard her Master&#39;s calls. 

She turned to face Amelia. A critical mistake to most from someone as dangerous as Saber, but Surus took to her side and stared down her opponent for her. A stalwart guardian against the monster before them.

&quot;So this kid&#39;s Republic, huh? That&#39;s a shame.&quot; Her partially melted blade materialized in a golden flash. Rider was going to kill him for that answer, isn&#39;t she? Lulled into a false sense of security into the worst position possible; away from his Servant. What a foolish move for the boy to make.

However, Rider could never betray Amelia like that. 

&quot;I guess that means we&#39;re in enemy territory, Master. This would be the perfect opportunity to ambush and eliminate us from the Grail War. We should fall back in that case. Strategically, of course.&quot; A smirk ended off her sentence well enough before returning her gaze to Saber.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030960147964624987 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030960147964624987><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Oct-22 07:47 AM">07:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grendel’s Mother stood, bloodied and beaten. Blade placed at her side like it were a stalwart guardian. “Next time, Rider. We shall see who will prevail.” She called to her opponent, not moving from her spot. Not yet at the very least. Hostilities had ceased, the invaders are leaving after all. 

This Hannibal. She was strong. She was a worthy opponent. It was only fitting she needed a blade to replace the one destroyed. Another metal object appeared within Sabers free hand, a curved blade with simple and elegant features. “A new blade. Take it, and do not disappoint when we meet again.” Grendel’s Mother called tossing the blade next to Rider and her mount. Before her stare turned towards Simon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She made it sound like a threat. But that word...friend. There wasn&#39;t anything in the world that could break the feeling that word brought with it. He stares from Saber&#39;s glare to Rider&#39;s softer one, gauging the room as he looks to Amelia&#39;s outstretched pinky, her promise of staying by his side all wrapped up with it. Was a promise really that easy to forge? Just with a simple shake...

But he couldn&#39;t waste time thinking. This was the first time he was ever given the chance for a pinky promise, much less one with such weight behind it. Shakily, he nods, reaching out and locking his own with Amelia&#39;s. &quot;O-ok. I mean, yes. Yes I agree.&quot; 

The words were shaky, but their Foundations were strong. This...this was a taste of life. What it meant to live. 

And he didn&#39;t want the feeling to leave.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
