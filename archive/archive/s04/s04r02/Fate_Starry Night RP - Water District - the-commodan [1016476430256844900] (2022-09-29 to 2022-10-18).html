Yes, every memory in my life is perfect, and these dreams are little more than a theatre through which to re-enact them.</em>

<em>Yet, there is one infuriating exception, the chip in a priceless diamond, the erroneous brushstroke in my masterpiece. It is this village, this insignificant little speck of dirt and dust upon my <s>father’s</s> perfect kingdom.</em>

<em>Existing here, in even dreams, is like a searing spike being driven through my skull and into my brain. In this place, my body is a clumsy wreck of flesh and bone, skin and hair compacted into this humanoid shape without thought or care. The imbeciles who live here offer me no true respect. They might bow and kneel, and they may proffer praise, but they all lie! They cannot deceive me. I can see how they shake their heads behind my back. I can hear the insults muttered under their breath.</em>

<em>Why? Why did I even come here? What drove me, the <s>prince</s> king of Arabia, nay, the SHAH of the world, to visit this wretched, pointless place?</em>

<em>...My legs are moving. My body shambles of its own accord. These are not my actions. My body is being pulled along like a puppet, made to dance, my nervous system being held like strings. I have no choice in the matter. I simply must move.</em>

<em>Down the shoddy path. Past the ramshackle huts. As I enter into the plaza, my neck snaps itself, turning to face a commotion. I have no care for this affair, for it is beneath me, yet my slave of a body approaches nonetheless. As it draws nearer, it hears shouting. Threats. Insults. Criticism. Pure and raw hatred. What could evoke such a reaction?

Mercifully, the screaming static of an announcement over the Commodan’s intercom roused the dragon from his nightmares.

Wordlessly, Lancer rose from his slumber, pulling himself out of his curled ball and into their standing position. He betrayed no discomfort as he stretched his massive body, cracking each of the many joints in their body, before looking about the room. A rather large locker room, evidently meant for whole sports teams, seemed rather barren when only inhabited by two souls. Speaking of which…

If it weren’t for the dull whirl of the air conditioner in the locker room, he might’ve been able to hear the <em>massive</em> crowd that sat and waited. Waited for them, and their foes, to emerge from their hide-y holes and battle. 

It was hard to believe that there was an ulterior motive behind these fights when the crowd took up almost every chair out there.

While Ryujin silently unfurled and stretched his long body, Nikolai doubled, then tripled checked his armor. No gaps, adequately secured, clean and fresh… everything was in order. His shield leaned against the wooden bench, a massive black rectangle that seemed to leech the light from the dim bulbs above. How a man such as himself considered a shield a worthy ‘weapon’ felt silly when the size more than made up for the lack of offensive prowess.

And speak of the devil…

“<strong>Always,</strong>” he said. Lancer could possess many gripes with the brute, but ‘lack of confidence wasn’t one. Their last few days together had cemented that fact, a truth that couldn’t be denied or twisted. 

“<strong>Remember. Kill. Servant. Not. Master.</strong>”

The odds it came to that were next to none. Odds are, the opponent would surrender the fight long before it came to that. Furthermore, to kill a Servant was no easy task. If one were to be slain, the Master would be a better target.

But it wouldn’t get to that point.

Content with his preparations, he slotted his arm into the shield holster and pulled himself up. “<strong>Let’s. Go.</strong>”

They hadn’t been told to enter the arena, but when would a little thing like that stop them?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>...THE FIRST ROUND OF THE HOLY GRAIL WAR WILL BEGIN IN FIVE MINUTES!</strong>

They were given five more minutes to prepare, but they were more detrimental than they were useful to Thomas.

The blonde kid closed his eyes, trying to overcome the nervousness in his legs. His bones felt cold, his chest constricted, and his hands moistened from the accumulated sweat. This was the kind of situation Thomas dreaded the most. Five extra minutes turned into a quarter of an hour inside Thomas’ brain, and that quarter stretched even further once he inevitably started overthinking.

The first and last fights are by far the hardest on a competitor’s mind, because they were the ones that would influence the tournament most. Whichever faction won the first fight held an immediate and overwhelming advantage over their opponent, because it impacted morale in a way the other fights couldn’t. It set the tone.

In truth, Thomas couldn’t believe he was allowed to fight first for Alexandria. Was he even strong enough? If he wasn’t, was it a strategy from the higher-ups to expedite the weak Masters first, saving the strongest for last?

<em>In that case, wouldn’t that mean Thomas was the weakest of them all?</em>

But he wasn’t allowed to lose! One loss meant that one third of Alexandria would fall prey to the nefarious Republic. One entire third of Alexandria.

No! He couldn’t bottle it. He had to win. Both he and Lewis had extensively prepared for this confrontation, ensuring that all chances were on their side. They discussed tactics, went over strategies together and met with numerous people to further bolster their strength. Mr. Barrett provided them with top-grade arms, Ms. Krause lent them Nimrod’s strength. They couldn’t lose with that kind of back-up.

<em>...but what if it wasn’t enough?</em>

Thomas looked at his wrist clock in an effort to free his mind from the constant stream of doubts.

<strong>Four and a half minutes left.</strong>

He felt like throwing up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He couldn’t believe that the day had gone so fast, and that now he stood in the locker rooms of the large and expansive stadium. While Thomas had sat down, Lewis himself was looking around for things that could have been fun to toy with. The speakers, holograms, anything. But, whenever he could bored of them, he couldn’t help but turn to look back at his master to see if he’d be enjoying himself too, only to be seeing his master hunched over and jittery. 

“You know, Jefferson was nervous before he sent us out too. There isn’t a need to worry! Our fight will be fun and next thing you know it’ll be over and we’ll win. Then we can go to Waku Waku Alexandria again!”

The rider kept a smile on his face as he said it towards Barnes. Lewis sounded as if the idea of this tournament hadn’t fully registered. Unlike his master who seemed to doubt himself and timing of going first, Lewis kept to the idea that this entire thing was meant to be fun. He knew it was a battle between the opposing sides of course, but he was to enjoy the fun of going against others, to experience a thrill of a good battle. And yet, Thomas remained unresponsive. 

The rider took a step closer, tilting his head to the side as he took full picture of the nervous wreck of his master. He didn’t look so good either. . . His face a ghostly pale, his body a sweated mess, and his twitching movements felt erratic. Was he not thinking about the fun he could have had? Lewis stuck a hand out, putting it right against the boy’s clammy head and on top of his hair, hoping he’d be able to at least have his words be heard by the master he had been given.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026508004654325853 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026508004654325853><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Oct-22 12:56 AM">00:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Barnes, you don’t need to worry.

Let’s win and then we can get more bubble tea.”

His words were as sincere as they could, and his movement was even gentler with how he gave his master a slight hug and tried to comfort him in his time of need. But the clock stopped for no-one. It was time to get ready to head out, the man on the speaker began his countdown. It was time to get the tournament truly started.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“...yeah. You’re right.” The Master said, giving the Servant a half-hug with one arm before getting up. “Let’s do this.”

And thus, the Alexandrian contenders finished preparing and entered the arena.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thankfully, it was not a long one. A bit under a minute, they arrived at an identical set of tall, metal gates. The only thing that separated them from the intense gaze of the crowd. Their cries and conversations flooded out any and all other noises, and threatened to deafen even their thoughts. 

And then, The Announcer.

“<strong>Well well well, let’s not wait any longer! Let’s give a big welcome to our contestants for the first round!</strong>”

The whirl of machinery lifted the two dull grey sheets. Sunlight poured from underneath the sliver of opening, and quickly made ground. Warm yellow painted their scenes, and the masses grew excited. Cheers, boos, and everything between took front and center. 

And all eyes were immediately on the four newcomers to the scene.

Showtime!

“<strong>Our first official Tournament Round, there’s sure to be anxiety and adrenaline a plenty, but best to leave those at the gate! This round will decide if Alexandria has what it takes to keep itself out of the filthy grasp of The Republic, or if The Republic has put forth a compelling argument to get what they came here for!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He’d have to ‘convince’ the tournament runners to get better lighting, so that they wouldn’t be blinded because they didn’t want to shell a few bucks extra. For now, he kept his hand raised and emerged from their side of the arena. With Ryujin right behind him, they slowly made their way to the center.

Looked like they were on the east end. It also looked like they <em>really</em> wanted to get the biggest piece of land they could afford for this venture. He stole a glance at Lancer, a respectably sized Servant, and cast the doubt aside. All it’d take is a good-sized Noble Phantasm to make these grounds seem like a hop, skip, and a jump across.

“<strong>For our Republic side, we’ve got the man, the myth, the not-so-legendary-legend, Nikolai… yea! A Mercenary hired to the home-wreckers, this massive guy is ready to crack some skulls and take some names! Whatever you do, though, don’t try to take a peek under all that armor! Last guy that did it still hasn’t woken up!</strong>”

Annoying. Insufferable. This was the last time he let Saria write something for him. Despite the thousands of people, a sizable growl escaped his lips. 

“<strong>And accompanying him is this nightmare fuel of a Servant! While I don’t know their identity, I can safely say this Lancer here looks ready to scare living daylights out of their opponents! Time will tell if those looks are just for show, but I have a strange feeling they’re not!</strong>”

“<strong>See. Foes?</strong>” He asked Ryujin. There were two blobs, far off and hard to make out. His eyes still hadn’t adjusted, which made it impossible to see anything else at the moment. However, the closer they got, the more it looked like they were… just two guys.

Surely Alexandria had better sense than to recruit a Librarian and some homeless man.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lancer&#39;s eyes narrowed as he peered across the barren expanse of a battlefield at the vague shapes on the other side of the arena. Had he been an Archer, he might have been able to better assess his opponents from the distance, but in his current class vessel, he could only tell the bare minimum - namely, that they were both diminutive, unimpressive, lacking in physical presence. A Caster, then? Or perhaps an Assassin? Pah, it mattered not. 

<strong>&quot;Foes? You could have fooled me. They have more the appearance of arena custodians than worthy enemies, kuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu!&quot;</strong>

As they approached, Ryujin still paid little attention to the Alexandrian pair, his gaze instead scanning the arena. It was mostly flat and mostly devoid of any sort of foliage or cover, little in the ways of tricks of gimmicks being immediately apparent. It appeared this first fight was intended to be fairly plain. A straight two-versus-two.

Then, his eyes switched to the crowd, the senseless mob up in the stands, booing and jeering and their mere presence here. Compared to the lukewarm response of the protestors at the Republic embassy, he could truly feel the vitriol of this audience. His grin seemed to grow wider as he realised this, a claw raising up to wave at them in acknowledge, an act that only earned him more ire.

<strong>&quot;Ah, just like old times...&quot;</strong> Lancer mused. He did not elaborate further. Instead, he turned his eyes towards his opponents once more.

They did not become more impressive on second glance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two infants came into the arena to the horrified eyes of the Alexandrian citizens, walking towards the center of the arena with purposeful steps. Were they supposed to be Alexandria’s fighters? There was no way! What was Alexandria thinking, putting those two as their first fighters against Republic? Did they have a death wish?

Eventually, the thunderous voice of the Announcer soon came to wash the public’s murmurs.

<strong>“And now for our Alexandrian side, we&#39;ve got the finest of our working class. He may look young, but don&#39;t be fooled, he’s well on his way to turn… 112 years old this year, holy smokes! He&#39;s a scientist, researcher, part-time teacher and Alexandria&#39;s first contender in this City Grail War. He iiiis... THOMAS BARNES!</strong>

The murmurs turned into quiet cheering, then quickly escalated to a loud cheering as the people took a closer look at Thomas. He seemed composed enough from afar, and this mysterious age… it seemed Alexandria had a trick up its sleeve! And it was enough to get their people’s voice reaching all over the Commodan again. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026881167665938512 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026881167665938512><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 01:39 AM">01:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>And following him is his partner, his compadre, a youthful Servant who will be fighting tooth and nail at his side.

The cheering boomed again, meant more as a statement from Alexandria’s citizens to Republic than as a reaction to the Announcer. The message was clear: they were behind their competitors, kids or no kids, and they made sure to let everyone know through their voice. Some people started chanting Rider and Thomas’ names as they closed in on the middle of the arena, a stark contrast to the opposing side’s heated and boo-ish reception.

This coliseum definitely had a few bias issues.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And that damn Announcer, why did his voice have to be so damn loud? And looking at the arena, why did it have to be so… big. And so flat. Was this truly a wise spending of Thomas’ tax money? I mean come on, they could’ve at least made it cute. Thomas sighed, directing his focus on their opponents.

They didn’t look like dots. They were dots on top of dots, large dots. Pitch-black, and pretty menacing even from that distance. A tough duo, both Master and Servant. Thomas expected that much from Republic, they wouldn’t bring kiddie guns to a fight this important.

“They look big from afar, don’t they?” He said, taking off his classes to get a more accurate look. “Well, you know what they say. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While he had known that it’d be a city grail war, he didn’t expect such a cheerful and exciting introduction, and now that they were heading towards the bright center of the commodan, he could finally put the faces to who had making such a loud noise. 

His master had been quite against such cheering and applauding, which his servant drank up with his smile. He tried to look around, trying to find how many people could have occupied this stadium and if he could have found the people he had met before. Unfortunately though, the amount of people was so expansive, each person looked as if they were but a conglomerate of different colors from their clothings, a sea of colors. 

“So many people! Are they all Alexandria’s people? How many do you think are from the Rupblic? Do you think Jefferson could see this too?”

Another set of rapid fire questions came out from Lewis as he turned back to focus on the trip to the middle, seeing the large dots also coming towards, but no matter how close they came, it seemed the dots didn’t shrink or enlarge. They were just consistently big! When Thomas commented on the other two who came forward, Lewis nodded energetically to agree.

“Mhm! I know plenty of big game that I thought wouldn’t go down, but a few moments of tiring them out and next thing you know, they’re all yours!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two nothings continued their trek to the middle, specs in the massive arena they found themselves in. They would reach the inner ring as Ryujin did the same, but Nikolai lagged behind. Slow, big, strong — small words for such a large figure. The Servant as well. 

And who did a bunch of old librarians get to represent them but the oldest of them all. Pathetic. Looked like any worthy fights were best sought within his own ‘team’ than with the enemy. Hadn’t Mikail mentioned something about being in the tourney as well? That’d be more noteworthy than…

<em>This</em>.

“<strong>Now, best to remind our contestants of the conditions! Two-on-two, the best pair wins! All you need to secure that is a physical-slash-verbal surrender from the other side. I’ll let you four figure out the best way to get that. Match will begin at the bell ring!</strong>”

One step forward. The crowd gasped.

“<strong>Thomas. Barnes!</strong>”

Once again, his roar threatened to drown out the background chatter.

“<strong>Keep. Up. Yes?</strong>” he asked, with a voice best compared to a broken cement mixer. Hopefully the man wouldn’t be too afraid to call back, or too slow to figure out what he meant.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 06:30 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ooo, how laughable! How utterly, utterly laughable! Did they truly expect this runt of a servant, this &quot;Rider&quot;, to pose any kind of threat? Was Alexandria truly so eager to lose that they would offer up this whelp of a servant to the slaughter? Were they so consumed by despair that they had all but given up? 

That was to say nothing of this Thomas Barnes. One-hundred and twelve years old? The tyrant had lived for millennia, and these modern dregs thought that a mere century was worthwhile? If he believed that was enough to defeat Nikolai, then age evidently had little to do with wisdom!

Mad laughter overflowed from Lancer&#39;s maw like stew left to boil, a cacophony of ridicule all targeted at the enemy team. It was so very, very easy! Almost TOO easy! They might as well have offered him the Holy Grail upon a silver platter!

<strong>&quot;Kuhu, huhuhuhuhu, pardon me, pardon me! I could not help it!

Please, send some security to escort these rascals back to the stands, and tell our</strong> <em><strong>real</strong></em> <strong>opponents to make their entrance!&quot;</strong>

Green eyes stared down at Rider, as though daring him to lose his temper, to spit out some trite comeback, to attack out of turn and get his pair disqualified. After all, was it not the place of a child to throw a tantrum when challenged? Yes, go on, little whelp! React, and expose your weakness!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Needless to say, there was a bit of a gap. Age, size, build, atmosphere. You couldn&#39;t find such polar opposites even if you tried. It was obvious who the people favored when you heard the cheering, but realistically, this wasn’t a fight. Not in a million years would two teenagers hold a candle to a <em>hunk of armor</em> and a <em>dragon</em>.

While this apparent fact did not need to be acknowledged out loud, the hateful dragon&#39;s laughter still echoed heavily as he glanced at his opponents and spoke his mind. He was right, Lewis and Thomas didn&#39;t look anything like competitors. It would be hard to guess that they would assume some of Alexandria&#39;s fate by fighting in the City Grail War...

&quot;I&#39;m afraid this is no joke, Servant.&quot; But of course, Thomas fully expected to be belittled. He folded the glasses in his hands, smiling weakly at the demon&#39;s taunt. &quot;Alexandria is a city built on peace, you would be hard pressed to find strong, menacing men like Mr. Nikolai to represent us. All we have among us are elderly, sallow-skinned librarians. I am terribly sorry to disappoint you, but we are not the fighting type.&quot;

A man of few words, but those words resonated strongly in the arena. Thomas could only imagine what kind of beast was hiding under that armor...

But his choice of words was curious. Thomas took a few measured steps towards Nikolai, raising his head to meet his gaze.

“...If it’s concern I hear in your words,” He started, raising his gloved hand for a handshake. &quot;Then it&#39;s not too late for you to back off. If it&#39;s money you want, I&#39;ll find a way to pay you. If it&#39;s something else, I&#39;ll do everything in my power to accommodate you...&quot;

His eyes let out a semblance of distress, a temporary melancholy before returning to their normal state.

“So please, give up and leave this place. Do the right thing, Mr. Nikolai.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that it was much an issue. Lewis noticed the hulking mass of armor that walked, surprised that it even was capable of movement in its heavy coating. With not much of an introduction it roared his masters name, which was immediately forcing Lewis to materialize his musket. He was almost a beast with how it spoke, his words broken up as if each one were it’s own sentence. Maybe he was just a beast. His rifle luckily had no problem with the difference. Man, beast, it’d fulfill its purpose. Lewis’ own cutlass materialized on his back, it too ready to assist in what may have to come.

As for the dragon, he earned a proud huff to back up his master’s response. Thomas knew their potential, he need not a servant to belittle it. 

“<em>Nah-uh</em>! We’re your opponents you big gecko! You’re going right in the journal so I can tell Jefferson all about you and Apu when we win! I hope you’re fine with that!”

Lewis shot back his retort surprisingly quick at the servant who mocked him. Though he felt a tad irked that he had called him a child, once again he puffed his cheeks out to show his disapproval of the sly comment Ryujin had said. But it wouldn’t matter either, just any thing he found in nature, his trusty musket would take care of him too. Big or small. 

“Master, are you ready for an adventure you’ll never forget? We fight first and we’ll win first too!”

Did not react. As immovable as he looked, so he was. Did the man simply not understand Thomas’ proposition? Or was he seriously considering it? Without vision of his facial expression, all the Master could do is stand there.

Until a sound escaped his lips. A low rumble at first, but escalated into—

“<strong>haaaaahaaaHAAAHAAAAA–</strong>”

<em>Laughter</em>. 

It sounded nothing like a proper laugh, but instead like someone was strangling a bear. Each bellow still followed by the smallest of pauses, his head tilted back, towards the sky. Looked like he did not quite agree to Thomas’ proposal.

Then, he grew silent. Without warning, he closed the distance to Thomas in three steps. His free hand raised, he threw it into the librarian’s and grabbed on tight.

“<strong>Sign. Weakness.</strong>”

Every muscle in his hand would groan as the grip got monstrously tight. Any sign of the previously shown amusement had vanished, just like the sun above as he towered over. Nikolai leaned forward.

“<strong>Next. Time. Not. Merciful,</strong>” he whispered. As quietly as a person like himself could, anyway.

With the introduction settled, Nikolai let go of his hand and dug his shield into the dusty dirt. “<strong>Smarter. Men. Kill.</strong>”

Light reflected off his helmet as it swiveled towards Rider. A sign. Thomas stood still intact, but only by his doing. Since the bell hadn’t rung, he’d be penalized at best. But no amount of punishments, charges, or even disqualification would bring a dead person back. 

If they did, he wouldn’t be in this stupid tournament at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thomas stood at the end of the laughter, unmoving. He took the intimidation, the insulting refusal, the crushing of his hand. He took it all in silence, his expression unwavering, unchanging.

He was naive.

If these people could be bought with money, then someone from Alexandria would have stepped up to them already. No, these people were not fighting for money. They didn&#39;t fight for fame. They didn&#39;t fight for a cause. They didn&#39;t agree with Republic, and they didn&#39;t particularly hate Alexandria.

No, they were not sentient beings. They were evil, an evil that had to be defeated by force.

Unbeknowsnt to Nikolai, Thomas left an <strong>explosive rune</strong> on his hand as they shook hands. he then massaged his throbbing hand as he took a few steps back, chasing away the numbness the titan brought with his grip. He nodded to Lewis, giving him a weak smile while he dug his hands into the pockets of his lab coat.

A minute was unnecessarily long. Not at all felt mean, cruel, even. There must be a middle ground, right? Perhaps… three seconds. Yes, that sounded right. Fair. Not many people got even that much, but these were newcomers. Best to ease them in.

<strong>DONG. DONG. DONG.</strong>

Unfortunately for Thomas, he wasted all three of them on his trip back to Rider’s side.

Surely Thomas would have even a <em>second</em> to get himself squared up and proper. Just needed to make sure his hand wasn’t broken, all his thoughts were in order, and turn arou–

<em>Thud. Thud.</em> <strong>Thud. THUD THUD</strong>

Behind him was naught more but a pitch black blob with a shield drawn back. He was slow, but it’s not like he announced his intentions either. Rider would have ample time to react, but not his Master. Most the Servant could do was damage control.

Even without distinguishable characteristics, the intent and ferocity behind every step that quaked the ground were clear. Each boot planted into the soil, the way his shield was angled to still block his face as he approached, even his head hung lower than normal. 

 The world grew even darker, and Nikolai was upon him.

He had best hope that his musket could kill a dragon, because his &quot;wit&quot; couldn&#39;t kill a fly.

Indeed, this would be an adventure that they would never forget, but it would not be for the reasons he hoped.

<strong>DONG. DONG. DONG.</strong> The bell rang out, and was soon followed by the renewed roar of the crowd. The tournament had began proper, no more pointless stalling or timewasting. It was time to sink his teeth in, to savour the fine feast of warfare that he hadn&#39;t tasted for so long!

He was eager. So eager, in fact, that he would proffer no mercy as Nikolai did. No, in fact, he barely waited more than a nanosecond before leaping into action.

<strong>&quot;FALL!&quot;</strong>

Like a great beast pouncing, Lancer surged towards Rider, razor-sharp claws and dagger-like teeth all primed to eviscerate Lewis in an instant. More important than the action itself, however, was the speed with which it was carried out. It was akin to lightning, a blur of purple and black heading straight for his opponent, giving him the shortest of windows to react. But despite his speed, his piercing eyes remained clear throughout, staring a hole through Rider, delivering a singular message - 

<em>I do not intend to lose to you.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His muscles taut and alert, he readied his musket for the time being, getting the weapon comfortably into his grip. Once the bell did toll, the enemy servant had no qualms with quickly closing their distance, and while Lewis knew he couldn’t exactly move out the way enough to dodge what he could, the boy knew he could defend. With his hands out, and his weapon at the ready, Ryujin’s claws would have struct against the metal of the musket Lewis had, claw against gun, in Lewis best chance of immediate defense.

Just through strength, Ruujin could have pushed Lewis back, and with it, he did, having the boy be sent a few yards away from the large serpent, his feet leaving skid marks on the floor of the stadium. He was strong, almost like a Grizzly Bear, or the Oxes he had seen before, but just as more menacing. The boy looked at his gun, the claw marks evident on pieces of where wood had been polished and on slight pieces of the large steel barrel. It wouldn’t matter, he’d use it regardless. In a moment of raising it lewis stared down the sights. To Ryujin, it would be hard to tell where he’d be aiming, but once a gunshot sounded out, and the magical bullet shot towards the beast, had he not been fast enough to dodge or see where it could have been heading, he’d feel it.

But that wouldn’t be all Lewis would allow, no not at all, he let out another and another, quick to try to aim for what the beast had open. Eyes. Body. Maw. Each one being targeted by a bullet with an oppressive <strong>Boom</strong>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The blond turned hastily, just in time for the man&#39;s shadow to hit him, mere seconds before impact.

He could see the movements clearly in his mind, as if everything was in slow motion. He could feel how each sound shook the earth around him, how the slow but powerful movements brought the man ever closer to him.

He couldn&#39;t use Barrett&#39;s arms at this distance, or else he might’ve hurt himself too. He couldn&#39;t dodge in time either, as he was neither agile nor quick enough to get out of harm’s way. No matter how he spun it, he couldn&#39;t dodge the blow.

And so, Thomas did not dodge.

<em>Reinforcing</em> both his arms and torso, Thomas clenched his jaw and put both arms in front of him as Nikolai collided with his shield. He took most of the momentum head-on, severely underestimating the force of the impact as he flew across the arena for half a dozen meters. The crowd gasped at the grotesque sight before them, that of a kid getting blown away by a man almost twice his size.

He experienced his fall in glorious slow motion, but again his body was not responsive enough to land on his feet. At most he managed to break his fall in a half-fall half-tumble, landing a few more meters away from Nikolai, his arms and upper body thrown in immense pain. Something must have broken from the impact, Nikolai was almost sure.

He needed to buy some time to recover. While his arms were still experiencing the effects of his Reinforcement, Thomas groaned and reached into his coat for two round objects, throwing them haphazardly over Nikolai&#39;s shield.

Before the man could wonder what they were, his eyes went white and his ears rang, destroying both vision and hearing in overwhelming succession through what could only be...

<em>Two flash grenades</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ryujin, whether because of his strategic genius or wanton bloodlust, made sure of it. That left the original two, and the smaller one did not possess the speed to dodge the tackle.

So, he didn’t. Nikolai skidded to a halt, which left the insect to fly across the dirt and sand. The way he fell looked terrible. Like a ball tossed across a driveway, he bounced to a halt a few meters away. No way in hell he could get up after that. Not someone like <em>that</em>. 

Except, he did. And gave Nikolai his own gift. By the time he realized what they were, it was way too late to react.

The world went bright, and the crowd vanished. Replaced by the intensity of a thousand suns that sang their hideous song. A while ago, a similar situation had occurred. Sucked for a moment, but he recovered fast.

Ten seconds passed before the effects started to diminish. In the meanwhile, he flailed his shield in a circle around him. No way in hell that idiot had another projectile up his sleeve immediately, but that Rider was another matter.

“<strong>Oh. Mistake. Vermin!</strong>”

With his declaration of intent, he charged forward once more. Shield raised up high, he ran towards the last spot he <em>thought</em> he saw Thomas. The way he squirmed confirmed he was on the right track.

In truth, he was a foot or two off. It was a rather silly sight, but that tower of a shield would still strike Thomas if he didn’t move out of the way once more.

“<strong>Still.</strong>”

Muscles bulged. Black <em>grew</em>. Fabric groaned as it stretched to its limit. Despite the natural order of things, Nikolai grew in size. If he looked monstrous before, now he was downright gigantic. 

Air whistled behind the descent of his shield.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite that, Lancer could not say he was disappointed. After all, even a useless servant was still a servant, blessed with prowess the likes of which mortals could never hope to attain. It was only natural that his foes would survive. It would have been far more abnormal if they had keeled over and died just like that!

But, there was no time to aimlessly ponder. After all, what went around would assuredly come back around, and even now, Rider was preparing a counter-attack. The musket aimed forwards, and Ryujin found himself staring the abyss within the barrel...

<strong>BOOM!</strong> The first bullet came roaring out, and Lancer was just barely quick enough to dodge, the projectile scraping the side of his head before whizzing off into the distance.

<strong>BOOM!</strong> Another shot, this one aimed at the dragon&#39;s body. Lancer just barely had enough time to shift his body, moving one of his armoured scales to cover his underbelly, and causing the bullet to plink off.

<strong>BOOM!</strong> Yet another shot, this one aimed directly at the monster&#39;s gaping maw. Once again, Lancer&#39;s reaction time proved just barely enough as he pulled his head backwards, the bullet striking one of his many protruding fangs, but failing to leave substantial damage.

<strong>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</strong> Bullet after bullet after bullet came soaring through the air, each of them just barely dodged in the nick of time. Clearly, Lewis had this beast on the ropes. All he needed to do was land one lucky shot, and then--

<strong>&quot;Do you intend to start taking this seriously?&quot;</strong> Ryujin would suddenly speak up, his voice dull, dripping with boredom, <strong>&quot;Because if you don&#39;t,</strong> <em><strong>then I will</strong></em>.<strong>&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Each shot though seemed to either be dodged by the writhing serpent, or his scaling made it impossible to shoot through. The beast wasn’t going to give up any openings easily, Lewis knew it, but he could have made it more fun! 

The explorer’s eye was moving in rapid movement, each step that Ryujin had managed to slip to, Lewis had his sights baring down on him, but to say these bullets could even do much harm towards him was difficult, and his comment was making it almost unfair to play against him.

“Hey! You’re the one not getting hit! What else do you expect when I have a gun and you’re running around like a big chicken! But come at me then!”

Lewis said back, with enough conviction to show he wasn’t afraid of his threat, and to back it up, the lad had his musket dematerialize, the weapon disappearing with a sparkle of gold before he reached behind him to grab his cutlass, quick to have himself run towards Ryujin’s way. He wanted to get into something serious? Then he’d be taken seriously!

With Lewis’ quickness it wouldn’t take long, rather if his opponent hadn’t taken him seriously he’d see that the boy had been been near him faster than one could expect, his arm raised as the cutlass gleamed brightly in the light for an attempt to strike against him.

If he were optimistic, he would say that a few ribs had been fractured on impact. At least his arms were still in one piece, he noted, although they were hurting like hell.

He would be lying if he claimed that he didn&#39;t bring this upon himself. His carelessness at the beginning of the fight had earned him a tackle that very nearly ended the fight with a blow...

But he wouldn&#39;t make the same mistake twice.

Thomas quickly got up to his feet once he stopped skidding on the ground, powering through the pain and running in the opposite direction of Nikolai. The ten seconds of rest he was given were more than enough to establish a safe distance between the two of them. He wouldn&#39;t be caught off guard by a sneaky tackle twice.

Before running away, he made sure to inscribe an <em>explosive rune</em> on the ground as a parting gift for Nikolai, the detonation of which would not cause significant damage but would get his attention for a few seconds.

Again, that was all Thomas needed for his next move. 

He stopped in his run and dropped to one knee. Placing his hand on the ground, he closed his eyes and concentrated. Through the magical circuitry of his hand, he could feel the lay of the land. How the ground overlapped itself to create a network, a structure made of sand, stone and dirt, incalculable lines that blended into the solid ground. He carefully <em>folded</em> these lines, bringing out a cube of material from the ground. This cube was then bent further, collapsing in on itself to form a solid needle-like structure. Once he was done, Thomas was holding a small condensed <em>javelin</em> in his right hand, a bit longer than his arm was tall. <em>Displacement</em>.

His eyes finally opened and he quickly looked around for the confused Nikolai, making sure he didn&#39;t close in on him like he had earlier with his tackle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He missed by a mile. To hit would be to break the very nature of ‘Space’ as a concept. Only a Servant with a gift to never miss could even hope to land the attack. Watch, look at that shield—

<strong>BOOOOOOM</strong>

Dust billowed from the sight of impact. Chunks of dirt flew away, scattered to the sides. More than reasonable. The thick, metal shield now sat in the ground, sunk a few inches.

A greatshield. A thick, rectangular, not edged shield. Into compact earth. 

And he looked unfazed.

“<strong>Hrngh,</strong>” he groaned, and the shield popped out of the ground with a firm yank. His body slowly shrunk, back to its original large size. His helmet swiveled around, towards Thomas. Pure disdain spilled from the black blob, even if he couldn’t see it.

“<strong>Not. Clever,</strong>” he said. Nikolai pulled himself back on his feet and smacked the black metal against the ground. Terrible idea.

<strong>FWOOSH</strong>

Another flash, but this time of heat and flames. The world exploded. More dust sprung into air, but this time with a dark tint and filthy black smoke. His armor avoided catching fire, but red embers singed his legs. 

Once more, he stood unfazed. “<strong>No. More. Games.</strong>”

This time, his approach was much more steady. Shield held forward, he marched towards Thomas and his makeshift spear. If a ‘surprise’ attack didn’t get him down, then a more forward approach should do the trick.

Already did his mass grow once again. A skilled mage would detect the use of prana with his increased strength, but it felt… unnatural. This brute knew next to none in terms of Magecraft, yet here he was. Animalistic Strength, at his beck and call.

With much more time to react, Nikolai swung the metal at Thomas. If the last enhanced strike was any indication, then this strike would <em>hurt</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sarcasm flowed out of the dragon&#39;s mouth like rushing water through the Missouri River, a never-ending stream of thinly-veiled taunts that refused to slow down, let alone stop. But that meant little, for it was still the early stages of this battle. While the Masters were already in the thick of combat, the Servants had barely begun, but as Lewis drew his sword and charged forth, that would all change.

It was a short distance between the two, but both Lancer and Rider were faster than they looked. In the end, this clash wouldn&#39;t be a matter of physical speed, but reaction speed. The Servant who could better predict and counter-attack their foe would be the victor.

But while Lewis was on the offensive, Ryujin had the privilege of defence. He had all of the time in the world to react, while Lewis would have to react to said reaction. It was a dangerous game, and yet, the dragon was unmoving, unflinching. His nerves must be made of iron, to keep such a straight face, to be utterly still in such a situation. Even now, the biting edge of the cutlass came closer and closer, until it was only a second away, a half second, a quarter second, a split second--</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028448417732636712 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028448417732636712><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 09:26 AM">09:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>SRCHT!</strong> The cutlass buried itself into the chest of Lancer, accompanied by both the sound of flesh being torn and the stifled gurgle of pain that it elicited. However, just as soon as that groan of pain dripped through treacherous teeth, it gave way to a leaking giggle, before bursting into a flood of laughter.

<strong>&quot;KUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Your masterful tactics have proven devastatingly effective!&quot;</strong> Ryujin bellowed between spurts of laughter, a pointed finger tracing the inner edge of the blade currently embedded in his body. <strong>&quot;Truly, truly, TRULY, you are one of the greatest minds of your generation! KUHUHU-KUHUHU-HAHAHAHAHA! Surely, SURELY, your beloved America must have cherished you dearly, you wise rascal! KUHUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA--&quot;</strong>

Lancer suddenly grabbed Rider&#39;s sword arm, and as though a switch had been flipped, the raucous laughter transitioned into an inquiring tone, precise and clear, though no less filled with mirth than his previous hysterics.

<strong>&quot;But, now you&#39;re in my range, are you not? You&#39;ve kindly sacrificed the advantage of distance, and saved me the trouble of approaching you. Now, defeating you will prove trivial. I&#39;m afraid I must rescind my compliments - this tactic was not smart.</strong> <em><strong>It was folly.</strong></em> <strong>Though, it is not surprising.

I’ve gotten more game with that rifle than you could count, don’t underestimate me!”

Each word of the lizard just made Lewis wish to shut up him faster. Everything he said was as if he were trying to unnerve the poor lad into messing up more and more, having Lewis not only have to divert his thought to coming up with a way to defend himself verbally, but also keep the fight in his favor. And, from Lewis’ perspective, he was doing well! After having made it close to the beast, he found his cutlass that plunged into the beast’s skin, giving the reaction he needed, a painful groan. . . And then suddenly, a low laugh.

With his proud and smug voice, Lewis could feel himself almost unravel at the thought of how he had so easily mentioned America, the boy tried to pull his arm back, wanting to rip his sword from his foe’s chest and continue to try chop this snake in two. But, when he was trying to pull his blade back, a fierce hand grabbed onto the Rider’s arm, holding it still before the owner threw another insult his way. Lewis glowered a bit, anger rising on how he continued to insult his home. 

“Don’t say anything about Jefferson’s America! We put a lot of effort there, you damn bully! He may not be here to beat you, but I’ll make sure you eat those words.”

For a moment, Lewis’ words cut deep. Clearly showing the lancer how much his words were getting to him now, and while Lewis had been trying to ignore them, he couldn’t. He was enjoying himself before, now seemed to be more angering than anything. The boy gripped the hilt of his blade, his hand a fervent force on it as he attempted to do another fervent pull away from the lancer’s grasp in hopes of getting himself free from him.

Thomas hadn&#39;t noticed the effects on Nikolai&#39;s body at first. The surprise tackle and resulting flight in the air didn&#39;t allow him to get a good look at his opponent. This time around, he saw the mercenary&#39;s muscles grow significantly larger. Was it Magecraft?

No... Thomas refused to believe that a raging beast could use Magecraft as such. It was most likely pure instinct, one of its characteristics. Something in his biology, perhaps.

The time for introspection was cut short when the greatshield was swung at Thomas. His arms and chest were still hurting from the previous blow, but his legs fortunately worked just fine. A powerful but slow strike could hardly reach him if it wasn&#39;t a surprise attack or he wasn&#39;t very close to him.

Thomas leapt back, barely dodging the powerful strike with his accelerated senses. The air brushed violently against his face, throwing his immaculate hair in all directions like a magnified hair blower.

There was no doubt about it: if he took one of these blows without Enhancement, <em>he would either die or suffer a fate worse than death</em>.

Clutching the javelin in his right hand, Thomas took advantage of Nikolai&#39;s follow-through and threw it with all his might at the titan.

&quot;...cursed!&quot; But unfortunately, the javelin narrowly missed the man and lodged about ten meters behind him. The scientist was not a fighter, he could not throw things that well under pressure. Especially not in his current situation, <em>against a man like Nikolai</em>.

Closer than ever to Nikolai, Thomas barely stepped back as he readied himself for the titan’s next blow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“<strong>...</strong>”

Alexandria was despicable. Terrible. To ignore the overhead reason for their fight was a mistake, but this truly was the bottom of the barrel. They seriously could not find <em>anyone</em> with combat prowess? Not a single soul? And to make it worse, they convinced this supposed geezer that he stood a chance? 

His shield lowered to the side. With his free hand, he threw a punch at Thomas’ face. “<strong>Stupid. Keep. Weapon.</strong>”

After the punch, he would take another step forward. With little to no personal space, there was nowhere to go but backward. Nikolai took yet another step. And another. Halfway through the second one, they made contact. Every other one continued to push him back.

“<strong>See? Defenseless.</strong>”

Their little parade continued on for another few steps before the massive man stopped suddenly. His foe would fall to the ground, dumped like a load of bricks. It mirrored his first move, but without all the brute force or intention behind it. Did the man intend to do anything, or was this playtime?

“<strong>End. Charade,</strong>” he lifted his foot high into the air. There were no inexplicable growths this time, nor hostility. The boot would lower down onto Thomas, and press down. Ryujin would surely slaughter Rider, and this one was a wide-eyed Private on his first mission. Going all out was unnecessary.

Half the effort would still incapacitate twice over, but whelps needed to learn their lesson the hard way. The delusion would end. Thomas would learn the hard way that battles were best fought by soldiers, not scholars.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, despite his efforts, Lancer&#39;s grip was like an iron shackle, immovable and unbreakable. Perhaps against a <em>normal</em> foe, the pain of the stab might&#39;ve been enough to allow him to escape, but it had become evident than Ryujin was not a normal opponent. 

<strong>&quot;Oho! Finally, the seal has been broken!&quot;</strong> Lancer cried out in celebration, their exclamations shifting in pitch with every twist and turn of the blade in his skin. <strong>&quot;Is this truly the best and noblest hero that Alexandria can offer to fight for it? A thin skinned child who lacks both skill and composure in equal measure? NNNNNNN, for shame, FOR SHAME!&quot;</strong>

A sudden surge of boos erupted from the crowd, no doubt stirred on by Ryujin&#39;s little speech. The hatred washed over him like a warm shower, refreshing him like a cool breeze. Yet, as enjoyable as it was the pluck the strings and watch the instrument sing, it was little more than a distraction. It was all well and good to make the hero suffer for one&#39;s own amusement, but when the time came, it was best to slit their throat, crush their bones, and watch the life fade from their eyes 

That time, of course, had come now.

<strong>&quot;Alas, while I profess a fondness for playing with my food, I have little interest in toying with spoiled meat. Allow me to return you to the dust.&quot;</strong>

At that, Ryujin would open their hideous maw, allowing magical energy to coalesce within their mouth. It took the form of a fierce anti-glow, a brilliant black darkness, a bright nothingness that flowed like fire. It swirled about, tendrils of it snaking between teeth and pouring over his lips, every drop exuding an aura that screamed trouble. Then, with one last look of disdain, Lancer would expunge it from his mouth and send it towards Lewis, aiming to reduce Rider to little more then ash.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He’d get his sword back if anything. It was either that, or be turned to ash like his threat had promised. 

Ryujin’s maw opened, revealing a concentrated abyss of magical energy that could only be compared to an abyss, it’s malicious swirl speeding up as the beast charged it, forcing Lewis’ tugs to become frantic. He needed to hurry. In a brief moment of panic, the boy took to one of the few resorts he had, his skill. Now was a good time to activate it.

It would have been slight, something at first unnoticeable. The normal feeling of Lewis’ cutlass being lodged in flesh of the beast was something he easily could have gotten accustomed to. But in a few moments, the feeling would have changed. The blade, instead of moving its few moments, could be felt sliding about more freely, his arms feeling a need to put more force to them to hold it inside, only to soon become increasing a need to acknowledge. Lewis on the other hand, felt less of a need to pull as forcefully, albeit he looked the exact same, until what could could only feel like a ripping sensation could be felt by the beast.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029157560823058442 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029157560823058442><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 08:24 AM">08:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was strange, how exactly could he have been feeling this when he hadn’t done anything. To Ryujin didn’t <em>seem</em> much different, let alone change his appearance. But there was a weird blue aura around him, one that soon would look like a stream flowing from him, away from the commodan into some unknown direction, but it flowed somewhere. To something. Lewis rose a foot, quick to break his stance of yanking from the beast to pulling toward it, trying to go about sawing at the muscle and tissue he had on the inside before planted a heavy boot on him in a kick. Something was wrong. Had the beast not been giving up his assault he’d feel full force of the change the boy had. This kick felt heavy, <em>too</em> heavy, in an attempt to have him let go enough for the boy to back himself away from where he could have been trying to blast him and for the reptile to question where he got this strength from.

Again, seeing was not moving. In hand-to-hand combat, as slow as the blows seemed to him, Thomas could not dodge a fighter&#39;s blows. Their speed and technique were on completely different levels. The Commodan&#39;s cheers doubled as the scene unfolded, their previous chants giving way to a cascade of boos and insults directed at both Nikolai and his Servant.

As if playing with his prey, Nikolai slowly advanced towards the scientist until he fell. The shield blow and the punch had finally gotten to him, standing on his two legs proved too difficult. Nikolai realized this and went to finish the job, wishing to end this miserable fight with a painful looking stomp.

Only two words escaped Thomas&#39; lips as the titan&#39;s foot lowered, almost inaudible in the wake of the Commodan&#39;s cheering and booing.

At the same time, <strong>an explosion blew Nikolai’s hand</strong>, the one he previously used to shake his opponent’s hand. That coupled with the momentum the javelin carried with it allowed Thomas to roll to the side just in time, narrowly avoiding a full body crush that would have collapsed his already fragile ribs.

&quot;Battles... are not duels...&quot; He slurred, doing his best to shake off the blow to his head. &quot;It&#39;s not about the strongest fighter... it&#39;s about the one who fights the strongest!&quot;

A sharp pain arose from his lower side as the object burrowed into his armor and pierced his flesh. Not deep enough to cause serious issues, but it threw him off balance.

Immediately, his senses flared up. Unlike last time, the only indication that he used any imitation of Magecraft showed via the familiar burn of prana. His body kicked it into high gear, and worked over time to keep his body in tip-top shape. The pain from before faded into nothing.

And it’s the only reason he could keep his hand from the rune.

<strong>BOOOOOOOOM</strong>

The world lit up once more. Flames erupted from his palm, with enough force to throw him to the wayside. Despite his active increased endurance, even that bomb lit up his nervous system like a christmas tree. Every neuron screamed in agony, and he clutched the damaged hand. 

It looked manageable. The glove had been torn asunder, and revealed an ugly mismatch of pink and black. Smoke emanated from the many hairs that were burned to a crisp, the smell nauseating. 

Unfortunately for his foe, this was still not enough. His free hand, which shook from the pain, reached around and pulled out the weapon. 

”<strong>Grgh,</strong>” he grunted, and it was snapped in two. His hand flailed for a moment, and he transferred his shield over to the other arm. A tentative grasp of the handle proved his hand capable. Or, at least enough for the next few minutes. A doctor was in order after this.

Once he turned his attention back to Thomas, all he could see was red. No coherent thoughts went off in his head, as a different part of his head took temporary control.

<em><strong>KILL. MURDER. TEAR. MAIM. DESTROY.</strong></em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 03:59 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029452661596114984 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029452661596114984><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 03:57 AM">03:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Nikolai stomped to Thomas, and wasted no time. A hand shot for his throat, and lifted the man upward. Heavy, muffled, short breaths escaped his mouth. The librarian struggled to breath, and he jerked even higher. Despite the slowered perception of time, this course of events happened with great gusto. 

In this moment, he could see one physical characteristic of Nikolai: a single eye. A part of the helmet’s visor must’ve blown off with the rune, which revealed a wide, dark blue pupil. The remnants of an eyebrow sat at a clean forty-five degree angle.

 Time froze in that single moment, as they stared back at each other. The emotion went far beyond anger. Beyond fury. Beyond <em>reason</em>. There existed no better human definition of intent, ferocity, lividity, than the partial expression viewed now. 

But to try and define that expression as ‘human’... felt wrong on a conceptual level. 

The world rose. And then, fell down. All Thomas could see now was the sky behind the steel framework above.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lewis was facing down the twin jaws of death and defeat, both of which drew nearer with each passing second. Indeed, it would take a miracle to escape this situation, nothing short of divine intervention to avoid demise.

Or perhaps, just the helping hand of a king.

Suddenly, Rider came upon renewed strength, and what was once an even match suddenly in his favour. In a single moment of Herculean might, Lewis tore his sword free and delivered a mighty kick to Ryujin, breaking his grip and sending him skidding back across the dirt. 

The dragon stood there for a moment, stunned by what had just occurred, magical energy still swirling in his jaws, before he allowed it to pour outwards, a wave of black fire scorching the earth beneath his feet. Then, his eyes turned up towards Lewis once more, shining with joyless contempt.

<strong>&quot;It appears I underestimated you. A shame that you did not use that opportunity to kill me, because I</strong> <em><strong>never</strong></em> <strong>make the same mistake twice.&quot;</strong>

Ryujin lowered a claw down to his wounded stomach, palm resting beneath the gash. Was he tending to his wounds? No, on closer inspection, one could see the wound move, watch it pulse and gyrate as though it were alive. Then, out from the bleeding gap came a head, one with many sharp teeth and few rounded edges, ripping itself free and coiling itself around Lancer&#39;s arm. On closer inspection, it was undeniably a serpent of some kind, but that revelation only raised more questions than answers.

Questions that would not have time to be answered.

With a roar of anger, Lancer surged towards Rider once more, swiftly making up the distance as he grabbed the serpent, flinging it head-first towards Lewis.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It didn’t matter the methodology. The crowd roared with cheers, the young lad managing to be able prevent a beast’s attempt of a devastating blow. It was nothing sort of a myth itself. But the most entertaining part was to see Ryujin be sent back from their original position, a trail of dirt showing the force of his kick against the beast.

Luckily for Lewis, he hadn’t been in the blast range for the dragon to release the black fire breath it had gathered, the earth under it turned the same color, the air wobbling to show the temperature of it, and soon the smell of burnt ground wafted about. 

His opponent’s comment against him had only made lewis raise his cutlass once more, the blade now a dirty red as the sun gleamed against it. His own form of nonverbal taunting, but the blade trembled when he noticed something in the distance. The wound he had created breathed life into itself, it’s once open flesh a gateway to see another head that was there, one of almost the same stature as the original. The crowd silence themselves, Lewis could feel a sense of disgust about it. He hadn’t seen such a creature do such a thing. It wasn’t even something he expected anything to do. It reached around it’s master arm. 

In those brief seconds of confusion, Lewis hadn’t registered that the beast was closing in on him, the newborn head going towards him while the main body continued only second behind. The explorer tried raising his cutlass to defend against the first target, but in some left himself open towards the next.

The beast breathed into his neck like a rabid dog, and what little of his face could be perceived only reinforced the image that <strong>Nikolai was not man</strong>. That uneasy feeling Thomas had felt throughout the battle made more sense now, as the beast he was fighting went even beyond beasts.

And the way his fingers slid around his windpipe didn&#39;t lie: if he wanted to, he could have ended his life. All he had to do was squeeze a little harder, and Thomas would have been killed.

Luckily, or perhaps sadistically, Nikolai smashed Thomas violently to the ground instead. The sudden shock took his breath away, leaving him unable to recover from the previous strangulation. He felt his consciousness slipping away, a slight blackness spreading over the sides of his eyes. Unable to move, unable to breathe, Thomas&#39; back really was against the wall...

Which meant now was the time for the final blow.

Crawling across the floor, Thomas fought unconsciousness as he tried to get closer to Nikolai. Just a little closer. He had only one chance. He only had this once chance. Every millimeter counted. He had to get as close to Nikolai as possible.

No human could ever hope to win against it in battle. Should he lose and this thing fight again for Republic, Alexandria would be truly finished. <strong>He had to kill this thing</strong>. If he didn&#39;t do it now, all hope would be lost.

All along his arms and legs, <strong>countless Runes had been inscribed on the librarian&#39;s skin in preparation for battle</strong>. Explosive Runes that would detonate at will, the same kind he had inscribed on the thing&#39;s hand earlier. If he detonated them all at once, and then <strong>Rewinded</strong> the damage immediately afterwards, he could <em>theoretically</em> deal a huge blow to his enemy while keeping his life intact. 

In an effort to ignore all doubt and self-preservation, Thomas used <em>Suggestion</em> on himself. It was his only hope of winning. It was the only way Alexandria could keep its records intact. The thing would never succumb to anything less than this. He had to do it. It was the right thing to do. It was now or never. Now or never. It was now or never. Now or never.

&quot;<strong>...now...or...never...</strong>&quot;

The runes exploded. A flash of light shot out from the Masters&#39; side, then a sharp <strong>BOOOOOM</strong> quickly invaded the Commodan, signaling the beginning of the end for one of the two pairs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They did not soar through the air, nor were they <em>meant</em> to. Too big. Too tall. One would need a rather large explosive positioned close to them in order to even get close to such a concept. And to get it to work, one would need to be suicidal or desperate to become a martyr if they wanted as best of a chance as possible.

Thomas fit the bill, it seemed. 

When Nikolai came back to his senses, another dreadful ringing sound echoed in his head. No, scratch that— his entire body. Nothing felt real, but in a surreal way. The world sat sideways, covered by the billow of black smoke and even more dust. 

The last thing he remembered was his feet lifting off the ground and going backwards. An explosion. A bomb. That supposed geezer had been packing heat all this time. Alexandria wasn’t unique in allowing a few lunatics onto their side as well, it seemed.

At least his helmet was still on. He couldn’t feel the rough dirt and rocks, which meant his armor survived. At least, it existed on his person. 

Slowly but surely, he pulled himself off the ground. As he climbed to his feet, a feeling returned to his body. Not a pleasant one, but it beat whatever else he felt before. Not a single sound could penetrate the incessant ringing, though.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029884471467585537 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029884471467585537><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 08:33 AM">08:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
An ache formed in every nook and cranny, every crease of his skin and every pore of his skin. It’d been a while since he’d felt this bad. These days, it took whatever the hell Thomas did to do that. 

Annoyance returned to his senses. That little—

Deep breaths. In. Out. <strong>In. Out.</strong>

He lost control back there. Couldn’t let that happen again. Not now. Not yet. Remember, here for Her. It was... his sister. That was right. He has a sister.

Sapphire. Had to find his sister. Don’t forget. Don’t lose control. Don’t let <em>it win</em>. Otherwise, all was for naught. He would do something right, even if it was a sorry excuse of an apology.

A few more seconds passed. Where was his shield? Not too far, a meter or two away. Slow steps got him there, and a few curses to bend down and grab the thing. Man, this <em>sucked</em>. 

Did Thomas even exist? Such an explosion put a number on even <em>himself</em>. Surely the brat had been atomized in the blast. Even a firework could do a number on a human. A dozen imitated military-grade bombs. 

Without anywhere else to go, Nikolai shambled towards the smoke and dust cloud. A crater had formed, with a mass still inside. If the lad was lucky, he would’ve been spared the agony of any dying moments.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, it was an unknown in this battle, something that wasn&#39;t clear, that couldn&#39;t quite be defined. Its purpose was unclear, and thus, it could not be predicted. It was not an error to focus his attention on it.

However, it was very much an error to take his attention away from Ryujin. The devil you know is certainly more tolerable than the devil you don&#39;t, but to leave either unattended?

<strong>&quot;NNNNNNNNN! FOOLISHNESS!&quot;</strong>

The serpent would suddenly alter its path, shifting its body to narrowly avoid the cutting edge of Lewis&#39; cutlass, and wrapping itself around his arm. Its scales were uncomfortable against his skin, like having sandpaper slither all across you, its spines like nails poking into your flesh. However, the discomfort was minor compared to what came next.

<em><strong>STOMP!</strong></em> The entire weight of Lancer&#39;s body came crashing down onto Rider&#39;s chest foot-first, smashing him into the dirt. Once again, Lewis found himself restrained by the dragon, but this time, he lacked the element of surprise. This time, Ryujin intend to dispatch him swiftly and efficiently. The serpent slithered along Lancer&#39;s leg and coiled itself around him arm once more, before straightening itself into a rigid position, reminiscent of a spear. 

<strong>&quot;You fought earnestly, American.&quot;</strong> Ryujin hissed under his breath, a whisper, only audible between the two servants. As he spoke this requiem, he pointed his serpent down at the boy, and it began to crackle with power, magical energy flowing into it. <strong>&quot;An admirable trait. It will serve you well under my employ. Now, let us test your mettle-- &quot;</strong>

Ryujin&#39;s voice was confused, as though he wasn&#39;t sure what had just occurred. But as more time passed, and he became more sure in his appraisal, a wide grin spread across his face.

<em><strong>&quot;He blew himself up.&quot;</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He couldn’t predict that it all. His braced his cutlass with hopes that the first would be skewered against it, trying at least take one away from the hydra like servant, but the force against it never came. Rather, the original head had its body switch its angle, slithering around his arm in its snake like fashion, his large body forcing the American to drop his weapon. 

The feeling came all at once, the impact so strong that Lewis hadn’t noticed he’d been forced onto the rough ground till he found himself there, his head facing the clear sky. The weight of the beast felt like boulders pressing against his chest, forcing the boy to take in whatever shallow breaths he could. His new found strength was helpful, but he hadn’t the best endurance.

The snake’s head had turned rigid, rider already feeling the way mana began to drain from its surroundings, all gathering together to swirl into his jaw once more for that burst of black flame he previously let go of. With a moment of struggle, Lewis writhed under Ryujin’s weight, but rather like a snake in grasp of a hunter. 

“You—You won’t kill me that ea—easily! I won’t go dow—down like this a second time!”

Ryujin’s comment forced Lewis to spit back his reply in anger, his features a lively red as tried to kept his glare at the beast. But right when he seethed in anger, an explosive and mind wrenching <strong>Boom</strong> had sieged both his and his opponents attention. The crowd themselves all simultaneously gasped about as if one hive mind, Ryujin’s attention snared and Lewis had turned his head almost instinctively to see what that could have been. His eyes tried to clear through the smoke, focusing on the slight sight of blonde that had now been singed black and grey from the explosion. Barnes.

“<strong>Barnes!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030148101945692320 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030148101945692320><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Oct-22 02:00 AM">02:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His stomach lurched forward, once again panic seized his nervous system and made everything into a thin sludge. Lewis’s word felt a sense of guttural and primal worry as he watched the smoke clear with wide eyes. His once admirable writhing into a forced and undignified flailing about. His hands grabbing at dirt as he tried to get towards his master the best he could. It was embarrassing, the crowd seeing a boy awkwardly moving about under Ryujin’s weight as the other had blown himself up, but it was something they’d instinctively done. The beast could feel the strength under him trying to move him about, and had he not been too focused about Lewis, he’d try to wedge himself away, not taking much time to scramble to his feet and run towards the scene he had witnessed.

Thomas&#39; body lay at the bottom of a huge crater in the middle of the Commodan. His once beautiful face was disfigured beyond recognition, with his nose, lips, and most of his skin blown off by the explosion. His hands and feet were reduced to nothing. The muscles and veins of his limbs were exposed to the hot sun, white smoke emanating from them like a human campfire. Everything was painted black, as if dipped in black paint then in coals and ash.

His torso, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape... in one piece, at first. The damage to the internal organs was minimal. The placement of the runes and his Strengthening made it better. More importantly, his <em>brain</em> was still functioning. His face may have been damaged, but what was behind it was relatively fine.

However, processing what his body was going through was an impossible task for him. The pain, a hundred thousand needles soaked in alcohol that pierced his skin, plunged deep into his muscles and then stirred. A pain that went beyond words. A pain that would drive you crazy. Pain that would make you beg for death. Pain the human brain was not supposed to feel.

His eyes were open, but he couldn&#39;t see anything. He tried to move his arms, to do something, but there was no feedback. It was as if he was a doll, doomed to stay in that position forever. Little more than a limbless torso, little less than a concentrated pain machine.

Honestly, <strong>the fact that he didn&#39;t die immediately after the explosion was nothing short of a miracle</strong>.

Without even the strength or vocal cords to incant, Thomas&#39; synapses managed to bring an idea to the surface through the blinding pain, as if struggling against death itself.

Suddenly, <strong>chunks of blood and body parts that had scattered across the arena flew into the air</strong>. Torn skin, shattered bones, ligaments, broken cartilage. Blood that had evaporated from the explosion condensed into liquid form, traveling through the air and then <strong>directly to the crater</strong>.

The blackened and coagulated blood on the ground around the corpse came back to life. It entered Thomas&#39; corpse and gave him the color he had forgotten. The charred bits of skin slowly returned to normal. The ends of his hands and legs reformed into solids, then into cohesive shapes. His face returned to a pinkish color, and the missing pieces returned to their usual places. 

The Commodan fell silent as the onlookers became aware of what was happening, as if they were witnessing a miracle before their eyes. Outside the crater came <strong>a healthy, if nearly naked, Thomas</strong> looking up with an unfocused expression on his face. No broken ribs, no missing limbs, no disfigured face. <strong>He was alive</strong>.

But his mind was not on Nikolai or his Servant. Not even Lewis&#39; scream could wring a reaction out of him. All his brain could do was try to make sense of what was happening around him, how its body could go from near death to a full recovery.

Suddenly, Thomas fell to his knees and violently threw the contents of his stomach onto the floor. His mind still scarred by the pain he had just endured, he was now completely and utterly vulnerable to any attack that might come his way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not too many people could blow up and not immediately perish. Fewer would be conscious. From those, it seemed only one could put himself back together. For that, he had to commend Thomas. 

As bits and pieces and droplets, all returned to their rightful owner, as all the damage done was slowly yet surely reversed. He slowly raised a finger and poked a chunk of tissue on its path back home. It squished slightly off course but stayed true to its invisible thread.

He followed along and reached the now whole body of Thomas. The librarian looked fine for half a second, then threw up his lunch onto the floor. The foul stench hit his nostrils immediately and overpowered the smell of smoke and dirt that still clung to the wind.

“<strong>Cute.</strong>”

Nikolai sidestepped the still-recovering man and bent down behind him. Thomas lifted, with two massive logs pulled against his chest. One stayed across the newly knit flesh, while the over moved to his head. A palm now rested on his hair, and fingers dug into his skull. He could still move his legs, but any kicks would thud into a thick suit of armor.

“<strong>Try. Again? Broken. Neck.</strong>”

With the problem child addressed, Nikolai drug him along. Their destination was clear now: Rider and Lancer, the former stuck to the ground and the latter with a twisted smile plastered on his face. 

The plan had <strong>failed</strong>. Defenseless and on the verge of collapse as was, there was little doubt who would walk out the victor here.

“<strong>RESISTANCE. FUTILE. SURRENDER.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At first, Ryujin was incredulous. Thomas&#39; body had been a scorched wreck, a mess of burnt flesh, one that just barely recognisable as human. And yet here he was, whole once more. But, could he be too surprised? After all, Thomas Barnes was a <strong>mage</strong>. Such a filthy, untrustworthy, despicable lot. Tricksy liars who deceived and schemed and died screaming. In the mind of the tyrant, they only ranked behind blacksmiths and dragonslayers in terms of ire.

In the heat of the moment, the confusion was enough to allow Lewis to wriggle out, escaping out from underneath Lancer. Finally, a critical moment presented itself - the monster had let his guard down, and now, the noble adventurer had the perfect chance to--

<strong>&quot;YOU&#39;RE WIDE OPEN!&quot;</strong>

Suddenly, Ryujin launched himself forward, wings slicing through the air as he soared towards Thomas, serpentine spear in hand. It did not take a genius to figure out his plan - he was going to land the killing blow on the Master while he was crippled in agony! While Nikolai was at least kind enough to offer surrender, it seemed that Lancer was either unwilling to be merciful, or unwilling to wait.

With a manic scream, equal parts glee and fury, Ryujin aimed the fangs of his lance down towards Thomas as he soared towards him.

<strong>&quot;COME, AND LOOK YOUR GOD IN THE EYE AS HE DAMNS YOU TO OBLIVION!&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His master was weakened in his new rewound state, evident by how the large armored being had easily picked him up like a weed, threatening to snap his neck.  In turn, Lewis took out his rifle, being quick to try to raise it up and aim towards Nikolai’s direction, hoping to find any sort opening to shoot at. But, the more he ran towards him, the easier it was to see that the armor had no gaps, no spaces, simply it all seemed to perfectly protect him.

With his scrambled concentration that had gone to his master, he’d been ignorantly dismissing the idea of Ryujin lunching for an attack. With his spear like head, Lewis wouldn’t see it until Ryujin sped past him, the head aiming right for a carefully held Thomas. Lewis switched his aim as best he could, firing off a few shots from his musket towards Ryujin’s direction.

An overwhelming fear gripped the barfing Thomas. He instinctively tried to move his arms, but they stuck to him like hot glue. The thing had a hold on him. There was no escape. His legs hit hard, meeting little more than the hot metal of the thing&#39;s armor.

<em>How did he survive</em>.

The shock in his brain was still there, but that question managed to resurface. There was no way it had survived. It didn&#39;t make sense. He didn&#39;t understand. It was beyond reason.

<strong>BARNES!</strong>

<strong>SURRENDER. </strong>

<strong>LOOK YOUR GOD IN THE EYE...!</strong>

The stimuli weighed too heavily on him. The Commodan&#39;s loud cheers, the voices around him, the phantom pain of his previous bombardment. The underlying effects of his previous Suggestion were fighting with his survival instinct, the resulting nervous disorder clouding everything that tried to pass through him. His brain melted, his thoughts slowly disappeared. Blood slowly trickled from his nose as he struggled with all his might to free himself from the thing&#39;s grasp, his gauntlet-bearing arm searching any surface on which it could inscribe a Rune.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As the ringing sound disappated, the boos and curses towards Republic returned. Any cheers were clearly directed towards the Alexandrians. He couldn’t make out any singular entity, but it was easy to see the faces so full of emotions. The variation put any work of art or picture to shame, with how visceral their feelings were.

Absolutely pitiful.

The large man adjusted his grip, and grabbed the hand that had the Rune-Maker on it. “<strong>Give. Up.</strong>”

At the end of the day, and with how the two Servants were positioned, it was either him or Thomas that ate the brunt of whatever Ryujin had planned. Add to that, since the other had just tried to evaporate himself to be a martyr, it felt easy to let nature run its course. 

“<strong>Too. Eager,</strong>” Nikolai called to Ryujin, as he tried his best to position Thomas squarely between himself and Lancer. Did his Servant need to be so dramatic with his actions?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikolai protests. Of course he would. He was still a man bound by the ropes of morality, a leash held in his own hands. He had told his &quot;Servant&quot; only to worry about the other servant, insisted that he would be able to handle Thomas with ease. Not an incorrect assessment, but an incomplete one. A common beast only ate their fill, and left the rest to the carrion. He lacked the ruthless edge to pick the bones clean, the foresight to sever the jugular of the prey before it could escape.

Simply put, any beast could inflict necessary violence. Only a monster could provide essential suffering.

It did not take long for Lancer to close the distance, and soon, he found himself face to face with Thomas&#39; limp body, held up by Nikolai. Indeed, the circumstances were absolutely perfect. There would be no chance at escape, no chance at mercy. What an ideal torment! Yes, it would be a most worthy anguish!

<strong>&quot;You have lost, Thomas Barnes, but you know not the bitter taste of defeat without dignity! THAT IS WHAT I SHALL PROVIDE!&quot;</strong>

As he raised his serpentine spear into the sky, his intention became obvious. He was not doing this to win - they had already won. No, Lancer was doing this to <strong>break the spirit of Alexandria</strong>. To make the crowd watch their hometown heroes experience despair, to send a warning to all who might seek to stand against the dragon king.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The weapon&#39;s maw grew in size, pronounced fangs erupting forth, dozens of uneven teeth all as sharp as knives staring down Thomas. All the while, the magical energy continued to spark off, like a live wire in the midst of a power surge.

<strong>&quot;Your ability to manipulate time may be sufficient to undo physical trauma. However!&quot;</strong>

Zahhak tightened his grip on the spear, and with a slight twist of the shaft, all the cursed energy rushed towards the snake&#39;s maw, coalescing within the mouth, each of the teeth turning into that same shade of ominous black.

<strong>&quot;You cannot run from who you are. You cannot run from anathema in your soul! Allow me to demonstrate the glory of THE TRUE GOD OF THIS WORLD!&quot;</strong>

And just like that, the lanced was plunged down into Thomas&#39; chest--

<strong>ANGRA CINMAN - THE KISS OF ███████</strong>

--yet, it did not stop there. No, in fact, it did not even leave a wound behind. Not a single drop of blood was spilled, not a mark left on the skin. No, the snake had not stabbed through the skin - it went <em>through</em> it. Wriggling, squirming, writhing, it pushed through the outer layers of the body, infesting itself in the deepest corners, leaving no trace of the body untouched.

Then, there was a quiet moment. A moment of tranquillity. There was nothing. Nothing going on. Had the Noble Phantasm failed to fire?

And then, Thomas would feel <strong>the most loathsome venom he had ever known flow through his magical circuits.</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They threw things in the arena, screamed themselves silly, ripped the skin off their faces in protest as they watched their ‘heroes’ beaten within an inch of their lives and more. The outcome had long been decided, but Nikolai and Lancer continued. They pushed past... no, they sprinted past the limits. Bullying was not the correct term, it was cold-blooded tyranny.

The message was clear: <strong>Alexandria had no hope</strong>.

Lancer&#39;s words were misunderstood by the already shocked Thomas. Something about time, about escape, about the true god of this world. His slowed perception of time worked against him, it was like the words were too slow to make anything of them. He didn&#39;t get it. The booing in the stands made him fearful of everything, made him completely paranoid. Why were people rebelling against him? Weren’t they on his side? Was it because he was losing? Were they not satisfied with his performance? But he had done everything he could. How could his efforts go unnoticed?

And what about Lewis? Where was he? Why was Lancer standing in front of him? Had something happened to him? He couldn&#39;t see him anywhere. His big eyes circled around the spear looking for the Rider, but found nothing. Where was Lewis? He needed Lewis. If Lewis wasn&#39;t there, he couldn&#39;t win. He couldn&#39;t stand up to the likes of Nikolai. He would not get away unscathed. He would most certainly…

<strong>The snake-like spear sunk into Thomas’ chest.</strong>. Thomas looked at his chest, watching the spear slowly, oh so slowly pierce through his body like a hot knife through butter. Even though it did no damage, the phantom pain of the explosion made Thomas jump in terror. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030771092492664832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030771092492664832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Oct-22 07:16 PM">19:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But the venom that followed was what really sealed Thomas&#39; end. 

&quot;Ahh...&quot;

The dragon&#39;s miasma slowly seeped into his magical circuits. If the phantom pain that marked his brain was a 9.5 out of 10, this went far beyond the scale itself.

<em>”...haaaaaaAAA... &quot;</em>

Like molten iron coursing through his veins, unable to move in agony, the pupils of Thomas&#39; eyes narrowed to a cold point of terror and pain. His scream intensified with each passing moment as the molten iron spread through the extremities of his body.

<em><strong>”...AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!”</strong></em>

Until it silenced even the booing of the audience, alone echoing throughout the Commodan. Louder than the announcer&#39;s voice. A shout so loud it hurt to hear.

If this was allowed to continue, then maybe Thomas would really be...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From how Ryujin sped past him, to how the second head seemed to become spear like once more, piercing through his master as if it were but a needle going through cloth, seamlessly. The crowd’s reaction mirrored Lewis’, who watched. Had he not moved? Could he move? 

The lance drew no blood, it caused no mess, rather, it was perfectly harmless physically. But even then it caused his master to scream gutturally, forcing Lewis from his state. Each one grew increasingly more agonizing, each as if he’d experienced fate worst than death, and every reiteration made Lewis try to pick up the pace. It wasn’t until he got close enough where the boy had grabbed his master by the hem of his clothes and tried pull him from Nikolai’s grasp that he could truly see the sight of it all. 

He had been the first to concede, his master not being able to. Every tug causing him to scream it louder,

<strong>”We surrender! We surrender!”</strong>

The boy hadn’t been as tall as the other master, nor the servant, but with Thomas’s leg in hand, he tried to pull him his direction with all his might, hoping that his master’s limp body would fall into his arms to take him from the arena. In summation, Alexandria had lost its first battle. The City Grail Wars had began, and Alexandria had already began to show its lack of strength.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030890238333173822 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030890238333173822><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Oct-22 03:09 AM">03:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

We surrender!</em>”

As those words left his lips, Rider felt his tugs meet no resistance. As a matter of fact, the force would be pushed <em>into</em> him rather than away. 

Nikolai practically shoved Thomas into his hands, as if the very presence of him hurt on every possible level. His position also placed him directly between the monstrous serpent and himself, to shield each other from direct contact.

“<strong>Tell. Alexandria,</strong>” Nikolai dug a thick finger into the forehead of Thomas, “<strong>Send. Soldiers. Not. Martyrs.</strong>”

Nikolai turned away before Rider could get a chance to look into his own eyes or an explanation for his cryptic warning. Now, the big brute faced his own Servant. This time, the finger dug into the scales of Ryujin. 

“<strong>Talk. Later.</strong>” 

He did not hide his visible eye from this one, his anger or frustration. If Lancer was at all capable, then he had made some conclusions and assumptions of his true nature. That, and the fact that they were together for the entire tournament, meant that he could only hide his secret for so long. Thomas surely would make falsehoods, but Ryujin would make conclusions. 

And speaking of the crowd: they were worked up. Pissed off, distraught, and everything in between. The disproval only grew from the crowd as the bell rang once again, to signal the end of the fight. 

“<strong>Well, there you have it folks! The first round of the tournament goes too… The REEEEEEPUUUUUUUUUUBLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030903840259723285 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030903840259723285><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Oct-22 04:03 AM">04:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
That only made it worse. 

Already did a few of the boldest throw their leftovers into the arena. The red-and-white popcorn boxes barely made it a few feet in, and the colorful paper cups splashed onto the dirt with little effect. Each thud reverberated in his skull, and with each curse, a nail hammered into his head.

Nikolai pushed past his Servant, one hand clutched to his own head and his shielded hand attempting to tug Lancer along, like a frustrated parent with their child. The winner had been announced, and the crowd would surely not let them forget their devilish-ness. No reason to stay, and tempt the stupid with ridiculous ideas.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But, alas, nothing truly good in this world could last forever, as the surrender was issued and the bell tolled the end. There was no need to prolong the suffering any longer. Their victory was absolute.

Though, he did quite enjoy this taste of heaven, however brief it may have been.

<strong>&quot;So be it...&quot;</strong> Ryujin outstretched an arm, and after a moment of pause, the serpents emerged from Thomas&#39; body, slithering back to rejoin its master. Twas a pity that he could not allow it to continue for but a moment longer, but he did not complain. The pain might have stopped, but the scars that it left? Those would continue to ache for a long time.

As he turned to leave, he was stopped, not by Lewis, but instead, by Nikolai. All it took was once glance at his furious eyes to tell that he took issue with what had just occurred. All Ryujin had to offer in turn was a smile, one that looked frighteningly genuine compared to his common farce.

<strong>&quot;Of course, of course. There is</strong> <em><strong>much</strong></em> <strong>to discuss.&quot;</strong>

Swatting his Master&#39;s grip off his body, Ryujin would march off, leaving the losers of this contest alone to soak in their grief.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The winners of the fight left without a word. The losers remained in the Commodan&#39;s shadow. Slowly but surely, the crowd began to quiet down. Anger turned to concern as the spectators realized what had just happened.

Republic was now one step closer to its goal. Any misconceptions that Alexandria would emerge unscathed from the City Grail War were now disproved. It didn&#39;t matter if they were on the side of justice. It didn&#39;t matter if they were the ‘good guys’. That was the unfortunate and harsh reality with which the peaceful librarians had been cursed with.
