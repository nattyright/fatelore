Reynard panted as he could finally drop Ā-Qing&#39;s <s>fat</s> body on the cold floor of the Pharos lighthouse. His body relaxed and his tail grew limp. Who knew that running right after you had eaten your fill was a terrible idea?

&quot;...You complete <strong>buffoon.&quot;</strong> He immediately started to verbally assault Ā-Qing, not pleased in the slightest with the way she behaved. &quot;You think you could just apologise to those men? After all the chaos you have caused? Nope! They would never be happy!&quot; He shouted, reminiscing of his tales where people would accuse him and put him on the stand. No matter whether he appeared just or corrupt, the lion king of the animal kingdom had only one sentence in mind for him: Death. If being forgiven for your crimes was something that didn&#39;t even happen in fairy tales, how could he expect it to happen in the dreadful &#39;real world&#39;?

&quot;They would have probably used you as a slave till the day you died.&quot; Reynard scoffed, putting a hand in his pockets and taking out the credit card that Ā-Qing had waved around earlier.

&quot;Now, I didn&#39;t save you out of the kindness in my heart.&quot; The fox&#39;s frown turned into a sly grin. &quot;This contains unlimited currency, doesn&#39;t it? In that case, I&#39;ll be taking it as payment for rescuing you. Seems fair to me!&quot; It was, of course, not fair. But Reynard didn&#39;t care. It was in his nature to pillage and steal.

...Even though part of him had hoped otherwise. Part of him wished that Ā-Qing would assert herself. Be more selfish and refuse him. He didn&#39;t even know he wanted this, but he just knew for a fact that he would have done the same in her position.

There was nothing wrong with being selfish.

“...but we were in the wrong, were we not?” she eventually replied, her reasoning so pure and simple it would feel out of place even for a child, yet curiously enough, the conviction with which she spoke those words was unshakeable.

“If you do bad things, bad things will happen to you in turn,” she uttered in a quiet tone, her eyes lowered and voice softly speaking against the coastal winds, unbothered as they ruffled her hair, “I just did not want anything bad to happen to us to make us sad.”

She expressed these words with a smile, but one that was unlike the previous grins she had worn in the presence of her new friend. This one was regretful and serene, the product of a life bound by a certain set of rules, even if oneself isn’t fully aware of them.

Folktales and myths were slaves to a single fundamental rule, that being to impart a lesson. A Moral to the Story, so to say.
Those who do good will be rewarded, those who do bad will be punished. Traits like honor, compassion, and selflessness would always trump over those that are cowardly, greedy, and selfish, with death sometimes being one of the kinder punishments, depending on the region. Even if the players cast in the story would be oblivious to predictable roles they played, the narrative formula that must always be upheld, they were nevertheless subject to its rules and would feel its effects most keenly.

Like a fox beaten for stealing.
Like a girl ashamed of her first murder.

Be good and good things will happen. Be bad, and the opposite will hold true.
Though Ā-Q&#236;ng could not express the reasoning for her strangely childlike behavior as she herself had yet to be privy to this revelation, Reynard ironically possessed enough self-awareness of the medium he was birthed from to not have his mind fall victim to its influence, thus marking the contrast between these two Servants.
Such was the difference between the two.
Though both originated from myth, one was aware of the fact and one was not.
Therefore one still strictly abided by the morals of their story, and the other did not.

Ā-Q&#236;ng’s despondent expression slowly melted away to reveal a warm smile, this one true and genuine, if not a little confused.

“Payment?” she repeated after Reynard as he reminded her of how he had gone out of his way to save her, “If that is enough for you, I do not mind. You even carried me all the way over here, thank you… Reynard.”

The tensing of her lips was imperceptible as she spoke his name, though the slight pause was telling. She clearly had to stop herself from calling him Young White again.

The moment she tried to take her credit card back, he would leap away and run off into the distance, as he had done many times in the past.

Of course, that moment never came, the fox instead feeling underwhelmed as Ā-Qing gave him a bright smile and quietly nodded. She went as far to thank him, an act so disgustingly naive that he wanted to grab a nearby bucket and puke into it. Yet despite that, it simply made him all the more curious. Why was this Servant so nice to him?

&quot;Forget it.&quot; Reynard sighed, tossing the card back to its rightful owner. &quot;There is nothing that money can buy for me, especially money that is so free.&quot; He narrowed his eyes at her.

&quot;Goats are probably dumber than you. That&#39;s why they are happy to eat trash.&quot; He spat back before getting closer. &quot;And really, bad things happen to bad people? Laughable! Are you aware of how many bad people thrived and good people succumbed? Plus, would you call yourself bad?&quot;

He paused, giving Ā-Qing a moment to ponder his question. &quot;Thought so. I am nothing but good! To myself, of course, but still, nothing but good!&quot; He proclaimed with a chest filled with pride.

&quot;Then we get you, who repeats this childish nonsense. I know that you&#39;re a child, but wake up! You&#39;re a Heroic Spirit now! Surely you know that the world isn&#39;t black and white? What are you, some kind of <strong>fairy tale?&quot;</strong>

The moment he blurted those words out was when it hit him. The strange mana aura coming from Ā-Qing, combined with her innocent and pure manners. She was a poster child for a character loved by children worldwide. A perfect main character.

&quot;...Are you?&quot; Reynard asked, shivering at the prospect of his theory being true. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His comment about her goats did upset her a little, but it was what followed that was important.

To his question of whether or not she was bad, she had only one clear answer, “Yes.”

She spoke matter-of-factly, as if it was only obvious that she would think that way.

“That is how I know. Even that bad man who fought our country eventually lost, and Xī Shī-” her words were caught in her throat as she stumbled over the first contradiction, as the woman she admired never did anything wrong, yet still she died. Suddenly and uneventfully. Just when she was reunited with her lover.

“...good people only have bad things happen to them by bad people, even if they don’t deserve it, and that is why bad people are bad people,” she muttered with a strange intensity.

Ā-Q&#236;ng regarded Reynard wistfully as he spoke.
To proclaim so confidently that one was a good guy felt like it would be so liberating, the life of someone who was truly free. In stark contrast to her, someone who wanted to be good because they knew they were bad, to Ā-Q&#236;ng, Reynard was someone good who just accidentally broke minor rules here and there. They were a fox after all. Just like how she didn’t hate Grandpa White for his antics, so did she not consider Young White’s actions to be evil solely because their actions did not agree with human values and rules.

As a Servant she was at least technically aware that she must have garnered some sort of fame to be remembered by the Throne of Heroes and considered worthy enough to be accepted into its halls, but still, the the fact that her legend would be widespread enough to rival her childhood folktales was baffling to her.

“Like the story of the Magic Lotus Lantern or the Monkey King? No, not at all,” she dismissed Reynard’s assumption out of hand, vastly underestimating the impact of her own myth, “Perhaps F&#224;n L&#237; told others about me after… the fighting. I can see why he would,” her eyes wandered across the shoreline, her body turning away from Reynard and pretending to take in the view as she deliberately tried to avoid looking him in the eye, “So perhaps that is how people know of me? But I do not think the stories about me would be told to children.”

She allowed herself a short pause before she clumsily tried to change the topic.

“What about you? I do not think I have ever heard about a fox as smart and strong as you. Do you look like a human only because you are a Servant now?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The lessons she had learned were far too heroic. Too selfless. She was falling victim to stereotypes, giving out her simplified view of good and evil which drove the fox mad.

<em>&quot;How can you be so naive?!?&quot;</em> The fox felt like screaming. <em>&quot;You sound like a tool, you nimrod! Making yourself look like an open book without a care in the world. Don&#39;t you find it infuriating?!&quot;</em>

He took a deep breath and calmed himself, deciding to just listen to Ā-Qing for now since there was no use in causing another spat between the two. Her disposition and heroic tendencies made him think that she was clearly a fabled hero of some renown. Based on her reaction, one wouldn&#39;t think so, but that scent of mana in the air was enough confirmation for Reynard. Ā-Qing was different, perhaps not as much as him, but different nonetheless.

&quot;Good or bad, it shouldn&#39;t change your nature. If you came from a tale where you were a protagonist, chances are you were most likely good. Likewise, if you were to stop a protagonist, you would be bad most of the time.&quot; There was a hint of irony in his voice, but not perceptible enough for Ā-Qing to notice. &quot;And it doesn&#39;t matter if your stories are for kids or not: You would still be a household name. There are plenty of tales for adults, after all.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025453470892961903 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025453470892961903><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Oct-22 03:05 AM">03:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Reynard droned on about his view of fairy tales. It was a bit too highbrow for Ā-Qing, hence she quickly turned the tables on him, asking him about his own identity. The fox&#39;s ears remained poised. He took a deep breath, readying himself for his grand intro. His true identity on display...

<strong>&quot;The name is Reynard. Reynard, the King of Foxes.</strong> I come from Spain and in the books I feature in, I was the ruler of the Island of Foxes™️. I was a fierce leader, engaging in war and peace with the Island of Raccoons™️. To this day, the war has no outcome, for the author and his extended family of six all drowned at sea.&quot; He said with a fully serious tone, no hint of deception in his voice at all.

&quot;My adventures had many exploits, including rescuing Alexandre Dumas from prison, defeating Napoleon in an arm wrestling contest, being the inspiration for the movie <em>Ratatouille</em> and so much more.&quot; He kept feeding Ā-Qing&#39;s mind with fantasies. &quot;As for my current form, I simply assumed it for marketability purposes. I hear this type of look is popular in the East. Care to confirm?&quot;

After Reynard was finished with his lengthy introduction, he asked Ā-Qing a simple question.

Protagonist and antagonist.
Though she knew the surface-level meaning of those words, her lack of a proper education and inability to read was starting to show. While she would know which character in a story to root for when read to her, she was not educated on the finer meanings and implications that came with those titles. Still, she understood what Reynard was saying on a basic level at least, enough to ask him, “But what if you are the enemy of the story and not the hero?”

Despite her conviction putting up some resistance to Reynard’s assurances however, she was ultimately not knowledgeable enough about the subject to make a solid claim, her life’s experiences, especially those of interacting with people outside of her family, being woefully insufficient.

Reynard on the other hand was the complete opposite.
A King and a Warrior both. Ruler of an entire island of foxes even! Along with this and that and whatever else he could come up with on the spot, though of course Ā-Q&#236;ng had no reason to doubt him and was thus unable to spot his blatant lies.

The only ones that I ever see just try to steal my goats.”

Taking a few steps closer and crouching down, Ā-Q&#236;ng put herself on fluffy tail height.

“I am sorry that I do not know who all these people are, but you must have seen so much of the world; how lucky that I was able to meet such a famous fox! I think everybody in China would think the same. Who would not want to have such a strong and fluffy fox as their friend?”

It seemed that Reynard’s deception had worked, and the girl was now suitably impressed. Even though her spirits were still a bit down from their discussion about good and bad, it seemed watching his tail from close up restored to her at least some portion of her usual glee.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His aura wouldn&#39;t be out of place amidst royalty and he even remained still enough to give the girl a good view of his tail&#39;s exquisite fluffiness.

In reality, he was trying his best to hide the smile and laughter inside his head.

<em>&quot;Incorrigible fool!&quot;</em> He chuckled to himself. <em>&quot;I even said that I was a thief before, yet she&#39;s buying into this like bees to honey. I could have her eating from the palm of my hand for days!&quot;</em> He laughed, treacherous schemes filling his mind as he pondered on what to do with Ā-Qing. She seemed too naive to ever backstab him, so he would be more than glad to milk her for her worth. After all, she had already displayed plenty of her capabilities earlier.

But first of all, he needed to learn more about her. &quot;You claim to not know some of the most famous men in the world?&quot; The fox asked in an inquisitive tone, point an accusatory finger at her while maintaining his faux-dignified appearance. &quot;China, hmmm? I see.&quot;

A Servant from the Asian continent. Definitely a case of oil and water, since Reynard&#39;s knowledge of the eastern hemisphere was limited to tales of Gon the Fox. Ā-Qing also had an interesting way of speaking, sounding polite and softspoken compared to the rude Aida. Plus, he hadn&#39;t heard anyone else praise him as fluffy. All signs pointed towards Ā-Qing being from a more formal time, where respect was king. Judging by her looks and outfit too...

&quot;I have revealed my name, now give me yours. Who are you exactly, lady of the dumplings?&quot; He asked. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

You see, I just lived in the mountains of Zhejiang all my life and only rarely went to the villages to sell my goats and run errands for mother.”

She allowed herself to sit as she prepared to answer the esteemed fox’s inquiry. As he had so graciously shared his life’s exploits with her, it was now her turn to return the favor, though it was rather suspicious how her chosen place of rest was a lot closer to Reynard’s tail than it needed to be.

“Even though my name is Ā-Q&#236;ng, the people in the village always used to call me Yuen&#252; because I did not show up a lot, so I think they just forgot my name…” Ā-Q&#236;ng seemed completely unbothered by this rather depressing tale, simply reciting it as fact, “So my life is not at all as amazing as yours! I did not save any friends from prison or was in charge of a big island like yours, and the only thing I ever did was fight some of F&#224;n L&#237;’s soldiers after he asked me to.

“You see, the place I lived in was a hostage of the state of W&#250;, and F&#224;n L&#237; wanted to change that. We just happened to meet one day after some mean swordsmen of W&#250; killed one of my goats and I beat them up, and so he asked me to beat up his swordsmen as well because I think he wanted them to become better fighters. I did not mind but…” Ā-Q&#236;ng’s eyes drifted off, not too sure how much of her story she was willing to tell, “...after a few days I left. They eventually fought and won against W&#250; in the end, which is nice I think, but I did not stick around to find out and stayed with mother in the mountains again. I never left again.”

“See, my life is not nearly as interesting as yours! It was a long time ago too, so I don’t think anybody even remembers what happened…”

<em>“...at least I hope they do not.”</em>

Her last whisper was uttered in a hushed tone, clearly not meant for anybody’s ear save her own, though perhaps she had underestimated the refined senses of a trickster fox.

“You said it before, but I think people now only remember what happened back in the Spring and Autumn Period as fairy tales.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hopefully a bit brighter than forest animals.&quot;</em> Reynard thought to himself, groaning inside despite his noble appearance. <em>&quot;Then again, I guess it would explain her intellect...&quot;</em> It was almost comical to think of how two-faced he was, deriding Ā-Q&#236;ng in his mind but appearing respectful to her in person.

&quot;Ah, apologies. I should have not assumed such knowledge to be that widespread. The world is a big place, after all.&quot; He said, even though in his eyes the world was just whatever felt relevant to him at the moment. He let Ā-Q&#236;ng explain her life story more, explaining how she lived in a village, how she was gifted with tremendous martial arts, how she defeated soldiers and then trained them...

<em>&quot;Huh, could that be why-&quot;</em> The cartwheel flashed back in Reynard&#39;s mind. That thought felt so alien and invasive, as if it had been planted there by a higher force. Could that have been Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s doing? But they weren&#39;t allies at the time, which meant-

<em>&quot;She can&#39;t control it. Interesting. Very interesting.&quot;</em> The fox snickered inside, thinking of any possible ways to abuse it. Oh, the image in his head of having his comeuppance on his own Master...

...It proceeded to be interrupted by Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s story, as her voice suddenly grew somber and cold. Instead of bursting into flame in the climax, it petered out like a spell of rain. Swift and brief, not long enough to leave even the ground wet for harvest. But most importantly of all:

<strong>Reynard could tell that she had lied.</strong>

It wasn&#39;t him being good at reading people, but more so the fact that it was in his <strong>nature to lie.</strong> That is why, as a Heroic Spirit, he was given the unique ability to tell truth from lies. The <strong>natural insight of a trickster.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025876517001121923 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025876517001121923><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 07:07 AM">07:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Reynard muttered, seeing chains wrapped around Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s neck. She couldn&#39;t see them, of course, since they were something exclusive to him. Anytime someone lied, chains of Magecraft wrapped themselves around their necks and tightened. They grew loose when the person stopped lying, which in Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s case, was when she started talking about pointless things such as the weather.

The fact that she lied about her life being interesting and about others not remembering her. It ticked him off. How <em>dare</em> she complain about something that he thought of daily? Get your own damn problems.

But, perhaps, this was a way for Reynard to get a second opinion. It was perfect too, for Ā-Q&#236;ng would never know that it related to him whatsoever. His image would be clean and pristine. All he needed to do was ask.

&quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng.&quot; Reynard spoke with an assertive tone. <strong>&quot;Do you regret your life?&quot;</strong> He asked, inching forward, one step at a time. It came to the point that it felt like he was towering above her.

&quot;Do you wish it were different? That you had taken a different path? That you had lived or died in a different way? Do you even wish you were born at all?&quot; A flurry of questions, each as packed as the last. But the fox knew that people only revealed their true faces when cornered, and so he proceeded to do exactly that. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This question required not a second of thought to answer, as Ā-Q&#236;ng answered with harsh acceptance. Just as summer gave way to autumn and the moon’s somber glow yielded to the morning rays, so did Ā-Q&#236;ng feel the utmost remorse for the ultimate crime she committed in life. Her guilt had crossed beyond the boundary of sorrow and had become fact, nothing more and nothing less. Just as one would not mourn the withering of leaves in winter, so did she lose the capacity to to feel depressed over her mistakes, so unforgivable was the sin she bore.
Only guilt remained. Raw and pure.

“I have prayed for things to be different many times, for there to be another path.”

Each of Reynard’s questions she answered in the affirmative.
It was clear that beneath her bright and bubble exterior, there existed a truth she tried her best to look away from, one that the inquisitive fox’s prying had brought to the surface.
To be plagued by such regret.
To wish for another outcome.
Naturally someone trapped in this toxic spiral of thought would consider their life a mistake, to wish to be unmade, yet the words that Ā-Q&#236;ng spoke next would seem to refute this assumption.

“But why would I ever wish to not be born at all?”

It was as if his final question was so utterly foreign to her that she could not comprehend why anybody would think that way, or rather, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that she could not ever imagine a scenario where her not being born would be the better choice. In fact, the zealousness with which she now faced him was enough to make one think if that line of thought was borderline criminal in her mind.

By why? What suddenly possessed her to cherish her life with such conviction when all she felt about her past was regret?

“If I never lived I would have never met Xī Shī, so of course I am happy that I am alive and was able to live my life as I did. Or rather, I am not happy with the things that happened in my life, but I am happy that I lived it… if that makes sense?”

Her tone relaxed again, her brief bout of momentary madness now seeming like a dream, as she chuckled over her inability to articulate herself well. On the surface it was a cute gesture befitting a girl her age, but in the context of their conversation it rang hollow.

“I would live my life and make the same mistakes a hundred times again if that was the only way for me to meet her, but is that not normal? As the King of all Foxes, you have to have also experienced something that made it all worth it, no? Even if it is just the fun we had playing together or the dumplings we ate.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No one in the world truly lived without regrets. Not children, nor adults, nor animals. Everyone once had the thought that their life would be better if they had acted in the past, instead of in the present.

But the fox was still shook when the girl in front of him reasserted herself. The chains wrapped around her neck started to slowly crack, until they grew completely loose and vanished. This happened anytime Reynard&#39;s target stopped lying for longer than ten seconds, meaning that everything that Ā-Q&#236;ng had said since his question was <strong>100% truthful.</strong>

He could not believe it. He stared at her with an almost sordid expression as his ears froze and his tail grew numb. He could not ever comprehend how a character from a myth or fairy tale would be happy with their life&#39;s outcome.

&quot;But you, you died alone didn&#39;t you? Alone, unloved and with barely any friends or family, over at the mountains.&quot; He let himself slip a bit, speaking in an incredulous tone as he questioned Ā-Q&#236;ng. &quot;You truly have zero regrets?&quot;

He asked despite already knowing the answer. The fox could not read minds, but if Ā-Q&#236;ng hadn&#39;t lied in a while, it only meant that everything she had said was truthful. She even chuckled in the face of Reynard&#39;s worries, facing her troubles head on with a smile.

&quot;Of course I experienced mistakes. Setbacks as well. I am a king, yet I have plenty of regrets. You&#39;re telling me you have none? <em>Zero?!&quot;</em> Reynard&#39;s shock turned to fury as he stomped the ground in front of him. It would have looked more imposing if it weren&#39;t a child doing it.

&quot;Hah! Don&#39;t make me laugh. Even now, you must still harbor some sort of regret.

Reynard kept pressing it. He refused this. He refused to believe that someone born from fairy tales, just like him, could be <em>happy</em> with the current state of affairs. Was Ā-Q&#236;ng really as noble as she appeared? Was she as pure of heart in the novel she came from? He hadn&#39;t read her story yet, but he refused to believe that every hero was a knight in shining armor.

Perhaps it would be easier for you to understand if you had only seen Xī Shī…”

Her eyes wandered off, the tone of her voice turning silent and calm.

“Her eyes were brighter than a fresh mountain spring, but clearer.
Her skin was paler than the clouds, but softer. Gentler.
Her lips were more delicate than blood sage and shinier than morning dew.”

Those words were not her own, an echoed account given to her by F&#224;n L&#237;, yet whereas she had not understood their meaning when she first listened to them, now she placed the utmost care into each and every letter, wanting not even the portrayal of Xī Shī’s charm to be sullied by an inadequate narration.

“Did you know that apparently when she looked into a river, the nearby flowers shriveled once they saw her reflection and the fish forgot how to swim, afraid to cause ripples in the water to interrupt her image. I never saw it myself, but I wish I did~” Ā-Q&#236;ng hummed happily, the mere recollection of Xī Shī lifting her mood.

“Do you not have something like this? A happy memory that makes all the bad ones go away? No matter how many regrets you have, just knowing that they all lead to this one moment makes it all worth it in the end. Even if my story is not a nice one and the only point of me meeting F&#224;n L&#237; was to cause us all to become unhappy and die alone, Xī Shī is much much more important than any of that!”

“What? No. Of course I am happy that Papa White summoned me. He looked a little scary at first, but he is actually very nice, and he even bought me these nice clothes that you have made even better! He is also very fun to play with. Do you know what a ‘gun’ is? He has one, and he can shoot pretty little rocks at you that explode. He showed me so many new things in just one day, and…” Ā-Q&#236;ng sheepishly rubbed the back of her head as she slowly started to remember her turbulent little adventure from earlier, “...he might scold me like mother does once he finds out about today, but maybe we can just keep it a secret! Either way, I cannot leave him alone and unprotected, he asked me to fight together with him after all, and I promised, so I have to do it.”

Tilting her head with equal parts curiosity and concern, Ā-Q&#236;ng regarded Reynard as she asked him, “Do you and your Master not get along? Does she not like foxes? Even ones that can talk and fight like you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fact that she was able to talk about her past with some form of nostalgia drove him nuts. He had never experienced that once, after all. His story&#39;s exploits were all a result of him trying to survive and live a peaceful life. There was nothing heroic nor profound about it, just the story of a fox wanting to live a simple life.

To be faced with a girl that felt content with the way her story ended, along with describing all the unique people and challenges she encountered without a hint of regret, was something that he never thought he could have.

&quot;Must be nice, having that one happy memory.&quot; Reynard spat out sarcastically, looking at Ā-Q&#236;ng with a raised eyebrow. The girl was too immersed in her own thoughts to care about his reply and frankly, he preferred it that way. They started to talk about Masters instead, with the girl unsurprisingly singing praises of her own Master as well. Reynard and Ā-Q&#236;ng truly were opposites, yet similar.

Similar in the sense that they were both brats. After getting lectured by a child (shorter than him, mind you!) and told about how great her own Master was, Reynard simply couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The fox part of his brain started turning...

&quot;What? My Master?&quot; His expression quickly changed from frustrated to cocky. &quot;Oh, <strong>she absolutely loves me.</strong> Fell head over heels for me at first sight. Even asked for my hand in marriage, mind you!&quot; He raised a finger, marking it was only one of the few stories he had to tell.

&quot;Of course, I refused, because us Servants are transient beings. She was heartbroken of course, but swore to worship me until I disappeared at least. She knew of my exploits as king, hence why she summoned me. Have you heard of the Grail War happening soon? Apparently my Master is participating in that one!&quot; Reynard chuckled, mixing truths and lies as he crossed his arms and appeared triumphant.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 11:35 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025929987360051341 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025929987360051341><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 10:39 AM">10:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I called her mediocre because of her profession. See, she is but a humble librarian. Books and words are her life, and I can&#39;t say I care much for that.&quot; He said.

&quot;But I suppose we can&#39;t all be winners. If anything, someone like her getting me merely balances things out. Every dog has their day.&quot; The boy shrugged. &quot;In fact, I&#39;d say she is getting worried sick right now. Ooooh, so sad without my cutie pie, Reynard~!&quot; He hugged himself tight, mimicking a woman&#39;s voice in an embarrassing tone enough to make Ā-Q&#236;ng blush.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 11:36 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was the first time she heard of a Master expressing a desire to wed their Servant, but then again, this particular fox was of a royal line, one whose exploits seemingly eclipsed the sun if his tales were to be believed. It would thus make sense for a mere mortal woman to fall so heavily for his charms. It was a modern world after all, complete with its own set of modern values. Who knew how much had changed.

“But it is nice to hear that you are friends. It would be too sad for the two of you not to see each other for weeks because you are ignoring each other, especially when you are such a nice fox. She sounds a little weird, but she must be nice as well if you two get along!”

Ā-Q&#236;ng spiritedly smiled in relief, only to be treated to an interesting piece of information that her fellow competitor let slip.

“The War? You fight in it as well!?” her eyes began to sparkle once more, “Me too! My Master told me that he summoned me to fight in the War as well, so perhaps we can play together again like today, only next time together with our Masters. I cannot wait to meet yours!

Ā-Q&#236;ng excitedly stretched her legs and reached into her purse to retrieve two Mana Batteries. Though she hadn’t expended all that much energy in her quick spat with Reynard, she had kept her Secondary Noble Phantasm active for quite a while, fortunately not stretched to its full capabilities of course, and sustained minor injuries. Her sprained wrist had since healed, but in place her stores of magical energy had been burned to fuel the recovery, thus putting her in the mood for a little snack.

Popping one of the Batteries into her mouth, treating it like candy, she offered the other to her playmate, whispering in a hushed voice after having just remembered something, “We should keep quiet about the dumplings and chickens though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was all lies and deceit, of course, but who cared! Not like there was an Aida to tell him no, nor someone else who knew her to shed some light on the matter. Ā-Q&#236;ng was just as gullible as he had envisioned, perhaps even more so than the bears in the woods.

&quot;Hahaha, certainly not. It is actually rather cumbersome. She can&#39;t stand being without me!&quot; Reynard nervously laughed, wondering how Ā-Q&#236;ng could come up with a scenario as ridiculous as Aida ignoring him. If he didn&#39;t know any better, he would have assumed the girl was being sarcastic.

His ears focused more on what came afterward, however, as Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s eyes grew sparkly yellow, perking up at the mention of the Grail War.

&quot;...Wait, you&#39;re in the Grail War as well?&quot; The fox&#39;s expression turned pallid. He let the girl run her mouth a bit more, before she started mentioning playtime. He took a gulp, wondering what kind of &#39;playtime&#39; she even envisioned.

&quot;What a rather odd coincidence, hihihihihi!&quot; He snickered, trying to hide his worries on the matter. It was one thing to fight Ā-Q&#236;ng in an eating contest, but in an actual battle? He would much rather run off and disappear if this was the level of competition he was dealing with. He was never born to be a fighter!

Thankfully, the conversation gradually stepped away from that and refocused on Aida. It seemed as if Reynard&#39;s words had worked a bit too well, since Ā-Q&#236;ng was now rather interested on what sort of person his Master was. The girl asked to meet the librarian, causing Reynard&#39;s mind to go blank for a second.

He envisioned a scenario where Aida and Ā-Q&#236;ng met. One where Ā-Q&#236;ng told her all the embarrassing lies Reynard had made up about her...

Not only did he think he would get skinned alive, but Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s trust in him would be ruined, removing her as a future pawn of his. It seems like lies truly had short legs.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026111667232321546 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026111667232321546><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 10:41 PM">22:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Uh, ahem.&quot; Reynard recomposed himself, graciously accepted Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s mana battery. &quot;That&#39;s a very tempting offer, Ā-Q&#236;ng, and I&#39;d love to indulge, but I am sure that your Master is worried sick as mine is. Best to not keep them waiting!&quot; He said with a smile.

&quot;We can always meet again later, after all.&quot; He nodded.

<em>&quot;I hope you never see me again.&quot;</em> Were his actual thoughts. <em>&quot;Especially with Aida around.

It had been a long day, one filled with adventure and misfortune alike. He could not wait to return back to the dust jackets, stretch his legs across Aida&#39;s bed and scratch some pillows here and there. It was his definition of comfort, after all.

But his journey wasn&#39;t done yet. He realized that soon enough as he started feeling slightly lightheaded, followed by warnings from his Spirit Origin that something was sapping into his mana. He initially thought it was rumbling from his stomach due to all the dumplings, but it would make no sense for a Servant to fall victim to that. The more reasonable explanation was that his mana sources were running dry. He eyed the mana battery in his hand, but it would do him no good. After all, he had been summoned in a Church provided frame, meaning that his mana sources directly came from his-

<em>&quot;That foolish girl. What is she up to now?!&quot;</em> He thought to himself, before hearing a loud, crackling noise come from below him.

<em>crack crack crack crack BOOM!</em>

Hurried screams and curious moans could be heard from the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#culinary-bazaar</span> down below. Judging by the mass panic, followed by a longer crackling, it seemed like whatever had caused the earlier explosion had no intention of stopping just yet. A gas leak? A rogue Servant? Just mother nature extracting its toll?

Reynard didn&#39;t care about the possibilities, since his first instinct in the face of danger was to get away as soon as possible. He turned his tail around, ready to walk past Ā-Q&#236;ng and disappear...until he felt his mana dip down even more. It seemed rather odd for it to coincide with whatever was happening down below. 

Too odd.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026970114437951498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026970114437951498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 07:32 AM">07:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me...&quot; He whispered to himself, before casting a worried glance at the bazaar once more. There was more crackling to be heard, but he perked his ears up, using his keen senses in an attempt to filter out any noise. He was looking for a certain person&#39;s voice, going as far to leave the lighthouse (and Ā-Q&#236;ng) behind in an effort to get closer. He kept descending rooftop from rooftop until-

<em>&quot;That was my favorite dress!&quot;</em>

The voice of a woman. That petulant tone. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it was <em>her.</em> 

He groaned in response, his frown burrowing as he imagined just the type of chaos she got involved in. His meal ticket was throwing itself into the garbage can. He could <em>not</em> let that happen!

Against his survival instincts, Reynard threw himself into the fog of war that was the bazaar. He slid past the screaming crowds and burrowed himself deep into the thick of the fight, slowly emerging on the other side...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026970222072184962 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026970222072184962><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 07:33 AM">07:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>---&gt;To <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#culinary-bazaar</span>

I hope we see each other again soon!”

With that she made to leave while happily waving her new friend goodbye, but something seemed odd.

<em>“Hnn?”</em> she tilted her head in slight confusion as Reynard started acting strangely.

He showed signs of discomfort and unease, his mental state only worsening after a distant explosion rang out, faint screams of panic and hysteria being carried across the still waters of Alexandria’s artificial bay. Something was going on, something big, and it was important enough for Reynard to seemingly forget about Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s presence and invest himself fully into this new incident, leaving her behind without a second word and rushing off towards a new adventure. Without taking his new friend. Let alone saying goodbye. How rude.

Ā-Q&#236;ng could not help but pout at being so rudely ignored, yet ultimately her curiosity won out over her displeasure as she could not help but want to find out whatever could have compelled her playful and free-spirited companion to act in such a serious manner.

After barely any time spent deliberating whether or not her Master would miss her absence, she had already started chasing the fox’s fading presence, spirits soaring in anticipation of the unknown.
