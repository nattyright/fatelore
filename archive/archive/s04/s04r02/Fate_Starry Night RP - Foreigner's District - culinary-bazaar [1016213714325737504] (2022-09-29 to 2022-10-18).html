There probably aren&#39;t gonna be many dishes from those countries, that place serves mostly Brazilian food because of course it does. By the way, do not call me your subject. Neither of us are a subject of one another and we won&#39;t be calling each other that.&quot;

After several minutes of walking the pair reached their destination. Mikail looked at the menu poster and scratched his head, or rather the combat helmet covering it. &quot;Ceviche, lomo saltado... Hm. Pastel de choclo? I&#39;ll be honest, i have no idea what those are. The first two Peruvian and the other&#39;s a Chilean dish it says. Ceviche is some fish salad served with sweet potatoes it seems. Why do the other two dishes not have pictures of them? Anyways, we&#39;re getting all three of those.&quot; Then he ordered the three mentioned dishes, after they were cooked he placed the three plates of food on a nearby table.

&quot;Wait here for a minute. I want to buy something from that tiny shop. I need it.&quot; Mikail pointed at a small dart shop that was across from them and quickly walked over there. He quickly bought a pack of six tungsten tip darts and returned, precisely when a minute passes. &quot;Darts. Used to throw at a dartboard. Normally can&#39;t be used to kill people, but-&quot; Mikail suddenly realized that he was talking in public and can&#39;t say that he&#39;s going to kill people with magically reinforced darts in front of everyone. &quot;You can guess what i&#39;ll do with them, friend.&quot; He then unpacked the darts and put them in one of his ammo pouches.

&quot;So what do we have? Ceviche, yeah that&#39;s a fish salad. Lomo saltado, that looks like fried beef with french fries and rice. That other dish, looks like a casserole with potatoes and beef. Wait. That smells like corn. Casserole with beef and some mysterious corn mixture? Ah, i&#39;ll stop talking. Try them. I&#39;m not hungry, don&#39;t worry. I only eat at home anyways.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Some things are meant to be paired up with each other and some aren&#39;t. But if you insist I will allow myself a bit of an indulgence.&quot;

Manco nodded at Mikail words about not being his subject not really taking them into consideration. He was a king, and for better or worse Mikail had asked for him help and even if the man itself didn&#39;t realize he was treating him as such so even if Mikail didn&#39;t accept it for Manco his master was also his subject. If anything his master words only make it so he wouldn&#39;t outright call him a subject in the open.

As he was left on his own Manco began to wonder about their current situation. It was a bit weird, as far as he knew they were supposed to fight in this tournament. He didn&#39;t really care about either of the sides fighting as there was no right or wrong each side was just fighting for what they believed needed to protect and in his opinion it was a smart move. Rather some ghost of the dead fight and die than the many wars usually took. Still he it was no different on how he fought and slaved other tribes as he found his city and started their empire, he had his reasons some noble, some selfish, none which he regretted so he hoped that whoever won would at least have that peace of mind.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1024796493665812581 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1024796493665812581><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Sep-22 07:35 AM">07:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Either way it was early to make a judgement about this whole situation, specially as his own goal was somewhere else. As he continue to examine the food his familiar continue to observe, the red condor stood on the edge of the roof of the restaurant observing, it stood still and quite that whoever didn&#39;t notice it confuse him with a rock statue. Although a keen eye should be able to tell it apart.  Manco didn&#39;t mind this too much as even if they spotted him they had no way of telling who was its owner. One Mikail returned the inca decided to lay some of concerns on his master. 

&quot;Answer me something Master, you told me you summoned me to fight in this tournament but its been quite a few days and haven&#39;t heard anything about it. Not that I mind, I finished all my preparations but cant help but be curious if you know anything.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever, i have a feeling that we will have an uscheduled fight soon. We just gotta wait.&quot;

Eventually after Manco finished his food the pair started slowly going back home. &quot;So, did you like the food? It looked good. I sure hope it tasted as good as it looked. Bad food can ruin your day, you know.&quot; 

Then Mikail suddenly stopped. There was a strange sight nearby - a woman balancing what seemed like dozens of food samplers in her arms. He crossed his arms and looked at Aida directly in the eyes for several seconds. Seeing the red lenses of his gas mask staring directly into your soul might cause fear in some people. But Aida wasn&#39;t &#39;some people&#39;, she was a hero. Right? Then he shaked his head in amusement, pointed his hand at Aida and looked at Manco. &quot;Did that girl really not think of getting a plastic bag before going to get free food? Heh. People.&quot; He did not think much of it and simply continued walking,

There was an unspoken rule among many criminals of Alexandria - You don&#39;t fuck with Mikail Bernstein. Whenever he was hired as an enforcer by a criminal organization, it was followed by destruction and death. Mikail became almost a mythical figure within that community. He was mostly under the radar and rarely appeared to be hired as a mercenary, but whenever he did, it was violent and incredibly memorable. Each time it was either a silent robot killing everyone in its path or a constantly yelling, unpredictable sadistic maniac wreaking havoc upon the unfortunate place where his targets reside.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="30-Sep-22 02:50 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025028523162865685 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025028523162865685><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Sep-22 10:57 PM">22:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Most of the testimonies Aida recieved from the local witnesses were told in fear and many refused to give a testimony in the first place.

Some said that it was a quiet psychopath that has no emotion and leaves his house only for important missions. There was one outlier which told that he met Mikail in person before and even bought some guns from him, describing him as just some chill guy that always wears a gas mask. 

Not counting the outlier, it seemed that Mikail was a big bad evil guy to be defeated by a noble hero. His outfit was black, like that of an evil black knight, the lenses of his gas mask were red and almost glowing, like the eyes of a dragon, there were rumors about his misdeeds, just like the ones told by secondary characters about an intimidating villain in a book.

&#39;Ah, come on, miss. You&#39;ve got room for one more! Go on, take it! Here, I&#39;ll stack it on top for ya-&#39;

Aida wished she had somewhere to hide. Something to distract the stall owners so they could stop piling samplers in her arms. Did they think it was funny, watching a girl struggle with plates of food piled sky high in the middle of a bustling food market?!

At first, Aida had only accepted the food samplers out of common courtesy, but little did she know that she would become a sight at the bazaar, with the food stall owners eager to join in on what she could only imagine to be some massive prank. Everywhere she went, chefs were eager to add their contribution to her food pile, as if they were playing a game of reverse Jenga. 

&#39;-there we go. Now that&#39;s what I call the leaning tower of Pisa.&#39; The kebab shop owner stepped back with a huge grin, proudly admiring his handiwork: a mini skewer sticking out at the summit of a toppling stack of food, expertly balanced by the exasperated-looking librarian who seemed to have accepted her fate. 

&#39;...Thank you very much...&#39; Aida replied weakly, her face kneaded in between a smile and a grimace. But then her tone changed, and before the kebab shop owner could turn away, she caught his attention for the last time and edged in a question of her own.

&#39;So, now that I have accepted your gift, it&#39;s time for you to receive mine.&#39; She began cryptically, though all air of mystery was lost as soon as she opened her mouth next. &#39;I have a question,&#39; she said importantly. &#39;What do you know of this man named Mikail Bernstein?&#39;

In a flash, the atmosphere changed, the once jubilant air now tinged with apprehension. The kebab shop owner pursed his lips. His eyes slid sideways to glance at the crowd, as if to see whether anyone was eavesdropping. But the bazaar was packed with people, and no one looked remotely interested in what he had to say.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025122268491284650 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025122268491284650><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Sep-22 05:09 AM">05:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But even so, the words that came out of his mouth next were less helpful than the kebab sampler he had stuck onto Aida&#39;s tower of food. Aida listened with a look of disappointment, as the kebab shop owner repeated what she had heard many times already. In other words-

&#39;-Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t do anything stupid. Is there <em>anything</em> new you can tell me that I haven&#39;t already heard from all the other shops before you?&#39; Aida decided to push her luck.

In response, the kebab shop owner seemed to have gone temporarily deaf. He turned to the next customer in line and began to promote his Hawaiian kebabs with an extra helping of pineapples.

Aida left the shop in a disgruntled state. 

&#39;It&#39;s always &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;ask the people at the next shop&quot; or &quot;have you got a death wish, girl?&quot;&#39;, she marched through the crowd, a surly frown on her face. &#39;Why do they keep insisting I&#39;d be walking to my own funeral?&#39;

Suffice to say, Aida was very detached from the unsavory elements that lurked around the underbelly of the city. Though she was aware of the dangers, simply knowing about them and living with them were drastically different stories. It was the difference between not touching exposed wires because you&#39;ve been warned not to, and not touching the wires because you&#39;ve touched them before despite the warnings, got electrocuted, and carried that painful experience for the rest of your life.

There hadn&#39;t been a single day in Aida&#39;s life where she&#39;d felt actively threatened by rumors and hearsay alone. To her, they sounded just like the spooky tales her parents would tell her on dark, stormy nights. Ghosts, monsters, witches, and evil spirits, feasting on people&#39;s fears and haunting their dreams. But in the end, these ghastly apparitions would always be outwitted. There would always be a hero who could overthrow them in a trial of courage and strength.

And she possessed both of these qualities!

Surely there had to be someone who knew of her target and was gusty enough to talk? Someone that looked tough, and <em>mean</em>, and...

Her gaze settled on a figure in the distance, shrouded in the pitch black darkness of their unassuming outfit - or, it <em>would</em> have been unassuming, had the wearer hung out somewhere else, anywhere but in a bazaar full of vibrantly dressed people. The dark fabric of their outfit stuck out like a sore thumb; the ring of empty space around him only accentuated him further, as people steered clear of his vicinity. Were they doing it on purpose? The gas mask they had donned on their face certainly helped, at any rate.

Aida approached him. It was easy to approach someone when there was no one else around. 

&#39;Hello,&#39; she greeted them but did not salute them, for her arms were occupied with food. An eccentrically dressed foreigner was with them as well. Aida&#39;s first instinct was that they were a Servant, but with the equally eccentrically dressed gas mask here, she couldn&#39;t be sure. 

&#39;Are you from around here?&#39; She asked them next. It would be awkward if she tried to interview a tourist who couldn&#39;t even tell the districts apart. &#39;I&#39;m looking for someone.

Just like him his master had made clear he didn&#39;t had any actual stake on this fight between two cities as long as he could fight and hopefully die he was satisfied.  But enough of that, as he hearing they just needed to wait was all the old king needed to hear. 

He focused on the food in front of him, it was quite the experience, in way being a servant was quite liberating. As a king he had to keep a sort of dignified persona all the time and while he still acted arrogant and with the elegance of a king he let out his more human side at the same time.

&quot;It was really something else, such a nice mix of sour and sweet in the ceviche, the softness of the fish with the crunchy toasted corn...&quot;

Before Mikail could even try and stop him Manco was giving a long a detailed explanation of how wonderful was each dish and how well they went together. His words became faster as his voice sounded more and more passionate to the point it was harder to even try and follow him let alone understand him. But suddenly he suddenly stopped as he was greeted by a random voice. Part of him was annoyed as he was interrupted out of his analysis about his lunch but before he could utter a word of protest he winked at the sight of the girl talking to them. 

A small laugh escaped the king lips as he saw how the poor girl was carrying all those food samplers. 

&quot;I am not from here, but my...&quot; he stopped himself from calling Mikail his subject again. &quot;... my friend here may be able to help you. But here let me carry some of those for you.&quot; he offered the girl not really wanting to help but rather he wanted to have a better look at some of the samples so he could have a taste later. 

He extended his arms with smile. &quot;Lets be careful though you may not want to drop a single one of them&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He put his hands on his hips and judgingly looked down at Aida, who was a head shorter than him. He looked like he was about to tell the woman to go get lost, but then Manco started speaking. Seeing his servant&#39;s positive attitude, he decided to be more welcoming too.

&quot;As my friend said, i can probably help with that. I lived for quite some time in this city, so yes, i am from around here. So, who is that someone? There&#39;s a lot of folks heading in this direction, there&#39;s nothing people won&#39;t do for some good food. Do you know how that person looks? Or their name- Hm.&quot; 

Mikail suddenly paused. This was not normal. People never approach him unless he specifically asks them to do so. Is this girl herself not a local? But even if she is not a local, why would she approach someone who is avoided by everyone else? This is either an incredibly oblivious individual or someone who is fearless and completely confident in their abilities. Or maybe an enemy master? Mikail was completely sure that some people saw him while he was going to the bazaar, so maybe this was an enemy master that knew his name but did not know his appearance? But no master in their right mind will try to find their opponent without a servant by their side. Who was this woman?

&quot;But are <em>you</em> from around here? It is normally not advised approach someone like me, as that can result in consequences. Did you not see the other people avoiding me? Are you brave, very stupid, or both?&quot; Mikail now spoke in an annoyed voice with a slight hint of confusion.

&quot;Friend, i think we should still be going. You can carry some of that girl&#39;s food samplers if you want.&quot; He then turned at Aida. &quot;If you still wanna talk despite my warnings, you can follow me i guess.&quot; After saying that Mikail continued to walk in the direction where the pair was going before Aida interrupted them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It helped that his possibly irate face was hidden behind a mask, which was somewhat obscured by the food samplers she had been carrying. She had to turn sideways to even catch a glimpse of him and his peckish companion.

Aida was more than glad to have someone offer to take the food off her hands. &#39;Here,&#39; she said with much relief, &#39;you can have as much - in fact, you can have all of them! I swear, some of these stall owners just want to watch me suffer.&#39; 

She pulled face and eagerly began to offload the food trays into Manco&#39;s welcoming arms. She was as much an expert at carrying the trays as stacking them herself, the years of experience working at the library paying off at such a mundane, yet critical moment. Manco must be delighted to see his own food stash growing as such a rapid rate.

&#39;As I was saying,&#39; Aida turned to the man in a mask as she continued her &#39;work&#39;. &#39;I&#39;ve been asking around, but everyone just keeps giving me similar answers, which doesn&#39;t help at all. At this point, I&#39;m wiling to consider all options,&#39; she sighed dramatically &#39;even someone as unapproachable-&#39; 

She let her words hang for a moment.

&#39;-oh, I&#39;m just kidding. You are alright.&#39; She broke into a smile, as if attempting to liven the mood. &#39;We&#39;ve had to deal with much more difficult clients back at the workshop，‘ she admitted, cluing Mikail in on her possible profession. &#39;Besides, you seem to have a little date of your own! I promise, I will leave you two alone as soon as I&#39;m done.&#39;

Now she looked less like a waitress who had run out during her shift and more like a journalist, though a half-baked one at that. She didn&#39;t even carry a notebook with her!

Bracing Mikail&#39;s guarded response with an inquisitive flash of her eyes, Aida heeded none of the masked man&#39;s warnings and dogged his steps. &#39;So,&#39; she tapped the pen lightly against her chin. &#39;The man I&#39;m looking for is called Mikail Bernstein. Have you heard of him?&#39;

<em>Tap. Tap.</em>

&#39;You must have,&#39; she continued, before her disgruntled interviewees could do it themselves. &#39;<em>Everyone</em> I&#39;ve talked to, I think they know him too.

While the way she decided to describe their little outing was technically correct the way she was referring to it sounded so weird it send shivers down his spine. 

Normally he would let the young lady know this but seeing as he had just received quite the tribute in the form of food samples he decided to be kinder in his word. But before he could elaborate more about why she shouldn&#39;t use the word date she made her request. 

It was hard, Manco was about to let out a loud laugh just like when he met his master. The situation was amusing and funny. The girl had been going around asking for his master and now had him right in front of her but she didn&#39;t know. 

&quot;Well they may have a good reason to tell you thar have you consider that?&quot; The king started as he managed to keep his urge to laugh under control. 

&quot;He is an amusing yet weird man. I will tell ya both me and my friend know him very well.&quot; Manco knew this girl was probably an enemy master but decided to play along for a bit and make sure. His condor remained stationes near them sure to make them know if there was anyone trying to sneak on them.

Though the librarian&#39;s words were na&#239;ve, their intent was sharp. Everyone who&#39;d lived in Alexandria long enough had at least heard of Paganini and his infamous rampages.

This was ironic, the one she was trying to find was in front of her.

&quot;I know Mikail. I&#39;ve met him in person before. He&#39;s a mercenary and a gun dealer that illegally sells pretty good guns. Or an abomination that wants to kill you according to the regular people. And no, he is definitely not like Paganini. As you said, Paganini is famous and possibly dangerous. Mikail is notorious and <em>extremely</em> dangerous. He is known for working as an enforcer for some of the most brutal criminal organizations in Alexandria, annihilating large groups of armed criminals against all odds and causing unbelievable amounts of property damage. Not a single person that he intended to kill ever survived, only some very unfortunate civilians saw his massacres. And they created overexaggerated rumors of him being some invincible monster that kills everything in its path. Now people are afraid that he will go to their home and break their kneecaps if they talk about him in public. Those rumors are not really true, since he would&#39;ve killed the witnesses too if he really was a monster. Personally i don&#39;t think that he is that scary, just like the hundreds of gun nuts and criminals that buy weapons from his gun shop. He&#39;s just some illegal gun dealer who&#39;s coincidentally good at fighting i think.&quot;

&quot;No, we won&#39;t run away if you tell us the reason. We know enough about him to not be scared.&quot; 

He knew that this woman was definitely an enemy master. But he also knew that trying to kill her now won&#39;t be a good idea due to the amount of people here. Then Mikail had an idea. What if he were to lead Aida to a less populated part of the bazaar and fight her there? &quot;And i&#39;m pretty sure i saw him in the bazaar. I might have an idea where he went. I can&#39;t really just give you directions to find him, it&#39;s a more of an intuition thing than precise knowledge. But i think we still have some time for a little adventure. Just follow me, we&#39;ll find him.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1025845327087018127 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1025845327087018127><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Oct-22 05:03 AM">05:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Either way it had picked the interest of the old king. It wasn&#39;t that she hasn&#39;t considered why other hadn&#39;t answer but more like her own guesses were extremely far off, optimistic was the most tactful way to put and naive the worst. Still this could still be part of her plan of action. 

On the other side he had his master, hearing him talk about himself was quite informative in how he saw himself and before he finished talking Manco already knew where he was stirring this conversation. It was the smart thing to do, this place was nice it would be a shame to involve it in trouble. 

&quot;I can guarantee you young lady Mikail is definitely  not shy. But just as my friend suggested we are more than willing to help you find him. I&#39;m curious of how he will react to having such a lovely lady asking for him.&quot;

As the masked man disclosed more and more rumors surrounding the individual named Mikail Bernstein, one would be an idiot to not realize how much danger it posed to get themselves involved with him. All of these rumors served as that warning sign.

Suffice to say, she was quite taken aback and then very much impressed by Mikail&#39;s abrupt info dump. As grumpy as the man seemed at first, this was the most she&#39;d gotten out of anyone all day long. She clung to his words like the gospel, determined to memorize every nugget of information he was willing to impart. 

However, as Mikail droned on, Aida found herself increasingly distracted by his words. As much as they served as cautionary tales, she couldn&#39;t help but become intrigued by what the man was going to say next. Criminals? Homicides? The words that came out of Mikail&#39;s mouse was night and day compared to the life she had led. Alexandria was quite possibly one of the safest cities in the world. For someone in her position, it was a rare thing - a rare <em>treat</em> - to experience the life of those living in the city&#39;s shadows. 

It felt as if she had been treated to an all-you-can-eat menu of the dark and gritty tales of Alexandria&#39;s underbelly, and as Mikail&#39;s warnings came to a wrap...

&#39;...<em>wow.</em>&#39; Aida involuntarily clapped. Then she caught herself in her moment of unprofessionalism, and quickly passed it off as a cough. &#39;That...was very informative,&#39; she complimented Mikail. &#39;You are an amazing storyteller. Have you ever considered self-publishing-&#39; 

She caught herself again, this time shaking her head, as if wanting to be sure to clear her thoughts.

&#39;-what I mean is, thank you for telling me all this. You must know this man well. It&#39;s usually the ones who don&#39;t that fall victim to the rumormongering. I nearly did the same, because all I&#39;ve been getting were bits and pieces of the full picture.&#39;

I&#39;m not exactly looking to have tea with him. If you must know, my purpose is much more nefarious than that.&#39;

By the time he completed talking, the group was already relatively far away from the center of the bazaar, and now they could notice that the amount of people around them was slowly dwindling.

&quot;Self-publish- <em>wheeze</em>&quot; The normally calm Mikail almost laughed after hearing such words and then had to cough twice to stop himself from actually laughing. &quot;Sorry, sorry. I just did not expect for you to say that. And i&#39;m not actually a good storyteller, you were probably just excited hearing someone actually answer to your question.&quot;

Mikail nodded as Aida was thanking him for describing the full picture. Little did she know, he was also withholding a lot of information and telling many half-truths this entire time. He had a sly grin under his gas mask. While he does not like lies, he is not against using deception to gain advantage over an enemy. He technically didn&#39;t say a single lie this entire time, as Aida didn&#39;t directly ask if he himself was Mikail Bernstein.

&quot;Much more nefarious... Don&#39;t tell me, you want to fight him? We&#39;re not really friends with him, so we won&#39;t stop you from doing that, but are you sure? You don&#39;t look like someone who can fight. Just know, we won&#39;t help with that. Me and my friend will probably bail when you approach him.&quot;

Mikail did not stop even once while talking, practically forcing Aida to follow the pair. Whether she wanted it or not, she was already following them to the &#39;location of Mikail Bernstein&#39;. The trio was almost at the edge of the bazaar at this point, and by the bazaar&#39;s standards there was practically no one around them.

&quot;But that does not mean that we&#39;re not gonna help you at all.

&quot;Being a story teller does suit ya&quot; ye add as he followed him. The condor keeping an eye on his surroundings. While Mikail kept Aida distracted Manco was keeping an eye for her servant. But so far nothing. 

This make the old king had a bad feeling. No, it wasn&#39;t bad just weird as the situation was going way too smoothly. By taking the information at face value this girl had come trying to find one of the deadliest person in Alexandria without any information nor backup?? It was beyond being reckless almost to the point of madness. 

&quot;I am not exactly his friend. I think acquaintance would describe our relationship. I have some business with him but if you wanna fight him I have no real reason to stop you from it&quot; 

Unless this young girl was hiding something Manco could see Mikail being able to easily take care of her.

I know a good storyteller as soon as I hear them speak. I love stories!&#39; Aida exclaimed with a flourish of her arm, pulling a thread of ink out from the tip of her pen. The ink thread spun itself into a cartoonish doodle of a gunslinger in midair, hung for a moment, before splattering onto the ground.

&#39;But maybe you are right. Maybe I <em>am</em> excited. Oh, you aren&#39;t gonna believe how much trouble I had to go through to even arrive at this place...&#39; Aida shuddered as she recalled the multiple fiascos that had occurred since her summoning of Saber. It wasn&#39;t as if she had been given a choice. With the tourney lineup completely overhauled behind her back, she had to improvise. She had to take matters into her own hands!

Mikail&#39;s guess was spot on. It wasn&#39;t as if she had been hiding her intentions! Aida skidded to a halt in front of the pair, a bright smile on her face as though Mikail had just won her the lottery. She tapped herself on the chest, proudly, confidently. 

&#39;If you aren&#39;t friends with him, then that&#39;s all the reassurance I need. I&#39;m going to fight him!&#39; Despite the fact that they were in broad daylight. Despite the fact that there were still the occasional straggler passing by, Aida&#39;s voice chimed like a crystal bell, sharp, melodious, and brimming with confidence. It was the voice belonging to someone who had never known adversity, who had never experienced anything but good in her life. If she willed it, she believed she could do anything.

&#39;I can beat him in a duel, fair and square. He <em>was</em> supposed to be my opponent, but never mind that now.&#39; She glossed over the details. Maybe a few details too many, but that didn&#39;t matter! She shook her head after hearing Manco&#39;s doubts.

&#39;Receiving any form help defeats the spirit of dueling,&#39; she educated the King patiently, as if she was the pro. &#39;This is meant to be between the two of us. And our Servants, I suppose.&#39; She added, a bit less jubilantly than before.

He laugh loud and clear. The sudden fit of laughter almost make him drop all of the food samples until from the ground rock hands sprouted and kept the food from falling. The king was grabbing onto his sides as he was unable to keep his voice and laugh down. 

It was amusing, incredibly  amusing, the person in front of him was quite radiant and confident in herself Manco Capaq could only laugh at her words. 

&quot;Sorry... sorry. It was that I had been having the wrong idea about you since we started talking so now that I can have a more clear view about who you are and what you want I can&#39;t help but laugh at the situation.&quot;

The laughs stopped as he looked at the young lady. The whole situation was laughable if he were a more no nonsense servant he would had already try and kill her but he was more. A king needs to teach and guide even if the one being guided is the enemy. Besides his master was probably aiming to kill her but he rather obtain a bit more information first. 

&quot;You are correct that would akin to cheating in a duel.&quot; He composed himself &quot;But like you said this is a fight between both you two master and servants so...&quot;

As he spoke more hands sprung from the ground and aimed to wrap themselves  around the young lady. 

&quot;...if you challenge both at the same time without backup is not unfair if you the servant does the first move.&quot; He said with a more serious tone and expression as he reached for a piece of food to have a taste.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They were still not as far from the center of the bazaar than where he wanted to get to, but it was still enough for him to comfortably open fire without risking accidentally killing a civilian.

&quot;So you think that you can beat him in a duel, all alone and without a servant by your side? Not very smart of you. I hope you&#39;re completely sure of that, because you&#39;re too late to change your mind now.&quot;

After seeing Aida&#39;s trick with a thread of ink, Mikail easily understood that the woman could control ink and possibly use in some sort of offensive manner, so he decided to put some distance between them before the fight starts. He thought that Manco was smart enough to realize that too, so he did not warn him of that. 

Then two small bright red explosions appeared under his feet as he was sent flying several meters away in a tremendously fast, stylish backflip. Upon landing he turned at Aida, pulled out the Abaas pistol and aimed it at her center of mass. The three of them could see all of the few bystanders around them suddenly making a mad dash away from them in panic, screaming something about Mikail being there in an attempt to warn those who do not see this event happening.

 &quot;There he is. Mikail Bernstein. We found him.&quot; He said, as he pointed a finger at himself with his free hand.

That was quickly followed by two gunshots, briefly filling the area with light. It was deafening to Aida who has probably never even seen someone shooting a real gun, and it was likely the loudest sound she ever heard. But it was not the sound that Aida should care about, rather it was the pair of bullets headed in her direction. This was a terrible situation for her to be in. What would Aida do now?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="04-Oct-22 07:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026570698426175578 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026570698426175578><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Oct-22 05:05 AM">05:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even his laugh exuded a contagious, kingly aura that enticed people to join in and share the fun. Yet, few kings knew the meaning of moderation, and as the Inca&#39;s laughter continued, Aida&#39;s smile began to wane, as she struggled to figure out what was so funny. Moreover, his masked companion didn&#39;t seem to find the situation half as funny as he did, so Aida could only surmise that the king was laughing at some joke privy only to himself.

&#39;You are confusing me a little.&#39; She interrupted Manco. &#39;Do you mean to suggest that I cannot hold my own?&#39; She unconsciously stood a little straighter, as if measuring her own strength against her own words.

&#39;Don&#39;t you worry about my Servant now,&#39; she added, perhaps a bit more frustratingly than she&#39;d led on. &#39;I <em>am</em> aware that you can&#39;t participate in the tourney without having summoned one yourself-&#39;

The rock hands under Manco began to move. There were now more hands than food samplers to carry, and the extras closed in around her, a maneuver that was too abrupt to ignore.

&#39;-what is the meaning of this?&#39;

Aida asked out of curiosity, but there was a ripple of emotion in her face: surprise, followed by suspicion. Though magecraft had become commonplace, there was a limit to how bold people could get under broad daylight. 

As if to corroborate her suspicion further, the masked companion also decided to chime in, just as the first of the stone hands touched the fringe of her dress. Instinctively, she jumped back in an attempt to evade its grasp, but a lack of awareness made her forget that she had been surrounded on all sides. To Manco, it would seem as if Aida had willingly offered herself up, as she did a backwards hop and landed right into another one of those outstretched hands.

Not even Hansel and Gretel had chosen to enter the witch&#39;s house as fast as she had into those rock hands! And as more of Manco&#39;s constructs closed in on her, as the masked man pulled down his fa&#231;ade and reintroduced himself with the cold glint of iron, the dark barrel aimed towards her, as a hush settled over the bazaar accompanied by the occasional, high-pitched shrieks of a panic-stricken visitor, Aida&#39;s mind raced. 

It took but an instant for the synapses in her brain to finish talking to each other. Facts, observations, memories, everything she had gathered over her lengthy investigation was processed in the span of a second, then fed back to her in a rush of adrenaline that made the colors bleach from her face. She could hear nothing but the wild thumping of her own heart in her ears, even as Mikail leveled his pistol with her body, and her mind went haywire. 

<em>Run. Run run run run RUN!</em>

Instinctively, she knew that this was the moment she had been waiting for. She had imagined many scenarios under which her fated duel could unfold, she had dreamed about it, annoyed her auntie and anyone who would listen about it, and now, the moment she had so long looked for had arrived. 

But her body was frozen, as it failed to keep up with her brain. 

She watched as Mikail pulled the trigger, feeling pressure all around her as Manco&#39;s rock constructs wrapped her in a stony cocoon. It almost felt as if she were in a dream, the only thought clutching to her being that she had finally found her target. A neutral fact, without any emotions attached. Perhaps it would have been better if she could feel something, <em>anything</em> - the joy at finding her target, the anger at being tricked, the shock at being held at gunpoint, or regret at dying so young - but reality didn&#39;t give her the luxury to process any of these emotions.

When thrust into a life or death situation, she couldn&#39;t even bring herself up to cry or to scream, let alone having any time to reminisce, introspect, strategize, or simply cuss the enemies out for their foul play. There was no time for teary soliloquies, only an eerie tranquility that befell her as she felt the bullets make contact with her body-

In a stroke of luck, or simply the natural result of miscommunication, Mikail&#39;s bullets had lodged themselves squarely in the cocoon of rock constructs currently restricting the librarian. The shockwave from the bullets were all but captured by those hands, causing cracks to appear along the surface, until some explosive threshold had been reached and the stone detonated in a huge cloud of dust and debris. 

Aida felt as if she had been hammered by a battering ram, the force and what remained of her rocky entrapment sandwiching her and threatening to crush her bones. In fact, she <em>did</em> hear the telltale <em>cracks</em> of breaking bones - and so could Manco, as he was a merely few inches away from where the bullets had landed. 

<em>crack crack crack crack crack crack crack-</em>

It sounded as if the blast had utterly destroyed the librarian. Was she made of glass of something?

<em>crack crack crack splatter-</em>

&#39;That-was my favorite dress!&#39;

Aida coughed and gasped as she tumbled out of the wreckage. There was dust in her hair, her skin was bruised and scraped where it had been exposed, and there was a large tear in the frills of her dress. But more than tears, it was now marred with several large, dark stains of <em>ink</em>. Shards of glass fell from her dress as she picked herself back up, wobbly and staggering.

The librarian groaned when she saw the state her dress was in.

But just who would think it&#39;d be a good idea to bring a dress to a life threatening fight? She was probably the only specimen of the kind in Alexandria. 

But that didn&#39;t stop the librarian from pressing her charges. She seemed to be more lively now. The blast had shocked her out of her stupor, at the very least. But now it had sent her into a rage...

It was better than being stunned, at any rate!

Aida flexed her magic circuits, and the elements responded. 

It started with her dress. The ink stains began to bleach from the fabric, rolling off it as if it were made of tarp and collecting into a pool around her feet. A tiny, tiny tendril began to sprout from it like a delicate blade of grass, only to bulk up at a rate visible to the naked eyes.

In the span of a few breathes, it would have grown as tall as Manco&#39;s rock hands and as thick as a human leg. It looked rather soft and plump, and nowhere near as rigid or dangerous as either rock or gun. Just what was the librarian playing at, employing such a baffling tactic to face a seasoned fighter?

Only her Servant would realize, perhaps. Little did he know, that his days of gorging on a seemingly endless supply of mana would be coming to an end...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026935425098600591 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026935425098600591><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 05:14 AM">05:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

One of life and death, even. To make matters worse, she was outnumbered.

Until she caught a glimpse of red in her eye. A familiar shade, followed by an itchy feeling across her skin that reminded her of fur. It was hard to see in the dust caused by the broken rocks, but she could see the vague outline of a tiny figure.

Manco would be next to catch a glimpse, seeing something scurry around like a raccoon. It was far too quick, red spots appearing in the corner of his eyes, but disappearing before he could turn around and see who it was.

&quot;You know, I was wondering if you were something worth worrying about, but I guess I was wrong~!&quot; She exclaimed in a cheery grin. &quot;You&#39;re nothing but a pushover, I could beat you with one hand tied behind my back!&quot;

While her taunts were filled with glee, she made sure to back them up with facts, circling around Mikhail and pouncing at him from the side. It shocked him how impressive the maneuver was, since it was nothing compared to the sluggish and awkward dodge Aida had attempted earlier. If anything, it felt like she had turned into a different person!

The woman swiftly wrapped her arm around the mercenary&#39;s neck and slammed them on the ground, attempting to choke them into submission. This strength was also beyond what he had expected. Just what sort of opponent had he gotten himself into?!

...

Both Manco and Aida would be gawking in disbelief. After all, the <em>real</em> Aida was still standing far away from Mikhail, charging up something fierce. The same applied to Manco, who had his eyes focused on her. However, for some inexplicable reason, there was <em>another</em> Aida that was currently choking Mikhail out!

Though, there was one thing the librarian would notice: The other her had an oddly suspicious bushy tail emerging from their behind...

From anyone who knew their abilities they should be one of the best teams in this holy grail war, at least in theory. The issue is, while they had talk about one being the support while the other did the fighting they haven&#39;t really decide on how exactly to do that. Main issue was Manco Capac being the sort of man too used to just do whatever he wanted, it was no surprise really, as a king he had been more than used to that, he was the one taking the decisions and the rest obey his wife and other advise him but he always had the last word. 

That was why he hadn&#39;t wait for Mikail order and acted on his own which had now resulted in Aida surviving. The old king could only let out a sigh of disappointment at the current situation. He would need to talk with his master after this is done. 

&quot;Well that happened&quot;  he said not really worrying. The situation was not one to worry about, the young lady had been wounded and it was 2 vs 1 with a servant included. Their blunder had only only postponed the inevitable. But he was too naive, he of all people should know to never get too complacent as a situation can easily change in matter of second. The appearance of the second Aida changed the situation it was not only 2 vs 2 now but his master was not in deep trouble. The new enemy was fast, so fast his master wasnt able to react, was this the young lady servant?

The situation had began to turn into chaos but there was no time to doubt, the air began to heat up in both his hands, a golden glow covering them as he pointed them towards both&#39;s Aida&#39;s 

&quot;Inti&quot; he said as he unleash a fire ball towards both targets aiming to give his master a small deprive. But this also leave him open as all his focus were in this 2 enemies.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Under most circumstances that would have certainly been the case, but thanks to a certain coincidental meeting, it would appear that the fox had somehow gained a sort of underling that followed his trail after he had so rudely left her behind without so much as a proper word of goodbye.

<em>One step.</em>

Reynard had given himself quite the head-start however, so while he was grappling onto one of his Master’s assailants, Ā-Q&#236;ng had barely made it within eye-shot of the battlefield, darting across the roofs and cutting past the streets below her in a straight line without having to pay heed to the winding roads and alleys that would have otherwise only lead her astray, instead traveling as the crow flew and gradually closing the distance.

<em>Two steps.</em>

Yet she was not the only being currently calling the sky its home.
Sharing this space with her was a majestic condor of crimson plumage, hovering above where Ā-Q&#236;ng had last sensed her friend’s presence and observing the area, appearing to be on careful vigil to prevent any unwanted visitors from interrupting from whatever friendly gathering she was not invited to. Its nature as a familiar was apparent, the magical nature weaved into its physical form marking it as such, and thus Ā-Q&#236;ng’s next course of action was already decided.

<em>Three steps.</em>

Having progressively escalated her speed each time her feet made contact with the concrete rooftops, she was now a bullet shooting across the sky, nothing more and nothing less than a green blur akin to the violent howl of lashing wind. Yet still, she was not quite fast enough to reach the bird before it could notice her, and so she pushed herself just a little further.
On her last step before her final dash, she remained still for just a little longer than usual, the muscles in her legs straining from the exertion as her Qi flared up to wash over her limbs in preparation for what was to come.

Suddenly she vanished.

As if scratching up the film of the World as she moved, or even cutting out full sections entirely, Ā-Q&#236;ng’s leap was almost akin to teleportation as even the sound and wind accompanying her movements struggled to keep up with her, lagging behind for just a moment too long. Without a word she had appeared just above the condor, her fluttering coat and hair bleeding into its periphery but otherwise instinctually placing herself just above the crown of its head. Her right leg was raised perfectly straight above her head, her form faultless and her intent clear, as she made use of the sudden stop of her momentum to bring down the heel of her boot with the full weight of her downward plunge.

And fall she did, plummeting to the ground just in time to see two identical looking women being attacked by a Servant’s conjured balls of fire… though one of them was clearly in less trouble than the other. The trademark tail clued Ā-Q&#236;ng into their true identity however, meaning that the other must then be Reynard’s esteemed Master!

For now there were more pressing matters to attend to however, so her personal desires would have to wait.
As her legs braced for the impact of her landing, they were once more enveloped by her magical energy, but this time on a magnitude incomparable to when she previously facilitated her borderline inhuman dash, bound into a concrete shape by the proper invocation of her Secondary Noble Phantasm.

“Yu&#232; nǚ de Zh&#250;l&#237;n: Vengeful Assault of the Jade Serpent!”

An imagined flash rang out as her magical energy soared at the exact moment her feet impacted the ground, thus allowing it to flow free into the earth. And the earth drank deep, the entire area gradually being dyed in Ā-Q&#236;ng’s presence as she claimed the soil for her own, causing a deep low rumble that was immediately followed by the violent sprouting of bamboo at two separate locations. Rising up before the enemy’s fireballs, her bamboo shot up at odd angles, growing almost diagonally into each other and weaving a solid fence of criss-crossing stalks to serve as walls to intercept the attacks, before finally, a single lone pole bloomed just beside her own feet, long enough to serve as a pole-arm perfectly balanced for her build and height.

Did she not have a proper weapon to call her own?
Not to mention, and most importantly, was her atrocious appearance! Though she was stylishly dressed in a short coat, shorts, and thick-soled boots, the colors went everywhere from vomit green to glittering pinks, occasionally interrupted by vibrant yellows and random dark blues placed there for no reason in particular. It would not be an exaggeration to call her color palette the most disgusting rainbow in existence, but the girl herself seemed completely unbothered by her outrageous appearance as she simply raised herself to her full diminutive height to address the two men before her.

“For the two of you to be attacking women in broad-daylight… are the two of you bad people?”

Placing her right hand on the bamboo stalk proudly swaying next to her, her grip on it tightened as she glared at the would-be bullies in front of her, the seriousness of her tone losing all weight and meaning once realizing that she appeared to be no more than a small child trying to scold adult men many times her size and age.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

How did that girl get here that fast? Despite the chaos of the situation, he did not panic and quickly formulated a plan. Instead of turning around to see the suspiciously fast Aida, he immediately removed the regular magazine from his pistol, emptied the gun&#39;s chamber and switched it to a magazine of movement marker rounds, completing this action just in time before &#39;Aida&#39; pounced at him and slammed him into the ground and wrapped her arm around his neck. 

While at first it seemed to Reynard like Mikail couldn&#39;t resist at all, less than a second later his grapple became way less effective than initially. Mikail realized - this could not be a human enemy, the strength was too much. It now all made sense, this was actually a servant disguised as their master! Mikail&#39;s body started faintly glowing red - he cast potential energy reinforcement onto himself as he realized what this opponent truly was. Then he grabbed Reynard&#39;s arm with way more force than a human should be able to create. But instead of trying to break out of the chokehold, he tightly held onto the arm. What was the point of this?

And while his free hand still prevented the fox from moving an arm, he fired the pistol onto the ground, leaving a tiny glowing purple cube at the point of the bullet&#39;s impact. Then Mikail grabbed Reynard&#39;s arm with all his strength to prevent him from getting it out of the way and activated the marker, making him incredibly quickly move into the ground while causing his head and neck to violently collide with Reynard&#39;s arm with unnatural force and velocity. This was a big gamble - if the servant that Mikail was facing off had high endurance, this maneuver would just snap his neck even while he was under effect of reinforcement. But if this servant had low endurance, that would not only free him from the hold, but also severely damage or break the servant&#39;s arm. The mercenary thought that since servant appeared so stealthily and had capability to disguise as someone, it was probably a non combat focused servant with low endurance, so he decided to risk it.

After &#39;teleporting&#39; to the floor through Reynard&#39;s arm, Mikail&#39;s upper body was slammed into the ground due his free arm not being fast enough to react to &#39;teleportation&#39; and sending the force that was directed at holding the fox&#39;s arm downwards. This resulted in one of the lenses of his gas mask to break, leaving one of his eyes open for everyone to see. Then he swiftly stood up and delivered a jumping uppercut into the air, without even checking if Reynard was still above him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027190872384741466 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027190872384741466><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Oct-22 10:09 PM">22:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Naturally, he scoured the foreigner district first, planning to work his way outward to find Lancer. However, it seemed that fate would toss him a bone. A large commotion caught Alexander’s ear from the Culinary bazaar. The sound of explosions echoed through the streets, the monarch making his way towards the battle as quickly as possible. With his luck, Ā-Q&#236;ng was to blame. After all, she was a battle-hungry warrior who ached for fighting. Nearly every moment Alexander pondered his decision to leave her alone, it seemed like a worse mistake, a mistake that he would not make again.

Alexander would slow his footsteps as human figures came into sight. He gripped his shotgun in his left hand, preloaded with a Jasper and a Quartz. His feet stopped, keeping himself at a distance from the battle but still close enough to observe. His eyes scanned the area, counting four unidentified combatants and a… “Good god.” Alexander’s thought process was interrupted upon seeing his colorful servant. The clown-like getup had momentarily dissociated Alexander from any sense of urgency. He moved his hand to his beard hairs, pulling on them to snap back to the matter at hand. Pulling his head back to earth, Alexander would finish thinking the situation through. He had successfully located Ā-Q&#236;ng, but his worst fear had been realized. She currently stood between an unknown girl and two armed men, most likely a master and servant. There was also a bushy-tailed variant of the girl behind Ā-Q&#236;ng who was fighting one of the armed men. That did not answer the question of who Ā-Q&#236;ng was protecting, why she was there, and how she possibly joined a circus on the way.

Given the situation, Alexander only saw one sensible plan. He positioned himself behind a now abandoned food stall, his gun aiming in Ā-Q&#236;ng’s general direction. There were far too many unanswered questions to rush headfirst into battle.

He would wait for someone to make a move at Lancer; that would be his target. He didn&#39;t need to know who he was shooting or why; he just needed to keep Ā-Q&#236;ng safe. Running in might cause a distraction putting her at greater potential for harm. Resting his finger on his triggers, the ruler was confident this was the right move.

She flashed him a grin, looking both confident and deranged. The gas mask made it hard to see Mikhail&#39;s intent, but he made sure to make his feelings known as he grabbed Aida&#39;s arm and attempted to keep her pinned in place. His grip felt stronger, as if he had been holding back earlier.

Still nothing compared to them, of course.

&quot;What are you trying, buddy?&quot; Aida whispered in Mikhail&#39;s ear. &quot;Because whatever it is, it won&#39;t wor-&quot;

<em>BOOM!</em>

A deafening explosion shattered the ground around them, propelling them higher as Aida and Mikhail erupted for the sky. Smoke surrounded them, but once it dissolved, Mikhail would observe as his opponent kept smirking at them, their clothes slightly singed at most from the previous impact.

&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; She giggled, still holding Mikhail in her grasp. &quot;All you did was get us higher. But if you really insist on falling d-&quot;

<em>ZOOM!</em>

&quot;-own.&quot; Aida&#39;s eyes narrowed as she stared down below, noticing Mikhail plummeting. She also felt a stinging pain in her arm, noticing that a bruise had appeared on it from the sheer speed of Mikhail&#39;s special &#39;teleportation&#39; bullet. It would have been enough to cause serious damage to a magus, possibly fracturing or even severing their arm with enough force applied.

It was clear that this &#39;Aida&#39; was no ordinary magus. She had already sustained two attacks at point blank range that would have killed lesser magi. Not only that, but she was capable of keeping track of Mikhail&#39;s speed, her pupils following his path and almost feeling like they were tracking him in slow motion. That was beyond the capabilities of an average magus. It could only mean one thing...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027334982533906472 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027334982533906472><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Oct-22 07:42 AM">07:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Mikhail regained his bearings once he landed, albeit he wished he had done so graciously, instead of slamming his arm on the ground and cracking part of his mask. He retaliated by directing an uppercut towards the air, aiming to finish off his opponent if his previous trick hadn&#39;t worked.

He blinked as he saw that the skies above him were empty. Nothing but clear, overcast clouds and a blinding sun. He then felt something tug at his leg, clinging tightly to his ankle. He looked down and saw Aida&#39;s grinning visage, eyes wide with ill intent.

&quot;That&#39;s the second time you didn&#39;t let me finish.&quot; Aida said, her grip tightening as Mikhail felt himself being dragged down. The two were gradually falling, just milliseconds away from touching the ground. <strong>&quot;I guess it&#39;s only fair I do the same, then!&quot;</strong>

<em>SMASH!</em>

She slammed Mikhail down with unprecedented force, showing off more strength than he had expected. This wasn&#39;t something belonging to a pathetic Assassin or meek Caster. This was something far more raw and brutal, like a wild animal on a hunt. The mercenary had underestimated his prey, and was now deeply paying the price as he felt part of his bones crack as he hit the ground, face first. He was punted with so much force that he bounced off the floor, causing him to land face down with his back out. 

A lesser man would have been in critical condition now, but not Mikhail. His crest had endured long and hard battles. He was a representation of that, having survived far more brutal injuries than this. However, he hated to admit that he was in a vulnerable position. Dazed and injured, it would have taken barely a few seconds for the Servant to finish the job and eliminate him from the war entirely. Such a disappointing way to go.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027335055577718854 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027335055577718854><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Oct-22 07:42 AM">07:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Then he felt warmth, along with weight. Something had landed on top of him, furry and round. His eyes glanced at his side, before he noticed a shard of his gas mask visor on the floor. Its reflection clued him on what was happening on top of his body.

&#39;Aida&#39; had proceeded to sit on his back, using him as a human stool as she lazily sat cross-legged with her arms resting on her knees. She yawned, two foxy ears perking up above her head as he observed her surroundings with a coy smile. This turned into bewilderment and surprise once she realized that Ā-Q&#236;ng had showed up, coupled with her Noble Phantasm stopping two flames that had been fired off from the unnamed Servant nearby.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re here, Ā-Q&#236;ng?&quot; She asked, her palm now resting on her chin. &quot;You really shouldn&#39;t have. But I appreciate it nonetheless!&quot; She laughed, waving at her friend from afar. 

&quot;Yep! These two are very, <em>very</em> bad people.&quot; She tapped Mikhail&#39;s bum. &quot;I just arrived here, but they seemed to have ill intentions towards my-&quot;

She turned her head, staring back at Aida, who looked like she had seen better days. Her clothes were ruined, for god&#39;s sake!

&quot;Ah, if it isn&#39;t my wonderful Master, Aida~!❤️&quot; She exclaimed, clasping her hands together and rubbing them. &quot;Do you recognize me?&quot; Her ears perked up and wiggled to remind her.

&quot;It&#39;s me, <strong>Reynard!</strong> I&#39;m sorry to have left you alone, love. But I had important matters to attend to.&quot; It was almost sickening, to hear such honeyed words coming from someone who sounded identical to herself. Worst of all was knowing that she was dealing with Reynard, which meant that his honey was more akin to rat poison than anything else. What got him in such a good mood? Was he that happy to see her? Or was he simply keeping up appearances for someone?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027335128025927700 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027335128025927700><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Oct-22 07:43 AM">07:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;But what&#39;s good is that you&#39;re fine. That&#39;s what most important to me anyway!&quot; The fox hugged himself tightly while still in Aida&#39;s shape. &quot;I would be devastated if you were gone. Ahhh, a life without my Master... <em>sniff sniff</em>&quot; He wiped off &quot;&quot;&quot;tears&quot;&quot;&quot; from his eyes before leaning down backwards and letting his head almost reach Mikhail&#39;s.

&quot;Hey, <em>psst psst</em>, my Master is watching, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you could just let me show off a bit. Just keel over and pretend you&#39;re dead, okay? I&#39;ll let you go afterwards~&quot; He said with a smile, although these sort of comments most likely made Mikhail&#39;s blood boil more than anything. To be defeated was one thing, but ridiculed? Reynard was lucky that the mercenary was still exhausted from the previous exchange, but not for long. Just one more minute, and Mikhail would have fully recovered for another assault.

A minute which Reynard spent in unwise ways, raising himself up as he looked back to Ā-Q&#236;ng and struck up a conversation yet again. &quot;I took care of this one, Ā-Q&#236;ng. You have the honors of dealing with the other-&quot;

Just as he spoke, another person showed up. They didn&#39;t seem to be a Servant, despite their bushy beard and elegant attire. However, they carried a weapon and were intently aiming it at various people in the group, before settling down on monitoring Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s area of battle. Reynard was confused at first, before he put two and two together and realized why said person would not make a move yet.

&quot;Oho. Hello there, good sir!&quot; Reynard waved his arm, albeit still in Aida&#39;s form. &quot;Are you perhaps, Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s Master? Hmmm? Is my guess correct?&quot; He glanced back to Ā-Q&#236;ng, awaiting confirmation, before looking back to Aida and flashing a smile.

&quot;See? Nothing to worry about, dear Aida. You should be glad that I was nearby with my newfound friends. I guess you were truly lucky, to have summoned a Servant such as me...&quot; He gave her a distant wink and thumbs up, something that most likely annoyed her more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027335182765785239 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027335182765785239><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Oct-22 07:43 AM">07:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That is how he went in what his father and clan though was a suicide mission in order to find something better. But right now he wished he had been wrong, that the idea that such an easy to solve situation had turned into a bigger mess was something the old king could have never foreseen. 

As a kid presented in front of him calling him a bad person the Inca remained still as he try and focus on the situation, she had stopped his fireballs that wasn&#39;t something easy to do. A regular magus even with elemental water affinity would have a hard time would have a hard time stopping the flames of the sun. The being in front of him was a servant and before he could even made another though the warning came. The condor confirm his suspicious 2 servants  had been coming to them. It wasn&#39;t the familiar the situation had evolved way too fast for his warning to achieve anything either way. The Inca could only let out a sigh as he wonder what to do. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think I am a bad person. I am just defending myself.&quot; just as he finished saying that a loud crash could be heard as the situation had turned even worse. He saw how Mikail had been subdue for the moment as the other Aida claimed that she had him under control. All thing considered odd were against them, 2 servants against them and even if they discounted Aida the master of the little girl must still around waiting for its time to strike. 

But what to do? Should he leave Mikail behind and run? Should he try and rescue him and run away? It was strange before he could even consider his options his body and mouth were moving.

They joined the dark puddle growing under Aida feet, while a second, a third, and more rope-like tendrils sprouted all around her, braiding themselves together into thick, flexible whips.

All this while, Aida stood rooted to the spot, nursing her bruises and scrapes and concentrating on the circulation of her mana, which had begun to flush out of her in generous amounts in order to aid her newest creation. She responded to the fast-paced action of her adversaries with an almost inaction, seemingly frozen in time as the battle unfolded all around her, with blurry images of oddly-dressed individuals clashing in showers of sparks and flame. 

Aida was not a fighter. Her body had not been honed in combat skills, not was her mind trained to take tactical initiative. She was proficient in a myriad of small tasks, but her greatest assets, as cherished by her colleagues, were best displayed in a workshop and behind her desk. Though there were many parallels to be drawn between a battlefield and her workplace three hours before the deadline of a particularly difficult job, some skills simply weren&#39;t meant to be transferable. 

Not without a great amount of discipline and guidance, at least.

Unlike anything storybooks would describe in their illustrated pages and embellished prose, most people died suddenly and quickly, without any such thing as even displaying the tiniest amount of art and skill in comparison to sheer power and, usually, surprise. The moment Aida had decided to use her skillset for combat was the moment she had lost. To fight reality with magecraft birthed by imagination was akin to witnessing a certain beauty in suicide, and she must soon come to learn that fact, as she unwittingly embarked on the laborious task of inkweaving in full witness of her adversaries, without the slightest hint that she had prepared herself for any retaliation.

And yet, the retribution had not befallen her. Despite her idiotic decision of summoning a familiar without putting any distance between her and the enemy, standing perfectly still and posing as the perfect target, Mikail had not been able to unload any more bullets her way. Likewise, Manco had relented from trying to trap her in any more of his stone constructs as his attention, too, had been sapped by a sprout of verdant green that overtook the edge of the bazaar in the blink of an eye. 

Help rained from the sky just in the nick of time, as both her Servant and a surprise aide dressed in rainbow colors intercepted Mikail and Manco, bringing their advance on her to a standstill. Where did they come from? Had they been standing guard over the bazaar the entire time, or did they just make it here after receiving some sort of distress signal, or was it merely a coincidence? Not to mention that Mikail and Manco&#39;s joint attack on her had been halted by none other than a miscommunication between the Master and Servant, without any input of her own. Had she just been saved by nothing short of a miracle?

After all, she <em>had</em> meant to summon her familiar to give the M&amp;Ms a severe beating! And she <em>did</em> manage to carry out the summoning, did she not? <em>No one</em> had even managed to put another scratch on her!

&#39;Looks like it&#39;s my turn to go on the offensive!&#39; She was practically beaming with pride, as the shadowy tendrils shot up overhead, writhing and twisting themselves into an enormous black beast...

<em>squish</em>

...A jellyfish.

A soft and plump-looking hood, supported by a dozen or so tendrils, each of which looked as huggable as an oversized pool noodle. There was little doubt that this majestic creature would be her trump card. It even did a little bow upon its entrance with one of its fat tendrils, mimicking the motion of tipping one&#39;s hat as its creator gloated from the ground.

First, a finger pointed straight at the &#39;Aida&#39; across the street, who was striking a rather unseemly pose on top the masked man.

&#39;I am <em>more</em> than fine, <em>Reynard!</em>&#39; Aida was positively bristling as she accused the Aida imposter, who also happened to be her lupine Servant. She was so shocked and angry that she even forgot the #1 rule she had read in the many accounts of Grail Wars: that of protecting the identity of her own Servant. But could she be blamed? It wasn&#39;t as if she had been given any practice in the art of Master-ing in the past few weeks. It if weren&#39;t for all the cleanup duty she had to perform for Reynard&#39;s mishaps around the office, she&#39;d have almost forgotten she was saddled with a Servant in the first place!

Ooh, she would give the little fox a beating right now! As if mirroring her shorted fuse, the plump jellyfish raised two of its tendrils and mimicked the action of cracking knuckles - except there was nothing to crack within its noodly body-

<em><strong>SCREEEEEEECH!</strong></em>

The sound of water evaporating sizzled through the air, and the jellyfish pulled back its tentacles, both of which had been severed from where a flurry of golden feathers pierced their surface, each as sharp as a blade and burning with the intensity of a roaring flame. The severed chunks of inky tendrils fell to the ground along with a handful of bamboo stalks, raising a large cloud of dust and obstructing Aida&#39;s most direct path to her Servant.

Though yanking on Reynard&#39;s ears was no longer the first thing on her mind. Aida didn&#39;t have eyes growing on the back of her head, and she could not have guessed that the &#39;gibberish&#39; Manco had been speaking was meant to be a form of assault. Moreover, who could have anticipated that the others would have their own familiars biding for time in the dark (or in this case, the sky)?!

Certainly not her, and her equally gullible jellyfish! 

At once, the jellyfish resumed a protective stance, lowering its hood over its owner&#39;s head like a gigantic umbrella - or a frying pan, depending on how one chose to interpret the fact that it was soot black. It obscured Aida from view of the condor, forcing it guess her position under the dark mass at the very best...

&#39;...where did you come from?&#39;

It was a little girl, dressed from head to toe in a most...avant-garde outfit. It seemed as if she had knocked over an entire color palette and splattered it all over herself, with primaries, secondaries, and pastels colors all merging into one another. The design was too revolutionary to be from a chain store. It had to be a custom-made outfit!

That was how Aida tried to justify her imminent urge to eye-vomit. 

&#39;Where are your parents, little miss?&#39; She asked Ā-Q&#236;ng, who had been toying with a bamboo stick for the longest time. Were she a practiced martial artist, Aida would have realized the elegance with which the girl carried herself along with the bamboo, and ceased to usher her away. But, well...

&#39;You must get away from here! The bazaar is now a battlefield. It&#39;s not save for you to hang around.&#39; Look at her, warning the others when she had no idea of the dangers she had gotten herself in!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027583717293707337 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027583717293707337><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 12:10 AM">00:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever have you gotten yourself into n-&quot; He was interrupted as the librarian started ranting towards him, and for good reason too. Anyone would be furious at seeing their visage be used for wicked deeds!
 
&quot;Hmmmm?&quot; Reynard tilted his head, his lips remained in a curled smile as he enjoyed Aida&#39;s little outburst towards him. &quot;Whatever do you mean? This disguise was meant to protect you and confuse the enemy. I&#39;d say it did its job.&quot; He snickered.

&quot;Besides,&quot; He leaned forward, slightly spreading his legs in the librarian&#39;s body. <strong>&quot;maybe you should!</strong> It has been nothing but liberating to take up a new form and stretch it to its limits. Just relax a bit!&quot; He tapped Mikhail&#39;s helm lightly. &quot;See? He knows.&quot;

The more Reynard giggled at her and took her lightly, the more Aida&#39;s blood boiled. She channeled that fury into her next act, a pile of black substance drowning her surroundings until it eventually took shape...

...Into a giant jellyfish.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027628620971257957 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027628620971257957><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 03:09 AM">03:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Eh?&quot; Reynard stared at it, dumbfounded. He even adjusted his (fake) glasses to make sure he wasn&#39;t imagining it. The longer he stared, the more unsightly and ugly the familiar seemed: A black exterior that reminded him of gangrene, the dripping ink that seeped from its pores along with the squishy and slimy tentacles that practically screamed wet in the fox&#39;s eyes. The jellyfish even tried &#39;cracking&#39; its knuckles, only to fail and make an horrendous squeezing sound instead.

&quot;...If that&#39;s your idea of my replacement.&quot; Reynard gave Aida a disappointed glare. &quot;Then your sense of humor is better than I gave it credit for! What sort of disgusting beast have you brought out h-&quot;

His rant would be interrupted by Manco, who resumed attacking the two. He sent a condor to Aida, which caused the fox to worry, until he realized that he was being attacked as well. A watery projectile was aimed right at him, as if the Servant had no care for the Master lying nearby!

&quot;You sure your aim is fine?&quot; Reynard asked out loud, mocking that fact as he instinctively crawled on all fours with Aida&#39;s body, most likely sending her into even deeper pits of shame. Ah! They could see <em>everything!</em>

But that movement had a purpose. Reynard felt that too as the invasive thoughts from earlier flashed back into his mind. By instinct alone, he performed a cartwheel and dodged Manco&#39;s projectile with ease. Ā-Qing would have been proud!

&quot;Ha! You&#39;ll need to do better than that to-&quot;

<em>CRUSH!</em>

He had dodged the first attack, but neglected to even consider the second one, a rock crashing right on top of him. The bazaar was silent for once as the fox&#39;s incessant yapping had stopped. Dust and water littered the battleground as it became a bit hard to see what had happened to Reynard. The flames from earlier had caused the water to slightly evaporate, creating a light mist.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fox ears trembled on top of him as he shook his head and dusted himself off, pieces of rock falling from his fur.

&quot;Shame that you knocked me out of my disguise.&quot; Reynard complained, glancing at Aida in the meanwhile. &quot;Like wow, didn&#39;t you see what I was going for? No wonder you&#39;re losing when you&#39;re so dense.&quot; He stuck his tongue out at Manco, salty that the Caster had ruined his fun.

But Manco would be more preoccupied with other things: How did Reynard, who took a direct hit from his attack, only end up with some light bruises? It might have been just a rock, but it had been cast from his Magecraft nonetheless. Come to think of it, he had noticed that Mikhail&#39;s attacks hadn&#39;t had much effect either. Despite this Servant&#39;s disguise abilities, they weren&#39;t just some meek Assassin.

If Manco thought long and hard, he would realize that there was only one possibility left: <strong>He was dealing with a Knight Class Servant with Magic Resistance.</strong> The worst possible matchup for a Caster, especially when they had been caught with their pants down!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027628858909937724 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027628858909937724><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 03:10 AM">03:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Well, I offer you my apologies, <em>buddy.</em>&quot; Reynard said with a fake smile. &quot;But it seems your choice in prey was rather poor. That four-eyed dork is out of your reach, since I am unfortunately her Servant. Now, we can either do this the easy way,&quot;

<strong>&quot;or the hard way.&quot;</strong>

A golden pillar of light enveloped Reynard, his clothes growing bright as his tail&#39;s hairs rose up from the power he was emitting. It was bright enough to make Manco blink, and strong enough to make Aida feel a little woozy. That spoiled brat was sapping mana from her like a leech!

The light then subsided, revealing a gigantic crayon in Reynard&#39;s hands. The design was intricate and the tip was rumbling with latent energy, ready to burst out at any moment.

&quot;So, what will it be?&quot; Reynard pointed his crayon at him, looking like a knight in shining armor as he challenged Manco to a duel. This type of chivalry, combined with the shape of Reynard&#39;s odd weapon, made Manco realize the true nature of Reynard&#39;s Class: <strong>Saber.</strong>

This would be a tough battle, since Sabers were known to be one of the strongest classes around. The Magic Resistance would be an issue. The crayon was also surrounded by an ominous aura, most likely being the fox&#39;s Noble Phantasm. The only sign of relief was the fact that the Saber had challenged him in combat, meaning that his Master was-

<em>&quot;Let me pick for you then-&quot;</em> Reynard whispered in a hushed tone, turning around and showing Manco his tail as he sprinted towards Mikhail at full speed!

&quot;For me, <strong>it&#39;s the easy route! Always!!!&quot;</strong> He laughed, handling his crayon like a lance as he sped right after his target. He aimed to harm Manco&#39;s Master!

&quot;The brains are always better than the brawn, are they not? Then that&#39;s what I shall do!&quot; He laughed, gloating about his vileness as he aimed to get rid of the weak link in a Master-Servant team. Forget about chivalry, the fox gave Sabers a poor name!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027628972479090769 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027628972479090769><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 03:10 AM">03:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But luckily for Mikail, instead of Reynard using his strength for something dangerous like punching him in the face and fracturing his skull, the fox only slammed him into the ground by pulling his legs downwards. Mikail barely managed to cast some tiny, nearly unnoticeable explosions at the surface of his body right during impact, softening the blow. While there was still a lot of force applied to him because of hitting the ground, it was nowhere near as lethal as the concentrated power of a punch or a sharp point of a dagger. So in the end, this caused less harm to him than Reynard expected, as the combined power of his magic crest, explosions and reinforcement nullified all possible severe injuries. He still did get some bruises on his body and had a slight concussion, no bones were actually cracked and some pain was reduced due to some parts of the surface of his body having third degree burns and lacking nerves to feel anything.

Then as he laid on the ground in pain, the foul beast proceeded to sit on top of him and mock him, even suggesting something as outrageous as doing nothing and letting the fox show off! And even more annoyingly, the dubious little creature decided to chatter with everyone else on the battlefield as there was still chaos and danger going around! Anger boiled within him as the fox talked more and more, ridiculing everyone it could see. Mikail furiously got up and blew up in rage as the magic crest on his chest brightly glowed red, just after Reynard dodged from a water arrow into a falling rock. &quot;<strong>FUCK YOU AND YOUR STUPID DISGUISE, YOU BRAINDEAD ANIMAL! IT DIDN&#39;T EVEN WORK, I KNEW THAT YOU WERE A SERVANT THE MOMENT YOU APPEARED! YOU&#39;RE DEAD NOW, YOU KNOW THAT? AND WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, A CRAYON? IS THIS A JOKE?

Always!&#39; and seemingly calmed down. &quot;You have a point... <strong>BUT SOMEONE ELSE DOESN&#39;T!</strong>&quot; He did not calm down, instead he pointed his cursed rage at a different target - Aida. And the small moment of calm was enough for him to make a small plan, and it was possibly the craziest plan he had in a very long time. The mercenary switched the Abaas pistol to automatic firing mode and pointed it into the air at an angle. Then in a second he was gone. As each bullet was fired out of the pistol, Mikail &#39;teleported&#39; to the markers while they were still in the air and within a five meter radius from him, resulting in a strange-looking awkward form of flight. Whole sixteen bullets were fired during the second because of the pistol&#39;s incredibly high rate of fire, but he managed to activate only eight of them and some of them were activated too early, resulting in only thirty meters travelled instead of the possible eighty. But it was still incredibly fast, as while Reynard could react to and see what was happening, it was too fast for him to actually do something about it.

And now Mikail was above Aida, falling down at her. But instead of waiting for gravity to do all the work, he casted an explosion above himself, quickly sending him downwards, as he quickly pulled out the Uluu Toion pistol. Then he cast another explosion under him to slow down in the last moment, preventing fall damage. He did not land directly on top of Aida&#39;s jellyfish umbrella. Aida could see the big mercenary suddenly laying on the ground near her with two pistols in his hands pointing up at her less than five seconds after she saw Reynard charging at him. In the next moment, a poorly aimed cloud of shotgun pellets was flying at her from below. Then a big fiery explosion appeared, evaporating some parts of the jellyfish, sending a bunch of shrapnel at Aida&#39;s feet and throwing Mikail onto a nearby rooftop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027670903816990800 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027670903816990800><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 05:57 AM">05:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He landed violently and with a lot of force onto the rooftop, with his entire body rolling and bouncing on the rooftop twice. This practically made him experience the same thing that Reynard did to him about a minute ago, except this time it was self-induced. And unlike that time, Mikail couldn&#39;t soften his blow with tiny explosions, and that resulted in him breaking two ribs. &quot;<strong>FUCK! EVERYTHING HURTS! WHO THE HELL MADE SUCH A DURABLE ROOF!? IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS PAINFUL IF I JUST FELL THROUGH! AAAARGH!!!</strong>&quot; Then Mikail dropped both pistols and looked at his hands. Everything was blurry and shaky to him, as moving at such speed, using so much mana, breaking two ribs, receiving two concussions in a row and casting a strong explosion right in front of yourself can take a huge toll on a human. Then he barely picked both pistols back up and simply laid on the rooftop while writhing in pain, being too tired to do anything.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 06:03 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027671786327912548 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027671786327912548><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 06:00 AM">06:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Although, ah-... it is good to meet you, Master of the Fox King, I have heard so many stories about you. Hopefully you haven’t worried too much not being able to be by his side-”

Her humble introduction was quickly interrupted by the Master’s less-than-happy reaction to her Servant’s return, causing Ā-Q&#236;ng to swallow the rest of her words mid-sentence.

<em>“Perhaps she is just shy…?”</em> she thus reasoned, <em>“Or stressed from battle?”</em>

Naturally she had no reason to doubt the esteemed King of all Foxes who had traveled the world far and wide, made war and made peace with the vaunted Isle of Racoons, and even rescued the famed Alexandre Dumas from prison, while also beating Napoleon in an arm-wrestling contest in his spare time… not that Ā-Q&#236;ng had any idea who the last two were supposed to be, but their names were hard to pronounce, so they must have been some famous warlords oversees.

Regardless. She had bigger things to worry about. That being Reynard’s mention of her Master.

Quickly scanning the area and following her friend’s line of sight, sure enough, there she spied the unmistakable form of the man who had called her into this world, tactically hiding behind a now abandoned food stall and aiming his odd firing device at her general direction.

“...”

Cold sweat began to form on her back as the events of her rather adventurous outing flashed before her eyes, but like any child who had been caught in the act and knew that they were in deep trouble with no way to worm their way out of it… she tried to worm her way out of it.

“M-master!” Her voice cracked as she stumbled her way into an explanation that was not technically a lie, her eyes darting all over the place to look for an excuse not to look at him directly, “I just came here to help my friend’s Master from these bullies, so I cannot talk right now. Sorry. Later! I can explain! But not now. I can handle the Servant. These two are mean. Thank you!”

As the fiery condor descended on the battlefield, Ā-Q&#236;ng thanked whatever gods remained in this world for their divine intervention and left her Master with nothing other than her quick barrage of words as she headed straight for it, but most importantly, away from Alexander.

Reynard’s Master appeared to be fully capable of protecting herself, freeing her from her only burden and allowing her to act unbound and untethered, and thus she decided to soar.
The condor had evaded her earlier axe-kick with unexpected swiftness, for which she could not help but hold a petty grudge, and so she decided to settle her personal score first before joining the battle in full. Her favorite bamboo stick in hand, she did not move far before securing enough run-up for a sufficient leap long enough to bridge the distance between them, but having learned from its previous evasive maneuver she decided to make doubly sure.

Her foot stepped hard on the ground, the soles of her boots digging harshly into it.
The soil was still soaked in her magical energy from the earlier invocation of her Secondary Noble Phantasm, but still she poured more of it into the concrete, pumping it not only into the earth around her, but spreading it even to the nearby buildings. One in particular, whose ledge was located closest to the hovering condor, from which a hefty stalk of bamboo erupted explosively and without warning, aimed straight at the avian sentry.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027681278948020314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027681278948020314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Oct-22 06:38 AM">06:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But that was not all.
While Reynard’s Master had dealt with the blazing feathers aimed at her, Ā-Q&#236;ng had yet to intercept her own share. With such obstacles barring the straightest path from her to her target, her favorite trick to instantly Reduce the Earth between them would only bring more harm to herself, so she settled with doing it the traditional way. Having already secured a run-up and found solid footing, Ā-Q&#236;ng gathered the strength of her coild legs for but a moment before shooting into the sky as if fired from a bow. Though not quite as abrupt as before, her regular speed was still unmatched by none other but the most agile of Servants, turning the outline of her body’s ascent into nothing more than a green blur chasing after the shadow of her form, a bleary smudge left in the space she used to occupy just moments before.

Naturally this would mean she would head straight into the condor’s hail of feathers, and she did, yet she also carried her favorite bamboo stick with her this time. And in her hands, it danced with unadulterated glee.
Almost like a jade serpent coiling around her body, the bamboo was bent to its utmost limits as it flowed from palm to limb, circling around her hip to gather momentum, only for it to be nudged back into place and guided back into her flexible grip by her lifting knee. Each and every swing held purpose and meaning, as was evident when Ā-Q&#236;ng emerged from behind the scorching shower with nary a scratch on her, a frightening number of smoldering feathers deeply lodged into her pole to coincidentally make it resemble a Macuahuitl of Aztec origin, granting it a temporary fiery edge, with which she once again struck at the condor in conjunction with her preemptive surprise attack to pincer the bird once and for all.

Thus it was her job to keep Bully #2 occupied. He had just fired an unsuccessful attack at the fox, and she would not allow him to fire a second.

Landing on the long bamboo horizontally sticking out of the nearby roof, Ā-Q&#236;ng used a combination of her own inertia and the skillful shifting of her own weight to transform this simple foothold into a functional, yet clearly improvised sling, putting its inherent flexible nature to its ultimate test as it painfully groaned from the extreme duress she subjected it too, before all at once, it violently flicked her straight at the ground in a maneuver so absurd that one would not be wrong to call it comically overkill.

Though Manco would be the ultimate judge of its effectiveness.

Like a streak of lightning she descended on him from the heavens above, her smoldering bamboo in her hands now crowned with the corpse of his familiar, causing her to leave behind a charcoal trail. The impact of her attack rang out loud and clear, her aim to have him eat the full brunt of it, causing a small cloud of fire and dust to explode from where her weapon struck.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just moments after arriving, he had been spotted by bushy-tailed Aida. The casual wave and prodding of his identity hit the monarch in a sour spot. Had this war been full of amateurish children on purpose? Every time Alexander met someone, it felt like they were even more childish than the last. Even worse, two of the children he had to work with and the third… well, he wasn&#39;t sure if the fox-tailed Aida was on his side. However, he did know that Ā-Q&#236;ng wanted to protect them. For all intents and purposes, that meant he was on their side, at least until he found out more about the four strangers.

As Ā-Q&#236;ng apologized to Alexander, she received what felt like a lethal stare. He was clearly very unhappy that Lancer forced them into this situation. Not only were they fighting outside of a sanctioned battle, but he had no idea if Ā-Q&#236;ng had actually befriended an enemy or not. Would she have checked what side they were on before engaging in combat? There were far too many things to consider while the fight moved on. At this rate, Alexander might be better off shooting first and asking questions later. This would have been much easier if Reynard didn&#39;t blow his cover, or so he thought. As Ā-Q&#236;ng scampered off to engage in the mess of flaming birds and jellyfish, Alexander would stay incognito. In the heat of battle, Reynard’s wave hadn&#39;t drawn any sort of attention.

Still maintaining his stealthy position, Alexander watched the fight play out. His eyes glimmered with a bit of reinstated hope as he watched Lancer defend against the flaming attack. Alexander had only seen a few select portions of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s abilities. In their sparring match, Ā-Q&#236;ng had to hold back so she didn&#39;t hurt Alexander; here, however, Ā-Q&#236;ng didn&#39;t have to ration her strength; watching her go up against another servant was fascinating. 

While Alexander did want to see Ā-Q&#236;ng fight more, he couldn&#39;t just sit back and do nothing.

There was one thing that happened to catch Alexander’s eye. Mikail had taken a particularly hard-looking tumble across the rooftops of the bizarre. This was most likely the master of Ā-Q&#236;nq and Aida’s opponent. Taking a shot at them would be the most effective move. 

Alexander’s weapon would point at the lip of the rooftop where Mikail was catching his breath. Pressing down on the gun&#39;s rightmost trigger, a loud bang would ring out from Alexander&#39;s direction. Amidst all of the smoke and steam, a red Jasper would fly into the lip of the roof where Mikail resided. The gem would crack, causing a blaze of flames to cover the rooftop, the fire quickly climbing in towards Mikail.

Let alone that the situation had changed into such a disadvantageous where he was probably fighting against 2 servants at the same time. Let alone that one was  cowardly enough to try and only target his master cause it was easy, honestly Manco were he not the recipient of this tactic would praise the fox boy for doing the smart thing. But that wasn&#39;t the worst of the situation. 

A Saber? While part of him wonder how far below had knighthood fell after his death seeing such a disgrace of a knight was not that much of a suprise. It was men like those who eventually conquered the empire he created, pillage it and done all sort of unspeakable acts except possibly burn the whole thing to the ground. But stop of reminiscence about the past, as annoying and foolish the brat looked he was the worst possible match of Manco Capac in his Caster form. Were he had been summoned into an Archer or maybe even a Lancer he could possibly fight him head on but in his current state he was having a hard time thinking a way to stop it from attacking him master. 

&quot;You little brat....&quot; Luckily his master took care of that problem on his own, Manco had no idea how he had done it but Mikail was out of danger or at least he though so. He had so many other things to worry about it right now.  Still the situation wasn&#39;t as bad, as long as the other servant wasn&#39;t also of the knight classes he should be able to somewhat manage. It was then that he heard his condor let out a sing of pain, warning him of the imminent danger that came out of it before Manco itself felt his familiar getting destroyed. 

He turned around and saw how Ā-Q&#236;nq  had easily killed his familiar and was now coming at him at the the speed of a bullet. He erected a wall of rock thinking that should be enough to stop her. Boy he was so wrong he didn&#39;t even had the time to realize it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pain coursed through his body, his vision was hazy and even breathing felt like something he was okay with not doing for a while. He cough as he let out groans of pain as he tried to recover. His idea run through his head at an amazing speed as he tried to piece what had happened. But the pain kept throwing his off. That was a blessing in desguise as were not for the pain he would have realized it wasn&#39;t just one knight class he was fighting but two. 

Ā-Q&#236;nq , physical power was to high to be just a rider or an assassin and a caster itself knew she wasn&#39;t like him unless there was a weird Caster servant able to use its own fist to fight instead of magic but those were questions he would ponder once he wasn&#39;t coughing blood on the ground. 

Manco&#39;s crown fell and the sound it made when it hit the ground was enough to numb the pain for a second, seeing his bloody reflect in it was enough to make him grit his teeth as he forced himself to stand. To be reduced to such state was quite fitting yet infuriating at the same time. He pulled from his waist a golden rod and let if fell into the ground. 

&quot;Listen to me brats...&quot; he said as the ground around to him began to glow. The rod softly dig itself into the ground and a powerful surge of magical energy could be felt all over the area.  &quot;... I am done playing nice!!&quot;

The magical energy would coat Manco Capac and for a second the image of his bloody self would dissapear, for a second Ā-Q&#236;nq  and anyone who would see him would see a man clad into a gold suit with golden feathers around him.  The rod was something he had made himself but at the same time it was special it was something that couldn&#39;t be separated from his very own legend.

This was something he had been gifted. Something humans had rarely had received,  gods were petty they were not that much different from humans when it came to personality they just wielded more power. But some, some really believed in humans and wanted to protect their existence. The old gods of the Inca empire were like this, they watched Manco reached for something better, they saw his struggles and how much he sacrificed and more than just amusement they wished to give him a reward. 

The reward was their blessing,  right now the old monarch was not really fighting alone, both Ā-Q&#236;nq  and Reynard could feel the sudden change. But there was a catch, Manco could only draw more power while he was in that golden circle no bigger than 10 meters. That circle was his territory, his workshop the place where only him as the Inca was allowed. 

&quot;Hear me out you brats!! You managed to get me out of this circle you win.&quot; As much as a bluff as it sounded Manco was telling nothing but the truth, he still had one more ace under his sleeve but he didn&#39;t wanted to reveal it so early.

&quot; Inti!!!&quot; he yelled as golden flames came out of his hand another golden fireball went towards Ā-Q&#236;nq , the flames looked different the burn brighter and more violently melting everything on their path as it attempted to scorch Ā-Q&#236;nq.

&quot;Pacha Mama!! Suffer the wrath of the four Suyos you annoying brat!!&quot; many rock tentacle sprout the ground all aiming to catch Reynard, the fox would realize that the speed of the attacks had increased, and that even when initially dodged the tentacles would still pursue not giving up.

But if she had been too preoccupied to miss out on Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s entrance, the little girl made sure that her exit performance would leave a deep impression on the librarian. In a flurry of green she shot into the sky, propelled by nothing but sheer strength and speed as she intercepted the golden familiar with a gleeful cry. Where Aida had had no choice but to go on the defensive, the little girl toyed with the condor, reducing it to a pulp with a few well-aimed prods of its bamboo sticks. 

That, coupled with the words she had left behind, with &#39;Master&#39; punctuating every few sentences that she would utter, it didn&#39;t take long for Aida to realize that she had been talking to a <em>Servant</em>. One that seemed to have come to her aid, no less. 

But how could it have happened? Had Ā-Q&#236;ng and her Master been on the prowl just like Aida, with their investigation converging onto a single location by chance? Or had they acquainted themselves with Reynard, which only spawned more questions as Aida felt the urge to face palm after hearing the title &#39;the Fox King&#39;. 

<em>&#39;What sort of chicanery have you gotten yourself into now, little fox?&#39;</em> Even in the heat of the battle, her mind was elsewhere. Reynard himself certainly didn&#39;t tilt the situation in his favor either, as he continued his stunts under his Master&#39;s disguise. His intention of singling out the weak link in the enemy&#39;s defense - the Master - and taking them out first completely flew over Aida&#39;s head. The way she saw it, Reynard was clearly testing her limits, his antics only emboldened by the fact that he was currently well out of her arm&#39;s reach!

Two weeks&#39; worth of pent up anger boiled just beneath the surface, the aches and pain all over her body only served to exacerbate her frustration towards her own Servant. But little did she know that her wish would be granted soon, just not in the manner that she had imagined.

Instead of going after Reynard, the enemy would bring Reynard back to her.

Or, more accurately, they would <em>force</em> the fox to come chasing after them, leaving him no say in the matter. Mikail disappeared amid a hail of bullets, his body blinking in and out of existence as it matched the bullets currently zipping through the air. For a brief moment, his speed even outmatched that of the Servants; magecraft and inertia propelled him across the battlefield in a lopsided arc, and within seconds he was facing up at Aida from the ground, his gun poised and ready to reap the rewards of his haphazard maneuver. 

Aida was completely caught off-guard. While she had been perfectly protected from the condor under the cover of her jellyfish, it also made her completely oblivious to the other threats raining from above. Not that she would have anticipated anything even close to a Master teleporting themselves at breakneck speeds and in complete disregard of their own safety in order to get the drop on her! 

In that regard, Mikail&#39;s actions perfectly reflected the rumors he had repeated of himself. He was truly monstrous, if not in his sheer strength compared to Servants, then most certainly in his mindset. He was willing to stop at nothing to kill his targets...even if it meant ruining his own body.

Aida could do nothing but blink as even more gunshots rang out, mere feet away from where she currently stood. Her vision went dark for a second, then pain exploded from her ankles all the way up her legs, followed by the wet, slick, and squishy feeling of being wrapped up in a soaked sponge.

It wasn&#39;t just some low level familiar created to carry out simple commands issued by its owner. The creature seemed to possess a sentience of its own, perceiving the stimulants around itself and reacting to them of its own accord. What Aida had fallen short of perceiving, the jellyfish made up for it with its own intelligence, as two of its remaining tentacles surged forth in response to the bullets fired by Ullu Toion and attempted to soak all of them up with its body. 

But it&#39;s body was too plump, and its movements too slow. Blades of shrapnel managed to pierce Aida&#39;s legs, lodging themselves deep within the flesh. Pain beyond description quickly coursed through her legs, making it feel as if they were made of fire, and her marrows filled with boiling lead. 

<em>It hurts. It hurts it hurts it hurts!</em>

Aida let out a howl of pain, the sound of which only deafened by the spongy appendages wrapped securely around her, supporting the entirety of her weight. The pain was a far worse experience than she could have imagined. None of the books she had read would have prepared her for the reality of it, and reality made her suffer. Forget fighting. Forget subduing the enemy. The only thing she was capable of thinking at the moment was how much everything hurts and how much she wanted it to stop!

But her familiar had other ideas.

The jellyfish split a free tendril from its body, raised it in the air in a manner that was reminiscent of how when Aida was ready to grab Reynard by the scruff his neck and give him a stern talking to.

But he did not waste time for nothing, and while he was pretty tired and hurt, he pushed through the pain and switched the magazine of the Uluu Toion to freeze storm ammunition, planning to use them to slow down Reynard or Ā-Q&#236;ng to help Manco with the fight. But then a fiery crystal shattered at the edge of the rooftop, setting it ablaze, with fire climbing towards him. There was another opponent sending suppressive fire onto the rooftop.

Mikail immediately shot at the fire-engulfed part of the roof with Uluu Toion. A lot of white, freezing fire fought the scorching flame, putting most of it out and greatly slowing it down. &quot;<strong>WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? STOP HIDING, COWARD!</strong>&quot;. Mikail quickly got up and started scoping out the nearby area, trying to find the unknown opponent. He quickly understood that there was only one direction where that new enemy could possibly be and looked away from the main battle involving three kids and a dumb bookworm.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027998275137187941 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027998275137187941><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 03:38 AM">03:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Mikail saw smoke coming off from someone&#39;s gun in the distance, and proceeded to start running across the rooftops while casting small explosions under his feet, completely forgetting the pain, as he experienced way more painful things in his life that just breaking two ribs. While it seemed incredibly slow to Alexander after seeing Ā-Q&#236;ng, it was still way faster that a human should be able to run and the mercenary was approaching rapidly. Mikail shot in the general direction of Alexander with his shotgun-pistol, hiding the mercenary behind a cloud of white fire and sending a stream of icy glowing metal shards everywhere, each of which created brittle frozen shrapnel on impact and made the ground into a dangerous place, practically forcing Alexander to go into cover. 

Then Mikail disappeared out of sight, running on the parts of roofs that were the furthest away from Alexander, making it impossible for him to shoot the mercenary without moving away from the food stall and going out of cover. Eventually the mercenary reached the leader of Macedon, standing on top of the abandoned foodstall that Alexander was hiding behind with both of his pistols holstered. &quot;<strong>FOUND YOU!</strong>&quot;. In a split second Mikail was right in front of the man, achieving this by propelling himself with a yet another explosion to close the distance, hoping to abuse his superior physical strength and defeat Alexander in melee combat. Then he threw a punch directly at Alexander&#39;s face with all his strength while attempting to go past the length of the double barrel shotgun to avoid getting blasted.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1027998411074584626 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1027998411074584626><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 03:38 AM">03:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, her only measure for another Servant’s capabilities so far were those of Reynard’s, one whose physical parameters were nearly identical to her own, ensuring that their exchange was left at a more or less equal level. The same could not be said of her current opponent, one whose strength and speed she vastly outmatched despite his larger size and musculature, causing Ā-Q&#236;ng brow to furl in puzzlement as she believed herself to have somehow overestimated his abilities. He was a bully of course, so there was no need to hold back, yet he was also a Servant. To deprive herself of the rare chance of fighting one would be greatly upsetting, and so she flippantly shook the tension from her limbs after discarding her bamboo stick that had splintered upon impact, re-adjusting her style to one better suited for a lesser opponent and deciding to fight him unarmed.

It was the rationale of a child wanting to relish their limited playtime to its fullest before being made to return back home, not the tactical ruminations of a seasoned fighter, and it was this mindset that would cost her dearly.

Her foe activated some manner of ability and repeated his earlier attack, that of a blazing fireball, though this one seemed more potent than the projectile she had intercepted previously. Ordinarily she would have followed her instincts and simply dodged aside, but her Master’s disapproving glare had not gone unnoticed, the memory of it carved bitterly into her heart, and thus she endeavored to make it up to him.

The fireball currently aimed at her was more destructive than its previous incarnation, so surely it would cause a lot of damage if left to its own devices. Surely Papa White would thus be happy if she intercepted it like before, protecting the buildings around them. And then all his anger would be forgotten!

A complacent grin on her lips, Ā-Q&#236;ng crouched low and slammed her right palm into the cement, calling to the earth once more. And it answered. An intricate criss-crossing of stalks erupted before her, forming a similar wall as before to shield her from the attack, though she made no attempt to leave its shadow to ensure that she would be in full view of her Master should he take a look at how his Servant was doing, no doubt being awed by her performance and forgiving her for all her misdeeds on the spot. Yes yes, everything went exactly as planned…

“Eh-?”

…until it didn’t.

She had expected her wall to suffer a little bit of course, but she could not have predicted for it to be utterly obliterated without offering any resistance whatsoever.

It was too late for her to react, especially when her mind had been elsewhere entirely.

The ball-shaped inferno punctured the bamboo in front of her and smashed into her without resistance. Though Ā-Q&#236;ng had desperately leapt to her left side purely on reflex, she was not fast enough, and the center of the fireball impacted right into her shoulder without issue. Her clothes were no more than additional kindling, feeding the flame as it gnawed its way into her flesh, before detonating against her naked skin in a brutal explosion.

It was an attack of the highest magnitude, and though Ā-Q&#236;ng’s Magic Resistance would have ordinarily dispersed with most of its effects and left her relatively unharmed, that was only the case when protected by a conscious surge of her own Qi, one which she currently did not have the luxury to employ, thus crippling her Magic Resistance to below-than-average efficiency.

The extent of her injuries were difficult to make out beneath the thick fumes, though a clearer look would expose the fact that the entire right half of her torso was marred with singed tissue, starting from her shoulder where the damage was at its most severe, and reaching all the way down to her lower hip. Only her shoulder and chest had been blackened completely however, the periphery of her burns escaping the worst of it, yet still no doubt causing her tremendous pain.

If only she had the ability to vocalize it.

In the short time it took for her to fall to the ground and crawl away from the splintered wreckage of her own bamboo, she had only succeeded in weeping her own throat dry, leaving her only with the freedom to retch as her body tried to expel the toxic vapors from her lungs with small success.

Though she found no joy in the lesson as she continued to crawl aimlessly in the dirt, her mind unable to realize where to; she simply wished for the pain to stop.

The world had become blurry, distorted by her ceaseless tears.

Plus, the fact that Mikhail was a Master made his job a lot easier, since there was barely any chance of a magus being able to pierce his high Magic Resistance. 

&quot;Woah, you kiss your mother with that mouth?&quot; He teased the man in the gas mask, finding their colorful insults rather amusing. Perhaps he should have taken Mikhail more seriously, since Reynard&#39;s idle pace was enough for the mercenary to catch him off guard with a rather odd maneuver. By firing several bullets in mid air, the ones that seemed to warp him past short distances, he was able to mimic the act of &#39;flying&#39; as they soared past Reynard and kept reaching for further heights.

&quot;Wait, hey! Get back here, you flying chicken!&quot; The fox shouted back, before overhearing Mikhail&#39;s intent. He noticed that the mercenary had begun flying towards Aida, which caused the Saber&#39;s eyes to narrow: If his Master kicked the bucket, then he would be toast too!

&quot;Ohhh, don&#39;t you even <em>dare</em> try that.&quot; Reynard snarled, crouching down as he was determined to pounce at Mikhail and stop him at once. Before he could, however, Manco had made his move, summoning more rock tendrils from the ground that had the dexterity of tentacles. The fox hopped, only to be grabbed by his ankle and pushed downward, his chin hitting the ground and being dragged across like a rag. Various other tendrils sprouted, slamming him repeatedly as more bruises and slashes appeared on his skin.

<em><strong>BANG BANG BANG!</strong></em>

He heard some loud noises, but was unsure on where they came from, since he was preoccupied with the tendrils.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028106752081789018 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028106752081789018><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:49 AM">10:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...GET-&quot; Reynard grabbed his crayon, stabbing the tentacle holding him as the yellow tip completely pierced through the rocky exterior, causing it to crumble into pebbles. &quot;OUT-&quot; He proceeded swing his crayon sideways, doing a wide slashing motion that chopped two other tendrils in half. Unbeknownst to him, a third one had sprouted right behind him, aiming to stab him from the back.

<strong>&quot;OF MY WAY!&quot;</strong> He shouted, doing yet another cartwheel as his mind imitated Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s movements, dodging the spear with grace and bisecting it with a single crayon slice. But Manco&#39;s tendrils were like a hydra: Cut one head and more would emerge. More tendrils showed themselves, much to the fox&#39;s frustration, until-

<em>&quot;Huh?&quot;</em> A chill ran down Reynard&#39;s spine as a familiar sensation ran across his mind. It reminded him of his first encounter with Aida, with the woman grabbing him like a child from the bookcase he had gotten stuck in. This time, however, the arm grabbing him was a lot wetter, not to mention squishy and black. It wrapped itself around his neck and dragged him away, safe from the clutches of Manco&#39;s tentacles. Not that the fox was happy about it, of course.

&quot;Hey, let go! I had him!&quot; Reynard shouted, being restrained by the jellyfish as he was forcibly dragged back to the familiar&#39;s location. Somehow, it felt tougher to free himself from Aida&#39;s familiar than Manco&#39;s tentacles. He wondered why, before realizing that there was a portion of Aida&#39;s essence in all of her summons, meaning that the rule of the wolf still applied to them, albeit to a reduced level. He could free himself if he truly tried, but that would expend precious mana.

Speaking of, he felt a lot more sluggish now, as if mana was gradually leaking from his body. He immediately suspected Aida, since she had wastefully used up his precious resources in order to summon this fat and ugly creature.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028106807157207161 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028106807157207161><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:49 AM">10:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Get off!&quot; Reynard shouted as he finally shoved the jellyfish aside once the creature had brought him back to Aida. Despite its docile nature, the sea familiar kept staring at him with contempt, judging him from a distance. He paid it no mind, thinking that it had simply inherited its owner&#39;s ugly soul. He instead turned to the latter, watching Aida sitting nearby.

&quot;Hmph, what do you want? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy saving your skin?&quot; He spat with the acidity of a petulant brat. He had decided to protect Aida out of necessity, but he still didn&#39;t quite care for her needs. After all, she had trapped him like a dog in a cage, only wanting to use him for her own purposes. Why should he treat her any-

<em>splurt</em>

Blood dripped out of Aida&#39;s body, covering the jellyfish&#39;s ink body and adding layers of red to its various tentacles. Her expression spoke a thousand words, being a mixture of confusion, pain and fear as she was still recovering from the impact of Mikhail&#39;s attacks. Reynard&#39;s eyes widened in confusion as he observed the gruesome sight: No, the injuries weren&#39;t fatal. Yes, Aida would still survive. But it was hard to keep a straight face as more details kept emerging around him.

The bullet shells encased in the jellyfish&#39;s body, which were its valiant attempt at protecting its Master.

The loud noises from earlier, which were most likely the result of Mikhail firing loads of bullets and shrapnel at Aida, explaining how it was currently embedded in her legs.

The aggressive jellyfish, which kept casting accusatory glances at Reynard all this time. After all, it was <em>his</em> fault that things had ended up this way.

Reynard felt <em>furious.</em> He never asked for this burden. All he wanted to do today was grab a bite to eat and rejoice at the fact that Aida wouldn&#39;t have to waste his time with ridiculous requests such as Holy Grail Wars and fights to the death.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028106871795621918 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028106871795621918><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:49 AM">10:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Instead, that dolt of a librarian had decided to seek trouble herself, getting involved in a fight with two strangers that had no qualms with murdering her on the spot, it seemed. He had viewed this as a &#39;game&#39; at first, since no one had seriously gotten hurt. It was about as fantastical as a fairy tale, a setting where there were zero consequences.

Yet every cough of blood from Aida&#39;s mouth reminded him of the tragedies that awaited them both if they played their cards poorly.

&quot;You complete moron.&quot; Reynard snarled, grinding his teeth as he almost felt tempted to shred past the jellyfish&#39;s tentacles and knock some sense into Aida. &quot;What were you even doing here? Why did you leave the library behind?! <strong>You&#39;re only good at reading books, so stay in the library, nincompoop!&quot;</strong> He shouted out loud, enough for even Aida to hear. 

He then scoffed, turning around as his tail paced itself left and right. He summoned back his crayon, staring at the scene in front of him as he noticed Ā-Q&#236;ng being pummeled by Manco&#39;s attacks while Mikhail was currently facing the girl&#39;s Master. The situation was perilous for both, but Reynard didn&#39;t care. He felt more like a wolf than a fox, looking for prey to release his stress on.

&quot;Stupid, stupid, stupid.&quot; Reynard kept repeating to himself, before noticing that the jellyfish was still glaring at him. &quot;You too, <em>idiot!</em> Why are you even here?! Go carry your Master to safety, you giant <img

The sudden profanity was unexpected, perhaps a sign of how much Reynard boiled. He didn&#39;t care about Aida at all. Truly!

But they were still his Master. His meal ticket for a better life. And not just that, but they had gotten hurt in a crossfire. Mikhail had only retaliated because of him, after all. The fox had no qualms with hurting others and being hurt back, but to see those closest to him get hurt in exchange-

-It was akin to pissing on his porch. And he liked it sparkling clean.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028106901625520198 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028106901625520198><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:49 AM">10:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/47uhv2w5cjc">https://youtu.be/47uhv2w5cjc</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXeiE6oxkRXx-rC_INztUDg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Quendra Obliviate</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47uhv2w5cjc"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace OST - Speed of Sound</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/47uhv2w5cjc width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028107033595088979 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028107033595088979><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:50 AM">10:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The fox stepped forward, leaving the jellyfish behind as he walked past the injured Ā-Q&#236;ng. He stared Manco down, having no fear of the Caster&#39;s elemental prowess.

&quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng.&quot; Reynard turned his head to the injured Lancer. &quot;You&#39;re a Servant, so get back up. As the rightful King of Foxes, <strong>I order you to keep my Master safe.&quot;</strong> He declared with a dignified glint in his eyes, strong enough to even mystify her.

&quot;And the best way you can do that for me is by taking care of Mr. Sniffer over there.&quot; He pointed towards the area where Mikhail and Alexander were fighting. &quot;They are your Master, are they not? Protect them then.&quot;

He then looked back at Manco.

&quot;This one is mine.&quot; He cracked his knuckles, imitating the jellyfish before sprinting at the Caster on all fours! What sort of strategy did the fox plan on employing? Surely they knew that Manco&#39;s tendrils were still active and ready to intercept any form of attack?

They certainly didn&#39;t show it, since they kept running at Manco on all fours, disregarding all forms of strategy and surprise tactics. It was no different than a fox running towards a juicy apple in the middle of a forest.

He kept running, reaching the scorching earth that had been burned from previous attacks. At this point, he was close enough for Manco to attempt any form of magical attack. He could use the ground, the soil, the air, the heat, the moisture...The possibilities were endless.

What could a little fox do?

<em>&quot;You might think you know what I&#39;m about to do, but-&quot;</em> Reynard thought in his head, smirking once he realized that he had reached just enough speed for his plan. He summoned his crayon again while he was on all fours, launching it in the air and letting it land...before getting on top of it and riding it. He was using it like a rocket, one that grinded across the ground. He was aimed straight for Manco, no doubt attempting to take a stab at him with the crayon&#39;s tip!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028107225828438077 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028107225828438077><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 10:51 AM">10:51</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His territory only allowed him an increase in power, it didn’t heal him or anything or the sort and seeing his Master also struggling he had little hope for support but weirdly enough even when it all hurts the king was somewhat calm.  

Even when he was standing purely on stubbornness as he refused to let two kids beat him. It didn’t matter that both were the worst possible matchup for him nor that both were way stronger than him: a king doesn’t run, a king doesn’t give up and more than anything a king doesn&#39;t beg. There was also a thought that passed through his mind as his tentacles continued to try and grab Reynard. If these 2 were enemies that meant that in the off chance he managed to defeat both of them that means his side would basically obtain 2 wins without a need to fight. His wish to survive and visit what remained of his old empire would be at hand. 

Yet that thought was just a fleeting thought, the screams of his master who continued to fight was actually another reason the king refused to stop. After all, no king could afford to relax while their subjects fought. Another tentacle came out of the ground and he gave it a small bottle. 

“Take it to that moron… it should make sure at the very least he doesn’t kill himself by accident.”

As the tentacle moved away he cast his gaze at the Lancer laying on the floor, his attack had been successful. Maybe she wasn’t of the knight classes? Hard to tell and no real time for him to worry. He still had one more enemy but her screams of pain were annoying...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028130203731501106 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028130203731501106><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 12:22 PM">12:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>No, they weren’t annoying, they were just a reminiscence of the same act he had done so many times in the past. Manco had no illusions about himself, he had been a good kind but that didn’t make him a saint by a far margin. How many men, women and children had he killed in order to protect his empire. Sometimes he wondered, was it worth it? All those lifes lost all for his empire to eventually crumble and be slaved just like they had done before.

The king didn’t know and it was pointless to worry about it, but even if it was pointless the question would never fade. As Reynard ordered Ā-Q&#236;ng to protect his master the old king got angry.

“Bold words of someone who is quite useless… The strongest class, the strongest servant and still you are just going for the easy way out. You are no king, you are just a foolish brat who can’t even keep its master safe and only thinks of running away.”

The king&#39;s words were also directed at himself, Mikail had been forced to be so reckless and crazy only because of Caster&#39;s own shortcomings. But right now with both Lancer and Saber attention he would give Mikail his chance. At the very least he would make sure no one else were to get in his way. After all it was the job of the monarch to pave the way for his subjects. 

As Reynard began to move he moved his hand water came from the circle but not directed at the fox but instead they went and covered Ā-Q&#236;ng giving the young girl some reprieve from the burns his fireball had caused her but also imprisoning her as the water slowly began to freeze turning itself into a freezing prison. His aim was to keep her in place as he dealt with Reynar. 

More tentacles came from the ground,but they couldn’t grab the little fox,it was too fast and before Manco could think of something else the little brat had once again betrayed his expectations. He was riding the crayon as a rocket ready for a full collision. .</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028130244265259008 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028130244265259008><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 12:22 PM">12:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Why does everyone keep throwing themselves at me…?”

But even so the king would accept the challenge, even if he could dodge that the moment he stepped out of the circle he was as good as dead. Many walls of rock were erected in between the two of them. 

<em>crack crack crack</em>

They offered little resistance, the fox easily broke through them but that was okay, he never thought they would stop him, they were just to slow him down even if just a second. As Reynard broke through the last one he would find a rock warrior blocking his path. The warrior was armed with a big shield and an axe but the latter was basically thrown aside the rock warrior would stand firm shield in hand to receive the brunt of the servant attack and for a moment the Rock warrior stood strong and still. 

<em>crack crack crack</em>

More and more cracks appeared, it seemed like the efforst of the Inca were useless, pathetic resistance of a servant who clearly had no way of winning but Reynard should know that exactly that will and stubbornness was one the reasons human were able to achieve the status of legends, of heroes.

As the warrior crumbled,  Manco Capac&#39;s last defense appeared, the Inca had been waiting for this moment all along. Trying his hardest to delay the Reynard rocket attack to counter it with everything he had. Golden flames shine once again wrapped in the king’s fist as he punches the tip of the crayon with everything he had.

“Inti!!!” he yelled as the flames aimed to engulf the crayon and the fox. This was Manco’s final bet and as the powers clashed a big explosion occurred hiding whoever came out of the clash victorious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Doing so had caused Mikail to reveal an array of abilities, all of which Alexander didn&#39;t have time to make out. This fight wasn&#39;t necessarily Alexanders ideal engagement. While he was trained in person to person combat, he liked to take things slow. The ruler prided himself in his strategic abilities, mixing both his mental capacity and his fighting prowess as his go to gameplan. However, this forced fight made strategizing hard. He had little time to think, and barely enough to react. He would have to think on the fly, finding ways to stall bit by bit.

Alexander would press his body against the food stall watching as Mikail approached far above average speeds. His opponent was physically strong, being able to efficiently move after taking a hard tumble was more then impressive. Additionally, the constant screaming lead Alexander to believe that Mikail might be a bit of a meathead. If he was careful he could hopefully take advantage of his opponents brash nature.

As Mikail loudly announced his presence, Alexander&#39;s eyes would narrow. He needed to act quick. Mikail had done well to quickly move past the range of Alexander&#39;s weapon, however this situation was ideal for the King. His shotgun would shift downwards pointing between both Masters feet. Just before Mikail&#39;s fist could reach Alexander&#39;s face a bang would go off; a white stone would slam against the floor causing a mana barrier to expand five feet in all directions instantaneously. Alexander would fall backwards, the souls of his feet pointing towards the barrier, the expanding force launching him ten feet backwards. Meanwhile the barrier would collide with Mikail&#39;s shins, making them feel like they had just been wailed on by a boxer. 

Landing ten feet back Alexander would take the spare moment to peer behind his opponent, catching a glimpse of Ā-Q&#236;ng. His heart nearly skipped a beat as Lancer rushed willingly towards Caster&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028226253356023848 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028226253356023848><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Oct-22 06:44 PM">18:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>s attack. Did the girl learn nothing from their lesson at the park. Alexander couldn&#39;t do anything but watch helplessly as Ā-Q&#236;ng was ravaged by Caster&#39;s attack, her searing flesh and screams of pain, echoing in Alexanders mind. 

Alexander bit down on his lip, his heart pounding from Lancer&#39;s mishap. He knew she wasn&#39;t ready for this kind of combat, why couldn&#39;t she just listen to his order and not have wondered off. He needed to be swift in his fight with Mikail. He had to put an end to this fight as soon as possible. 

From Alexander&#39;s right hand a Jasper would fall onto the floor causing a wall of flames to come between him and Mikail, blocking a direct path. Mikail would be able to hear Alexander&#39;s gun dispense his used capsules as two quarts were loaded into the barrel with a satisfying click. &quot;Call off your servant or step through these flames and meet your fate!&quot;

Her entire body was wracked with painful spasms, and blood was pouring out of the wounds on her legs, staining the wisps and strips that had belonged to a once beautiful dress. It was like watching a red spider lily bloom on a battlefield. The visage was striking and ominous, as in the language of flowers, the Lycoris Radiata was most often associated with death. What a relief it would be if the tears, the agony...what a relief it would be it all of it could simply <em>stop</em>. A state of unconsciousness would become her ultimate salvation, and Aida was ready to succumb so that she wouldn&#39;t have to feel anymore.

Yet death would not answer. The shrapnel lodged in her legs were more painful than lethal; instead of knocking her out in an instant, they only prolonged her suffering by subjecting her to the slow but steady torture of blood loss. The pain sharpened her senses, making every hitch of breath sound unusually loud in her ears and every drop of tears searing hot against her skin. 

The fleshy tendrils of the jellyfish rippled as someone slashed at them from the outside, as if trying to get through to the princess being protected within. Aida jerked her head up, her face a teary mess, and through the foggy glasses she was able to vaguely make out the shape of her Servant. 

<em>’You complete moron!&#39;</em> The fox child yipped at her, the fur on his ears and tail bristling as he shook in a mixture of horror and rage. <em>‘You&#39;re only good at reading books, so stay in the library, nincompoop!&#39;</em>

Aida scrunched up her face in a grimace. She covered her ears, but even that wasn&#39;t enough to stop Reynard&#39;s colorful vocabulary from making their way through. The insults bounced around her protective chamber, they echoed back at her, sounding like a chorus sung by a dozen of so Reynards...

&#39;...Shut up, Reynard.&#39; 

Unbeknownst to even herself, Aida curled her fingers in the dirt. Her voice shook, but there was a tinge of something else in it, a new emotional that had been brought forth by Reynard&#39;s barbed words. &#39;You are the last person I want to hear it from.&#39;

Who did he think he was, calling her a dunderhead when he was the one who slipped on ink (Reynard&#39;s multiple &#39;blunders&#39; during his summoning were still fresh on her mind)? Who was he calling a bookworm, when he was the one who insisted on bringing a crayon to a fight? What kind of Saber fights with a crayon anyway? His tomfoolery was pushing her limits! 

So what gave him the right to preach to her?

Aida flexed her magic circuits. Mana flared out from her fingertips as she plunged her hand into the flesh of her familiar. Then she pulled back, and began to withdraw bundles of threads made of ink. 

&#39;<em>I&#39;m</em> the one who will be teaching <em>you</em> a lesson, silly fox.&#39; The librarian spoke under her breath, a dangerous glint behind her glasses. Painfully, painstakingly, she began to weave, her fingers dancing over threads of ink and layering them into something corporeal, magnificent, something that was ready to be plucked out of her memories, an iconic figure that was the cornerstone to oh so many stories preserved through time...

Where its tendrils had once rested, a dark vortex appeared and grew to engulf its entire body. Threads of ink spun like candy floss over a cotton candy machine, its once plump body shrinking at an alarming rate and wrapping itself around its owner&#39;s body like a cocoon-

A cracking sound slammed against the earth. A grim figure emerged from the maelstrom of ink, their body covered from head to toe in an ebony armor that seemed to be fashioned from the darkest shadows. They wielded a lance in one hand and a shield in the other, both of which were streaked with the color of blood. The jellyfish was gone, replaced by a dark-armored knight that seemed to have stepped straight out of a child&#39;s nightmare...

<em><strong>CLANG!</strong></em>

&#39;I-I forgot my silver dye!&#39;

Aida&#39;s anguished voice echoed from behind the helmet, which neither shone nor reflected any light from the sun. The &#39;knight&#39; dropped their shield on the ground with a <em><strong>clang</strong></em> and moved to push up the visor of their helmet with their free hand.

&#39;I&#39;m missing so many colors!&#39; The librarian&#39;s face peeked through from behind the visor, a look of immense disappointment on her face as she berated herself for her oversight. &#39;For get a knight in shining armor, now <em>I&#39;m</em> the one who looks like a villain!&#39;

As the barrier collided with his shins, explosions appeared from his legs, reducing the recieved damage by weakening the orb and moving Mikail some distance away. His legs were now fairly hurt, but that did not stop him. He immediately ran at the king to punch him again, but a wall of fire appeared in front of him. 

Then Mikail realized the mistake of holstering his guns, but to remedy this mistake he proceeded to quickdraw the Uluu Toion while speeding up his arm by casting tiny explosions at some parts of it, making the quickdraw unnaturally fast. While the velocity from this did bring pain to his arm, it was necessary. 

Then he shot it at the lower part of the fire wall, both sending metal shards at Alexander&#39;s lower half of the body and removing a lot of the flames with a wave of white freezing fire. And just as the wave of cold disappeared together with a lot of the flames, the king could see as the mercenary was sliding across the floor on his back. Mikail achieved this by dropping onto the ground and casting a yet another explosion behind himself.

Alexander could barely react as the mercenary was sliding across the ground near him just as he finished reloading, having not enough time to properly aim at Mikail who was moving at breakneck speeds. Instead of sliding directly at Alexander, he slid on a diagonal, with the final destination being behind the king slightly to the side. &quot;<strong>I WILL NOT FUCKING DO WHAT YOU WANT, YOU SLOW SNAIL-LIKE UGLY BEARDED FAILURE! I BET NO ONE IN YOUR WORTHLESS FAMILY LIKES YOU!</strong>&quot; The mercenary quickly got back up, turned around and tackled the king from behind while attempting to grab his shotgun and disarm him. 

Alexander underestimated Mikail - the king will have to use some of his more valuable jewels if he wants to defeat this opponent.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028369052973944873 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028369052973944873><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 04:11 AM">04:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His crayon kept hurrying forward, piercing through Manco&#39;s defenses and barely meeting any resistance. The Caster was simply a poor match, his Magecraft having little use against a Saber with high physical parameters and an innate resistance to magic.

But every wall was destined to eventually crumble. A drop of rain could slowly erode an entire mountain. Such is the strategy that Manco Capaq employed as he delayed the fox&#39;s advance as much as possible, dulling the crayon&#39;s tip with every obstacle.

&quot;Chickening out? I don&#39;t blame you, but <em>c&#39;mon,</em>&quot; Reynard taunted as he passed through multiple walls, until he came across a rock soldier Manco had left specifically for him. &quot;at least you would have something to brag about if you faced me head on!&quot;

He taunted, cracking the soldier open and eviscerating him with the crayon&#39;s tip, before Manco emerged from the warrior&#39;s ashes. The Caster&#39;s fist was raised, aiming for a more direct approach when it came to dealing with Reynard. Their fist was on fire, directly aimed towards the crayon&#39;s tip as they attempted to break it and stop its advance.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Reynard retaliated, getting off and pushing the crayon forward with all of his might, wanting to overpower Manco and jam the crayon right inside of him. Likewise, Manco aimed to do the opposite and shove the crayon back to Reynard. The two kept clashing, the ground around them trembling and cracking until-

<em>KA-BOOM!</em>

An explosion occurred from the sheer amount of energy generated from the two colliding forces. The crayon overloaded, while Manco&#39;s fist burned too bright. Reynard was sent flying, tossed several feet away as his coat was now slightly burning and his crayon looked duller than usual. The same applied to Manco, who had been catapulted away with an heavily injured arm and landed right in the danger zone of Alexander and Mikhail.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028470241652654110 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028470241652654110><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 10:53 AM">10:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Gah!&quot; Reynard screamed in pain, scratches and burn marks across his body as he cursed himself for underestimating just how much grit the Caster had. Perhaps, facing them head on was a mistake after a-

<em>CLANG!</em>

&quot;OW!&quot; He shouted, landing on something hard and rotund. His head felt knackered as he turned around and noticed that he had landed on a...shield?

<em>&quot;What the-&quot;</em> He thought, before hearing more metallic clanging nearby, followed by an iron figure appearing in his line of sight. It was a suit of armor, albeit one that seemed dark and malefic. They also wielded a bloody lance, one that had most likely stabbed the hearts of many men in storied and bloody battles.

Then the suit opened their visor, revealing a pair of glasses and the puppy eyes that accompanied them.

&quot;...Aida?&quot; Reynard asked softly, albeit he was unable to hide his astonishment. He thought his Master was in critical condition earlier. That they needed assistance while his duty was to deal with the enemies around them. Instead, Aida was now wearing some vile armor and the jellyfish was gone. Plus, she seemed to be more focused on ranting about the lack of silver dye and moaning about how evil she looked.

The fox couldn&#39;t make heads or tails about it. All he knew was that he felt rather ticked. What was the point in him getting angry about his Master being hurt? They looked fine now! God, he felt like such an idiot. That feeling turned into frustration, and what better way to heal that than by slapping his Master?

&quot;What are you still doing here, you dolt? Didn&#39;t I tell you to get to safety?!&quot; He chided her like an overbearing parent, stepping closer as he started tapping at the suit&#39;s wide chest. &quot;You look positively <em>hideous!</em> Are you trying to overshadow me in villainy? Because I&#39;m more than ready to turn over to a new leaf if it&#39;ll stop me from being compared to folk like you!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028470330374758400 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028470330374758400><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 10:53 AM">10:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He hopped and closed her visor out of spite, scoffing at her and thinking about how much of an idiot he was for getting worried.

&quot;Whatever, just get out of here! If that armor looks as vile as it suggests, then you should be safe enough to make a run for it.&quot; The fox said. He seemed intent on handling the situation on his own. In his eyes, his Master was but a hindrance!

He was fighting a Saber, the difference in their powers was such that he honestly didn’t had a single chance yet Manco continued with his struggle.  He felt how the muscles in his arm began to tear themselves apart as he continued to try and push Reynard crayon back. It was laughable in some way, the golden flames of the sun, the power he was able to channel from the gods his culture believed was barely enough to push a crayon back. It was barely enough to keep the crayon from stabbing him and ending this second life he had been given. Yet as he stared back at it there was nothing but determination in his eyes. 

Then all went black again, just like when he was blown away by A- Qing blow the world turned upside down. The pain that he had been able to somewhat ignore had come back with even more strength. He couldn’t find his voice, it was no surprise he had been sent flying for the second time in a matter of minutes. Normally that wouldn’t be much issue for a servant but a Caster isn’t meant to be durable, he isn’t meant to be able to fight the knight classes head one and come out on top. Which made the fact that he was still breathing nothing short of a miracle. 

He was a bloody mess, one of his arms barely resembled one and instead it was just a bloody chunk of meat limping on his side and his clothes had lost his luster and were covered in blood and dirt and yet the king was quite satisfied.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028536050873794642 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028536050873794642><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 03:15 PM">15:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It could very well just be the fact that had suffered too many blows to the head and his thoughts right now were just the pain talking but despite everything the old king found he had done quite the nice job. Like all things considered he should be dead already but even despite his enemies best tries he was still alive. 

Sounds of battle reached his ears as he laid down on the floor unsure of what to do. He had been blown away from his territory and with that any hope of hurting Reynard or even A-Qing was gone. Part of him wanted to just stay down but the loud sound of bullets and swearing made it impossible. 

“You are quite a noisy master…” he said as he could recognize Mikail’s loud voice. He began to understand what he meant before about going into a frenzy and all that. He slowly picked himself up, unsure what to do. 

“Hey Master!!” he yelled in order to make sure that Mikail heard him. “I think we are quite close to losing, I have a final ace under my sleeve but not sure how well it will work. So give me your orders, you wanna continue fighting or you wanna try a strategic retreat.”

He knew what his master answer probably was going to be so he began to focus. He needed to make the most of this small reprieve.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was close to just closing her eyes and letting go, to escape the pain by giving up and waking from this predicament as one would from a bad dream, but it was then that a voice rang out to pierce the veil.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">“Ā-Q&#236;ng.”
</div></div>
The fog clouding her mind dissipated, her thoughts no longer lost amidst the haze and gripping tightly onto the voice guiding her back to consciousness.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">“You&#39;re a Servant, so get back up. As the rightful King of Foxes, I order you to keep my Master safe.”
</div></div>
It was Reynard.
In his wisdom he sought not to coddle her, but give her a tangible goal to focus on. An important objective meant to give her the strength to rise above her pain, not to ignore it, but to overcome it. As the mighty King of the Isle of Foxes he must have known that it was all too easy to be selfish and give up when it was only your own life that was at stake, but warriors did not have the luxury to die selfishly; their lives no longer belonged to just them alone.

“...sorry,” Ā-Q&#236;ng laboriously groaned as she rolled onto her stomach and wiped the snot from her face with what remained of her remaining left sleeve; though all she did was apologize, her reply was spoken in gratitude for Reynard’s intervention, her agonized cries now halted and instead replaced with silent focus.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028611877099552799 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028611877099552799><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Oct-22 08:16 PM">20:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She wouldn’t have the chance to say much else as she was immediately encased in an aquatic prison. A mercy from her opponent, or pity perhaps, though its intended purpose was clearly to restrain her so that she may be dealt with at a later time. The water sizzled and boiled as it made contact with her skin, but as it turned to ice, Ā-Q&#236;ng was finally given a moment of reprieve from the scorching heat eating away at her flesh. Her injuries were still agonizing of course, but no longer debilitating, meaning that she could now follow her Fox King’s command.

A crack formed on the ice. Then another. And yet another again.
Each was preceded by a powerful low thud, not unlike a battering ram being made to fell a mighty glacier, before eventually the bindings of frost and rime were undone by numerous stalks of bamboo exploding out of the icy sphere, causing snow and hail to rain down onto the battlefield. Out of this blast a single verdant streak emerged, not as straight and clean as it had been before, but even as it left a wavering trail in its wake, its velocity was not something to easily dismiss. Though Ā-Q&#236;ng had lost use of almost the entirety of her entire right upper body, her legs yet continued to function. Balancing her steps was a challenge without being able to so much as bend her charred arm without causing the agitated skin to crack and tear, but she wouldn’t have attained such mastery over the Wisdom of her Bamboo Grove if she couldn’t account for these small discomforts in her movements.

Coming to a halt at Alexander’s side, she nearly toppled over as the shift in momentum caused her arm to move, and thus pain to surge, but she was not bearing it just by herself this time. Her fall caught by her Master’s sturdy frame, Ā-Q&#236;ng used him as a support to make up for her own diminished mobility, her face momentarily buried in his chest as she murmured in the smallest of whispers.

“...I am sorry.”

Then gunshots rang out, heralding the enemy Master’s assault.
Ā-Q&#236;ng tore her face away from her Master and spun the pole she had taken from the ice around her left wrist, intercepting the metallic projectiles before they could reach Alexander, who now bore a slightly damp stain on his chest from where his Servant had wiped her tears. In fact, they had not ceased once, so unfamiliar she was to the sensation of pain that her body had no idea how to process it even if her mind had regained some measure of stability. But Reynard was right. She had to protect her Master. If she could be capable of hurting this badly despite being a Servant, the thought of him suffering similarly was all the more upsetting.

The enemy soldier’s movements were fast and erratic, already sliding behind them even as Ā-Q&#236;ng caught the last of his earlier volley with her stick, but speed was not a contest she intended to lose.

For her it was only a single step or two, and so she had enough time to prepare for the oncoming assault. Her left arm was raised to around her opponent’s chest level, open-palmed, Qi gathering on the surface to pillow his crude velocity and make him come to a stop at a moments notice. It was less an attack and more of a ‘catch’, seeing as any attack performed on him while moving at such a pace would undoubtedly be lethal.

In life she likely would not have cared. She had struck faster and harder for much lesser offenses before, but she had since learned of the consequences that came with the taking of a life, even if unintentional. Still, neither could she forgive someone showing such open hostility to her Master, so she was not above punishing him for his rudeness.

As tears still gathered in her eyes from the exertion, her voice trembling with the involuntary convulsions caused by the festering wounds on her chest, Ā-Q&#236;ng nevertheless spoke with as much determination as she could muster, “I am not going to let you hurt my Master.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The visor went back up, this time with Aida propping it up adamantly so that Reynard couldn&#39;t slam it shut again. Aida&#39;s pale face confronted her Servant, her blazing eyes beat down his! But what that a tinge of embarrassment he spotted? It looked like his words hit harder than he&#39;d expected.

&#39;Stop judging my outfit!&#39; She whimpered, embarrassment written all over her face. &#39;I fashioned it after the image of a radiant knight, not...I had to make do with what I had, alright?! Besides, who are you to talk? You look like someone who just crawled out of an oven!&#39; She huffed, clearly unimpressed by Reynard&#39;s tasteless judgment. 

Upon hearing his suggestion that <em>she</em> turn tail and run, the librarian shook her head fervently, a telltale sign that she was done listening to whatever nonsense the fox was about to spew.

&#39;I&#39;m doing what I should&#39;ve done a long time ago!&#39; She defended herself fiercely. Now that she was wearing an oversized can, the librarian&#39;s voice bore a strange ringing quality that sounded half like it was reverberating off metal, and half like she was talking underwater. The experience was a little disorienting, especially for Reynard, who was well within earshot of her. Perhaps a bit <em>too</em> close too, as the librarian immediately resumed the tried-and-true tactic of picking Reynard up...like a kitten.

&#39;I&#39;m not running...and that&#39;s final. Running away goes against a knight&#39;s code of conduct.&#39; As she declared her stance, she released Reynard and allowed him the freedom of movement, albeit with more hesitation. After all, she wasn&#39;t done with him yet! A childish part of her still wanted to punt him for all the &#39;good&#39; he&#39;d done over the past weeks, but she had to refrain for now. After all, she was currently <em>in character</em>. She would sully the honor of knighthood were she to punish a comrade for selfish reasons alone.

Besides...it wasn&#39;t like she could run far even if she&#39;d wanted to.

Giving Reynard more ammunition to call her an idiot was the last thing she wanted right now. What more mean things would he say to her if she confessed to him that she hadn&#39;t been trained in the healing arts at all? What would he do if he found out that standing and pacing around was the most she could manage in her current state? She&#39;d rather he gape at her in awe, or whatever sour look he was projecting her way. <em>That</em> was how it was supposed to work in the first place! 

&#39;I want to claim victory for this fight,&#39; she said flatly, &#39;and I want you to stop slacking!&#39; Her voice went almost a full pitch higher, as some of her frustration broke through the grim fa&#231;ade she had so valiantly put up. &#39;You&#39;ve been living like a king while I had to clean up your mess, it&#39;s time you pay it all back!&#39; 

The shield quivered at her foot as she spoke. Could Reynard have been imagining it?

Then when he was in the middle of trying to tackle Alexander, he was suddenly stopped in his way by a small hand of a severely burned child. It was Ā-Q&#236;ng, who pushed through the pain and ran as fast as she could to save her master. But instead of just killing Mikail to quickly win the fight, she spared him, not wanting to take another life. &quot;<strong>WHAT THE- WHAT? YOU LITTLE FUCK. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

What a wasted opportunity! What made it worse was that the one in front of him was a child, something he promised to himself he would never kill.  

Then he turned his head at Alexander, hatred could be seen in his eye through the shattered lens of the gas mask. &quot;<strong>YOU&#39;RE DESPICABLE!

This was a terrible situation for Alexander, as Ā-Q&#236;ng was distracted fighting Manco for most of the fight and didn&#39;t know much about what Mikail can do, but explaining that the mercenary is about to explode to the girl would take way too long to get away in time. But crucial information could be found in Mikail&#39;s rant - they were both on the republic&#39;s side this entire time.

So what if he was physically slow? From the way Mikail spoke, he seemed to be the slow one. Alexander would smirk at his mental joke readying his weapon. Before he had much time to prepare, an array of metal shards would fly toward his body. He had prepared for a ranged attack, thus why he loaded two quartz into his weapon. Despite his small preparation, no matter how fast Alexander moved, he would not successfully stop Mikail&#39;s high-speed attack. Instead, Ā-Q&#236;ng came to his rescue. 

Alexander’s body shifted slightly, feeling Ā-Q&#236;ng stop against his chest. The tears running down his chest and her somber words caused the king to frown internally. Her words were genuine, and the tears only reminded him of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s young age. It was hard to tell if the tears were only from the pain or if the disappointed look from before had left an impression. 

Before Alexander could respond to his servant’s words, she was already taking action against their opponent. She easily blocked his metal shards and outspeed the incoming Mikail, gracefully parrying his attack. Mikail was fast, but he could not match a servant&#39;s speed.

Following Ā-Q&#236;ng’s parry, Alexander’s shotgun raised in the air pointing at Mikail. Ready to pull the trigger, he would choke up as Mikail’s rant revealed some very important information. A very small detail in the conglomerate of words changed everything. Hearing it come from Mikail’s mouth made Alexander want to scream at the top of his lungs. In fact, it confirmed Alexander&#39;s worst fear from when he engaged in this fight… Ā-Q&#236;ng had befriended the enemy and was currently fighting a Repulic master and servant! 

Alexander’s hesitation to fire had given his ‘opponent’ time to charge up an attack. From the looks of it, the attack would be devastating to everything and everyone around. He had to defuse the situation with this maniac as quickly as possible. “WAIT!” He called out as loud as his lungs would allo</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1028738379237572759 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1028738379237572759><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Oct-22 04:39 AM">04:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>w.

“I&#39;M ON THE REPUBLICS SIDE!” Alexander quickly reached into his pocket, not puling out any gems this time, but his mobile device. He held it forward to Mikail&#39;s face revealing a string of formal business messages with a republic representative. “I don&#39;t know how this mixup happened, but we’re on the same side!”

In all of this chaos one thing was clear. Alexander and Ā-Q&#236;ng would have a very long talk when they got home.

Whereas she would have been ordinarily forced to dodge or redirect his tackle, now she was thankfully able to stop him completely. His momentum ceased and Ā-Q&#236;ng braced for an impulsive attack to follow, but what came instead was a waterfall of insults, directed at both her, and her and Master.

“Because if you murder someone you cannot see them anymore…”

To the shouting man’s outrage at her refusal to go for the easy kill, Ā-Q&#236;ng answered with a fact that was almost too elementary in logic. Of course killing someone meant that they would no longer be around, one did not have to know war to understand this intrinsic law, and yet to her it appeared to stand at the core of what drove her.

“Even if you really hate someone, killing is always a mistake.”

Just as madmen would never stoop to reason, so would her absurdly simplistic mindset never bend to the proven truths that governed the world. There were numerous faults one could find in her logic, and even more ways in which it would contradict itself, but to her, her beliefs were unshakeable. That was because it was not this vague ideal she held in her heart when she spoke, but the image of someone very dear to her, whose life was tragically cut short by Ā-Q&#236;ng’s own hand.

It was then, at the moment her mind wandered, that a sizeable amount of magical energy surged within the body of her opponent, its magnitude far from being called a Noble Phantasm, yet still reaching levels that could very well leave its targets in critical condition should they face the brunt of whatever spell he invoked unprepared.

Gathering strength in her limbs, she was about to perform the same trick she had employed when fighting Alexander on the day of her summoning, her own variation of a one-inch punch to blast her opponent away before he could complete his spell, but to her surprise, it was her own Master’s voice that halted her in her tracks.

Alexandria. Republic.
Two names that were told to her when she was summoned, but not quite taken to heart, judging by the puzzled look on her face as she listened to his plea to convince his foe of his allegiance. Come to think of it, those two names did start to ring a bell? Sort of. Which meant… were the bullies they were fighting supposed to be their friends?

Glancing between the two men as she just happened to be caught between them, she kept her palm firmly placed on her potentially new ally’s sternum, ready to halt the attack herself should he refuse to, and maybe, just maybe, feeling a particularly angry glare bearing down at her from behind by the increasingly more frustrated Alexander.

It was quite possible that she might have been the cause for that frustration, but she wasn’t sure just yet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She immediately raised her visor, glaring at him with those bright of hers, albeit they weren&#39;t nearly as bright as her blush.

&quot;Hit a nerve, have I?&quot; He sneered as his Master went into a long tirade of how much effort they put into their outfit, how much thought was put into its meticulous design, before devolving in yet another string of insults designed to bring the fox down.

&quot;If I come from an oven, then you&#39;re half baked. Radiant knight? You look like you&#39;re my future executioner!&quot; The fox howled, finding Aida&#39;s claims ridiculous. He might have even continued, had the &#39;shining knight&#39; not lifted him up like a baby and held him too close for comfort.

&quot;Put me down. Now!&quot; Reynard flailed his arms around to no effort. The laws of the wolf made him powerless to Aida, regardless of how goofy she looked. He was forced to listen to her spiel, watching his Master state their stance and determination. Her grip tightened as she spoke, informing him on her intend to act like a proper knight. Despite how passionate she sounded in that moment, she was quick to release the fox as soon as she was done. Even Reynard was surprised.

&quot;Slacking? Me? More like trapped because someone left me alone for weeks.&quot; The fox grumbled, not budging an inch at Aida&#39;s accusations and shrilly voice. If she thought moping would be a good strategy, then she should reconsider, since Reynard felt like he owed nothing to her.

&quot;You expect <em>me</em> to resolve the problems that <em>you</em> got yourself involved in?!&quot; The fox laughed, incredulous at how na&#239;ve Aida was with her demands. He had seen scarecrows barter with more impressive logic than her. &quot;Why don&#39;t you go lick my-&quot;

A loud noise could be heard next to Reynard&#39;s feet, as he turned down and noticed the shield vibrate at Aida&#39;s words. This wasn&#39;t just the impact of the sound, but the words as well. Anytime Aida said something that was designed to shoulder responsibilities to him, the shield replied with a noise, as if nodding in agreement. In addition, he could feel its gaze on him, like a piercing eyeball scouring his every move. It was no different than-

&quot;Wait.&quot; Reynard interrupted himself. &quot;That armor, don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s made out of-&quot; He paused, realizing that he didn&#39;t even need to ask. That sinister, dark color, coupled with the tinge of red that came from Aida&#39;s own blood. There was no doubt about its origin.

&quot;You made a suit out of your familiar? What sort of sick magus are you?&quot; Reynard said, trying to hide how impressed he was at that fact. He was skittish, but not foolish: He had rarely seen Magecraft capable of turning familiars into enhancements for the magus who summoned them. &quot;And you used blood as your pigment? Are you <em>trying</em> to get yourself killed?&quot; He tapped on her stomach with an accusatory finger.

&quot;I&#39;ve already been doing <em>all</em> of the work here, so don&#39;t go blaming me for your inadequacy.&quot; He scolded her. &quot;You&#39;re lucky I even bothered coming to help you in the first place. This entire mess is <em>your</em> fault and the result of <em>your</em> actions!&quot; He glared at her from below, before hearing the shield rumble a bit at his words.

&quot;Oh, shut up you!&quot; He stomped it lightly, causing a reverbing noise to echo across the bazaar. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

At this point it would be easier for Manco to count the parts of his body that weren&#39;t hurting and while he understands that running away at this point was something both needed to consider he felt that letting those two  have the win left a really bad feeling inside of him. Manco was aware of how petty he was being but seeing how his master was ready to keep fighting he really had no real options except somehow win. Luckily Manco had one  last trick, it was something he didn&#39;t wanted to use yet but he really didn&#39;t saw another option.  Specially now that Ā-Q&#236;ng had recovered, or at least recovered enough to rejoin the fight.

He began to focus his mana, this would be his last attempt to win if the enemy had some sort of surviving what he was planning he really had no idea what he could do to take them down. Still while he had spent many days with Mikail, due to the lack of fights he hadn&#39;t really experience much time with him in his current state. 

&quot;So noisy...&quot; the old king complained as his master continue to let out insult after insult. Normally he would just ignore his master rant but he felt something else as he talked. As a magician himself he could tell his master was also charging something and his previous words were ominous enough. He wasn&#39;t the only one who felt how badly this could turn as for some reason Ā-Q&#236;ng master act in a fit of panic. 

It was then that Manco stopped his charging, a new hope appeared before them in the form that both of them were supposed to be on the same side. This make all their efforts and wounds completely useless, the situation had become so absurd that Manco could laugh for many days but that was something he would need to leave for another time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Mikail calm down for a freaking second!!&quot; he said as he walked closer to the group before turning into Ā-Q&#236;ng. &quot;Look little girl, right now Im in a lot of pain and part of me wants to do as my Master but If you stay still for a bit I promise I wont do anything to that brat&quot; he said pointing at Alexander with his good arm.

He turned towards Alexander his mind trying to process the new information. So if the guy was telling the truth, that means he had been beaten for nothing but also meant that their only enemy was that fox brat and his master which actually meant they had a chance to win.

She had looked forward to getting back to normality - whatever that would turn out to be, and having a fox-sized reminder of everything she&#39;d done wrong certainly didn&#39;t help.

&#39;Oh, dear me, how could I have forgotten that us lowly peasants have no right to deserve the mighty King of Fox&#39;s grace?&#39; She picked up on the title Ā-Q&#236;ng had adopted for Reynard for reasons beyond her imagination. &#39;If you&#39;re going to put yourself on a pedestal, then at least have something to show for it. What good have you done all week?!&#39;

She knelt down on the ground with a heavy <em>thud</em>, her sentient armor raising a cloud of dust and almost flattening Reynard&#39;s snoot as she leaned into her Servant and flicked his forehead with her armored finger.

&#39;Half-eaten fruits across the library floor&#39;—<em>flick!</em>—&#39;stolen books from private collections&#39;—<em>flick!</em>—&#39;fur on the shelves and dog-eared documents as far as the eye can see&#39;—<em>flick!</em>—&#39;We had to recruit new janitors because of you, and I had to spend half of my shifts running errands because you swindled the delivery ladies to take you out on a date!&#39; 

<em><strong>FLICK!</strong></em>

&#39;And now you are here telling me to mind my own problems?&#39; 

Clearly, Reynard and his Master weren&#39;t quite on the same page. Though Reynard had presumably been talking about his valiant efforts in contending with Manco and Mikail, Aida&#39;s mind seemed to be stuck in the past, as she started reading off a list of the sins the fox had committed thanks to her excellent memory. Meanwhile, Reynard&#39;s contributions to the current fight had been overlooked!

Unlike Reynard or even Ā-Q&#236;ng, Aida didn&#39;t have eyes growing on the back of her head, nor did she have the capability of perceiving all the actions unfolding across the battlefield. She was intimately drawn towards the things happening right in front of her, and in that regard, all the good deeds Reynard had done had all but gone undetected...aside from the fact that he had allowed Mikail to slip through his fingers and catch his Master unawares.

How unfortunate.

Aida raised her finger again, but this time she spared Reynard&#39;s forehead and wagged it in front him instead. &#39;No, no. You have it all wrong. I&#39;m <em>always</em> minding my own problems. You just happened to be a tough one to-&#39;

<em>CRACK</em>

She spread her fingers and cracked her knuckles, the popping noise reverberating oddly in the hollow of her ink-fiber armor. It was a huge step-up from the lackluster attempt made by her jellyfish, but had it been an actual battle worn warrior behind the suit of armor, the action would have been much more menacing. Still, not bad for an amateurish attempt!

&#39;But you are right. Maybe it&#39;s time for me to try something different. Maybe <em>I&#39;m</em> the one who&#39;s been slacking.&#39; She said with a determined frown. &#39;I&#39;ll have to try harder.&#39;

There wasn&#39;t even a hint of sarcasm in her voice. The librarian was actually serious, and that posed an issue all on its own.

Then he turned in the direction of Reynard and Aida with contempt in his eyes, however this time he did it consiously rather than out of blind rage. &quot;That god damn fox...&quot; 

Suddenly rock hands appeared from under him and the two nearby in an attempt to wrap around them. Mikail instinctually casted an explosion under him, briefly sending himself into the air before landing close to Manco. &quot;Wait. Caster, you don&#39;t have to constrain me, i think i&#39;m calm now. And unhand the other two, if you will?&quot;

After saying that Mikail stumbled slightly forward almost falling onto Manco, but catched himself back up before that actually happened. He then briefly slid one of his hands under the gasmask, his hand returning with blood on its fingers. &quot;Yup, that&#39;s a nosebleed.&quot; After that he carefully put the hand on his chest. &quot;I think some of my ribs are also broken. Seems to be nothing serious, luckily.&quot; Mikail did not consider this to be a serious injury after years of living as a mercenary. &quot;The lack of mana is killing me more right now.&quot;

He turned around and approached the other pair once again. &quot;Child. Do not trust people when you first meet them. Get to know them first for a few days. Look where it got you. That so called &#39;king of foxes&#39; tricked you, and now you got burned. Be more careful next time.&quot; After that he turned away from Ā-Q&#236;ng, dusted himself off and faced Alexander. &quot;So you are the master? My name is Mikail Bernstein, nice to meet you. And i apologize for my hostility and previous insults, i quite literally couldn&#39;t control myself. I assume that your small friend did all of this against your advice? But we&#39;ll talk more about this later, we should take care of our enemies first.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029067194023301170 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029067194023301170><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 02:25 AM">02:25</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Mikail proceeded to reach into one of his ammo pouches, pull out a throwing dart and cast potential energy reinforcement onto it, practically turning it from a mostly harmless projectile into a super lethal miniature missle. &quot;I still have more than enough mana to do a certain trick! Caster, remember that small detour i made to buy some throwing darts? Well, now this is when i make it worth the time!&quot; He then turned in the direction of Aida and threw the dart while casting an explosion at the back of his palm to speed up his arm. Everyone could see as the wind itself was split by the dart breaking the sound barrier with a deafening sound. A horrifying force was flying at Aida&#39;s center of mass, the dart was something akin to anti-aircraft round of huge caliber, something that could pose a great threat even to something as durable as her carbonfiber-like ink armor.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029067366384025722 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029067366384025722><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 02:26 AM">02:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His arms pushed against the rocks restraining him, not in an attempt to escape, but In frustration. At the current moment It felt like the last twenty minutes of worrying and injuries dealt to his servant were for nothing. At the very least Ā-Q&#236;ng stuck to her moral code about killing. The situation would have been far worse if one of their teammates blood was on their hands. 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t my choice to fight, I simply stumbled upon you two attacking my servant and I acted to protect her.&quot; Alexander answered Manco&#39;s question, clarifying how he got involved in the misunderstanding. &quot;As for <em><strong>you</strong></em>&quot; Alexander turned his head towards Ā-Q&#236;ng emphasizing every word directed towards her. &quot;You better have a good explanation as to why you disobeyed my orders and how this mix up happened in the first place&quot;

Alexander&#39;s attention then turned towards Mikail as he gave Lancer a speech as obvious as her talk about murder. Then again he was questioning everyone&#39;s intelligence so perhaps simple words were the key to communicating with these people. &quot;My name is Alexander Vladisnov, ruler of Macedon.&quot; The leaders composure stiffened as he spoke his title, it was almost robotic, like those very words had been taught to leave his mouth that exact way.

 Alexander&#39;s head tilted to the ground, his eyes closing. Being frustrated wasn&#39;t helping anyone, he needed to clear his mind. Now that they had teammates they could formulate a proper plan. First there was the question of who the fox and his Master were. The mystery of their teammates was solved. However it still wasn&#39;t clear if Saber was worth engaging. From what little he could tell the fox was cunning and had strength to back up his antics. Alexander still had yet to get a proper read on Aida.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029087580714717284 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029087580714717284><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 03:46 AM">03:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>.

&quot;Now that we&#39;re together it&#39;d be best to...&quot; Alexander&#39;s words stopped as Mikail readied his attack. &quot;Stop you baboon! A plan we need a plan! Does no one on this god forsaken island think things through!&quot; 

Alexander&#39;s stern composure broke in witness of Mikail&#39;s attack. Every single person he met in Alexandria acted first and thought later. The constant bombardment of people, who from his point of view, acted in illogical ways had taken a toll on him. All he could do now was watch as Mikail&#39;s attack made way towards the Alexandrians.

His previous showcase of magecraft had been more than enough to instill into her a newfound cautionary respect for his sacred arts, and so her body was awash with her own Qi the moment she felt the earth churn around her, loosening the bonds holding the constructs together as she expanded her Magic Resistance, before catching the bamboo stick that had since fallen from the sky and using it to break apart their crumbling form entirely, sparing herself and her Master of their touch. Naturally this meant leaving the raging man to his own devices, though he had long since evaded his own Servants attack as well.

It was nothing but the most ordinary of attacks, she had simply swung her pole as she had countless times before, but already her breath was ragged and her soot-stained skin awash with sweat, clearly showing the toll her injuries continued to have on her for as long as they remained. They muddled her thoughts with pain, a distraction she had to spend deliberate effort on suppressing to function somewhat normally.

“Brat?”

Thus her reaction to the Incan Servant’s address of her Master was a little delayed. Still, she found it odd that he would address Alexander as such. After all-

“But he is old. And even if you promise to leave him alone, what about my friends? I only attacked because you were trying to hurt them!”

That Reynard had tricked her. That he was the one at fault for her getting burnt.

“You…” her voice trembled as she muttered shakily, her gaze downcast to hide her features, yet it was clear that she was trying to restrain her anger, “What do you know!?”

And she failed. Her high-pitched scream was a result of both her voice cracking and her parched throat making it difficult for her to speak at all, but still she pressed on, “He is my friend! He might be a little naugthy, but he was also very nice to me when we played. Not like you. All you tried to do was hurt my Master and his. Fighting is only fun when everybody has fun, but it is different for you. Your eyes. They are cold and scary, and I hate them!”

It would appear her words fell on deaf ears however, as immediately he would go on and prepare to fire an attack at her friends yet again, attempting to continue his rampage that Ā-Q&#236;ng had considered halted. In response she turned to her Master, and though she was met with disapproval and scolding, those were the least of her worries at the moment.

“I will explain, I promise! But the bad man wants to hurt my friends again! Please, can I stop him? What if they are also on our side? If that is what he is so mad about, can we not just ask!?”

For one, her injuries greatly limited what she was capable of at the moment, and while she could still continue to fight if she really pushed herself, doing so would no doubt agitate her wounds even more. More importantly however, she was not alone anymore. She was now bound to a Master, one she had already disobeyed once, yet one she held in the highest regard nonetheless. If worst came to worst, she could always disregard what he said of course, but for now she trusted in Reynard’s ability not to fall from a simple dart being thrown his way. That, and after everything he had done for her, Ā-Q&#236;ng felt compelled not to upset Alexander further.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a second he was concerned that he needed to use some harder means to restrain him. All things considered, Mikail was being relatively reasonable but at the same time it meant that whatever he did was beyond what he nor anyone could predict and just as he finished thinking that his master proved him right. 

In a way this simple mindedness of his master was something Manco enjoyed although it was somewhat hard to keep up. The man went from stopping the fight to preaching to Ā-Q&#236;ng and to resume fighting. Seeing the reactions of both the servant and master pair brought him a nice distraction from all the pain and madness this whole situation was. 

“I am 1600 years old, everyone is a brat to me” The inca said in a more relaxed tone as he watched his master resume his attacks before letting out another sigh, The tentacle he had sent to find Mikail earlier had finally caught up with them. He picked the bottle from it and threw it to his master alongside a second one. “Drink those Mikail. It should help with both your wounds and lack of mana and try to pace yourself. I don&#39;t have any more of those.” 

He returned his gaze to the other pair, Ā-Q&#236;ng innocence was something that many may found annoying but as he learned the reason why she was acting the old king could hardly blame her. Especially as right now, when she wasn’t fighting him she looked no different than a child. Of course Manco knew she was much more, but her reasoning and the way she acted;  even him found it hard to stay mad at her and that was after she had probably fractured something inside of him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029213233409708143 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029213233409708143><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 12:05 PM">12:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Him being a good person doesn’t mean he isn’t an enemy.” the Inca gave it a go on his own to convince the young girl. “They attacked us first so that is why we are fighting back. The master confirmed to us that they were supposed to face both me and my master in the tournament but decided to take matters into their own hands So I really have no reason to stop my master but…” 

He went and gave Ā-Q&#236;ng a soft pet on the head as he took a step forward.”But well, compromise then I shall not kill either Saber nor his master but I will defeat them.” 

This compromise was due to knowing that if he didn’t say anything Ā-Q&#236;ng may get in the way and he really was in no shape for another 2 vs 1 and honestly he just wanted this fight to be over and he would be damned if he didn’t got back at Reynard for what he did to his arm. 

“Oh but dont be concerned brat” he said as he looked at Alexander, “I do have a plan”

Mana began to burn and everyone could feel something surging in Manco Capac but it was something different. it wasn’t something as violent as when Mikail tried it, it was a more gentle surge of power.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029213367371571331 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029213367371571331><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Oct-22 12:06 PM">12:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Follow the path of the Mother, she will guide you

It was her words which kept him going through that journey.Mama Ocllo, in some stories she was his wife in others his sister but regardless it was a crucial part of Manco Capac legend. To the point their fates were intertwined, one existence was linked to the other. 

Everyone would find themselves engulfed by a golden light and reality would be warped, the culinary bazaar would be no more and instead they would be transported to a different place. A city made of rock and gold, it was majestic. All the presents were witness of the glory of a city that no longer existed in this world and at the top of the highest building Manco stood proud with an arrogant grin on his face, looking down on everyone who was now inside of his domain. 

They would soon realize that the city consisted of many level each with their own share of buildings, Manco was on the very top one while Mikail and the others found themselves just one below him finally Reynard and his master would be a few more level below but they would be able to clearly see the old king and the others.

Then two potions were handed to Mikail. He was about to drink one of the potions while the Inca talked with Ā-Q&#236;ng, before suddenly stopping. &quot;So one of these is for healing and the other&#39;s for mana? I have a question. Can it affect servants? If so, give the healing one to the girl. I do not like seeing children with burn scars. Brings bad memories.&quot;

Mikail watched as Manco was chanting, and in a short while he was no longer in the bazaar, but in an ancient city. He looked around in awe before his eyes eventually pointed to the top, where his servant stood in all his glory. The mercenary couldn&#39;t hide his excitement. &quot;Hell yeah!- I mean great job, caster! &quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029399446418640917 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029399446418640917><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 12:25 AM">00:25</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She then proceeded to ridicule him even further, having no respect for his grand accomplishments. Oh, how his blood boiled! How did this petty librarian even manage to survive out there in the jungle of the real world?!

But Aida was not referring to the current fight. No, she knelt down and grabbed Reynard, preventing any form of escape as he repeatedly flicked his forehead while counting up his sins.

&quot;Ow! Ow ow! Ow ow ow!&quot; Reynard squealed with each sentence, the next worse than the last as Aida vent all her unpaid frustrations that she had suffered at the hand of the fox&#39;s schemes. She wasn&#39;t wrong either, since no matter how much Reynard insisted that he could live comfortably without her, his way of living directly impacted Aida. 

He never realized this of course.

She let him go, his forehead blistering read as she cracked her knuckles and asserted herself over the little fox. Even the shield was laughing along, praising Aida for her swift and righteous speech. The suit of armor seemed to have protected Aida not only from the outside world, but also reinforced her inner strength. She was bolder and more confident now. A hero of justice to stand up against the villainous fox.

But Reynard bore his fangs, snarling back as he instinctively thumped the ground with his feet and tail repeatedly.

<strong>&quot;You&#39;re such a pain in the tail!&quot;</strong> He shouted, no longer having the elegance nor patience to mask his intent. All that was there was bestial and human rage. 

&quot;I stole fruits and ate them because mana isn&#39;t tasty. I stole books because I was bored of staying indoors all day. I snooped at documents to immerse myself in the world, and I asked women on dates because I was lonely.&quot; He scoffed, huffed and puffed in unison. His chest pumped out, his tail&#39;s hairs raised from the tension and his ears shaking from stress.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029477764862054525 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029477764862054525><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:37 AM">05:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Tell me, what did <em>you</em> do when you left me at your cruddy home? Stay with your aunt all day? Bother her with your childish dreams of winning a Holy Grail War? Bah! As if you would! You&#39;re human as any other girl I&#39;ve seen!&quot; The fox accused. &quot;Surely you would have spent time on yourself, be it reading, watching, listening, observing...Even someone as hopeless as you goes on dates, right?!&quot;

He advanced towards Aida, with no fear for his own safety. He knew for a fact that his Master could beat him barehanded, never mind with the assistance of armor, but he didn&#39;t care. He didn&#39;t even know why he had intervened in the first place to save this ungrateful wench&#39;s life. Was it just self preservation?

&quot;If you can do all that, <strong>then why can&#39;t I?</strong> Am I just a story to be read for you? Something to be consumed, disposed of and returned to the library, so that the cycle can repeat anew?&quot; His eyes turned into slits, no different than that of a wild beast alerted to prey. &quot;I am <strong>NOT</strong> a convenience! I am <strong>NOT</strong> your tool.&quot;

His words were so loud and seeped with discontent that they echoed nicely through Aida&#39;s armor. The vibrations almost gave her palpitations as even the jellyfish was perturbed. Maybe she should have chosen her words more wisely, since Reynard seemed to be absolutely furious! Had she already lost control of her Servant again?

&quot;...Yes, you&#39;ve been slacking. You did so the moment you chose to ignore me. Did those accursed stories of yours ever warn you to never let your eyes off a fox? Bah.&quot; Reynard spat out hot air, sighing as the tension from earlier dissolved. &quot;You want to try harder? Good. <em>Prove it.&quot;</em> 

He extended his arm, much to Aida&#39;s shock.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029477963508482058 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029477963508482058><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:37 AM">05:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I&#39;m dead anyway with you gone. The same applies to you.

I know that you don&#39;t look the part. In fact, I&#39;d say you look properly <em>horrendous</em>, but-&quot;

<em>&quot;Can I trust you to be my knight in shining armor?&quot;</em>

He held her blackened hands and clenched them tightly, before giving her a look that was neither pleading nor demanding. It was serene, like that of a true child. He had placed all of his faith in her because there was no point in second guessing himself now. This was the face of an honest fox.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029477984144474185 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029477984144474185><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:37 AM">05:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s the unequivocal truth for man and beast, and in the absence of such freedom, everyone ends up disappointed, frustrated, and filled with anger.

Reynard was filled with that anger. Never before had he been so misunderstood, to the point where every word and action he performed had been turned against him regardless of his true intentions. Perhaps it was a part of the natural camouflage of being a fox, as it was in his nature to be capricious and scheming. 

After all, a fox did not <em>beg</em>. 

He would rather die than speak his heart. He would rather blame others for his feelings than confront it himself. He would rather drag everyone down his path than accept their right to be. He was Reynard, it was in his blood to oppose the authorities. If <em>he</em> didn&#39;t stand up for himself in this crooked relationship of Master and Servant, then who will?

Only that it had backfired stupendously. His lackadaisical attitude and twisted words had met their worst match in the world&#39;s most gullible Master, who also happened to be well-read on his legend. The result was devastating. No matter what he said or did, his actions would be met with such scrutiny and interpreted as some form of malevolence. He had tried to be coy, to fake cooperativeness, to slander, ridicule, and blackmail, but nothing had gotten through that thick skull of his Master. He might as well be banging his head on a slab of granite, only that he was too dignified to do so. 

...Or was he?

It seemed that even a fox had a limit to the amount of slander they could take, despite being a master of the craft themselves. As Aida charged him with crime after petty crime, Reynard finally exploded into a tantrum which he hadn&#39;t had for as long as he could remember. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029478066247958528 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029478066247958528><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:38 AM">05:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And his violent spat took his Master by shock. Of course, this wouldn&#39;t be the first time she&#39;d been subjected to his barbed words, and they stung her just as much as they had the first time they had met. But the more Reynard ranted, the more his rage seemed to be directed inwardly, towards himself. The topics became more granular as the fox went on a tirade on the unfair treatment he&#39;d received as a Servant. Perhaps, just perhaps, his short escapade with another kid-sized Servant had opened his eyes to how a Master-Servant relationship could&#39;ve been...

But he didn&#39;t <em>really</em> want that, did he? He didn&#39;t relish being in charge, nor was he suited to playing a sycophant. No, he was much more at ease being his own boss! And look at where that had landed him!

Reduced to nothing more than a <strong>character trope!</strong>

<em>&#39;Am I just a story to be read for you?!&#39;</em>

<em>Why, yes.</em> Aida thought instinctively. <em>What else?</em> She was tempted to add, but couldn&#39;t bring herself to speak. Reynard was doing something quite uncharacteristic, and she wasn&#39;t quite sure how to handle the situation. For once, Reynard&#39;s attacks hadn&#39;t homed in on her &#39;silly&#39; aspirations or her aptitude as a Master. He talked about the days he&#39;d spent alone, trying to fit into the new world and find a place for himself with his own research. 

It reminded Aida of the days she&#39;d suffered after her parents had left her &#39;stranded&#39; in Alexandria. It wasn&#39;t nearly as bad back then, as she had her auntie for guidance. But Reynard had nothing. He had nothing to fall back on besides his own survival instincts. And what was a fox if they didn&#39;t immediately resort to slacking, stealing, and swindling?

It had all been so painfully obvious. But Aida hadn&#39;t realized. How could someone who had lived such a sheltered life realize just how hard it was for someone with nothing to survive in the world? 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029478096602148865 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029478096602148865><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:38 AM">05:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The realization of her thoughtlessness hit her like a bucket of icy cold water. &#39;Goodness,&#39; she breathed, her eyes wide and her hands flying to cover her mouth. &#39;I shouldn&#39;t have let you wander off on your own.&#39;

It all made so much sense. The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree. Even though Reynard had been plucked right out of a storybook, he still possessed sentience and autonomy. Why <em>couldn&#39;t</em> she have changed him for the better? If she could bind him with a Command Seal, then she must be able to do the same with words and a certain amount of wit!

&#39;I didn&#39;t realize,&#39; she continued to stare at the fox as if seeing him for the first time. &#39;I didn&#39;t realize that <em>you</em> didn&#39;t know it&#39;s bad to litter! Because trashcans never existed in any of your stories!&#39; 

Wait...

&#39;Of course! How could you possibly know how libraries worked? Your storybooks never mentioned one, let alone tell you that you can simply borrow them from the front desk!&#39;

Wait just one minute...

&#39;And the dog ears! And the dates! You never knew about bookmarks, and you don&#39;t know anything about work shifts and lunch breaks. It&#39;s all coming together!&#39; Aida clasped her hands together as a figurative lightbulb flashed over her hand. She directed her gaze to Reynard, this time not with scorn, but with sympathy. She was looking at Reynard...

...like he was a little baby who couldn&#39;t tell right from wrong.

&#39;I&#39;ll fix you,&#39; she said resolutely. &#39;I take responsibility. <em>Full</em> responsibility. My neglect has led you astray. <strong>But no more!</strong>&#39; She grabbed Reynard&#39;s charred hands in a vice grip, almost crushing his fingers.

&#39;I&#39;m going to show you just how capable I am!&#39; Aida shook the fox&#39;s hands fervently, as if they were penning a new contract on the spot. &#39;Auntie doesn&#39;t see any value in our magecraft, but I&#39;m going to prove her wrong. I&#39;m going to prove to <em>you</em> that you can always count on me for guidance!&#39;

As a loud <em><strong>BANG!</strong></em> rang out in the distance, the rattles of the shield increased, as the sentient familiar within the shield sensed the impeding danger from the enemy it had once failed to intercept.

Just like Aida, it swore to not make the same mistake twice.

Aida closed her fingers on the shield, and in one fluid motion that she would definitely <em>not</em> have pulled off on her own, she propped it up on the ground and threw her entire weight behind it. 

&#39;My armor might not be very shiny, but at least I&#39;ll still get to be a knight!&#39; She shouted as Mikail&#39;s bullet zipped towards them, unaware that it had been engineered to pack the force of a miniature missile.

And then it all came crashing down.

&quot;Of course my stories wouldn&#39;t have trash cans. What do you m-&quot; She kept going, tossing out the bold claim that the fox was so ignorant he had never even heard of a library before.

It didn&#39;t stop there of course, as she listed out the various reasons that contributed to Reynard&#39;s &#39;ignorance&#39;. Her attitude towards him was no longer that of scorn and bias, but sympathy and piety. If anything, Reynard was just a little cub! Someone she should have protected from day one. Ah, how could she have failed him!

The fox was incredulous. <em>&quot;How did I manage,&quot;</em> He thought to himself, dozing off as Aida grabbed his hands and waved them around, promising to do better and inspire him to be a good boy™️.

<em><strong>&quot;to be summoned by such a fool!&quot;</strong></em> He was almost frothing at the mouth from rage. This far more ridiculous than any fairy tale he had experienced. When people hated him, they were clear in their intent. Likewise, when people liked him, they would make it apparent. But Aida. This despicable Aida. She was pampering him with promises and reassurances...without even understanding what he truly meant!

<em><strong>How could someone be so kind yet so brainless at the same time?!?</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029478246309433364 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029478246309433364><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:39 AM">05:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;You complete imbecile!&quot;</em> Reynard cursed at her as she shook his hands with such force that he couldn&#39;t even resist the shake. <em>&quot;I&#39;ll use you up like a wet rag and toss you into the nearest bin once I&#39;m done. Mark my words!&quot;</em> He declared, puffing his cheeks out as his tail shook with intense fury. How <em>dare</em> she give him that patronizing look of needing help?! If anything, it was <em>her</em> who needed his help!

&quot;Listen now you little-&quot;

<em>BANG!</em> 

The fox was more than ready to give his Master a stern talking to, until the noise of Mikhail&#39;s sonic dart snapped him back to reality. Aida and him were still locked into a fight between Masters and Servants, meaning that any disagreements could be left till later.

To his surprise, he didn&#39;t even get the chance to act first. Aida had already headed straight for the projectile, determined to live up to Reynard&#39;s expectations. He was irate: How <em>dare</em> that fool risk her life for someone she didn&#39;t even know at all? It drove him mad, to say the least.

&quot;You idiot! Get out of the way!&quot; Reynard shouted, attempting to shield her himself, but to no avail.

<strong>CLANG!</strong>

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

He felt a gust of air right next to his ear. It whizzed past his hair, disappearing into nothingness. He turned back to the front and observed the scene: Aida was still intact in one piece, but the shield, not so much. The noise of shattered shells filled the battlefield as a large crack appeared around the hole where the shield had been punctured. Whatever was behind that dart&#39;s momentum, it was huge. Half of the shield was practically gone by now, most of it cracked and damaged.

Reynard sighed with relief. He didn&#39;t show it, but he was glad that Aida was safe. He couldn&#39;t have lived with the shame otherwise, after that pathetically sappy speech of his from earlier. Not to mention, he needed her alive if he meant to show how much of a complete buffoon she was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029478325040722031 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029478325040722031><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 05:39 AM">05:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; He approached Aida, tapping at her shoulder, before noticing the shield squirm. The jellyfish was still alive, albeit barely clinging to life. Even though Reynard never liked the creature, it was hard to not admire its determination to live. No, even more, it would be disgraceful to not acknowledge the shield&#39;s desire to <strong>protect.</strong> It was its role as a familiar after all, no different than that of a side character in a book.

Reynard pondered on that thought for a second, before noticing that the ground around him appeared different. The level they were at was no longer the same, with the fox feeling like he had sunk several feet lower. He stared in front of him and realized that Mikhail was no longer there. He looked above and noticed a scorching sun, followed by golden buildings, a luxurious palace and Manco towering above all.

&quot;This isn&#39;t something native to Alexandria, is it?&quot; Reynard asked, rubbing his eyes in case he was hallucinating something. &quot;Great. Means they are bringing out the big guns.&quot; He bit his thumb in frustration.

&quot;C&#39;mon, prepare yourself! Surely they don&#39;t plan on just standing and looking down on us menacingly!&quot; He tapped Aida repeatedly.

Even though he had no clue about what Manco’s plan was, he was just glad to see someone else thinking things through. For this, he would allow the nickname ‘brat’ for the moment. It would be a waste of time to argue about titles, especially when they were still mid-combat. 

Still nudging against his restraints, Alexander watched as Mikail’s attack sped forward in the enemy&#39;s direction. The two had been caught up in conversation, yet their reaction was just fast enough. Aida acted quickly to subdue the blast with her shield, protecting her servant at all costs. From what little he observed, Alexander could tell that the librarian lacked the same amount of combat experience as Mikail and him. Whatever Aida was missing in experience, though, she certainly made up with determination. Taking action to protect something valuable to you is an admirable cause that Alexander could get behind. 

Mikail&#39;s attack was followed up by Caster’s chanting. Alexander waited in anticipation to see this so-called plan. Whatever Manco was doing, it needed to help get them out of this fight. The odds weren&#39;t stacked against Alexander; in fact, it was the opposite with the newly realized alliance. Alexander’s worries were about the sustained injuries of his servant. Lancer had been severely burned and for seemingly nothing. For this reason, he eagerly wanted out of the fight. Further, risking his servant’s safety in any way wasn&#39;t worth it.

Alexander&#39;s hands would stretch out as his bindings were released, his shotgun raising to his side in a ready position. The golden light had warped reality around everyone, a vast golden city pushing past the horizon. In front of Alexander was something from a history book, a beautiful and powerful kingdom. The city was form before the flood, something the monarch never thought he’d get to witness. He couldn&#39;t help but get just the slightest bit giddy inside as he realized</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029641083124207676 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029641083124207676><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Oct-22 04:26 PM">16:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>what exactly he was witnessing.

Containing his excitement, Alexander turned to Ā-Q&#236;ng, addressing her request. “No, just because they are your friends does not mean they are your ally; as a warrior, you should know this well” As Alexander spoke, he would bend down to Lancer’s eye level, making sure to be as direct as possible. “Our teammate has promised not to kill them. After the fight, we can talk to your friends if they&#39;re willing to make peace with us. But until then, you are not to interfere with our Allies. You may abstain from fighting, and you may help us win, but nothing else. Is that understood?”

Alexander would stand up tall after his conversation with Ā-Q&#236;ng. He turned to face the enemy readying himself for combat if needed. He wouldn&#39;t make any quick movements. Instead, he would wait to see what Manco did. In an ideal world, this would all be over very soon.

“That is older than Grandpa White…” she whispered mostly to herself, her wonder cut short by the soft head-pat that ruffled her unruly hair as her fellow Servant gave his word not to use lethal means against her friends and simply fight them in the capacity as competitors competing in the same War.

&quot;Ok, I will trust you. And... I am sorry for thinking you were a bad person...&quot;

The revelation that Reynard and his Master were the initiators of the conflict was also news to her, seeing as she had only arrived in time to see fireballs being flung at them, but with no way to confirm the truth either way she simply kept silent and allowed herself to be appeased by her new ally’s reassurances. He was not a bad guy. In fact he was actually quite nice. Though they had traded crippling wounds, neither side seemed to have swung their weapons with malice, ensuring that their injuries were nothing more than the unintended casualties one would expect from the battlefield, and not efforts to maim and kill.
In other words he was a friend, she could tell as much from his gentle touch, but the same could not be said for his Master.

It was clear that he had regained his presence of mind, evident by his composed speech, though the brutality and wrath of his earlier actions had left a deep impression on Ā-Q&#236;ng nonetheless. Even a beast simply followed its own instincts to feed and protect its young, but this man had chosen to enact violence deliberately and willfully. For that alone Ā-Q&#236;ng shirked the offer of his unfamiliar potion with a disapproving glare.

One was raised in idyllic tranquility, isolated from the world’s woes in a solitary mountain hut, tending to goats and surrounded by the breath of nature, silent yet strong.
The other’s childhood was drenched in blood, his innocence robbed by the assassination of his father, and in his effort to enact vengeance, he had lost himself to his wrath and begun to feed the bottomless pit of his soul even with the flesh of those unrelated to the fall of his house.

Ā-Q&#236;ng had avoided the horrors of war, privileged enough to look down on the act of warfare as a waste of time seemingly without understanding the gravity of such an endeavor.
Mikail was formed into the man he was today precisely by those horrors, and thus did not have the luxury to enjoy the simple pleasures of a good fight as he only cared about the result, victory or death, ignoring the joy of the journey leading to said result.

From a rational perspective, the latter was the correct approach. Conflict and war should not be celebrated, let alone enjoyed, and yet Ā-Q&#236;ng’s knowledge of fighting was limited to her playtime sessions with Grandpa White and her occasional trouncing of the local swordsmen.
It was like a child being told that too much sugar was bad for them.
They simply lacked the hindsight to comprehend the reason as to why since they lived in a world that did not extend far beyond their lacking years. If Ā-Q&#236;ng enjoyed the thrill of the fight and Mikial did not, then to her, it was clearly him at fault for starting them improperly. He set out to kill and hurt. He was mean. It would go without saying that he would only leave death in his wake, and so the words of such a man would mean nothing to Ā-Q&#236;ng.

“Eh?”

His command was strict and absolute, but it also was quite sensible. It just wasn’t the response she had expected.
Being ordered to stand down and leave her friends to fight their new allies alone was a difficult order to accept, but she was left with no choice but to obey. She trusted in Reynard’s strength, and Caster had also promised her not to use lethal force. That and she still felt the guilt of disobeying him previously, not to mention the current state of her body.

With her Master’s well-being now secured and the rush of urgency passed, her body suddenly released all its tension all at once.

Her knees wobbled as her feet’s purchase on the ground became unsteady, no doubt aided by the unexpected shift in landscape as the world itself was molded into a mighty kingdom of old, though Ā-Q&#236;ng had long since lost the ability to appreciate this wondrous sight.
Falling feebly to the ground as her legs finally gave out, she somehow supported herself with her remaining arm to keep her body from toppling over completely, the fatigue and weight of her injuries finally catching up to her as the periphery of her vision started to blur and lose color. She was yet able to retain her consciousness however, determined to watch over the battle and make sure that her allies kept their word, but with her body now bereft of strength, it was unlikely that she could do much to stop them anyway.

“...I understand,” she eventually mumbled, reluctantly agreeing to her Master’s command.

&quot;Was I wrong?&quot; Ā-Q&#236;ng asked quietly after letting the silence between them sit for a short moment, &quot;Was it wrong for me to want to help my friend?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 12:45 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This domain didn’t heal his wounds either nor really increased his power. So in theory his magecraft should barely be enough to leave a scratch on Reynard if his only weapon was his magecraft of course.

“Time to repel the invaders” He said as he moved his good arm. More chants answered his words as buildings began to crumble but they didn’t just break down and disappear but instead they remnants of the buildings transformed into something else this time 2 gigantic arms reached for Reynard and Aida. 

Such a simple display was enough to show everyone present how this world worked. This world, this city was an extension of Manco Capac&#39;s will,the city was not a temple nor just a memory for this old king. This city was his legacy, the symbol of him becoming a hero in the eyes of its people. So at its command the city would shape shift and attack the enemies, the whole city was a weapon. 

Still the original problem remains, how to manage to make Reynard submit alongside his master as even if the whole city was a weapon his magic resistance would just let him withstand most of the attacks. At the same time Manco’s ammunition was not limitless, each attack needed the destruction of a building for it to start and when all the buildings were gone the world would collapse.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029773698217017354 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029773698217017354><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 01:13 AM">01:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yet the monarch had already thought of a solution, the gigantic and slow hands weren&#39;t meant to do anything. They needed to distract them from what he had planned, he raised his hand into the air and more than half of the remaining buildings also disappeared but their rubble did not remain in the ground. They joined together forming boulders as they began to rise into the sky.

“Lets test how big is your and your master&#39;s resistance to magic” He said in a cold voice as he lowered his arm.

The boulders would then fall, like meteors they would descend with strength and power aimed at Reynard and Aida with the intent to crush them. Or normally that would be the case, he had made a promise with the little girl and as a king he couldn&#39;t break his work even if the situations demanded it. He spread the meteors a bit more than normal, giving the master and servant pair an actual chance at surviving. Then again it would also depend on how Reynard and Aida decided to fight back but that was no longer the emperor&#39;s problem as he turned his back at them as the first boulders crashed into the ground.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This is better than coffee. Not only in taste, but in effect too.&quot; When he saw Ā-Q&#236;ng fall to the ground, he took the other potion and placed it on the ground near her. 

&quot;Take the healing potion, you&#39;ll feel better. My broken ribs can wait.&quot; Then after a second he realized that Ā-Q&#236;ng will probably not accept anything from him out of spite, so he added some more words to convince her. &quot;It&#39;s Caster&#39;s potion by the way, so consider this to be a gift from him.&quot;

Then Mikail reached into his ammo pouch and pulled out another dart. He aimed at Aida once again and was about to cast potential energy reinforcement, but then he saw Manco summon enormous rocky arms and create something that was practically a meteor shower, reminding him of his servant&#39;s existence and breaking his concentration. So he stopped and said something to himself. &quot;That woman won&#39;t survive another dart right now if the fox has no more tricks.&quot; 

After that he simply placed the dart back into his ammo pouch and sat down on the ground. &quot;My long range weapons are too lethal.

The shockwave from Mikail&#39;s enhanced dart actually rolled her along the ground a bit, like a balled-up hedgehog. Aida&#39;s face was caked in sand and dust, which she hastily wiped with the back of her armored hand, but to no avail. Arguably, it only made the situation worse: what she needed was a clean towel, and the closest thing to that would be...

A chill ran down Reynard&#39;s spine as he felt a tug on his bushy tail.

Meanwhile, in her blind search for something soft and fluffy, Aida had closed her hands around what felt like a piece of fabric. That&#39;s got to be Reynard&#39;s cloak. It wasn&#39;t ideal, but it would have to do! 

&#39;What do you have to say to that, Reynard?&#39; She continued to prod Reynard with a prideful joy as she used his tail like a windshield wiper, making sure to pay extra attention to her precious glasses. &#39;Not too shabby for a bookworm now, is it?&#39;

She cracked open her eyes. Then immediately wished she hadn&#39;t.

&#39;...&#39;

Aida stared blankly at the lump of orange fur in her hand. For a moment, it felt as if she was going to faint. She opened her mouth and quickly closed it, then opened right back up as her eyes darted around herself, a classic diversion tactic as she looked for something else to mention.

Thankfully, she didn&#39;t have to try very hard.

&#39;Where are we?&#39;

Her question all but confirmed Reynard&#39;s suspicion. If Aida didn&#39;t recognize the landscape, then surely it couldn&#39;t have belonged to Alexandria. The librarian stared in awe at the sprawling city. It looked ancient, something straight out of a history book, thought she couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on the civilization. Cathy might have a better idea, or even someone in the archives at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-great-library</span>. If only she could ask them now!

It was difficult to tear her eyes away from him, as if his very presence demanded worship. There was no doubt about it: he had to be the one responsible! 

But even more pressing was the question: <em>how?</em> 

&#39;Alexandria is huge. You can&#39;t just terraform an entire city.&#39; Aida mumbled, question after question bubbling up inside her. &#39;Have we been teleported?&#39; She racked her brains as she tried to recall Servants who were capable of recreating entire landscapes. &#39;Illusions?&#39; She pinched her cheeks, then winced in pain. &#39;A reality marble? Bounded field?&#39;

The possibilities were endless. But all of them seemed to lead to only one outcome, and it would not be in her or Reynard&#39;s favor.

&#39;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice,&#39; the librarian grimaced. &#39;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s <em>just</em> standing there to look menacing.&#39; 

As she said this, a sizeable number of buildings vanished into thin air. Aida didn&#39;t even have to guess where they had disappeared off to, as the sky suddenly seemed to collapse. Aida raised her head with a sinking feeling as a thick, almost impenetrable darkness fell from the sky in a form of a meteor shower. The rock hands Manco had conjured inevitably failed at their jobs: what spectacle would be grand enough to tear anyone&#39;s attention away from a hail of boulders raining over their heads?!

The broken ink shield wobbled feebly at Aida&#39;s feet. Even in its worst possible shape, the familiar was still intent on protecting its master, only that-

&#39;I can&#39;t prepare for that.&#39;

Every vestige of color seemed to have bleached out of Aida&#39;s face. Whether it was due to dread, blood loss, or a mixture of both remained to be seen, but her pale skin almost looked harrowing against the darkened sky.

Aida cradled it in her arms. &#39;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to do much against a meteor shower,&#39; she tried to reason with her familiar-turned-shield, but that only seemed to agitate it more. In fact, even her armor seemed to be in protest, as the visor on her helmet trembled slightly, apparently unable to stomach this affront to its strength! What did Aida know?! It had already protected her against bullets and darts, surely it could take on a meteor or a few dozens!

Surely!

&#39;Come on! Don&#39;t you think <em>I</em> would have a better grasp on your toughness? I made you!&#39; Aida groaned, as the clamoring of her visor grew louder. It seemed that her familiar and Reynard finally found something in common: annoying their Master to no end when they failed to get what they wanted. To free herself from all the noise echoing in her skull <em>and</em> to silence her familiar for the time being, Aida stripped the helmet from her head, undoing the woven mesh and pulling them back into threads.

&#39;Fine, <em>fine!</em>&#39; She said out of exasperation as she fed the threads into the shield to mend the hole left behind by the mercenary&#39;s dart. &#39;Now I&#39;ve got an umbrella, just in time for rain!&#39; She held the shield over her and Reynard&#39;s head in an overly dramatic manner. &#39;There, happy now?&#39; She huffed.

Oh, if only her familiar could comprehend sarcasm. The shield hummed happily, eager to take on the impossible challenge. The familiar and the master were truly two peas in a pod...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029898729936928888 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029898729936928888><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:29 AM">09:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was called Ryu Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea. His power was immense, for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small.

But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone. At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful. So he decided to take a wife....</code>
<strong>&quot;Aida!&quot;</strong> Reynard shouted, watching the deceptively strong dart manage to push her all the way behind him. She was curled up like a donut, landing face first on the golden land&#39;s floor. Her shield was broken and her position was rather undignified.

The fox hurried over, feeling somewhat worried for the first time. It&#39;s not like he cared, but to lose his Master right after they had promised to watch each others&#39; backs would have been downright insulting to his pride.

He couldn&#39;t help but smile once Aida reaffirmed that she was fine. In her own, clumsy manner of course.

&quot;Good. You&#39;d be quite the terrible knight if you left me alone like this.&quot; He turned around as he spat out a joke at her expense. Karmic justice caught up to him as he felt something tug at his tail, feeling his spine freeze solid from the shock.

&quot;What are you-&quot;

He felt excruciating pain from his behind, completely at Aida&#39;s mercy as the librarian casually used her Servant&#39;s tail as a rag. She wiped her face, her chin, some bits of her armor, her glasses especially! To think that Reynard&#39;s cloak was so warm and fuzzy...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029898835897622539 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029898835897622539><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:30 AM">09:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;NO! PLEASE STOP! NOT THERE! AAAAAGHHHH!&quot;</em>

The fox was so distraught by this pain that it almost morphed into pleasure, as his face contorted into a myriad of intense expressions that had him gasp and pant all over. It was only over once Aida opened her eyes, releasing her hold as she noticed a chunk of red fur all over her hand and body. She seemed to be about as shocked as Reynard was.

He would normally have choice words for her. Actions as well, but the two of them agreed that they didn&#39;t have time to scream at each other over this little incident. After all, they were currently in the city of gold, ruled by Manco Capaq himself.
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">...Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily. They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral Palace.

...Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed. In spite of all the nurses’ assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse.

“I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jelly fish). He is certainly ugly to look at, but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one.”

&quot;Are you even a magus? Of course we&#39;re in a Reality Marble.&quot; Reynard scoffed at Aida&#39;s theories, albeit she eventually came to the right conclusion. &quot;If even I can&#39;t terraform Alexandria in my image, what makes you think <em>he</em> can?&quot; Flawless logic.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029898904109596712 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029898904109596712><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:30 AM">09:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But what&#39;s worse is that the two&#39;s assumption of Manco not putting up this city for show was correct. Soon, two gigantic arms emerged from the vast metropolis in front of them, as if aiming to crush them. This turned out to be incorrect, for the attack they were dealing with was on a far massive scale. The bright, golden sky morphed into a dark, ominous night. The only source of light was the climax of Manco&#39;s attack: A golden meteor shower, aiming to rain on Aida and Reynard in an effort to bury them alive in the furious flames.

Reynard didn&#39;t mutter a word, for his eyes were cowering in fear at the bright spectacle in front of him. This was too much. This went far beyond any challenge that he had encountered in his fairly tales. Isengrim the wolf? The lion king of the forest? All child&#39;s play compared to the very real danger of a meteor shower crushing him to death.

<em>&quot;I can&#39;t prepare for that.&quot;</em>

Had the shield not had a will of its own, one could be sure that a <em>clang</em> would have been heard right there. Aida had lost all hopes of winning, to the point she was only holding the shield because it was pestering her to keep trying. Despite its attempts to convince her, Aida was but a realist: She knew for a fact that her shield and armor would offer no protection whatsoever towards the shower.

But the shield refused to break.

Reynard stared at that scene in awe. How could that jellyfish be such a dunce? Like master, like servant? That was the only logic he could think of, yet Aida was being far wiser than her own creation now. Even stupidity had its limits, yet the jellyfish seemed to be <em>beyond</em> stupid.

<em>&quot;What a worthless piece of ju-&quot;</em>

And yet, Reynard felt sick anytime he mocked the creature. 

<em>&quot;You won&#39;t save your Master. You will die with-&quot;</em>

He wanted to puke anytime his mind called the shield an idiot. Not even <em>he</em> could put that shield down. In such a hopeless situation, it took guts to have even a single sliver of hope.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029898967158374450 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029898967158374450><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:30 AM">09:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>How could he let a mere jellyfish upstage him?!</strong>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The Dragon King’s wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished. The punishment was a horrible one. All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks.

The poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the Dragon King’s order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness.

From this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King’s sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan.

&quot;That won&#39;t be enough!&quot; Reynard screamed, placing his hand on the now reformed shield. Aida had done wonders to fix it by sacrificing her helm, but if she had barely survived Mikhail&#39;s projectile from earlier, how did she expect to survive an entire meteor shower?

But Reynard had a plan. He knew it in his heart that it was possible, so long as he believed in it...and was capable of selling that belief to others.

&quot;Your jellyfish is a really annoying piece of work, you know that?&quot; He cast Aida a judgmental glare, before almost wrestling the shield out of her hands with how roughly he was treating it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029899058040557608 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029899058040557608><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:31 AM">09:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Hey, jackass. You want to help your Master out? You really want to?&quot; He asked, staring it down. He knew that it and him had gotten off on the wrong foot, but if they could not get past the initial pettiness, they might as well be dead already.

There was a moment of silence, but, with no other options in sight, the jellyfish shield nodded in agreement with a slight nudge.

&quot;Good.&quot; The fox smirked, tapping the shield. &quot;Then, do as I, and follow your instincts.&quot; The Saber took out his crayon, its pointy tip illuminating the darkened night that surrounded them all. It was a weapon meant to cleave and destroy, but it was impossible for him to slice down so many meteors at once.

Instead, he would use it to protect.

&quot;Master, apologies if I suck you dry.&quot; He said with a laugh, not caring in the slightest if Aida felt drained by the time he was done. If anything, she should be praising him regardless for being the one risking his neck out here!

<strong>&quot;Crayon of Malpertuis!&quot;</strong>

He shouted, before proceeding to stab the shield with his crayon. One would think that the shield would break, but it did not.

<em>It grew bigger.</em>

The image of a story flashing right into the familiar&#39;s eyes. The cruel fate of the jellyfish, removed from his original, glorious form and reduced to the boneless wreck that he was today.

<strong>&quot;Is this really the life you want?&quot;</strong> Reynard&#39;s voice echoed in that empty abyss. <strong>&quot;Are you going to let a fairy tale dictate your way of living?&quot;</strong>

The jellyfish&#39;s water boiled. It wiggled around its limbs anxiously, before noticing a slight pink tinge in them. They felt heavier, sturdier, robust. No longer was their body only water, but <em>blood</em> as well.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029899095235629137 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029899095235629137><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:31 AM">09:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;If you are fond of that way of life, then you have no reason to complain.&quot;</strong> The fox judged from afar, closing his eyes and crossing his arms disapprovingly. He then slowly slid one eyelid up, giving the jellyfish a lazy stare.

<strong>&quot;But if you want to break the rules. If you want to protect your Master...&quot;</strong>

Waves emerged from that empty abyss, swallowing the jellyfish and Reynard whole. The Dragon King had unleashed his terrifying attack: A tsunami so vast and wide that it was comparable to a meteor shower!

But the jellyfish was no longer the meek and timid blob from earlier. No, he had been reborn as <strong>Kurage</strong>, the proud tortoise-crab-lobster-angler-turtle from years old! His head was a gigantic shell, his stretchy limbs put both crabs and spiders to shame, his carapace was durable enough to protect his dear Aida. His true form had resurfaced after laying dormant for 5,000 years!

...

Aida could only watch in disbelief as her shield morphed beyond what she had expected. Whatever Reynard had inserted into her familiar with that crayon had pumped up its mana capabilities beyond what she could ever hope to control. In fact, her own mana reserves started to plummet once the fox had finished casting.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029899290467897365 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029899290467897365><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 09:32 AM">09:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Kurage was now beautiful: A gigantic shield that could rival a building in terms of height and a street in terms of width. Its head had morphed into the combination of a crab&#39;s carapace and a tortoise&#39;s shell, while its limbs were now noodly strings of death as they stabbed Manco&#39;s floating arms and dragged them down to the meteor shower. The jellyfish planned on taking them on all at once!

Could Manco have foreseen this? Could Ā-Q&#236;ng or Mikhail have? No, this was something only possible due to Reynard&#39;s thorough studying of fairy tales in the past two weeks. The jellyfish tale had stuck with him, due to how much he could relate to the monkey character in it, but to see him root for the character he loathed the most...

&quot;Go for it, crabhead!&quot; Reynard shouted, laughing at the utterly ridiculous scene in front of him. It was a gambit to transfer his crayon&#39;s power over to Aida&#39;s familiar, since it would have backfired if his target had no connection to fairy tales whatsoever. It was only due to Aida&#39;s own love for stories, to the point she had shaped familiars in their image, that this Noble Phantasm was able to manifest itself in such a form.

It was a combined effort, but of course, in Reynard&#39;s eyes, it was all <strong>him!</strong>

&quot;If it is a Dragon King you seek to destroy, then you must become a <strong>Jellyfish King!&quot;</strong> At this point, one couldn&#39;t tell if Reynard was speaking nonsense or not. &quot;Therefore, I order you, Kurage, <em>to win!&quot;</em> 

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Perhaps he had timed his lines perfectly, or perhaps his words had truly resonated with the jellyfish. Either way, an explosion occurred as the full brunt of the meteors reached their target. The blackened night now erupted in a beautiful sparkle of fireworks and exploding rocks.

<em><strong>BOOM!!!</strong></em>

The energy was so potent that even Manco&#39;s Noble Phantasm was struggling to remain stable. It hadn&#39;t been destroyed, more so constipated by the amount of mana in the air caused by the struggle between the two titans. Smoke also surrounded the scene, since the impact had been very real. When they regained their bearings, they noticed that most of the ground had been destroyed, along with scathing damage to the nearby golden buildings.

&quot;Achoo!&quot; Reynard sneezed, breaking into a coughing fit as he could barely see Aida around in all that smog, let alone his opponents. He stumbled around in random directions, hoping to find his Master, before eventually coming across a shadowed figure.

<em>crack...crack-</em>

There was no clear victor, but it was obvious who had the superior attack. Right below Aida&#39;s feet, one could find several shards belonging to her shield, which had now broken into a million tiny pieces. Aida herself was also worse for wear, half of her right arm being exposed. It seemed that the armor had also been destroyed in the impact, followed by some scratches and bruises across Aida&#39;s face. Judging by the damage on the shield, had Reynard not intervened to assist his Master...

<strong>...Both of them would have likely died.</strong>

 Reynard could not judge the entire damage yet, for Aida was still covered in smoke. In fact, he was more focused on the opponents, who had finally shown themselves as the dust cleared.

&quot;Crap.&quot; Reynard blurted out, sweating bullets. &quot;Master, we need to get out of here. Right now, I may add!&quot; He glared at her, since his first response to frustration and fear was taking it out on someone else. &quot;What are you standing around for?! I did my best, but it wasn&#39;t enough!&quot;

Anyone seeing his golden meteors would assume he was going for the kill, but that was far from the truth. As no matter how much time,how many years or decades even there was something that Manco Capac would never lose. His faith, his faith was not directed at the gods, while he appreciated  they help and respected their efforts and blessings his love and admiration was mainly towards his people.

He believed in others, he died believing that his son and his people would continue to grow and progress even without him, after all he wasn’t really that special. His miracle was the product of his own effort and his will for something better, it was something anyone could do. So even now he believed that if someone like him was able to command this power the one who would stand in front of him was more than ready to take it. 

And just faith was proven right, just like he had struggle to the very end trying to stop Reynard previous attack the fox king was now doing the same. Feeling the clashes of power the king turned and seeing how his enemies were aiming to just resist with all they had it brought a smile to his face. 

“Amusing, really amusing Saber!!” He began to laugh as his meteors clashed against the tsunami conjured by Saber and his master. Nature itself was fighting inside of his world and the sight of it was exhilarating and the monarch began to laugh as the two powers crashed. He erected a wall to protect the rest of the group from the aftermath of the clash.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1029951619854499850 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1029951619854499850><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Oct-22 01:00 PM">13:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Devastation had descended upon his constructed world, as the attack ended Manco wondered for a second if when the last of his descendants saw the empire crumble he also saw a similar sight. But more than that he could see them, still looking down on them he could see that both Reynard and Aida had survived his attack and while that alone was worthy of praise it also meant Manco was running out of options. 

He was still standing purely on his own will, aiming to keep his imagine as the king he was yet the same could be applied to his enemies. The shield they had used had been broken into pieces, the master was laying on the ground no doubt Saber defense probably drain most of her mana. The rock platform where he was standing move and lowered himself to be just a few meters away from Saber. 

“I could finish you off, you can kill me but I can probably kill you master before that. Meanwhile my master will remain safe. It would stupid to not do it.” as he said that he turn around. “Yet I made a promise, that is why I&#39;m giving you this chance right now. I won Saber, now leave” 

As he finished saying that the rock platform began to carry him away as the world around everyone began to crumble. There was a hint of regret in Manco as he knew that what he had done was foolish but even more foolish would be to break his word as breaking it would mean he was no longer worthy of being a king. Still it was also interesting, both Saber and his master, even if Aida’s actions were fueled by recklessness her very way of seeking her own path reminded the king why he believed in humanity. He was curious, would her potential be squashed by her own hand or she would be able to rise beyond it. 

“Oh and thanks for the food samples” he said as he waved his good arm as another light transported them to the real world. It was now on Saber hand take the chance to leave or not.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would move his shotgun to his back, placing it in the hidden holster. His left hand then swooped under Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s legs picking her up in his arms. Looking down at her he saw a sad sight. A child dealing with the cruel nature of the world all while suffering in great pain. &quot;It&#39;s normal to want to protect the people we care about.&quot; Alexander responded to Lancer&#39;s question, his tone of voice softer then usual. &quot;Things aren&#39;t so black and white though. Sometimes our friends are an obstacle, a road block in our journey. We have to sacrifice what we want to achieve what we need... That is reality Ā-Q&#236;ng.&quot; Alexander&#39;s eyes wondered, his conscious receding in thought. The words he spoke reminded him of Helen and how their antics used to get in the way of their teachings, how he grew soft for her and his children. In his love for Helen, Alexander lost sight of his goal. Her death pushed him to become the person he his now.

Breaking from thought, Alexander reached down and grabbed the potion from Mikail, resting Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s head in his forearm. He placed the potion on Lancer&#39;s chest, giving her access to it if she wanted. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I trust Caster has it under control.&quot; Given the situation Alexander had faith that Manco would end the fight with this grand ability. 

He watched closely as Manco&#39;s meteor strike launched itself at the Librarian-Fox duo. Given Manco&#39;s promise Alexander could only assume that this was just a small display of the Kings true power. The Macedonian King starred in awe, amazed at the power generated by Manco. He was formidable, displaying the grandeur of a King. His stature and showcase of power were things that Alexander knew to be the qualities of a Leader, something he strived for. 

Despite the great power of the meteors the Fox was cunning enough to work with his Master&#39;s familiar, pulling them out alive.

Even now did their allied Master offer his potion to her, revealing that there still was a distinct goodness within him even as he had to adapt to the cruelty of his chosen way of life, but still unsure of what to think of him, she simply let it be and watched as her Master retrieve it in her stead. No longer did she regard Mikail with disapproval, but a sense of wariness remained.

From the comfortable view offered to her by Alexander’s elevated position, Ā-Q&#236;ng silently watched over the spectacle now unfolding below them as the hammer of the skies descended on the surging waters of the deep. Both Servants were incredible. Their actions changed the very terrain itself, molding it to their whims, and replicating disasters she thought possible only for the gods themselves. Reynard was clearly holding back in their earlier encounter. And so did Caster in their all too brief exchange. As her consciousness faded she vowed to herself to meet them both in battle again, this time no-holds-barred and letting the candle of their life burn bright as they measured the brilliance of their flames against each other.
But that would have to wait until another time. For now her body desired nothing more than rest.

Her words were drenched in melancholy, reflecting on both the events currently unfolding, as well as old reminiscences of her past she could not help but recall at her Master’s explanation of reality’s cold unfairness.

“But…” even amidst this revelation, the faintest of smiles graced her lips as she spied the surviving figures of her friends, as well as the deliberate effort her new allies went through to ensure this favorable outcome, even if such mercy could prove detrimental to their chances in this War, “...there are still plenty of good people left. So reality is not all that bad…”

With that her eyes finally shut and her breathing settled into a strained yet steady rhythm, feeling safe enough in her Master’s arms to entrust him with her fate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While he did dislike Reynard and Aida, he couldn&#39;t help but admire the efforts of the jellyfish, even getting up from his sitting position to see its struggles. Eventually when the dust settled, he saw that the familiar&#39;s body was shattered into a million pieces, so he put his hand to his head in respect and briefly saluted. Then the group was soon returned back to the real world. 

&quot;I prefer to end my enemies, but maybe now it&#39;s better this way. It&#39;s still a point for the republic after all. And besides, this is only the second time in my life i spared someone who i wanted to kill. Maybe having more mercy could be better for me after all.&quot;

Mikail took two steps in the direction of the enemy pair and started speaking loudly. &quot;Fox! You should realize that you and your master owe your life to the little girl.&quot; He pointed at Ā-Q&#236;ng with one of his hands. &quot;She wanted for us to not kill you. If not for her, you would be dead right now. Were i a pragmatic emotionless person, by this point another supercharged throwing dart would be flying towards your master, but Caster made a promise. Do not even try to take advantage of this though. I am still not afraid to kill you both in self-defense. Just leave.&quot;

&quot;And you, Saber&#39;s master. You are not exactly smart, but there is honor and bravery within you. However, you are lacking some determination. I saw you practically giving up when the rocks were falling from the sky. Your familiar had way more resolve than you yourself do. If you want to even have a chance of winning this war, you will have to become a stronger person.&quot; 

Then he turned around and approached Manco. &quot;Are you alright? Using so much mana and breaking an arm looks like a pretty bad experience. I hope that you can handle the pain. Right? To be honest, i&#39;m a bit worried.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1030173626852450459 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1030173626852450459><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Oct-22 03:42 AM">03:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby, Pisser of Eagans Pants</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He needed to keep the act, he needed to show that Saber and her master how foolish would be to try this again. Even so more than anything he felt he understood what his master meant by how he wanted to die. While he kept trying to win, he couldn&#39;t deny that part of him though something that was not usually in his thoughts. 

<em>If I die like this is okay</em>

&quot;I am alright Master....&quot; he said letting out a small laugh at his own thoughts. &quot; A King doesn&#39;t bow, a King doesn&#39;t cover in fear, a king doesn&#39;t lose.  So when two who claim to be kings fight, the one true king will remain victorious. So I would never lose to a fake king...&quot; 

Manco&#39;s vision began to turn blurry as he continue to talk, part of himself was having trouble understanding his own words. Without realizing it himself he had began to go into a tangent and without stopping he suddenly fell down into the ground. He was completely exhausted and wished to sleep for a few days at least but while his collapse was fast and out of nowhere if one were to see him they would be able to relax as even though he was unconscious his confident smile remained. 

If there was any worry in Manco tired mind was that he hoped his enemies had leaved before he had collapse but he would like that concern to his master.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
