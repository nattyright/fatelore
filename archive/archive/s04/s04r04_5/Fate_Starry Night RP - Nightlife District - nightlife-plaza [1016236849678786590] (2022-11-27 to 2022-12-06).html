After their respective outbursts, there had been an odd lack of late night bickering at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>. Tensions between Reynard and Aida seemed to have calmed down, with some of the librarians even reported seeing the two of them leave the library on  a regular basis, hand in hand like they were good friends. Whatever they were doing, it was causing no harm to the library. Therefore, not worth fully investigating.

Reynard had been dragging around Aida to various sections of the city, each one more different than the last. The cultural district, the foreigner district, the academy district and so on. All places Aida surely would have visited in her lifetime, yet the fox was insistent on her accompanying him to revisit them under a &#39;new light&#39;.

<em>&quot;That guy looked at you wrong, so you shouldn&#39;t mind glaring at him back!&quot;</em> 

<em>&quot;Those donuts are overpriced. Try haggling for it to be lower!&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Work asked if you could take some extra duties on Thursday? Tell them you&#39;re busy!&quot;</em>

Most of their sightseeing was comprised of this, along with Aida getting Reynard out of trouble anytime he induldged a bit <em>too</em> much on his animal urges. She had since become a prodigy at apologizing whenever her furry companion had gotten his face stuck into a jar of jam or a lady&#39;s skirt.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047217787300495451 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047217787300495451><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Nov-22 04:29 AM">04:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
In Reynard&#39;s eyes, he was <em>helping</em> his Master. After their numerous spats, it felt like he now had a better grasp on her as a person. Aida was a good girl. Too good, even. The fact that she couldn&#39;t think of a single, selfish wish for herself compared to the numerous wishes she would make at others&#39; behalf was enough for Reynard to view her as such. No wonder she loved storybook characters. She sounded like one herself!

Which is exactly why Reynard hated it, because he couldn&#39;t see anything good coming out of it. What had stories done to him besides ruin his image and curse him to retread his same old mistakes. Perhaps it was too late to change himself, but if he could change Aida&#39;s path, then perhaps it wasn&#39;t too late for him either! And even if he couldn&#39;t, at least he would have known that he had tried.

Not his fault humans wrote him as such. Yep yep.

Granted, he could notice the reluctance in Aida&#39;s actions, along with the emptiness in her voice. He had broken her down enough to convince her to join him on his daily escapades, but the remodeling process to create Aida ver2.0 was taking its time. She was terrible at stealing. Atrocious at manipulating. Even if she were the prettiest maiden in all of Alexandria, there would have been zero occasions where she would have thought to use her womanly charms to her advantage. She was too green!

Not even Reynard&#39;s guidance could help her with that, which left him rather stumped. Aida could not move on from her life if she didn&#39;t enjoy the opportunities of greed. She needed an environment to cultivate that mindset, one that she hadn&#39;t experienced. The fox thought long and hard, until his tail raised as a figurative lightbulb lit up in his head. Eureka!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047217862483398746 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047217862483398746><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Nov-22 04:29 AM">04:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
...

It was now late night, that precipice between the dawn of a new day and the whimpers of the old one. Reynard had convinced Aida to a night stroll and dragged her all the way to the nightlife district before she even knew where they were going. It was bright, sparkly and intense despite its name, the district lit up like a bunch of fireworks that almost assaulted the eyes with its intensity.

The fox had heard of the place&#39;s reputation. At night, Alexandria apparently morphed into a different beast, one not afraid to loosen up and let out some steam after a long, hard day. He hoped this same energy could infect Aida. Break her out of her shell. Make her realize her own inner desires.

...It did sound rather hedonistic, but it was for a good cause. Right?

&quot;What you looking at?&quot; Reynard asked, bringing Aida&#39;s attention back to him. &quot;Never been out to a date this late at night before?&quot;  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They came to her easily, like plucking roses and gardenias. But making a garland out of flowers was no easy task, as were stories that needed to be coaxed and wrought. Aida was a weaver of ink, but a teller of stories she was not. After all, her stories had long since passed their expiration date. Ever since she had set foot on Alexandria&#39;s grounds, her life had its life had spun into a single strand of thread, so she had imagined.

Then, was it Alexandria that she should write about? Was that what Reynard had meant when he pressed the pen into her hand, telling her to write her own story from now on? There was no sight in Alexandria she hadn&#39;t already seen, but the fox Servant had insisted, and now he was the one leading her through the winding streets of the giant Archive, revisiting places that she had already explored with promises of showing her everything under a new light.

Only that said &#39;new light&#39; mostly resulted in her saving both her and Reynard&#39;s face from much embarrassment whenever the fox angered a shopkeeper or a particularly pretty-looking visitor on the streets with his smarmy actions. She did get to experience what it was like to be on the receiving end of much raised eyebrows and affront, but...

All these new &#39;experiences&#39;, were they supposed to be good enough to give her that spark of inspiration? Reality birthed fiction, and facts birthed myths. But what was she supposed to conceive from her haphazard crash course on modern day foxherding? 

She thought long and hard about her subjects, but the ink wouldn&#39;t flow.

It was the night after the Cherry Blossom Festival. The streets were all lit up, the lamps still carrying a faint, pink halo around themselves through the haze of thaumaturgically engineered cherry blossoms that had yet to wither. The scenery looked straight out of a storybook; perhaps the horticulturists responsible for these trees had also taken liberal amounts of inspiration from those pieces of literature.

It offered her a momentary tranquility that she had been lacking lately. She became vaguely aware of the sound of sweeping from nearby, where a caretaker was cleaning away the stale flower petals that had fallen from the trees and gathering them into several heaps at the side of the road. A couple walked out of a bar, boisterous and happy as they kicked up a heap of flower petals, undoing the caretaker&#39;s hard work as the petals scattered in the light spring breeze.

Mundane moments like this made up a way of life. She, too, could have be one of those moments...

<em>&#39;What you looking at?&#39;</em>

She retracted her gaze, feeling as if she had just been carved out of a canvas and given her own easel and brushes to paint something. Reynard had been asking her similar question rather often lately, picking her brains, making her think about all sorts of things she&#39;d never considered before.

She was an observer, not a thinker.

&#39;I know what a date is,&#39; she replied rather stiffly, as she always did when she thought she was being quizzed. She tilted her head in the direction of the couple. &#39;<em>That</em> is a date. We are just taking a walk, aren&#39;t we? I&#39;m allowed to look at whatever piques my interest.&#39; She let out a small <em>hmph</em> and avoided looking at Reynard on purpose. 

Cheeky.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047672755241357414 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047672755241357414><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Dec-22 10:37 AM">10:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a habit of hers, but not one Reynard particularly cared for. All he could think of whenever she entered that trance was how silly she was being. It was like staring at a delectable hare in the bushes and not pouncing at it. He seemed to confuse dreams with desire.

...Or maybe he just wanted Aida&#39;s eyes back on him. He thrived on attention after all.

&quot;That&#39;s a date? To you?&quot; Reynard replied in an almost mocking tone, noticing the annoyance in her voice. He saw the couple walk past him, kicking up a storm of petals that almost had him sneeze. He didn&#39;t vibe with these flowers, no matter how pretty they looked.

Aida had turned away from him, doing her trademark scornful expressions of the day. At this point, Reynard had grown used to them, viewing them as a challenge more than an insult. If she didn&#39;t want to look at him, he would just have to try harder!

&quot;What would make this more than a walk then, to you?&quot; He asked with a cheeky grin on his face as he increased his pace, walking side by side his Master. 

&quot;I count this as a date at least! Are you saying my opinion doesn&#39;t matter?&quot; He faked a whimper, just to elicit a reaction. Not even a glance from Aida it seemed.

He smiled, getting gradually closer as the librarian felt soft fingertips slide into hers, wrapping around her right hand as Reynard employed the forbidden art of <em>handholding!</em>

&quot;This better to you?&quot; The fox snarked, casually dragging her arm up and down. &quot;Looks more like a date now, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; He laughed, keeping up a brisk pace while still holding his Master&#39;s hand. He kicked up some stray petals in the air too, just for added measure.

&quot;Unless, you would rather go for something a bit more risqu&#232;?&quot; He flashed his eyes, looking at her expectantly. At this point, he was begging for a reaction!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="01-Dec-22 08:42 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047787063791063040 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047787063791063040><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Dec-22 06:11 PM">18:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Aida blew cherry blossom petals away from her face as Reynard kicked them up for even more dramatic flair. If he could summon up an orchestra right now, they would be playing some sickly sweet tunes as well, no doubt!

All of this, it was too much. Aida turned her head and looked Reynard&#39;s way. Then she slowly, pointedly raised the hand that Reynard had been clutching, so that Reynard had no choice but to walk with his arm shooting straight up in the air, as if he was dangling on a monkey bar. 

&#39;It looks like I&#39;m taking my baby brother out for a nighttime stroll,&#39; she retaliated once more, her glasses shining in the rosy glow of the bars and shops lining the streets. &#39;Do you want some candied apples?&#39; She suggested with an air of exaggeration. &#39;We&#39;ll have to head back to the main street. All these bars, they are too mature for someone your size.&#39;

He received exactly what he had sowed, as the librarian gradually raised her arm upwards, to the point that Reynard was almost standing on his tiptoes now to remain attached to his Master. He could easily let go and save himself the embarrassment, but he was too stubborn to relent on his advances, especially if Aida was challenging him like this.

&quot;I guess I should be flattered you see me as a brother then. Hmph!&quot; He snorted, sticking his tongue out in response. &quot;But what&#39;s wrong with candied apples? You are daft if you think that anybody with a brain would dislike them. Unless you&#39;re giving me a subtle hint.&quot;

He giggled, using Aida&#39;s words against her, before his Master countered by spreading more slander about Reynard as she stuck to her guns and exuded confidence. It was surprising just how strong Aida felt when confronting the little pest of a fox.

But Reynard was no fool. Despite how assertive Aida seemed and how much power she held over him, he had been given plenty of chances to see who exactly she was behind that boring fa&#231;ade.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t you worry, I can certainly hold my own when it comes to liquor.&quot; He reassured her with a smile. A gentle, uncharacteristic one. &quot;What about you?

Well, if we consider the origin of Reynard&#39;s tale, he had probably outlived most people - Servants included - in Alexandria by centuries...

But it was still quite difficult for the fact to sink in. Had it even begun to sink in at all?

But nevertheless, Aida wasn&#39;t fazed by Reynard&#39;s sudden display of wisdom far beyond his appearance. &#39;Only bad boys and girls drink,&#39; she said in an oversimplistic manner, much like when she was preaching to a school kid rather than an adult. Perhaps that was her way to dealing with the dichotomy between Reynard&#39;s ever-shifting mannerisms. Try hard enough, and you could squeeze an apple into a pear-shaped mold. 

&#39;Besides,&#39; she continued, and some seriousness crept back into her voice. &#39;Alcohol interferes with my craft. It addles my mind and unsteadies my hand. As an inkweaver, as well as a mender at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>, I must always make myself available for work.&#39;

There it was, &#39;Aida the professional Librarian&#39; talking over &#39;Aida the clueless Master&#39; or &#39;Aida the childish dreamer&#39;. It was so easy, slipping back into work mode. Or rather, letting her work do the talking for her. Reynard would be reminded of how often she&#39;d used the same excuse as she stopped him from bothering the poor shop vendors during their daytime adventures as well. Every time he felt as if he&#39;d begun to make a breakthrough, when he&#39;s started to crack her prim and proper fa&#231;ade, how quickly she&#39;d go back to her old self, like an eel between his fingers, slithering back into the water without so much as a plop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048005433736040539 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048005433736040539><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Dec-22 08:39 AM">08:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He stroked his chin and listened carefully to her patronizing rant, but the longer it went on, the more his face morphed into one of disappointment and annoyance. He knew exactly what Aida was doing, as she had done several times before.

&quot;Can you stop?&quot; Reynard squeezed Aida&#39;s hand tighter and tugged her down, the movement perfectly conveying his emotions. &quot;I&#39;d much rather have you sound like the na&#239;ve dolt you usually are than whatever this is.&quot; He mocked, waving his other arm around in a condescending manner that most likely caused some veins to pop in Aida&#39;s forehead.

But he didn&#39;t stop, no. He kept going. &quot;Don&#39;t you find it so tiring? Sounding like a doormat with this librarian junk? Is it <em>really</em> so wrong for you to loosen up?&quot; He asked questions that Aida had already asked herself at times, albeit never in such a brazen and open manner.

&quot;I already told you: You write your own story. You aren&#39;t even a storybook character. What keeps you tied down to these rules?!&quot; He asked in disbelief. &quot;At least everything I do and say has been prewritten, courtesy of you humans. You, however?

Her tone perfectly betrayed her emotions. The narrowing of her eyes followed suit. A nerve had been plucked, but the sound came out dissonant and hollow.

&#39;No one enjoys being trapped. But that has nothing to do with writing a story. You are comparing apples and oranges!&#39; She jerked her hand away from Reynard, rubbing its back as if she had been stun. &#39;Is that why you are doing all...this?&#39; She vaguely gestured. &#39;Shirking my duties and haggling on the streets? I don&#39;t see how any of this can &quot;loosen me up&quot;. If anything, they only make me feel stressed.&#39; 

The librarian sighed, her shoulders starting to slump as if the fatigue of the past few eventful days had finally caught up on her. &#39;And stop calling me a storybook character,&#39; she rested her hands on her hips in an authoritative manner. &#39;Rules are necessary for peacekeeping.

Shame, he had grown somewhat used to it too. But at least he could enjoy some newfound freedom.

&quot;So you&#39;re relaxed but also stressed. Got it.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, leaning his chin on a palm and sighing as he watched Aida give him the usual <em>&#39;you&#39;re in big trouble mister!&#39;</em> pose. The fox wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Aida legitimately viewed him as a child. Not because she was arrogant, but because it was easier for her to view him as such.

&quot;Look, all I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;ve read books where the characters were flat and one-dimensional, yet took more risks than you.&quot; Reynard&#39;s tail swung side by side as he sniffed his own forearm. 

&quot;Yes, I do <em>read</em>, before you start judging me on that as well. How could I not, when I had to see just how much you humans had slandered me and my character through your stories?&quot; He groaned. &quot;It&#39;s always the fox&#39;s fault. Always. Never a time where he&#39;s shown in a positive light! Really, did none of you or your ancestors ever get bored of the same old tropes and story beats repeated over and over?&quot;

His ears perked up in irritation. Aida had barely prompted this, but it seemed like Reynard&#39;s own musing had caused him to grow angry with himself. He even realized it, causing him to shake his head and readjust himself.

&quot;Whatever! I&#39;m just saying...<strong>I don&#39;t like that.&quot;</strong> He exclaimed. &quot;Why am I made fun of for collecting grapes, or fooling birds, or eating rabbits? Is there anything wrong with that? If I can&#39;t tell you how to live your life, how come you get to intrude into mine? Hmmmm?!&quot; His tone raised at the end, causing him to butt heads with Aida as he stood on his toes in an attempt to match her height. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It felt as if Reynard was trying to convey that there was no getting through her thick skull without a good old-fashioned hammering. But who did he think he was?

&#39;A fox,&#39; Aida responded patiently, &#39;that is what you are. If you stopped stealing grapes and tricking others, then you wouldn&#39;t be Reynard. The authors would&#39;ve given you a different name. They would&#39;ve even turned you into another species, because the fox must be cunning. Just like how the owl must be wise, and the horse must be independent. If you don&#39;t even want to be yourself, then who do you want to be?&#39;

Surely not some boring old librarian stuck mending books and organizing catalogues all day long! Her lips curled into a wry smile. &#39;You have big idea for a little guy,&#39; she continued, adjusting her glasses with much care as if she wanted to have a better view of her Servant. 

&#39;What do you know about risks anyway? If I recall correctly, weren&#39;t you just chastising me a few days ago about how I should stop taking risks?&#39; She declared triumphantly, finally having found a loophole in Reynard&#39;s words. &#39;What is it that you ask of me, really?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048360245027676200 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048360245027676200><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 08:09 AM">08:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had headbutted her to blow off some steam, but could already feel the irritation rising again as Aida gave him another of those sanctimonious speeches of hers.

&quot;And librarians are ugly, four-eyed dorks.&quot; He huffed and puffed, cheeks blowing up from annoyance. &quot;How are you humans fine with that? Isn&#39;t that stereotyping? Wow, just because one author wrote me as selfish and cunning, that&#39;s the rest of my life now?&quot; He sounded outraged.

But it seemed like Aida was more interested in entangling Reynard with his own words than listening to his rants. A fact that he did not appreciate. &quot;Just stop being <strong>you!</strong> Is that so hard to understand? Haven&#39;t I already told you how your antics have gotten not only me, but the people you care about in trouble? Most of your co-workers are worried. I&#39;d know, since I&#39;ve been living in that dusty library for weeks now.&quot;

He sighed, staring at the ground and sizing Aida head to toe before his view focused back on her glasses. Just like how he had given her a full scan, it seemed like she was reappraising him somewhat. Trying to gauge his reactions.

&quot;Look,&quot; He said with a heavy pause. &quot;you should already know by now what I want. <strong>I wish I had been never written.</strong> Don&#39;t you ever find it frustrating? The thought of having your entire life and decisions written out by an author you never met? I sure as hell do! Especially here. Especially when-&quot;

The fox droned on and on, his words growing harsh and bitter, enough to make the spring flowers wither. Though the spring night was chilly, the air around them grew heated. Reynard&#39;s agitation reached its peak once his own stories were brought to the surface, and a thought reared its ugly head in the back of Aida&#39;s mind, stretching and festering until she couldn&#39;t contain it anymore. 

It had always been her desire to be good, so much so that it might as well have become her nature. She took genuine pleasure in being good, but had it always led her down the right path? The more time she spent with Reynard, the more she started to question herself. If what she had been doing was truly good, then why did she and Reynard keep taking one step forward, and several steps back? They kept circling around each other with rhetoric, but in the end, where did that lead them? Even these little outings, which Reynard claimed to have planned extensively to jolt her brains into author mode, ended up doing nothing but ignite an old fuse. 

In the end, they would never see eye to eye.

For a moment, she didn&#39;t know whether it was her or Cathy speaking from her own mouth. &#39;You complain quit a lot, don&#39;t you? My appearance, my skills, the real world, the fairytales, your own stories, and the stories of others.

Embarrassing remarks, such as how vile and cunning the fox was, along with how hilarious his schemes were. So focused he was on those words that by the time he noticed Aida&#39;s movements, his Master was already just inches away from him, meeting him face to face as she knelt right beside him.

Normally, Reynard would match Aida&#39;s height to reassert his superiority. But despite the gap having been closed, he felt like he was about to be washed away by Aida&#39;s aura. She plucked at his words like feathers, dissecting them in her usual, analytical style. No corner was ignored. All eyes were on him. He had always wondered how Aida could effortlessly switch from a dolt to someone far more imposing.

&quot;I&#39;m <em>what</em> now?&quot; He spat back, staring at her, incredulous. He was hearing, but not listening. He refused to acknowledge Aida&#39;s words, since doing so would mean that yes, he was as flawed as they come.

A statement, not untrue. But somehow she made it sound like some sort of affront. What was she saying? What was <em>she</em> thinking? Aida could feel her desire to be right outweighing her desire to be good. But that was exactly the type of person she&#39;d always been. Obstinate to a fault, the little girl who would jump into the sea without hesitation for a glimpse of the mermaid&#39;s tail slipping beneath the powdery seafoam. 

She couldn&#39;t see where her actions could take her. So she looked into Reynard&#39;s eyes, the anger and trepidation imprinted in the depths of those glassy orbs. Had those emotions always been directed at her, or had she unwittingly caught herself in the path like a sacrificial lamb?

She realized that she cared less than she had anticipated. What was the worst that could happen? There was no word they hadn&#39;t exchanged between them, no amount of grief that they hadn&#39;t already given each other. Then, what was a little bit of spite, a little bit selfishness but an extra sprinkle of spice on top?

&#39;Even now, you contradict yourself. If you think you should be allowed the right to speak anything on your mind, when who are you to judge what I say and what I do?&#39; She pressed on relentlessly. &#39;If you are truly speaking your mind, then why does it feel like you&#39;re still hiding things from me? Aren&#39;t you supposed to be the brave one?&#39; 

&#39;I&#39;ve heard enough of <em>your</em> views on the world.&#39; She spoke each word slowly and clearly and raised her hand. Yet the pain that usually accompanied a nose flick did not come. Instead she removed her glasses, dissolving the final barrier that came between them.

&#39;It&#39;s time to hear what <em>Reynard</em> has to say.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 11:40 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048413011326537849 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048413011326537849><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 11:39 AM">11:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fox stood no chance, as she meticulously described each and every inconsistency in vivid detail. How could he despise fairy tales yet read them on a daily basis? Blame authors for stereotyping him and then playing into said stereotypes? Acting as if he had been wronged when everything could have been avoided had he simply acted good in the first place?

It was a one sided massacre. One brutal enough to turn Reynard&#39;s face pale as his ears dropped and his tail grew silent. He instinctively felt like lowering himself, a habit of predators about to submit. Aida&#39;s presence filled him with a heavy burden as each of her words crushed his already fragile ego. He had always underestimated her. No, it&#39;s more like he refused to think that he and her were alike. He crushed people with schemes, but Aida crushed them with truth. Despite the difference in ethics, the methods were the same. He had never met his mental equal in the books, after all.

<em>&quot;Why do I feel like cornered prey?&quot;</em> Reynard&#39;s heart felt heavier with each beat, his face struggling to remain composed with all of Aida&#39;s prodding. This woman would not take an inconclusive answer, for she would rather arrive at the root of the problem. That is how a librarian worked, much to the fox&#39;s annoyance. His tail spiked from stress, causing him to grab it as he attempted to cover his face with his fluff.

As if to counter that, Aida took off her glasses, determined to bring things to a close. It always felt like they were living in the same building on opposite sides, but no more. Reynard stared at her, his face red as a beet as his Master approached him with such bluntness that he couldn&#39;t help but feel embarrassed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048429591661903905 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048429591661903905><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 12:44 PM">12:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He opened his mouth and spoke, but any dull warnings and insults were immediately shut down. All that Aida was focused on right now was the truth. All she needed to do was see, capture and listen. Let the pages that formed Reynard do the talking for him.

Various writings and markings appeared on the fox&#39;s surface, unbeknownst to him. Inside, Aida could read a story. To be more accurate, she felt like one of the protagonists in it. It was one of those stories where the reader was part of the main cast and could fully immerse themselves into the actions of the characters within. In this case, there was only one character included: Her Servant.

<em>&quot;Stupid, stupid Aida! I hate you and your smug mug so much! Why can&#39;t you get a clue and see what I&#39;m going for?!&quot;</em> The fox was rolling across the floor, smashing it with a flurry of fists and kicks. Even when cornered to this point, he refused to admit his own weakness, instead grabbing his tail and covering his eyes with his own fur.

<em>&quot;Even stupider than you is me! How could I be so blind, to think that we were similar? For a second, I felt happy, thinking that I had found someone else who didn&#39;t fit the mold. That had been forced a role on them that they didn&#39;t want. But no! You&#39;re just too good! You&#39;ve accepted the life you&#39;ve been given and embraced it too!&quot;</em> He sneezed through his fluffy tail, his snot so wide and large that Aida drowned in it, transported to a deeper dimension of microbes where a swarm of foxes were running around aimlessly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048429628722794567 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048429628722794567><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 12:45 PM">12:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em><strong>&quot;It pisses me off!&quot;</strong></em> They reluctantly glared back at Aida. Their eyes were feral, but even they could not mask the faint wetness behind them. No wonder Reynard had swiftly started covering himself with his tail. <em>&quot;I want to tear you down. I want you to feel how I feel. Confused, jealous, angry...GRAAAAH! Everything! I shouldn&#39;t be forced to suffer alone. It&#39;s not right. It definitely isn&#39;t! Yet you corner me now like I just lied to your auntie again...&quot;</em>

And then, all of the foxes turned red as they started whining and whimpering. Their tails dropped down and they hid their faces out of embarrassment. <em>&quot;...And now she&#39;s staring at me and giving me a weird look too. Why&#39;d she take her glasses off now of all times? Wait, come to think of it, I&#39;ve never seen her with those off. She looks kinda-&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Cute.&quot; &quot;Hot.&quot; &quot;Stupid.&quot; &quot;Sexy.&quot; &quot;Intelligent.&quot; &quot;Interesting.&quot; &quot;Cool.&quot; &quot;Badass.&quot; &quot;Adorable.&quot; &quot;Dumb.&quot; &quot;Nerdy.&quot;</em>

The council of Reynards continued their verdict, now debating Aida&#39;s outer appeal in the senate of foxes as each of them proposed their own thesis on which aspects of Aida worked for them. It was a massive stream of consciousness, one that Aida could thankfully ignore and skip like the filler chapters of a very large book. Thank God for that!

She could have pried more. Invaded more of Reynard&#39;s privacy and used it as blackmail, but did she really need to? All of the information she had obtained so far seemed like it had fulfilled its purpose. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The world seemed to blur around her, and she was both here and somewhere else. Her feet still touched the flower petal laden ground and her hair still brushed her cheeks, but the sensation was blurry, as if she was feeling them through a rubber glove. She was dimly aware of the chatters flowing out of the bars all around her, though they sounded distant, as if she was hearing the voices through walls. 

As her surroundings shifted and warped, the center of her vision was pushed into sharp focus. She saw Reynard&#39;s bewildered face, each strand of orange fur standing on end; then she was in the dark, formless words and images bubbling forth from a bottomless well until they suffused her being.

There was no light, but she could see. The stage was unlit, but Reynard - Reynard<em>s</em>, dozens and dozens of them - circled and prowled and howled, kicking their legs and beating their arms, their tails quivering as words, inhumanly loud and inhumanly sharp, entered her vision and made her eyes water.

Though Reynard was a storybook character, the chapter of his life he had laid bare before Aida read nothing like a book. It was too recent. Too <em>personal</em>. It made her feel as if she was peeking into a part of his mind, the part that he&#39;d kept hidden in a secret diary with a lock and no key. 

Except that she now possessed that key. 

&#39;Oh, Reynard,&#39; was all she managed to say, before the <em>Book of Reynard</em> drowned out everything else. Reynard&#39;s inner thoughts flooded her vision, her mouth forming little <em>Os</em> of shock and surprise. She couldn&#39;t help but curl her lips into a smile as the council of foxes piped up, then wrestled one another on their opinions on Aida herself. Then embarrassment washed over her, and she quickly flipped to the next page.

The foxes multiplied in number, their voices melting into a buzzing sound as each one tried to talk over the other over events that happened over a few days past. There was a fox with a sash. A fox with a straw hat. A fox with a limp. A fox with a crown that was too large for his head. None of them looked exactly like Reynard, yet every one of them was unmistakably Reynard. A different piece of him, born under the pen of a different author from a different time...

She&#39;d had enough. 

<em>Look away,</em> her own inner voice tried to leverage some semblance of control, but Aida had never learned how to properly detach herself. She blinked, and the scene shifted again, carrying her further and further back into the past. With unsteady hands she reached out to close the Book, but the scene was too hectic, with orange fur obstructing her every move. How was she supposed to find the book&#39;s spine if all she could grab was a handful of fur?

She shoved her hand further back into the fur, searching for that telltale sign of a the book&#39;s spine...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048519807269609472 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048519807269609472><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 06:43 PM">18:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Something that should have only affected her sight was now invading her mind, her hearing, her sense of touch. She felt all of Reynard&#39;s pain and joy in the past weeks, along with the intense feelings he harbored towards her and his audience. She was submerged in his curses, and then blessed by the fox&#39;s praises all the same.

At this point, she risked devouring him whole, reading him with the voracious hunger of someone who had chewed through thousands of other books. It was best to avoid that right now, so she tried to escape and regain her bearings over the real world-

&quot;Ah!&quot; Reynard yelped, seeing Aida move in her trance as she abruptly launched her arm towards him. He expected a slap or a flick, but instead felt her fingers digging into his tail&#39;s deep fur. Another hand grabbed him by the head, dragging him close as he felt her fingers delicately rub the end of his ears.

&quot;Ah.&quot; He groaned again, blushing as Aida kept stroking those sensitive areas, unaware of what she was doing in that dreamlike state. From her perspective, she was still digging through her Servant&#39;s furry appendix, trying to find the beginning and end so that she could close herself out of Reynard&#39;s world.

&quot;What are you even doing? Can&#39;t you tell that we&#39;re in-&quot;

<em>POMF!</em>

<em>&quot;-public?&quot;</em> That last word felt particularly muted, as Reynard&#39;s face had unexpectedly collided with her chest. Aida dug even deeper, causing her to slam Reynard to the ground and topple him over. She now towered above him, still groping his fluffy areas as she was wrapped around him like a coccoon. The distance was minimal, causing the fox to sweat and pant as his Master kept stimulating his more sensitive areas.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048677555152101458 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048677555152101458><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 05:10 AM">05:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;H-Hey! Stop that! Stop handling me like a doll! I still haven&#39;t forgiven you for-&quot; Any nerve of aggression in the fox&#39;s mind was slowly being erased by the calming effect that the librarian&#39;s hands and body had over him.

&quot;-We&#39;re in public. Don&#39;t you have any shame-&quot; He wanted to keep speaking and reassert himself, but every breath kept being stolen, replaced by groans and yipping. He couldn&#39;t even physically shove her off due to the Wolf&#39;s Curse. Aida was like a venus flytrap and he was the easily attracted fly.

Did he even want to leave?

...

From Aida&#39;s perspective, she was in the middle of scaling a giant of fur. This went beyond the kitsunes she had learned of in myths and legends. No, this was a giant tail. Red, brown and black with multiple layers to each of those colors. She had already explored the latter two, leaving only the top layer of red. She scaled it with all of her might, braving through the waves of confusion and words that rang in her head. Her body felt hot to the touch and her breath felt labored. Was diving into one&#39;s past really that stressful?

Her hand eventually met something with a rough texture. She plucked it out of the furry mountain, snapping it into place as she realized that she now had an original copy of <em>The Tale of Reynard</em> in her hands. Weathered, cracked and a bit rough. A reflection of the fox&#39;s age and experience.

It was wide open, so Aida closed it, severing the mental link that she had between her and Reynard&#39;s world. She gradually started returning to hers, as if transcending dimensions. The beautiful night time sky. The loud noise of Alexandrians partying outside.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048677637326901388 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048677637326901388><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 05:10 AM">05:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
...The groans of Reynard in her grasp, who was hugging her tight and feeling all around her?!

Aida felt like her mind had gone into shock. What exactly had her physical body gotten into while she was in that trance? She could still feel fur on her fingertips, realizing that she was still massaging his tail and ears without sign of stopping. She was also dangerously close to Reynard, to the point the fox was clearly taking advantage of it!

&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Reynard moaned, his cheek rubbing off on Aida&#39;s bosom and he hugged her tight with his eyes closed. From his perspective, he had tried so hard to resist! It&#39;s not his fault that Aida was too strong for him...

...Was what Aida read off the fresh writings on his forehead. Her Mystic Eyes were still exposed, but closing the book had limited their effect to only reading the most recent portions of Reynard&#39;s story. Which is why she was being bombarded by his present thoughts, ranging from raunchy, depraved fantasies to childish dreams of eloping. It was enough to make any woman die of shame ten times over.

But things got worse, since the fox didn&#39;t know that his Master had regained her senses. His eyes were still closed, since he was now indulging in his other senses. The scent of Aida&#39;s perfume, the warmth of her body. It caused him to crane his neck upward as his lips curled into a very familiar pose.

&quot;Chuu chuu~&quot; He murmured with his eyes still closed, extending his lips into a kiss. You could tell that he was expecting to reach Aida&#39;s lips, but had misjudged the distance and would end up kissing Aida&#39;s neck instead.

If Aida would let him, that is. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a moment, the deafening silence overwhelmed her with a deluge of nothingness as she untangled her thoughts from the immensity of the Book&#39;s presence. Reynard&#39;s Book, battered and worn, smelling musty of age and leafed through by a thousand hands. None had read it like she had. But it was time for her to place it back where it belonged-

She blinked in confusion as her senses began to return to her. The hardened tarmac under her knees, the hairy tangles tickling her nose and making her sneeze. A bundle of softness pressed against her torso, making her feel like a branch who&#39;d been hugged by a koala bear. Except that that wasn&#39;t quite the case...

Her cheeks flushed bright red as realization smacked her on the head like a book. The bookshelf had toppled, and she found herself in a deep mess. Her hands had somehow found their way into Reynard&#39;s hair and was stroking and scratching his head like he were a little puppy. Reynard squirmed under her with none of the bite he&#39;d carried before, all of his defenses broken as huge words appeared on top of his forehead, projecting his inner thoughts to her like a weather presenter broadcasting tonight&#39;s weather. Childish thoughts and depraved thoughts screamed at her all at once, and she had to shut her eyes to avoid being dragged back under the ocean&#39;s depth again.

Something. Anything to root her to the present. Her Mystic Eyes were a gift as much as a curse. The dangers of losing herself in her subject&#39;s past was what had brought so many Seers to their demise. If only there was something she could latch onto...

A trail of puckering sounds entered her ear as she felt hot breath on her neck. Trapped underneath her, a beast was about to bare its fangs-

Reynard&#39;s lips swelled up like a duck&#39;s beak, unable to speak, much less realize his short-lived fantasies. Ah, so sad!

&#39;You...you bad, <em>bad</em> fox!&#39; Aida shook under the stress of embarrassment, made even more difficult to manage now that she had to juggle both the real life Reynard and the inner Reynard that kept leaking under the influence of her Mystic Eye. Come to think of it, since when had she been able to read a Servant? An so thoroughly at that, making her want to run back to her room and hide under the blankets.

And now they were even starting to attract attention. Words belonging to neither her or Reynard filled her vision. She felt herself being pulled from all sides by the shifting tides of people as they walked, watched, pointing and talking among themselves. Her tether on reality began to weaken once more, but this time the change was rude and invasive. She hadn&#39;t asked to Read any of them, yet their experiences poured into her, until she could no longer tell her own thoughts apart.

Who was she, but a speck of dust caught between the pages of a book?

Reynard felt his Master shake above her, cold sweat glistening on her face as her eyes came in and out of focus. Whatever was happening, he wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted to prolong the issue...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048760201316155422 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048760201316155422><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 10:38 AM">10:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Come here, my handsome prince!&quot;</em>

Aida&#39;s voice echoed inside Reynard&#39;s head, his eyes closed as he daydreamed a scenario where he was sat on his Master&#39;s lap, being coddled and spoiled for his great exploits. So happy he was in that dreamland that he leaned forward, determined to show Aida that he was truly hers-

<em>squeeze</em>

Well, he got his wish. In more ways than one. For he felt a strong pressure around his cheeks, holding him in place as his kiss never reached the intended target. Instead, he could barely move his lips at all, his mouth being squeezed and held in place by the jittery hands of an awakened Aida. She started reprimanding him the moment she woke up, her face as red as a beet and her body quivering like a bag of feathers.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Reynard barely blurted out, opening his eyes as his ears perked up at the sound of the <em>real</em> Aida. His face turned pale once he saw his Master stare back at him in a mixture of confusion, embarrassment and anger. It made him feel inadequate, as his previous desires shrunk from shame as well. The two of them were boiling red, albeit the fox was quick to realize that Aida wasn&#39;t fully there yet. If she was actually embarrassed, he would have received slaps in the face by now. No, instead, she seemed to be more focused on something else, giving him weird looks and trying her best to avoid looking at anything at all. It looked like she was being crushed by an invisible weight, one that threatened to drag her down to a bottomless abyss.

Reynard looked deep into her eyes, noticing how they kept focusing and refocusing on different things every few seconds. Such hyperawareness was only reserved to the greatest of predators, something that did not befit Aida. It was more like part of her nature had been sealed until now. But what exactly had released it-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048787995454611507 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048787995454611507><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 12:29 PM">12:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;The glasses.&quot;</em> He realized. <em>&quot;That&#39;s why she insists on putting them on despite looking far cuter without. Of course no one would be dumb enough to make themselves uglier, not even her!&quot;</em> Reynard felt truly intelligent in that moment. With that knowledge in tow, he quickly slid out of Aida&#39;s grasp while she was overwhelmed by people&#39;s novels. He tracked down her glasses on the ground and pounced right back at her.

Aida froze as her vision completely shifted, the glasses now forcibly pressed on her face as the noise of the words drowned out. Instead, all she could see was an image of Reynard pressed up her nose, a bit too close for comfort.

&quot;You still alive in there?&quot; He screamed right in front of her, not concerning himself with the distance. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bereavement befell her, making her feel as if she had been severed from an invisible organ that occupied her brains. She could finally hear her own thoughts again, and the world began to right itself, coming into sharp, unblemished focus-

<strong>&#39;You still alive in there?&#39;</strong>

Aida felt as if someone had doused her with a bucket of cold water. Wincing, she pulled her head away from the screaming Reynard, one hand placed over Reynard&#39;s mouth, preventing him from piercing both of their eardrums.

&#39;Shhhhhh!&#39; She gestured, pressing her finger to her lip, looking around again-

<em>Uh-oh.</em>

In an instant, her stomach dropped to her shoes, and she went from a fidgeting librarian to an embarrassed, fidgeting librarian. A crowd had gathered around them, swapping gossip as they pointed and stared!

&#39;Come on, we have to go!&#39; 

With a burst of agility that seemed to come from nowhere, a mortified Aida rounded on the fox, grabbing him by the arm and pulling him behind her like an oversized balloon. They burst onto the sidewalk, shoes clacking in rapid fire against the pavement as she fled the night plaza and away from the crowds. 

Reynard may have had his fair share of lone expeditions in Alexandria, but Aida knew the city by heart. She wove in and out the winding streets as if she were holding a map of the city in her mind, until the scent of the sea grew stronger and both of them could hear the pounding of the water in their ears...

Then, like a canvas unfurling before them, the buildings dwindled, vanished, then opened out to a vast expanse of the sea. Ships of all shapes and sizes lined the shore, most of them unmanned, with only a scant few vessels lit up in the distance as workers and machinery unloaded cargo onto the docks.

Her eyes started darting out erratically, wincing as if she had been abruptly woken up from bed. She immediately covered the fox&#39;s mouth to prevent more damage to her ears.

&quot;Mmmmph!&quot; Reynard murmured, even though his sound was muted compared to the crowd that had gathered next to the two. Some were laughing, others looked curious. Some were silent and let their eyes speak for themselves instead. Each passing remark made Aida redder, causing her to grab at the fox&#39;s wrist and skedaddle away.

If anything, Reynard was nothing but impressed when he saw Aida drag him all the way to the docks in an instant. It took her all of her stamina though, since she was now panting like it was a drought and holding her waist like she had just stretched something a bit too hard. None of that stopped her turning around, staring at Reynard and scolding him even when she could barely breathe. 

&quot;What? Me? What did I do?!&quot; Reynard immediately went on the defensive, ears still and tail curling up. &quot;You&#39;re the one who started rubbing me out of nowhere! Felt like you couldn&#39;t get enough of me.&quot; He pointed out, turning Aida&#39;s face three shades softer.

&quot;Then you went into that weird trance and started shaking like it was winter or something. What&#39;s up with those glasses too? And those eyes?&quot; He got closer, staring at her inquisitively from head to toe. He wondered if something was wrong with his Master, but he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it.

&quot;Well? Tell me. It&#39;s the least you can do after what you did to me before!&quot; Reynard shouted, albeit part of him was still thinking back on those moments fondly... <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then who was the one...making all the...kissy faces! Like there&#39;s! No! Tomorrow!&#39; Aida shot Reynard a dirt look, her recently acquired knowledge resurfacing in her mind as rosy colors resurfaced on her cheeks.

&#39;All I did was <em>read</em> you,&#39; she opened her hands like folding open a book, the implication horrific to Reynard. &#39;I was born with special eyes. They&#39;re very good at reading people...reading you.&#39;

Reynard&#39;s suspicions had been confirmed. A book, him? When he was trying so hard to be everything <em>but</em>? 

But before his thoughts could waver, Aida rounded on him once more, pointing a finger at him in an accusatory manner, as if she were a detective who had caught the thief red-handed.

&#39;Explain yourself, Mr. Fox!&#39; She stated gravely. &#39;If you claim innocence, then who was it that wanted to elope with me? Who was it that wanted to do...do naughty things with me?&#39; Her face turned a deeper shade of crimson, but she pressed on with her onslaught. 

&#39;Who was it that called me cute? And nerdy?&#39; Her face was starting to resemble a red delicious apple. 

&#39;And b-badass?&#39; If she could, then steam would be coming out of her ears right about now. 

&#39;A-a-adorable?!&#39; Was she going to list out every single thing she&#39;d read? Woe was Reynard, to have gotten himself stuck with a Master with an excellent memory.

&#39;Who was it that wanted me to call him a-a-a-&#39; Aida stammered as she encroached on a pair of forbidden words...

&#39;-a handsome prince?!&#39; 

She was subjecting him to a public execution.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048945700186112070 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048945700186112070><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 10:55 PM">22:55</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was shocked, thinking that Aida had been in a trance. Instead, she seemed to have been aware of what had happened moments prior?

His soul left his body once Aida explained the why and how. That moment where it seemed like she had lost consciousness was actually her prying into Reynard&#39;s deep dark fantasies...

&quot;Mystic Eyes.&quot; Reynard spat out, slumping on a nearby wall as his tail snuck between his legs. His face turned pale, then pink as Aida started making implications about the things she had seen and read. Thoughts that he had but not acted upon were now being said out loud for him to hear, causing him to feel limp as he felt like vanishing in that instant. His entire stream of consciousness was being fed back to him, which was embarrassing as it sounded.

Even more embarrassing for Aida, who was trying hard to remain composed, but failed to do so as her speech devolved into stammering and her face looked more like a freshly plucked apple.

&quot;W-Who? Me?! Don&#39;t make me laugh! Why would I ever fall for someone as vain and conceited as you?&quot; Reynard laughed, trying to regain his composure by treating it all as one big joke. He was willing to even lie to himself to prevent Aida from being correct.

But it failed, for his own thoughts fought against him the more Aida spoke. <em>&quot;The way she points at me like a wannabe detective thinking she solved a crime. The way she stammers like the klutz she is...Cute-&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;NO! No she isn&#39;t! There&#39;s far prettier women out here in Alexandria! I&#39;m spoiled for choice. Heh. Why would I care about this four-eyed bookworm who has caused me nothing but strife-&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;My handsome prince.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048981489108390060 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048981489108390060><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:17 AM">01:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Reynard almost collapsed when Aida uttered those words. He fell to his knees and looked at her with his mouth wide agape. The librarian was an embarrassed wreck, struggling to keep the conversation going with the amount of knowledge she had seen. Her breath was labored and her speech stammered, but even with all that, Reynard could hear those words crisply, almost as if he had been waiting for them to be spoken to him for a long time.

Aida knew this too, because in that thick web of foxes that she had read, she had noticed that Reynard seemed particularly obsessed with fairy tales about handsome, heroic male figures that were rewarded for their efforts, usually with riches or a bride. He favored the brides, of course. Almost as if he wished he had been written as that type of character.

It was embarrassing and very childish. Which is why Reynard turned into a steamy mess as he crawled on all fours and looked at Aida in a submissive position.

&quot;...Am I handsome, at least?&quot; He said with a whimper, hiding his eyes between his fingers as his tail swept the ground like a fine broom. &quot;Everything you said is true, but...I mean...<em>No way I&#39;m admitting to all of that!&quot;</em> He screamed like a child. Worst part was that Aida could easily relate to that.

&quot;I&#39;m a villain, but I&#39;m not dumb. Why would I ever dislike someone who was never prideful like a lion, or scheming like a cat? I&#39;ve seen you work, even if you didn&#39;t see me. You&#39;re always so nice to your co-workers, especially to Cathy and the others. You&#39;re just a friendly round raccoon.&quot; Reynard said honeyed words with great difficulty, gulping with every sentence and almost choking on the amount of sugar he was adding to them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048981531277930586 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048981531277930586><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:18 AM">01:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;But if you think that I&#39;m the type of person that would tell that to your face, <em>then have you really read my story?!&quot;</em> He snarled angrily, as if he was blaming Aida for his own social inadequacy. &quot;Whatever. You got your answer!&quot; He hurriedly covered his face again.

&quot;And don&#39;t get mad at me. You&#39;ll make it worse. Because-&quot; He blurted out. Aida knew exactly what he was talking about and it made her embarrassed. One of the foxes in the council of Reynards was covered in bandages and had a drunken smile on their face. She remembered that particular fox&#39;s thoughts with the utmost of clarity.

<em>&quot;When she gets mad and annoyed at me over the silliest things. I can&#39;t help but love that! I want to prick her even harder just to see that cute scowl of hers!&quot;</em>

Reynard was...difficult. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was good. Great, even! Because Aida didn&#39;t know how much longer she could keep doing this. Her own knees felt weak; were it not for her desire to see Reynard crumble under the weight of his <em>sins</em>, she would&#39;ve melted into a puddle, for sure!

With one final, labored breathed she drove the nail in the coffin, and Reynard had nowhere to hide but from behind his own hands. Like an ostrich, he covered his face in his hands, peeking between the fingers as if that was enough to shield him from his Master.

It wasn&#39;t enough. But it was good enough, it seemed, for he quickly went into a tirade, his words tripping over one another as he layered insults and praises and insults disguised as praises and praises disguised as insults and...and...

Oh, screw it! He might as well pour his heart out because he&#39;d get read either way! It was <em>way</em> better to expose himself first than letting someone else do the work!

Aida was stunned into a brief moment of silence by the fox&#39;s sudden outburst. But she quickly came to as her own ears perked up-

&#39;Me? A-a raccoon?!&#39; She exclaimed loudly, but thankfully her voice was swiftly carried away by the nighttime breeze and dispersed over the sea. None of the sailors in the ships afar had passed their job to point and stare.

But Reynard didn&#39;t stop there. He launched another volley of verbal &#39;assaults&#39;, like stinky, spiky-shelled durians that hid their soft flesh underneath. His motives were simple, his intentions clear as water, and Aida felt like bursting on the spot into a cloud of smoke as she realized what game the fox had been playing all this time.

&#39;But I-&#39; she picked Reynard up unceremoniously, holding onto his collars and dangling him like a wash of laundry. &#39;-I only get mad at you if you do something to annoy me!&#39;

Bingo.

&#39;No. Oh no no. Don&#39;t you pull that stunt on me.&#39; She released Reynard, horrified by how easily it was to slip into her old habit. Could Reynard be <em>enjoying</em> this?! She mustn&#39;t let her impulses get the better of her. 

She mustn&#39;t!

...

&#39;Oh, you <em>scoundrel!</em>&#39; 

Her impulses got the better of her. 

Reynard felt his cheeks being pulled harder than a slab of mochi. Aida attacked his cheeks relentlessly, blowing off some much-needed steam that was starting to boil her brains. &#39;Why do you have to make things so difficult?!&#39;

She pulled harder.

&#39;If you want to be a prince, then start <strong>acting</strong> like one!&#39; She glared at him. &#39;Do you want to be a storybook character or not? Stop using your stories as an excuse!

Aida would be glad that they were at the docks, since she would have died ten times over if any of the words discussed today had leaked over to <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>.

&quot;That&#39;s what I first thought of when I saw those obnoxiously round glasses.&quot; Reynard spat out, referring to Aida&#39;s spirit animal. It seemed that even when he was an embarrassed wreck, he found it hard to lose his sense of humor. What came next, however, was far too real for him to deflect.

&quot;What?! No!&quot; He replied to Aida&#39;s accusation of him being a masochist. &quot;I just like-&quot; He stopped, not knowing how to word himself. Actually, he knew how, but he didn&#39;t feel like saying it. How could he ever tell Aida that he found her cute and adorable when she was mad?!

Thankfully, Aida didn&#39;t wait for a reply, since she was overwhelmed by a mixture of shame and rage. Embarrassed by Reynard&#39;s preferences and angry at the fact that she had been sustaining those same preferences. She grabbed him by the collar, an all too familiar scenario which would usually be follow by a slap and a flick. She then stopped herself, blushing even harder as she was conflicted between indulging in her habit or not.

Of course she would, for it was just part of her! Reynard wouldn&#39;t care about annoying her if she weren&#39;t at least <em>honest</em> about it. &quot;Ow!&quot; He whined as the librarian dropped him and stretched his cheeks into cheese. It was painful, but the deepest crevices in his mind were laughing with glee at Aida&#39;s steamy face.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048987591946539138 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048987591946539138><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:42 AM">01:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Even that side of him went silent when his Master conveyed one last nugget of wisdom for him. If he wanted to be a prince, why did he make no attempts at becoming one? He always helped her in a wishy-washy manner, never exposing himself like a true hero in the spotlight. Aida knew why. It was simply in Reynard&#39;s nature, after all. But if he wanted to keep whining about not being written well, then he might as well receive a reality check. She pulled extra tight just so that he could commit that to his thick skull.

<strong>&quot;I can&#39;t help it when messing with you is so fun!&quot;</strong> Reynard blurted out impulsively, then covered his mouth immediately afterwards. So, that was the truth of his masochism. He just found it cute whenever Aida was annoyed, to the point he was willing to endure the punishment for it. Aida didn&#39;t know whether to find that shameful or embarrassing or both.

&quot;I do want to be a prince, but-&quot; The fox stopped, his head pounding from the amount of stress Aida had given him today. &quot;Agh, whatever! Let&#39;s just go home, I&#39;m tired!&quot; And he did not wait, for he immediately threw himself at Aida and knocked her down unexpectedly. Before the librarian could react, she felt the fox&#39;s arms wrapped around her back and thighs: A proper princess carry. Immediately, the fox ran at full speed towards <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>, leaving the sea and sailors behind.

&quot;Stop pinching me! You will have to walk back home if you insist on doing that!&quot; Reynard scolded, since Aida&#39;s hands were still embedded in his cheeks. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
