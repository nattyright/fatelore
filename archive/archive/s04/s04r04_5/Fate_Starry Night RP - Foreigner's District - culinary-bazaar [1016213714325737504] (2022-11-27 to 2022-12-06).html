A teenager wearing sunglasses and a face mask zigzagged through the huge crowd that populated the Culinary Bazaar, making full use of his small size to squeeze his way to safety. The people he was jostling were complaining at every turn, but he paid them no attention and picked up the pace again.

It had been hours since Thomas had started running. It seemed that the security staff at the ServantPedia™ Head Offices really made it a life goal to catch him, even if it meant vacating their spots in the actual building. An endless cycle of running, getting to safety, and then being jumped by the men brought Thomas to the edge of his endurance. He nearly gave up several times, but the idea that they might not only catch him, but also find out that he was the man who failed Alexandria? It was that fear of being found out that kept him going, even when his legs were screaming and his lungs were threatening to collapse.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and removed his face mask, which was drooly and steamy from all the running he had done while wearing it. It wasn&#39;t until he finally rested that he realized how far he had pushed his body. Once the pressure died down, his legs suddenly gave out and he toppled to the ground, lying in a starfish position, too exhausted to stand anymore.

<em>Ah, how lucky he was to have Lewis around back then</em>.

This situation reminded him too much of the angry mobs that chased them out of the Asclepeion hospital. Back then, Lewis easily slid through the streets with his nimble legs. It barely took him a couple of minutes to lose the crowds. He made it look so <em>easy</em>. But when Thomas tried to do the same thing, even hours of running and hiding couldn&#39;t outrun his pursuers. They stuck to him like hot glue, and there was little he could do about it. If they found him now, he wouldn&#39;t be able to get up and run again. This was the end of the road.

He closed his eyes as he tried to calm his breathing, as if silently surrendering to his fate.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="29-Nov-22 08:54 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was time to find his master! While they may have wondered where Thomas could have wandered off to in his anger, Lewis was someone who knew where to go. He began his path.

“So did you also face a mean Dragon and Metal Man in your fight? You said you won right? Was it a fun fight? Was it something you liked? Maybe hearing that another pair won will cheer him up!”

Lewis’ innocent questions began with a rapid fire speed. He caught the eye of the wild woman with crimson hair, waiting on her to respond. 

“Also, Thomas can’t hide from me! He wanted space, he didn’t say he wanted to hide, those are two separate things! I wouldn’t be a good compassman if I lost my master so quickly, I always can find him! You could do that too, no?”

The more Lewis talked and talked, the more he didn’t seem to be paying attention, rather keeping his eyes on Hannibal for her to answer some more, and yet, strange enough he still stayed in his path! Waku Waku Alexandria slowly fell behind them, and soon the streets began to once again fill with a sea of people. To the young Rider’s surprise, their journey was different, unlike with Thomas, the people didn’t really harass the winners of the next Round. They were given high-fives and cheers and all sorts of celebratory sounds, while Lewis was ignored like a bag of rocks. Which, while it wasn’t exactly a major improvement, it <em>was</em> an improvement than the running away from people consistently. How fickle Alexandria’s people were! America welcomed all their soldiers home, even from a lost war, and yet these people didn’t seem to have much respect for losers at all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047106815122481183 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047106815122481183><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="29-Nov-22 09:08 PM">21:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><img

Soon, the group found themselves in the foreigner’s district, the smell of spices and foods greeting their senses as Lewis began to pick up the pace. He was near, and like a missile homing in on a target, he was coming fast. From Lewis’ eyes a mop of blonde hair happened to be swimming through the masses, and to Thomas, the sight of a <em>very very familiar</em> American Military Uniform seemed to be doing the same. The result led to the blonde’s hair disappearing somewhere by foodcarts, and Lewis trying to inspect each one until he stumbled on him. He wasn’t by the one selling fresh spiced potatoes, nor the one selling a strange but savory stew, but he was near the ones selling candied fruits! And on the ground for some reason. Regardless, Lewis stood there, towering over the other who lay on the ground, a smug and proud look on his face. He found him. And quite easily if anything.

“Ah, there you are Barnes! Told them I’d find you! Why are you on the floor? Was a mob of Alexandrian’s chasing you again? My friends and I can help!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No but that sounds more exciting than a flying gunman and a king who&#39;s got the hots for Rider,&quot; Amelia took the question in good humor, giving the cool factor to Lewis&#39;s fight over her own though at least no one actually died in hers. She nudged Hannibal and gave her a knowing smirk for emphasis on the last point. &quot;I really can&#39;t say a fight for survival was fun though or how we won.&quot;

&quot;Hey, hey. Let&#39;s not go that far now. We don&#39;t know the state your master is in and flaunting a win he didn&#39;t achieve shouldn&#39;t be the way we approach this. Trust me I know from experience. Let&#39;s be like real explorers and observe our target first before we make any moves. I&#39;d say focus on building up his own spirit though. That worked best with my little brother,&quot; Using her own near-boundless reserves of energy, she got ahead of Lewis for once and placed her hands on his shoulders, keeping him in place for a moment and locked her ruby eyes with his bandana. The playfulness took a hindseat for once as she stepped into the role of an older sister.

&quot;At the very least, the fact he wasn&#39;t moping around at his apartment is a good sign. Looks like we won&#39;t have to encourage him to get outside...&quot;

As they continued their search for Lewis&#39; master, Amelia naturally soaked in the attention and gave everyone the attention they sought from Alexandria&#39;s victor but she couldn&#39;t help but notice how they excluded Lewis from any friendly gestures. Sure she&#39;d usually be totally absorbed with all this good attention but the matter of the missing master got her in a different mindset somehow. An old mindset at that. So she made sure to have them give Lewis a high five or a pat on the back as well as a part of the whole deal.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047410665662468106 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047410665662468106><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Nov-22 05:16 PM">17:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>When they finally found Thomas, he would see alongside his companion a curiously pale young woman with gleaming ruby eyes, a floral swimsuit, wide straw hat and braided white and green hair.

The way he sent them out one after the other meant that by the time she finished with the first one, she would already be behind by a good few. Nevertheless, the questions still came out. Thankfully, Lewis had something who could keep up with him; that person being her Master.

Even in a city like this, it was still difficult to pin down a single person. It didn&#39;t help that they had to stop multiple times along the way. They were taking so long that Rider opted to change out of her swimsuit for now and don her more traditional battle attire. This is so that if they were ambushed, she didn&#39;t need to waste another outfit before she could even use it. So, with swimsuit inside of a bag, she kept up with the duo from behind.

It would seem that despite her attempts to avoid getting sucked into the maelstrom of questions, Amelia made sure to pull her right in. What a devious Master that one.

&quot;I swear if he tries to compare me to his wife again that I&#39;m sending Surus after him to send him back to the Throne.&quot; Rider rolled her eyes upon being reminded by the Caster&#39;s admiration towards her. You kick a guy&#39;s ass once and this is what you get. How annoying. 

The change in attitude in Amelia helped to keep her mind off of Caster at least. She appeared more <em>confident</em>. Or perhaps responsible would be a better way of putting it. How often did she have to step into this mood back there she wondered.

The bias was a difficult thing to just ignore. Sure, they won a round for Alexandria, but they still stepped up and fought. That had to account for something. The focus was soon shifted towards the fact that they found Thomas, thankfully.

&quot;So this is your Master, Lewis? Huh. Looks cuter than he did on the screen.&quot; The other companion accompanying Lewis showed herself on his other side. The garb of a Servant told him that he befriended another Master/Servant pair from the looks of it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047448854380941363 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047448854380941363><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Nov-22 07:47 PM">19:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was probably the person <em>he least</em> expected to meet at this moment. He could barely speak as his brain struggled to comprehend Lewis&#39; presence. It took him a few seconds to get his bearings before the word could come out of his mouth:

&quot;Lewis?!&quot; He wheezed, coughing painfully a few times as a result.

He grunted as he picked himself up off the floor, placing a hand on the wall for support so he wouldn&#39;t fall back to the ground. His whole body moved up and down with each breath he took, beads of sweat dripping from his forehead down his face. He was just standing there, completely stunned by the sight of his Servant. How did he even…

Thomas didn&#39;t recognize them as Alexandria&#39;s fighters in the second round, as he lost interest in the tournament after his own fight, but the red woman&#39;s heavy presence and stern features told him all he needed to know: she was a Servant. And judging by the way she stood around the red-eyed girl, she was probably her Master.

He looked at Lewis, his eyebrows furrowed in unease. There was so much he needed to say, and so much he wanted to ask. About himself, about BenjaB, about the two friends he had apparently brought with him. But he was overwhelmed, he didn&#39;t know where to start. So he blurted out the first thing that came to mind.

“I don’t… know you...” He panted, pointing vaguely at Amelia and Hannibal with a tired arm. “Sorry… out of breath… who are you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a bit. But, they both ruin fun, and they both are bad people. Me and A-Qing agreed on it.”

She knew how to keep Lewis in high spirits in her responses, especially with how she phrased such a thing to say it was fun. Though, now with how she questioned it, she wondered who exactly they fought! Flying gunman? Kings? They only king he knew was Alexander! 

“Wait! Did you fight Alexander and A-Qing? He’s a king! He’s a king! Or Nimrod! Is A-Qing the gunman? Or his master the gunman? They didn’t look like a gunman, but also, Thomas doesn’t look like an adult either. . .”

Lewis was caught up in his own imagination of the somewhat playful and friendly Ā-Qing as a gunman, a soldier, and the thought while discombobulated, did seem to work, even though he was dead wrong on both. There definitely were more people than Alexander and Nimrod who were kings. . . Amelia’s warning had sort of registered to Lewis, and then again, it sort of did not. Would having them brag about their win to Thomas help? No, but he didn’t want them to brag! He wanted them to talk to him! But, he did understand the idea of them being explorers and trying to understand how Thomas was at first. . . He could do that. He was an explorer. He nodded in agreement. As for Hannibal’s question, well, she could see how Lewis treated him, regardless of how better he looked on screen or not.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047859883011211314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047859883011211314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Dec-22 11:01 PM">23:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Not all of the information he knew could help with the situation currently though. In Thomas’ surprise, he hadn’t expected Lewis, and with it, Lewis simply reinforced the idea that he was there. 

“Yes, I’m Lewis! Why we’re you on the floor though, Barnes? Why are you so tired?”

His questions came with his help, trying his hardest to help lift the blonde to his feet while the latter took in his surroundings, and took to notice the two that tagged along with his servant. Amelia and Hannibal. He may not have known who they were, but Lewis could answer such a thing!

“They are my friends! They also are explorers and her servant is a rider too! They are here to help me and talk to you! Aren’t you guys? You’re here to talk to Barnes, no?” 

Lewis pulled Thomas towards him and then towards Amelia, and he followed suit so that he faced Rider, two of Alexandria’s teams, both with rider servants. Whatever Lewis was thinking, it seemed odd, but, maybe it could have worked. Both of them had the same  class of servant, and both had fought for their lives. So, maybe they could have related to one another.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047859967627100241 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047859967627100241><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Dec-22 11:01 PM">23:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rider and I really did get lucky against him...&quot; Amelia responded, shivering at the thought of trying to face him again. Yet the memory of her encounter with him in the hospital drifted back into her mind. &quot;Yet oddly friendly and full of regrets. Very hard to put him in one category.&quot; 

Upon encountering Thomas and the poor state he was in, something clicked in Amelia&#39;s mind and called her back to the work she once did under the tutelage of her adoptive parents. <em>Young male, likely mid teens, signs of exhaustion and possible dehydration. No visible wounds or other signs of duress. Combined with shortness of breath, symptoms point towards overexertion. Should be an easy fix.</em> 

&quot;Hey, its ok, Thomas. I&#39;m Amelia Ipomoea and I&#39;m just here to help out Lewis.  You don&#39;t need to move, Lewis can just carry you until we find a nice spot to sit,&quot; Straight to business and catering the patient, Amelia waved Lewis over to lift his master and carry him to a nearby street cafe and a table for four. 

 &quot;Here, take this bottle of Dragonade and this protein bar. Just go easy on them and take down what you can. You&#39;ve clearly been hard at work but rest is what you need now,&quot; Amelia fished out a sports drink with what looked like an man/alligator dressed up as a professional wrestler emblazoned on the front and a protein bar and slid them over to Thomas, her tone soft and eyes kind. None of her chaotic energy seemed to bleed through this performance.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048161533521313843 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048161533521313843><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Dec-22 06:59 PM">18:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;As for why we&#39;re here, Rider found Lewis wandering around the water park.

He could name a hundred different ways it could go wrong: His pursuers could lurk around and catch them, or someone in the caf&#233; could recognize them and draw unwanted attention... but he found himself sitting at a table before he knew it, with food in front of him that he was asked to ingest.

The dryness in his mouth awoke as he looked at the sports drink. He salivated at the thought of a liquid finally touching his palate, and swallowed, forcing himself not to look at it for too long. He looked at Amelia instead, with what seemed to be suspicion in her eyes. They wanted to help another Alexandrian out? Those intentions were a little hard to stomach when every other Alexandrian did the exact opposite. And she didn&#39;t seem to be lying about it either, which only added to the strangeness.

He purposely avoided looking at the food as he leaned forward on the table, breathing in and out slowly several times to regain his bearings before speaking.

&quot;...first of all, I didn&#39;t want to worry any of you.&quot; He began, not looking at anyone in particular. &quot;“I appreciate both you and Rider’s intentions and I thank you for taking care of Lewis in my absence, let me clear up any questions about my well-being: I&#39;m not doing very well, but I&#39;m not doing very badly either. I&#39;m… fine.&quot;

&quot;I hope you weren&#39;t too upset when I left you at the park. I needed to relax, to think about something else. But every time I saw you, I couldn&#39;t help but think about... you know, the fight. You&#39;re not a bad kid Lewis, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong. It&#39;s just... I needed to get away from it all. I needed to be left alone for a while. I can&#39;t say it was always great being alone, but it helped a little, I think...&quot;

His ramblings came to a halt as he took the sports drink with both hands, reveling in the feel of the liquid splashing around in his palms. But he didn&#39;t drink it yet. He turned to Amelia and her Servant, shaking his head slowly in incomprehension.

&quot;What is your purpose?&quot; He asked. &quot;I&#39;m just... trying to figure out what you might gain by helping me or Lewis, but I can&#39;t find an answer. Did we know each other before, or something like that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As long as you&#39;re still breathing, we&#39;re in this together. I&#39;m, um, well, you can just call me Rider for now.&quot; Rider gave Thomas a pat on the back after he asked who were they. Then, she saw the excitable expression of Lewis when he turned towards her. Something like that was almost impossible to simply ignore. 

&quot;Of course we&#39;re here to talk to him. That&#39;s what we came along, Lewis.&quot; After she finished, she gave his hair a bit of a rustle before motioning with her finger to follow along once Amelia stole Thomas away to a spot where he could rest.

The way Amelia handled the situation was nothing less than impressive for her. There wasn&#39;t any worry inside of her after seeing how Amelia took the situation. She knew Thomas was in good hands. 

Rider took a seat across from Thomas and listened to his ramblings. With the other side of the story, she understood where Thomas was coming from. She knew how it felt to suffer a loss during an important moment in her life after all. 

&quot;Our purpose? Well, no matter how you look at it, we&#39;re fighting for the same side. If we can&#39;t form some kind of camaraderie then the other side can simply pick us off one by one. I&#39;m not talking about the people of Alexandria either. They aren&#39;t the ones putting their lives on the line after all. <em>We</em> are. That&#39;s the side I&#39;m talking about.&quot; Rider spoke with a smile as she attempted to reassure Thomas. Her Big Sister side was showing just like when she comforted those who came along with her on the various campaigns.

&quot;Besides, I know for a fact that my Master wouldn&#39;t forgive me if I just left someone like Lewis to mope around the water park all day.&quot; Eyes were rolled as an attempt to lighten the mood was made. &quot;That and I kind of wanted to meet the two who had the balls to go up against what the Republic sent out in the first round!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048424237133725726 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048424237133725726><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 12:23 PM">12:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nope that didn’t ring a bell. Lewis shrugged at the unknown name, so it wasn’t them. That was fine. That conversation and seeking out could wait for later. 

Amelia’s command was fulfilled rather quickly, with Lewis not being afraid to pick up his master and bring him somewhere that was deemed safe to Amelia’s viewpoint. To make it better, he was the one who pushed the food and drink towards his master, his head eagerly bobbing up and down to show his approval of it, as if to silently say, <em>Eat, Eat, we got it for you!</em>and was slightly disappointed in the idea that he didn’t take a bite or sip of anything before he spoke, all of which seemed to play a tune of him not needing help.

“Are you <em>sure</em> you’re fine, Barnes? It’s fine you get upset, we all do! Jefferson got upset that America could be so quickly divided at times, or how he couldn’t do things, but he always seemed to remind himself that these were things he could one day fix in the future! We lost. . . Yeah, it is a bummer, and it isn’t fair at all we had to, but we found what they were, and we don’t have to worry about the problems there anymore! It’s not like we’re fighting forever!”

Lewis returned his apology with his own retort, something he felt could have remedied such a feeling Thomas had put out on display. Clearly, the boy had forgiven him as easily as he’d found him, and with how he stood beside Thomas, the boy was eager enough to one day rejoin his master’s side once more. 

Hannibal’s answer to Thomas’ question made Lewis almost bounce with excitement. That! They had been tough enough to volunteer first! These were the things he wished his master to see! And for Hannibal to have said such a thing about them being friends, well, to Lewis it just seemed like the perfect solution for his master. 

“Mhm! See? See? They get it! I’m not the only one saying it, Barnes!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Amelia felt insulted by the insinuation that she was expected to profit off the simple act of helping a fellow citizen of the city and one far braver than most of its inhibitants. Yes it was true Thomas likely held a treasure trove of information she could exploit later but that&#39;s not where her mind was in that moment. Her face set with a certain firmness to it that could only indicate she was about to give Thomas a stern word yet that faded fast when Hannibal spoke up first.

&quot;Our Riders are exactly right. You were the first to stand up for Alexandria against a bully and all its monsters. You were braver than anyone else in that moment and the city shuns you for even trying in the first place? That&#39;s wrong and I hate it how the city turned against you. That&#39;s not how our city should be in the slightest,&quot; Amelia shook her head for emphasis after nodding her thanks to both servants.

&quot;And it wasn&#39;t how I was raised either. You always treat your family, blood or not, the same way you&#39;d want to be treated. So I helped Lewis find you because A, you&#39;re a patient in need of help and B, as another Alexandrian, I consider you family so its my duty to help support you, no matter if you won or lost. We&#39;re built for far more than fair weather.&quot;

&quot;I apologize if I came out of nowhere but if this tournament&#39;s shown me anything, there&#39;s not enough kindness and good will out there, so even one good act can mean a lot. You may not even understand it at the time, but it makes every next one a bit easier and the world a drop better.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They didn&#39;t know about his memory loss, apparently. She thought she&#39;d meet the contenders who had the courage to come forward and go first, but in reality, she&#39;d only met one of those contenders. Thomas was not the same person he was when he fought Nikolai and his Lancer. She couldn&#39;t meet that person anymore, because he simply no longer existed.

Amelia and her redheaded Rider&#39;s explanation was simple: there was a difference in perspective between the citizens of Alexandria and the fighters of Alexandria. The former only saw the results of the rounds, while the latter understood what it meant to put their lives on the line. That’s why they could both relate to his struggles and offer a helping hand with no strings attached. Of course ... why didn&#39;t Thomas think of that? It seemed so obvious when they put it into words.

Thomas nodded slowly at the pair’s words, sheepishly opening the cap of the sports drink before rehydrating his body with a few sips. He could feel the walls around his heart begin to crumble, the idea of letting his emotions run wild seeming more and more appealing as the seconds passed.

&quot;No... you shouldn&#39;t apologize...&quot; He spoke in a high-pitched tone, tilting his head forward so it faced the table. &quot;I should be the one apologizing for being so blind to the obvious, it was rude of me to ask about an ulterior aim. You know… it&#39;s really comforting to know that... that there are people who... w-who mean well by me. Really, it&#39;s...&quot;

He tilted his head forward even more, hiding his features from view by bringing the crook of his elbow to his face. He wiped his face in his arm, sniffling as the emotions he tried his best to avoid for the better part of a week started to emerge.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You don’t need to worry! You have me and Amelia and A-Qing and Alexander and plenty of people who understand the problems you have! You aren’t alone. . .”

Though it wasn’t much, the servant went in to closely hug his master, nodding happily as he tried to keep his Thomas’ emotional state away from everyone else. He knew he would want himself not exactly seen as weak anyways. As he did so, he turned to nod at Amelia and Hannibal, a small smile on his lips to say <em>thank you for your help</em> before he went back to nursing his nigh broken master.

“No need fret, Jefferson once said that crying only causes us to worry, we should only push forward. . . Something like that. But, you’ll feel better soon! Do you want to go home? I can find a route there.”

He soothed his master the best he could, who knew the boy had such a strong emotional intelligence from his. . . Occasionally lacking wisdom! But, it seemed to be at his peak when it came to this! For the while, he comforted the blonde for all his troubles, trying to find ways to have him regain his composure, all while making sure that he was able to stay positive about his master’s troubles. He was there. <em>He was there.</em>
