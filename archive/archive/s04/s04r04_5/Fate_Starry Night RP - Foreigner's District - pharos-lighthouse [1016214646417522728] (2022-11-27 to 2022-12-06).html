Instead he changed course going to the Foreigner District. He did not explain his actions and continued the rest of their journey in a rare moment of silence from him.

He barged straight in leading her up to the highest level. No one was here so they got the place to themselves.He stepped out onto the catwalk and walked up to edge and took a breath.

He was right, you could see basically the whole city from up here. Looking down at it from up above washed in the dark night thousands of lights could be seen lighting the city ablaze as the warm glow of the lighthouse descended down upon it. It was most definitely a breathtaking sight. A beautiful, peaceful place. That would soon be taken over by the Republic. The king had spent much of his time since being summoned bathing in Alexandria culture with or without Lea. Visiting every corner of the city, talking to the locals and soaking up their culture. When he had declared he would become this city&#39;s protector he had meant it. He wouldn&#39;t allow another beacon of humanity to be lost in this dreaded world. His tower was a symbol of that. In this short time it had already grown massive. It now stood at 50 stories. Hovering over the city it towered over everything around it. Even in the night sky Lea could see how impressive it was. A well crafted construct that had been poured into by many men for years. While it was a Noble Phantasm now that remained true. It could be seen as an oppressive ugly structure to some but to many it was hope. It was hope that humanity could grow and reach their hands straight into the heavens and take hold of anything they saw. It was the King&#39;s life works and already the countdown to its destruction drew near. The king turned back to Lea. His expression was completely unreadable as he asked her a question.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Why didn&#39;t you kill that boy?

Lea expected that if anything, Nimrod would want to return even quicker than she did. Completely betraying those assumptions, the vain King instead led her into a completely foreign location. The lighthouse that they may have briefly paid a visit to during Nimrod’s first guide around Alexandria— it was so unremarkable to Lea that she no longer recalled.

Demanding absolute subservience from the atmosphere around him as always, he pointed to the scenery nearby— a wide view over the whole artificially created city, shining even more vibrantly than the stars in the sky.

“That’s unexpected coming from you. When did you get so attached to this city, eh?”

He mocked the modern world so harshly when he first got summoned. Lea never expected for the day to come where Nimrod actively touted its beauty by his own initiative. The world worked in bizarre ways. Nothing was as black and white as she initially imagined. A king as stubborn as this one changing his mind over one small thing should perhaps have been no surprise— was Lea’s assumption.

In reality, that assessment was far from the truth, however. Such a change could not have come about without the King having gone out of his way to form that bond with Alexandria in an earnest attempt to fulfil his promise. That <u>passion</u> of his sparked a meaningful change. It was far from a small thing.

The ever-growing size of the tower seemed to be indicative of Nimrod’s increasing determination.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1047487246216994846 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1047487246216994846><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="30-Nov-22 10:20 PM">22:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Say, whenever that thing gets bigger, what happens to the interior? Its already like a maze in there, please don’t make it too much more confusing.”

Some things never changed, still. Her nonchalant attitude to the clear blasphemy against the heavens, worrying less about the added strength the size would bring it and more about where her belongings would be after its lengthening. Although, compared to her usual lack of visible thought, her words seemed much more <em>detached</em>.

“Why didn’t I kill him…? Like I said, right? I just thought there would be no reason to kill someone that weak. Even if I didn’t shoot him there, we can just always deal the blow later on, right?”

The same smile she usually mustered up, but this one was full of flaws. It seemed that even Lea herself could tell that fact, as her expression quickly faded away.

“… Just kidding. I just didn’t want to shoot.”

A few words that completely betrayed everything Nimrod knew her for.

“That boy just happened to give me a convenient excuse for me to not. A clean justification in my mind for why I wouldn’t need to. I’m sure you could tell he was far from comfortable with fighting. Its hard to try and kill someone who isn’t coming at you with the intent to die, you know?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was subdued more than normal. He was different today. Things were different. He didn&#39;t press in like usual. He let her defence crumble all by itself simply gazing at the city below

</div></div>
He walked forward standing in front of her. Facing her directly. Looking down on her  as always. In the King&#39;s mind they were at an impasse. He was unhappy as to the manner in which Lea had been developing. It was unbefitting of his vassal to act like this. A honest conversation was needed

Being as stubborn as they had been, they both held strong visions of how their ways of life were meant to be. Nimrod saw himself as the figure who led humanity into the next level, whereas Lea saw herself as a harbinger of war that held the potential to revolutionize the field with her high passion. Perhaps that was part of why she ended up summoning this specific Berserker. Only by betraying those firm visions of themselves could they open a truly free dialogue in this manner.

It wasn’t as though Nimrod chose the path of strife without any thought. Hearing his words, in spite of his default Berserker-esque mindset, that much became clear. His willingness to quickly turn to threatening his enemies stemmed from the ruthless willingness to sacrifice anything in order to achieve his goals.

The lengths they were willing to go were far too different. Lea was only privy to this fact once it had turned too late.

“You said it yourself, didn’t you? Delusions are just that at the end of the day. Fun fantasies to think about.”

Lea shrugged in an attempt to dismiss her worries, but it was as unfruitful as she expected it to be. Resignation followed her every word nowadays. A small part of her expected freedom to give her the clarity to teach her what was the best course of action for her future. But freedom only made her blinder to what the correct course of action should have been.

“What, disappointed? Don’t worry, I know you are. I am too. I don’t know if I should regret running into Gatsby or not— if it was someone less kind than him, I’d be dead on the ground instead of wandering while lost. Dunno which would be nicer, I’ll be honest.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He grunted in frustration. He knew without a doubt that that man was trouble. But it truthfully didn&#39;t really matter what had caused it. Nimrod wasn&#39;t one to dwell in the past. He always looked ahead. And so he was able to acknowledge that Lea was also beginning to move 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">It’s not a bad thing though. You’ve grown a bit.

Some are to be forgotten so that children can set new goals for themselves as an adult.
</div></div>
Regardless of how things turned out. The one thing that Nimrod would not allow is uncertainty. Lea&#39;s current state was sickening to him. Her every action was filled with doubt now. It had taken root at the core of her being. Even Gabtsy had seen that. &#39;Confused&#39;. She was a confused lost little girl who was yet to find her way. That was what Nimrod loathed. Aimless people who didn&#39;t know where they were headed. Humans truly thrive when they head in a specific set direction for themselves. Making dreams a reality. Achieving goals. Making new dreams. Is what up to Lea but to continue from here I&#39;m any capacity a decision would need to be made.

He was pushing her to decide what she wanted there and then. She felt all of the pressure of his unbreakable will fall on her all at once. Yet it did not threaten her. She would not be punished no matter what she decided. He simply wanted to observe it. The fruits of her growth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was a good dude! Plus, like I said— if it wasn’t Gatsby, it would have been someone else.”

To look to the future was impossible without new stimulus. Both Gatsby and Simon acted as such a stimulus for Lea, making a new faucet of the world clear to her to demand growth from her. Gatsby showed her fear, and Simon taught her compassion.

“I don’t <em>want</em> to question it, being honest. Its hard to just throw away a dream, you know? But— maybe mine’s better thrown away, like you said.”

Something as dumb as a child admiring an astronaut out of nothing but innocent curiosity faded with time. Perhaps she was just realizing how immature her own dream was this late into the stage. While normally, she would insist on strongly sticking to her dream, the more she thought about it, the better it would be to be wrong than dead.

But as clearly shown by her lackluster performance in the last battle, a simple desire to survive was insufficient to live. She needed a reason to fight deeper than that— the <em>declaration</em> Nimrod was looking for.

What would be best?

“… There’s nothing, Berserker. Nothing for me to attach myself to if not war. That was my only passion.”

The intimidating pressure from Nimrod quickly lost its effect on Lea. After all, no matter how many times she evaluated herself, that was the conclusion she had no choice but to reach. Once you understood that the result was predetermined, resigning yourself to fate was the only thing left to do.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048202572105781249 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048202572105781249><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Dec-22 09:42 PM">21:42</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Putting all her eggs into one basket, Lea Krause defined her entire life by her singular obsession. Anything that might get in the way, she discarded. Once you took war away from Lea, all you were left with was an empty husk of a mana tank.

In order to give her life substance once more, she had no choice but to search for it anew. Starting from the beginning, seeking out a new reason to live.

“So until I can find something new, something that’s mine again, I’ll just do what little I can. It was just a pretense, but I <em>did</em> come here to protect Alexandria.”

When scrambling for a temporary duty to fill a vacant purpose, that ended up being the result Lea reached.

“One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, right? Even if I can’t be useful to myself anymore, I’m sure there are people I can protect by just living another day. I sure hope it pleases you to hear I’ll stick out the war, at least.”

A drive to continue fighting that exceeded her own survival. It was a resolve that, for the better or worse, made Lea less attached to her own survival. But it <em>was</em> one strong enough to fuel her to go one step further.

A much more selfless goal than what she had originally come here for.

“It’s hard throwing away a dream. It really is. So at the very least, I’ll protect others’ dreams so they don’t have to go through the same pain. Yeah. Playing superhero doesn’t sound all too bad either, don’t you think?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

</div></div>
And with that their contract was rewritten. Their relationship and expectations from here on out had fundamentally changed. At least for Nimrod it had. He know longer saw her as a delusional girl he had to drag around. In his eyes she was a young woman. One with a bit of growth left to do but he expected that would come in time. He wanted to be there to support her in that growth. He had stuck with her this far. He had developed a bit of an entitlement over her.

With those words his questions should have been brought to a close. He had gotten answers for everything he wanted to know. The decisions that had needed to be made had been made.

Hesitation. Lea would be familiar with it by now. It plagued the King&#39;s every movement. Doubt had set into the core of his being. No that doubt had always been there. It had even reared its head at points. This was simply the first time Lea was being allowed to see it. Everything that truly made up the man called Nimrod. She would soon be able to fully understand him.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 06:19 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was no wonder Nimrod thought of the solution as lackluster, but he could see past that dissatisfaction and acknowledge that in this moment, a band-aid was necessary. Her deep wound couldn’t heal instantly. It’d require time.

“H-hey, don’t shout it out with such a loud voice! I can’t particularly take pride in ‘I don’t know what I wanna do’, you know?!”

That was the first time since Nimrod had formed a contract with her when Lea expressed any form of embarrassment. Her typically unashamed attitude was nowhere to be seen. Her developing self-doubt contradicted with her absolute confidence. She was shedding out of her own arrogance.

Her stubbornness wouldn’t easily fade. Just as though the fear wouldn’t. Her duty now was to learn how to live in spite of those limitations.

As her delusions left, the weight of the responsibilities that loomed over her future became more visible. If anything, her blatant disregard of them prior was more than appalling. But her Servant placed his trust in her— that she would be able to unravel all of those obstacles with time. Even if Lea herself was too stubborn to recognize it as such, even now, that was the greatest form of respect one human could show to another.

“Foundation, huh? That’s a nice way of putting it. I just spoke out ideals without really realizing what they meant, or what it would take to get there.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048576214153048074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048576214153048074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 10:27 PM">22:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Now, she had a slightly better picture, at least. The goal she set too high, she could now bring down to a degree she could grow to match and handle. Nimrod had passed his trust onto her. Now it was up to her to live up to it.

“For now, I think lending a hand in winning the war is something I can more than reasonably accomplish, though. I promise to succeed in that regard, at least.”

Lea often made strong, confident promises. To lead Nimrod to victory, to fully experience war, and countless many others she had forgotten all about by this point. All of such promises were empty, said without a solid <strong>foundation</strong>.

This was the first promise in Lea’s life that had felt so heavy. The words that left her mouth penetrated her nerves, making sure to let her know just how important it would be to uphold them. It was much scarier than her usual nonchalant claims.

But it was also the first time she felt so empowered by her own words.


“… That’s not like you. If you have something, you can just spurt it out, you know?”

The same hesitation that Lea showed, she saw traces of in Nimrod’s demeanor. Of course, nowhere ridden i fear as she was, but it was visible enough for her to catch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned away from Lea, his gaze now focusing on his Tower of Babel. It had grown another floor just in the midst of this conversation. It was his Noble Phantasm. The crystallisation of his legend. It was a symbol of his pride, determination and dream. He was proud of it of course but every time he looked at it he couldn&#39;t help but feel a great deal of pain. It was also a symbol of failure after all.

Everything he had said almost seemed to contradict what he had been saying all this time. Quite simply it was self awareness. Self awareness of his own supposed madness something he was lucky to even have as a Berserker. Really though it was just insecurity. An insecurity that had deeply rooted in his heart. One he thought about every day. When anyone questioned or challenged he only double downed further. He had believed everything he had proclaimed of course bit it was impossible to not have some doubt. Nimrod was human after all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048699409036234923 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048699409036234923><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 06:37 AM">06:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
At times due to the character he attempts to always paint himself as it would be easy to believe he was anything but human. But he was just a man just as much as Lea was just a woman. They wasn&#39;t anything inherently special about him besides his cursed bloodline and that only counted as a negative. He had always had doubts and insecurities like any man would. They had just gotten worse. He had been scared in life. Humiliated and shamed. Crushed as if an insect , his ego shattered. He was scared. At times he would tear his own philosophy into shreds and curse his own stupidity. It was only his own will that kept him going. Perhaps that was the inhuman thing about him. He wouldn&#39;t let himself stop and he wouldn&#39;t let himself change. He continued acting as a perfect king without fault constantly hiding his insecurity. Yet now he was being vulnerable with Lea. This was the first and most likely the only time he would ever share his thoughts like this. He despised his own weakness yet he had shown it to her because she had shown him his. He had watched over her and felt bonded to her so he wanted to show her all that made him who he is. He wants what all men want. To be told that he is right. To be supported in all his actions in both of his lives. He wanted the person who was now most important to him to validate him. It was a simple, trivial thing. Yet it&#39;s what he wanted, perhaps even needed to continue towards his dream. For the first time Lea held the power. His armour had been shedded and he was left vulnerable and weak. Her words could easily pierce through him. To be told he was wrong by Lea now would hurt him more than any wound. It was quite the pathetic sight really and he was already regretting his decision to share this much but it was already too late.

It was in Lea&#39;s hands now to answer his question as she liked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the first time Nimrod had ever been so open with Lea. A show of trust from her Servant, reciprocated from her own despairs making themselves visible. She thought Nimrod expressing doubt was irregular, but she had no way of understanding just how deep his worries went.

Just as she underestimated how heavy the burden of becoming a soldier would be, Nimrod’s responsibilities as a King was an immensely burdensome shackle. Previously, she would have thoughtlessly dismissed his concerns.

“… I don’t know. I’m not qualified to say something like that, Berserker.”

This time around, however, she cautiously acknowledged her own shortcomings, and only conveyed her conclusion afterwards. It wasn’t that she didn’t care, it was that she lacked the ability to understand it fully. All of Nimrod’s hesitations were the same as her own. If she could answer Nimrod’s hesitations without issue, she wouldn’t be so lost right now.

“We both have it hard, huh? In terms of finding our path, I mean.”

Nimrod had lived a much longer life than she had— and fulfilled his duties for a lot longer as well. During all that time, if he held all of this doubt, Lea could only imagine just how hard it would have been to continue onwards. For the first time, Lea had learned to show <u>empathy</u> to her own Servant.

“But— you know, Berserker? You <em>do</em> trust in your own words, right? Every single time you start spewing all those speeches about wanting to further humanity, you must trust at least a little bit of that. After all, its… really hard to vocalize something you don’t trust in. I couldn’t do it, certainly.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048954782016077824 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048954782016077824><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="04-Dec-22 11:31 PM">23:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>There was a part of her that wanted to still believe that her path to war wasn’t mistaken. In reality, if it wasn’t for Gatsby, she may have forcefully deluded herself into an even more self-destructive path. But as she was, even if she wanted to, she couldn’t feign her ideologies for the sake of pleasantries.

“In order to trust your words, you need some kind of a <strong>Foundation.</strong> You said it yourself. I don’t know a single bit if your ideals are correct at all, but I know for sure that its something achievable.”

Lea’s eyes sparkled for the first time in a while. Whether it was right or not, she most definitely believed it to be plausible. <u>Nimrod’s dreams were achievable</u>. That was the absolute trust Lea had started to put into her Servant.

“Whether that’s a good thing or not is a whole other topic, though! It might be good to get caught up with the times, old man!”

She couldn’t irresponsibly tell him he was right.

So instead, she did the second best thing. This was as honest as Lea could be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet despite that when he turned back to face her his expression was that of a smile. It was different from any Lea had seen before. Devoid of arrogance and pride. It was genuine, heartfelt and happy. Her response had still managed to please him. His smile quickly shifted into a self content smirk the moment of weakness having of already passed&#160;

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">I see my words have been hitting their mark then.

Just like that he had returned to his usual self, his insecurity fading away. It of course wasn&#39;t gone. A single conversation doesn&#39;t deal with lifelong issues. Most likely a therapist was the only answer but that was never going to happen. Still for the time being he had been left satisfied. Putting his own dissatisfaction into words was really what he had needed to help ease the burden that had placed on his heart. Of course he wanted to hear he was right. He had a wounded ego that loved to hear praise but the opposite would have hurt him far more. Lea&#39;s belief was the kindest gift he could have been given. He was a King that guided the people to a better future. All he needed was the belief of a single person to continue without letting his worries consume him.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">My foundation, unlike you, is perfect no matter the era. I will achieve my dream. It is not a question of if but simply when. I expect you to remain at my side until that time we&#39;ve made a promise after all.

</div></div>
With this he was satisfied. He was able to continue pursuing his dream. With the knowledge that he now had a true comrade by his side. He picked Lea up ignoring any protests holding her with his two arms&#160;

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Well then with that all sorted let us be off.</div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049046256170836070 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049046256170836070><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 05:35 AM">05:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>
He charged forward nearing the edge of the catwalk and leaped straight off. Aiming himself towards the heavens, towards his ever growing tower. He had now become even more determined. He would prove victorious in this war. Claim his wish and take over Alexandria. From there the Republic. And from there the Neo Holy Empire. He would restore the world of humanity. No he would make it better than it had ever been. He would turn his dream into a reality. He wouldn&#39;t even let God stop him. That was his thought as he rose up towards the heavens. One day perhaps he would even make it there. He would give Lea the honour of accompanying him. It was wishful, delusional thinking. But that is exactly what made Nimrod the man he was. The king he is. And that would never change 

Of course after a few moments of bathing in his own glory they would plummet back to the ground but his endurance was high enough to deal with that</span></div></div></div></div></div>
