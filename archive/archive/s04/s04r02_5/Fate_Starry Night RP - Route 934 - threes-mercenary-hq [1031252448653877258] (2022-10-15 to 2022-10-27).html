Not even Ryujin could figure this one out. Nikolai bowled over the officials on their way out, despite his need of medical attention. His uncovered hand was clutched tight to his chest, with hints of pink whenever it was exposed. A steady stream of crimson started to leak as well, a literal blood trail on their surprise journey.

 They did not go the way back to their run-down barn, nor did they head towards the direction of the Foreigner District. Alexandria as a whole loathed the pair after their match surely, which left little elsewhere to go.

The glares and public call-outs did not help matters. A few drunks attempted to make a move, which left them shoved to the wayside. One in particular, the boldest of them all, was thrown into the canal itself. After that, most people made sure to keep their distance as they stormed the sunny city.

His Master stayed silent. Silent as one of his stature could, anyhow. A brick wall to the world around him, and not a single peep worked its way out his lips. It was clear Nikolai had a set destination in mind, and that would have to be good enough. 

After half an hour of marching, though, they finally arrived at <em>a</em> destination. The pair found themselves in the trade district, down a random alleyway that sprouted from the walls itself. Halfway through the dark and dreary cramped corridor, lined with litter and dirt, was a steel door. It blended in with the surroundings too well, as the only indication it was there at all was the handle that jutted perpendicular to the wall.

This was the place. Nikolai wasted no time and tried the mentioned handle. It wiggled uselessly in place, and he punched the door in response.

“<strong>Saria! Open!</strong>”

His demand echoed off the walls, but didn&#39;t get far due to Lancer&#39;s massive size. A makeshift sound-absorber, but left the occasional passerby confused as to what was going on.

&quot;<strong>You,</strong>&quot; he pointed to the Servant, &quot;<strong>Keep. Watch.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Every step he took was a step where he was a little less prideful than before, an opportunity for his inflated ego to shrink back to its typical size. By the end of the thirty straight minutes, the rush of a hard-thought victory had all but faded, and what replaced it was irritation.

Need he aimlessly follow this wounded beast as it stalked about? Was he too proud to receive medical attention from the Commodan staff? Must he shamble about and force his loyal servant to follow him on his silly little journey?

Finally, however, they arrived at their destination: a dirty shitstained alleyway. Joy. A sharp comment almost escaped Ryujin&#39;s maw, but he managed to sheath it before it broke free. This situation needed no insult. It was deplorable enough without it.

<strong>&quot;I am not your watchdog, Nikolai.&quot;</strong> Lancer retorted, crossing their arms as they spoke. <strong>&quot;Nor am I amicable to having my time wasted. This is the only time I shall warn you of this.&quot;</strong>

With that, Ryujin turned around, waiting for the door to open. In the meantime, he need not do much - after all, anyone who saw him waiting at the end of a dark alley would assuredly find reasons not to avoid entering.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, the door opened suddenly. A face popped up from behind a warm glow, “Wha–”

<em>Thud</em>.

 The door shut as fast as it had opened. Whoever had gone to greet them instead met the cold metal, and let out a loud, muffled groan. 

“<em>Ah, Nikolai! You dolt</em>,” the person yelled back, “<em>what the hell</em>?!”

Once again, the door swung open to reveal–</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“That hurt like a bitch,” a girl groaned. She greeted Nikolai with one eye squeezed shut and a hand on her forehead. A red bump wasted no time in forming, assuredly where the door smacked her. This was Saria, if previous tells were obvious. Half the height of Nikolai, with blue hair and bulky clothes. Terrible for the current weather, at the very least.

The door swung open further, “Ugh, just… come inside. Three’s out on work, so you’re safe on that front.”

He wasted no time and shoved past Saria. The door swung into the brick wall as she was pushed outside. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head, and she motioned with her head towards the inside. “You too, if you fit.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Immaculate as always. Chairs perfectly line up with the desk, books, and files neatly organized on their shelves, with no spec of dust in sight. Whoever owned this place did a damn good job of keeping it nice, despite the conditions right outside the door. And had an appreciation for pre-flood time decor. Hell, probably a while before that year too. 

Nikolai rushed for the back of the office, and into the room on the right. A lock was firmly clicked into place, and the sounds of shuffling armor came out from under the crack. A TV sat in the corner, on and loud. 

“<strong>Now, what a match, folks! Thank you very much to our guest analysts for their wonderful insight–</strong>”

<em>Click</em>. It fell silent and dark. That left the two of them, if Lancer decided to enter. Saria jumped up and sat on the desk in one fell swoop, feet resting on the chair in front. Alone, with Nikolai locked inside what must’ve been a restroom. Why undress there?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alas, he lacked such primitive anatomy, thus the best he could manage was his typical hard-to-read look. Thinking about it, that might have better fit the comic farce that played out in front of him.

Still, as Nikolai barged into the office, Ryujin would follow when prompted by Saria, slithering through the doorway, and entering into the offices proper.

As his master abruptly abandoned the pair alone, the dragon took the time to absorb his surroundings. The decor was... fine. Not to his tastes, of course, it lacked the gold and silver and fine silks for that, but it was acceptable. Better than that <em>husk of a barn</em>, at the very least.

It did raise questions. Why, pray tell, were they bumming around in a shitheap when they had a perfectly acceptable office to house themselves? But that question was pushed back, at least for now. There were more pressing inquiries to be made, but since Nikolai was not there to receive them...

Very well, he supposed a bit of &quot;small talk&quot; was in order.

<strong>&quot;Believe me, dear, I take no pride in what I did.&quot;</strong> Ryujin spoke, his voice like honey that had dripped down from the hive and mixed into the muck. He was not lying - that was hardly a victory to be proud of. One could not be proud when their foes were so unworthy. Still, he continued on. <strong>&quot;Yet, pride has no place in war, especially one with such a coveted prize! Ideals are fiction, and victory is truth. Ergo, winning is all that matters.

The faucet poured water out from its head, and he cursed under his breath.

The damage was worse than he thought. That fucker was lucky he had his Origin active when that damn rune went off. Otherwise, he’d be down a hand and Thomas would be down a head. Blood oozed from every little crevice on the raw limb, and the pain only increased. Half his nails were gone, and those spots of white were, indeed, bits of bone. Infection would settle in if he didn’t get it cleaned up proper.

At least the rest of his body fared well. Rather, well enough to be left alone for the moment. The main left him with a slight stiffness all over, but little else. That spear that stabbed him from behind wasn’t a major concern either, but his armor needed mending before he did much else. Shield too, if only for consistencies sake.

A flash of pain. Nikolai inhaled sharply and removed his hand from underneath the tap. Previously cold, but now steaming water escaped from the head. Didn’t he set it to cold? 

No, it was set to the hottest it could physically go. There was no reason to do that, as he’d need disinfectant to get anywhere. He slammed the handle down and pushed away from the fixture. 

“<strong>Saria,</strong>” he called from behind the door. 

She sighed, “What is it, Nikolai?”

“<strong>Need. Doctor. Get. Friend.</strong>”

“With what money? And for what? If it&#39;s that hand, I can–”

“<strong>Owe. Me. Favor.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“<strong>Please.</strong>”

She stopped her sentence, and her frustration seemingly disappeared. Now, she stared at the door with a raised eyebrow. This lasted only a moment before she shook her head and pushed off the desk.

“Geez, FINE, whatever. But we’re squared up after this, ok? Even,” she yanked a smartphone from deep within her sweatshirt and began to mess around with it. Presumably, to contact the aforementioned doctor.

“Sorry, I’ll answer your last question with a rain check,” she spoke up, eyes still glued to her screen. “Seriously, the nerve. I was gonna boot up ForthRite, relax on my day off.

No, in fact, it felt like the parade had started in said swamp, then spent the next hour wandering aimlessly about. And now, after all the timewasting, he came to learn this entire pointless diversion was because Nikolai sought medical treatment.

<em>Idiot. Idiot!</em> <em><strong>IDIOT!</strong></em>

It was so very, very fortunate that Ryujin was as tolerant as he was, for if he was even a <em>speck</em> less patient, he would have exploded with such indignant rage that the entire office would be reduced to ash and cinder. That did not mean he was not burning with incandescent anger, mind, but simply that it was restrained.

What on this blasted earth could be the reason for this utter stupidity?

A thought occurred to him. Lines connected, puzzle pieces clicked together. The question lacked an answer, and yet, the answer was within reach.

His eyes darted over to the door.

There was a pause as he pondered his approach, then a longer pause as he waited for Saria to turn her attention elsewhere. When the opportunity presented himself, he skulked closer to the door in complete silence. The door was locked, but that was of little concern to him. Outstretching a jagged claw, he pressed it against the locking mechanism, twisting and turning it until he heard a light <em>clunk</em>.

Quietly, the door swung open.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was too absorbed in her phone to even notice as Ryujin slithered over to the restroom. Oblivious to the Servant&#39;s intentions, he popped the lock and slowly pushed the door open.

And revealed a… 

<strong>Beast</strong>.

All his armor was discarded to the side, piled into the corner like a heap of trash. Hair covered every single inch of his body. Sure, it was sparser in some places than others, but short, black hair went head to toe. More than even a normal human, more equivalent to a wild animal than anything else.

One hand sat on the side of the sink, clear in view. The fingers were of average size, but the rest of the hand was absolutely massive. Of course, he had already known that. It’s not like he hid his hands from plain sight, and even the gloves he wore were big. But to see it in person, with long, dark nails from each fingertip confirmed that looks were deceiving.

Nikolai himself, for the first moment, stared deep into the mirror. A side view of his face only furthered the assumptions: absolutely covered in facial hair. The fluff there was much finer, and smoother, yet that didn’t change what it was. Hair was only absent from his nose, which sat close to the face. The tip of the nose was completely isolated, with more snout than proper human feature. A bridge thicker than a scaley finger, too. 

At the very least, this explained the raspy voice and difficulty with conversation. His Master wasn’t a proper social outcast, just physically changed to where it was hard to speak proper. 

However, none of this stopped Nikolai from taking a sideways glance at the intruder. Confusion appeared first, but disappeared once realization settled in. Eyebrows arched as far as they could go, and he turned to face Lancer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032881391811170378 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032881391811170378><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Oct-22 03:01 PM">15:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Like before, his breaths got shallow. Rushed. His undamaged hand shook and balled into a fist. Every single muscle vibrated in energy. A deep growl rumbled from his throat as each second passed, and only grew louder.

“<strong>rrrrrrRRRRGGAAAAAAAAA–</strong>”

The ‘man’ rushed the Servant, clawed finger pointed directly at him. “<strong>You. VERMIN.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Underneath that exterior shell of iron, Nikolai revealed himself to be not a man, but a monster. It was a moment of affirmation, when all the little oddities and inconsistencies coalesced into something tangible and real, where all of Lancer&#39;s curiosities and suspicions were confirmed.

And then, in a not unexpected turn of events, Nikolai rushed towards Ryujin, bellowing with fury. At that, the dragon&#39;s eyes narrowed.

Effortlessly, Lancer reached out, grabbing Nikolai mid-charge and pulling him up, off his feet and into the air. How fortunate, that he was already wounded. Had his &quot;Master&quot; been at full strength, it might have been a challenge to stop him. 

<strong>&quot;Tut, tut, tut. You&#39;ve kept me from the truth, Nikolai.&quot;</strong> Ryujin scolded, his tone a low and sinister whisper. <strong>&quot;Are you unaware that the bond between King and Advisor is built upon a foundation of mutual understanding? Allow me to REMIND YOU.&quot;</strong>

<strong>SLAM!</strong> Nikolai was thrown down to the ground, tossed away by Lancer in the same way one might discard trash. With a shake of his head, the dragon turned to leave, walking back the way they came, only to pause at the hefty iron outer door.

<strong>&quot;I have a duty to fulfil. When I return, I expect explanation for your treachery.&quot;</strong>

With that last dubious warning, Ryujin departed, out into the alleyway before disappearing from sight.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was proven further, as he slammed down onto the ground. Tiles cracked around his point of impact, and his arm screamed in agony. Even though he prepared for the fall, with another tap into his Origin, it was certain he’d be sore for a time. Not long, but at all was enough.

At least he had the sense to stay still, but he glared missiles into the back of Lancer as he slithered away. There would be hell to pay.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The scene… this was a dream, right? Lancer had <em>bodied</em> Nikolai, but there was absolutely no WAY that this was Nikolai. Sure, she’d never seen underneath that armor, and he was super secretive about his habits, and yea all she’d ever seen him eat was beef jerky, but–

Oh god, this was probably Nikolai. 

Her eyes darted back to Ryujin, and then back to the ‘person’ still on the ground. This dance continued until the Servant had disappeared, down the alley to who knows where. Only then did she approach her friend, albeit slowly. Each step brought her closer to the agitated, furry man. 

“H-hey, there! Uh, Nikolai? That&#39;s you, right? You’ve, uh, gained a bit of hair, since we’ve last met. Like what you’ve done with it…” she said.

He did not respond but instead stared off into space. Far away, far past the green walls of the office, past Saria. His gaze lay upon a time not known, off in the distance where no one could see. 

She knelt down, and carefully placed a hand on his shoulder, “Well, the doctor’s on the way. Do you, ya know… wanna get up and moving? And maybe tell me what’s going on?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His other hand rubbed his throat, sore from the relatively long explanation. Saria sat opposite of him, in the wooden furniture. She was leaning over the desk, chin in her hands. 

It had been thirty minutes since Ryujin left. Since that bastard had <em>exposed</em> him. After he recovered from his momentary rage, Saria helped him put his armor back on. The doctor, Raphael, had shown up two minutes prior. He had given them both a glance, put the important pieces together in seconds, and got to work. 

“Well, you’ll keep it,” he said. He poked a point of interest, and Nikolai jerked away. 

Raphael pulled his hand back, “Steady, pal. I reckon you ain’t exactly comfortable, but I’d rather fix your hand than anything else.”

“So,” Saria cut in, “how long have <em>you</em> known, Raphy? This whole time?”

He nodded, “ ‘Bout a week after you introduced us. Caught me off guard, but it’s understandable. Smart, too.”

“But… why not me?”

Both looked toward the man in question. Nikolai instead chose to stare at the ground, off to the side. “<strong>Less. Better.</strong>”

Raphael sighed and reached down. His medical bag was lifted and plopped down on the desk. He rummaged through the bag methodically, “Don’t overthink it, Saria. Not everyone wants the world to know their problems. Or deals. You get the idea.”

“Oh, easy for you to say. You got to know day one,” she sank further down into the desk. “Yet here I am. Learning this now. After your Servant pushed your shit in. Terrified he might go for me next. Or you, you looked pretty pissed off too.”

Raphael pulled a roll of gauze and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the bag, “Easy, girl. Man in question is still here, and very much alive.” He poured some of the contents of the bottle onto a piece of gauze. 

“<strong>Another. Topic. Tourney.</strong>” Nikolai said. He only flinched as Raphael wiped his busted hand clean with the cloth. “<strong>Need. Next. Move.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033595276973318194 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033595276973318194><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Oct-22 02:18 PM">14:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Saria crossed her arms, “Maybe you should’ve thought of that earlier. Odds are, you’ve got some teammates that want a shot in the ring themselves. That leaves recon, which you can’t do. It’d be like an earthquake in the glass shop.”

Hmm… teammates. Those would surely muck up his ability to get that wish granted. He could take every single tourney round and fry himself into a true beast, and the other sorry sacks would reap the rewards off his back. 

But he couldn’t do it <em>all</em> on his own. There’d have to be a method to the madness, a plan. Saria was right, but it was hard to turn on allies when he didn’t even know who they were. That was the trade-off for the first round. Prove his worth to a crowd of unknowns. 

“<strong>Way. Clear. Need. Info. Participants.</strong>” he decided.

Raphael stopped his winding of the gauze around his hand and stared, “I’m a doctor, not a spy. Besides, officials prolly keep a close hold on that list of participants. Even if Saria could get a hold on it, she’d be neck-deep up shit creek with no paddle.”

“Well, you know that Thomas guy but he’s on the opposite side. And Mikhail, he’s probably in it, right? No way in hell he isn’t,” Saria said. “Don’t want to pick a fight with that fucker, though.”

Nikolai nodded along. That put their options back at zero if they were generous about the first few. “<strong>Hmm. Hard.</strong>”

People who would join this sort of tournament for Republic are either Mercs or people with eyes on the wish. Anyone who wanted to protect Alexandria would join that side. That narrowed it down, but wasn’t quite enough. 

Saria stared deep into Nikolai’s eyes, a spectator as the gears churned. There was some struggle, but the machine moved all the same. 

“What’re thinking?”

“<strong>Mercs. Nobility. Candidates.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033595746437570681 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033595746437570681><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Oct-22 02:20 PM">14:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Raphael finished wrapping Nikolai’s hand and cut the leftover gauze roll, “Makes sense, I reckon. Former wants the money, latter wants the wish. In all honesty, Alexandria’s likely a pushover, so going for The Republic’ll get them further.”

“Hold on,” Saria perked up in her chair, “won’t that also get me up shit creek? Have you <em>met</em> some of the people we work with? Not to even mention those snobs with more money than they can comprehend. One wrong step and I’m in the slammer. At best.”

Nikolai flexed his hand. Pain echoed, but he&#39;d live. A day of rest and he’d be back in business. Hopefully.

“<strong>I. Believe. In. You.</strong>”

He pushed the chair back and rose to his feet, then grabbed the shield rested to the side. Since Lancer decided to sulk, he’d go and get his gear evaluated. Plenty of time to think about the relationship between the two of them. Ryujin surely had something going on, but the specifics would come in time.

And with how things might go, he’d be too berserk to even figure it out.

“Ugh. Fine, but you better be paying the big z-bucks,” Saria whined. She swung her feet around and back on top of the desk, once again absorbed by her phone. “Three’ll be back soon-ish, so I’d high tail it out of here. I’m telling him you were here, but I’ll spare the deets. You’ll get a bill for the damages right after, though.”

“And I’ll give you one too, along with these,” a bottle was slapped into Nikolai’s free hand. A translucent, orange bottle full of large pills. “Painkillers. Your size, I’d say a fifth of this is a decent dose. A fourth’ll do the trick for sure.”

The armormed man nodded. His account would be dry by the end of the week, but it was well worth it. With a lead, he could formulate a gameplan with Lancer and slowly conquer his way to that damn wish. And then, it wouldn’t matter. Everything would be as right as they could. Right?

Raphael and Nikolai approached the door, with the former winning the race. “Come on, daylight’s wastin’.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
