<strong>Breaking News: ALEXANDRIA LOSES FIRST ROUND OF CITY GRAIL WAR AGAINST REPUBLIC</strong>
By Stela Hemina, 15 March 2105

For our friends overseas, or for those of you who have been living under a rock, a recent dispute between Alexandria and Republic over a forced data transfer has escalated into a full-blown dogfight between the two superpowers. According to statements from Alexandrian officials, &quot;the fact that a Grail War was successfully negotiated with the Republic is both a victory for us and constitutes the best outcome that could have come out of the negotiations.&quot;

There was some skepticism about the legality and feasibility of that decision, as well as a conflict of interest regarding Alexandria&#39;s distaste for violence. It is no secret that Alexandrians are not made to fight battles. Thus, it wasn’t surprising to assume both Alexandria and Republic had to recruit mercenaries from outside their direct jurisdiction to fight their battles in their stead. This City Grail War was proving to be an interesting showdown, and while Alexandria was the clear underdog, the help promised by the Neo Holy Church did well to ease some of the worries of the Alexandrian citizens.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1031973357807226890 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1031973357807226890><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Oct-22 02:53 AM">02:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But a surprise came this Sunday during the first seconds of the first official round of the City Grail War, when two childlike figures emerged from the Alexandrian camp to face their monstrous and gigantic counterparts from Republic. A true David versus Goliath, a direct mirror of their respective patrons in terms of means and influence. One of the Commodan&#39;s spectators said to us, &quot;At first I thought they were bellhops, like there was no way these guys were going to be participating in such a major conflict. But when the bell rang and the blond-haired kid went flying, I immediately knew this was no joke.&quot;

Many Alexandrians felt the same way about the bold, if not downright strange, choice of competitors for their city&#39;s first contenders. While the Servant has raised few questions, as Servants are known for their eccentric forms that have nothing to do with their actual abilities, his Master has not been spared the spotlight. <strong>Thomas Barnes</strong>, a 111 year old whose academic record spanned generations, was the epitome of the typical Alexandrian citizen. While some appreciated the image behind his involvement and his representation of the average Alexandrian in the conflict, others saw him as a misplaced and completely unreasonable choice as a combatant in a Holy Grail War. BasanAhi, a well-known Alexandrian polemicist and part-time content creator, spoke out about this in a video posted shortly after the fight ended, &quot;Librarians are librarians for a reason, and their job is not to fight on the front lines... I don&#39;t care if he can put himself back together after a kamikaze attack, I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s a billion years old, this is serious shit!... Like honestly, these bozos made us look <strong>weak!</strong>&quot;

The fact that two young boys fought for us in the first round is truly outrageous behavior, not in keeping with the careful and thoughtful spirit of Alexandria. Revisions to future rounds and reforms to the HGW division should be our top priority in these difficult times.&quot; And yet, to date, no official statement has been made by Alexandria officials regarding these allegations.

Slander after slander directed at him, and most notably, at Thomas. People attack them on their appearance, on their performance, on the result of their fight. Truthfully, it was to be expected. They had no excuse for themselves. They lost the fight fair and square. They were not up to the task this time.

But still, some of the words in that paper stung. Really stung. 

Thomas was currently lying on the bed next to Lewis, completely unresponsive. Various machines had been hooked up to him. The breathing of the ventilator and the frequent beeping of the heart machine were the only source of atmosphere in the quiet, cold hospital room.

The blond had been unconscious since the end of their fight. He had been immediately appointed to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#asclepeion-hospital</span> as a result. From what Lewis remembers, the doctors diagnosed some kind of traumatic brain damage as well as... something about his magical circuits. Technical terms with which Lewis was unfamiliar. Although his condition had since stabilized somewhat, Thomas still hadn’t woken up from his coma.

Who knew if he would ever wake up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Suddenly, the door to the room was flung open by a blond man in an affluent suit, who quickly shut the door behind him before Lewis could react. He put fingers to his lips in a <em>shhh!</em> expression, eyeing the windows.

A few nurses ran past Thomas&#39;s room, with a few holding flowers and blushing furiously. Clearly, they were after this man, but for what cause? They quickly passed the room, and the man sighed.

Gatsby looked at Lewis, then at Thomas, then at Lewis again. &quot;Ah.&quot; The man said awkwardly, and swallowed. He quickly regained his composure.

&quot;I see, so this is the poor soul who lost.&quot; Gatsby said mournfully, already beginning to tear up. &quot;To think I found him so quickly, and on accident, too.&quot;

Taking a pen and writing into the air, Gatsby produced a get-well card, and gestured towards the nightstand, then at Lewis. &quot;May I?&quot;

It hadn’t been long since the tournament had been over, not even moments after he had been dragged along with medics to the hospital, that they began. Lewis looked at the newspaper, trying to find the big bold words that could give him a glance on what could have been happening in the city. Another announcement of their failure. 

Over the past few days, he had been sitting on his master’s bed, occasionally getting up to wander to the vending machine where only a select few sweet nurses would hand him currency for the snacks inside as he’d take back quietly to his master’s side, nibbling and watching over him. It had taken hours and multiple staff to pry him away from the blonde’s body, his grubby hands clinging to what clothing hadn’t been tattered or shredded from the fight. And when he had been separated, he chose often to stay solitary, only interacting when he felt the need to. Moments where his mastered stirred in his coma were lucky ones, Lewis’ large hopeful blue eyes drifting to the heart monitor to see any changes in the ever consistent beep of the heart monitor, just to feel the disappointment of Thomas not waking. Today was no different. . . Until it was.

Unlike the repetitive pattern Lewis had gotten used to, a clicking of shoes headed toward his door alerted him more than anything, followed by the familiar sense of mana that servants were akin to. It had been quick when he had manifested his musket in his hands and rose it instinctively towards the door, having Gatsby be greeted with the sight of a rifle towards his direction and a protective bleached haired boy sitting by his sleeping master. Lewis eyes locked on with suspicion, something he hadn’t exactly been akin to before having met the malicious servant before. But now, he had enough reason to be suspicious more than ever.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032071116992303174 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032071116992303174><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Oct-22 09:22 AM">09:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Gatsby’s following of paparazzi didnt help, only making the boy worried he could have been someone from the other side, until he spoke, his sentiment making the boy lower his musket a bit, though he still wondered why he had been here. Plenty of questions had already formed, but mainly a statement of <em>who</em> he was needed to be answered first. Barnes would have wanted to know that first anyways. When the affluent man placed the get well card off and asked for the boy’s permission he nodded his head slowly, only then taking the time to speak.

“<em>Who</em> are you and how did you get here accidentally? Barnes didn’t have many visitors besides the nurses. . . And you’re not a nurse.”

Soon, it was filled with various signatures of different hand styles, completely different from one another. 

<em>Get well soon, Barnes! You did your best! Thank you for your support! You stood for us when nobody would, Thomas! Take care of yourself! Please get better!</em>

Gatsby masqueraded a crowd of people writing into a card, before placing it on the nightstand with Lewis&#39;s approval. Gatsby didn&#39;t actually know how to change his style of penmanship, but it just came naturally, somehow.

&quot;Oh? I&#39;m just doing whatever I can, which is admittedly not much. You may call me Gatsby, old sport.&quot; Gatsby beamed at Lewis. &quot;And you&#39;re Meriwether Lewis! It&#39;s always a pleasure to meet a fellow countryman. You mapped the land I lived on, once.&quot; 

Gatsby frowned. &quot;At least, I think so? It&#39;s strange.&quot;

Taking a seat next to Lewis, Gatsby leaned back like the two were old friends. &quot;I may have accidentally created a fan club with the nurses. Please do not tell them I&#39;m here. You seem worse for wear as well, Mister Lewis. Defeat always stings.&quot; The American nodded to himself thoughtfully.

And from the looks of it, everything seemed cheerful and supportive, something he felt his master would need to see from all the slander and controversy the newspapers had brought. It was welcome.

Gatsby’s hadn’t been much for a bell for the boy, at least for now, but the man clearly knew him, reciting his deeds back to the small child. Yes, he did map the land that many had come to live on. He was proud of it, even for a moment. But what had gotten his attention was that he said he was a fellow countryman. Great! America had been something that big slimy lizard had disregarded, but it had created another servant too! Clearly he was wrong, and it was proven by. . . <em>Gatsby</em>. . . Whoever he was. But, just as he was to compliment the man, his odd statement made the boy ask another question. 

“You don’t know if you’re from America? Were from you from another country and came here? How could you forget where you came from?”

Lewis voiced his concern, though he had no idea what to be concerned about. It truly was strange to forget your place of origin! Lewis dematerialized his gun, not choosing to turn his weapon on a supposed American. Now, he had gained an audience with the boy. As Gatsby explained why he had been running from the nurses, Lewis listened intently, hoping he could grasp everything. Occasionally making faces of confusion, to amazement, but once again to the former. He had been running from fans?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032436596215128074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032436596215128074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Oct-22 09:34 AM">09:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Why don’t you want them to know where you are? If they’re your fans, they should be friends right?”

His question was genuine as a newborn babe, curious as to why he’d run from people who had been fans of him somehow. Was he famous? He hadn’t heard of many Gatsbys, and while not many Americans he knew in his time wore fashionable suits, unless he was the president, then he didnt even seem to be put much on the radar for American servants! Odd. Simply odd! Lewis would have asked another had the man not continued on his observation of the duo, both tired yet one worse than expected. The boy looked down in embarrassment.

“It wasn’t what he wanted to do. . . I promised Barnes it’d be fun and now he’s in this state. Not to mention that slimy lizard disrespected America like that, he doesn’t even seem to like the idea of America at all! And I worked hard with Jefferson to help it!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m from <em>North Dakota</em>, old sport. At least, I should be?&quot; Gatsby manifested his checkbook into his hand, which swapped between a machine gun, cane, a book called <em>Tender is the Night</em>, and finally <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. He pointed at the book.

&quot;Technically, I&#39;m from here. This bundle of pages is my home, but is it <em>my home</em>?&quot; Gatsby mused. &quot;<strong>Did I truly exist in history, or am I the product of Fitzgerald&#39;s tendency to self-insert himself into a more likeable character?</strong> I don&#39;t know. It certainly feels real, but maybe I&#39;m not. It&#39;s a strange feeling, see.&quot;

Gatsby became silent for a spell as he looked at Thomas. The idea of maybe existing but not never really bothered him, but for some reason, it irked him now. Shoving the thoughts away, he laughed at Lewis&#39;s next question.

&quot;No, no. I gave them flowers and now they keep trying to win my affection. Friends, yes. I cannot risk treating people as any more than that. But, old sport, I can&#39;t tell them that my heart is already set on my loving Daisy! If she saw me with another woman, she would cry!&quot;

Gatsby spoke of Daisy with such conviction, as if she were in the room right now. It was clear that he thought the world of her.

&quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think your Master needs more company.&quot; Gatsby nodded towards Thomas. &quot;The more the merrier is a sham in this moment, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

The fact that Zahhak would even dare to disrespect America made Gatsby&#39;s stomach churn. &quot;<strong>IMPOSSIBLE!</strong>&quot; Gatsby cried, causing Lewis to jolt slightly. &quot;America is a wonderful place, full of opportunity and excitement! That anyone would dare mock it... When I get my hands on that lizard...&quot;

Finally, someone who agreed with Lewis about the wonders of America!

Oxygen levels rose, the previously stationary numbers on the machine screens oscillated, until finally...

<strong>Thomas&#39;s eyes opened</strong>.

First there was the faint hum of the hospital&#39;s white lights. Then the beeping of the heart machine. The quiet breaths he was fed from the ventilator. Finally, the words spoken by the two servants. His eyes squinted at their first taste of light in two days, and his aching muscles moved slowly until he sat down on the hospital bed.

What was that on his mouth? Thomas&#39; hand went to the ventilator on his face, grabbing it and pulling it away from his mouth. His eyes looked around the room. Everything he could see was white, except for two people with indescribable features. He blinked a few times. It seemed that his eyes had not yet fully adjusted to the bright hospital light.

His thoughts moved like molasses. His memories were blurred. To top it all, it seemed as if a silent pain was slowly simmering in his head. He slowly began to regret waking up, but there was no way he could go back to sleep now. He turned to the two figures besides him.

&quot;Where...&quot; A hoarse, incredibly dry, barely audible voice came from his mouth. Startled, Thomas stopped and cleared his throat, but the discomfort did not go away. It seemed that his vocal cords had been damaged in some way. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out the meaning of his one word. The puzzled expression on Thomas&#39; face spoke volumes:

Where am I?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He hadn’t expected there to be a north, back then he called it just Dakota. Good to see there was a north one and a south one now. Lewis looked in amazement, well surely he had been someone who was from America if he was from <em>North Dakota</em>. As Gatsby had gone and and showed the boy the book he came from, Lewis nodded. Ah, so he was a character from that book. . . The. . . <em>The Great Gatsby. . .</em> Thats what it said.

“Well even if you’re from there, then you’re American! Book or not! That’s that! Whoever this Fitz. . . Fitz-<em>Jerry</em> is should be thanked because you’re from my favorite place in the whole wide world!”

He sounded matter of fact of it, regardless of how the man felt. And with his mind on the idea him saying this should at least be of some comfort towards the man. Gatsby went on, going on about this and that and a flower named Daisy who he seemed smitten with, though Lewis had no idea what a flower could have done with a man’s love, but he didn’t judge. After all, maybe the book had him always fall in love with flowers, Lewis had loved sweet treats, but he felt Gatsby’s love and his love were likely two separate things. Or maybe it was a lady. But, what parent would name their child after a flower?! Were there people named Tulips running about? He thought not.

“Well you’re right! Barnes isn’t in the best condition, but nurses are here to help. . . So, i don’t know. If you say not to bring any, I’ll believe you, but only because you wrote a note to Barnes, and because you agree America is exciting, I think the same!”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032824928438845611 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032824928438845611><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Oct-22 11:17 AM">11:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Just as he had finished his words, a stirring under his body alerted him.

Lewis turned his head, and to his amazement, his master finally opened his eyes. 

“Barnes! You’re awake!”

He didn’t say much about him removing medical gear because frankly, he didn’t know what they were to do. The nurses just said for Lewis to not touch them because they were to help Thomas, but if <em>Thomas</em> removed them, then wouldn’t the nurses be happy? The boy focused his attention on Thomas, almost entirely forgetting that he had been speaking to Gatsby beforehand.

“You’re at the doctors! The nurses put you in here and I waited forever for you to come back! Luckily, you’re here!“

His servant paid attention to his hoarse voice, but hadnt commented on it, wasn’t that what happened when you woke up from a long nap? Rather, he focused on the fact that his master was awake more than anything! Lewis scooted off the edge of the hospital bed, quick to try to give Thomas some room. . . After a moment of time, the boy asked, his voice not as excited from before, but still present for Thomas. 

“Are you feeling better?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Splendid!&quot; Gatsby said, eyeing the magus as if he were an explosive (he was). If he blew himself up right here, would Gatsby survive it?

The thought was dusted away with the fires of shame. This poor soul had fought for Alexandria&#39;s defense when few would, and had destroyed himself for a desperate attack. That took guts, and Gatsby was <em>ostracizing</em> him for it? That was the nonsense that had turned Paganini into a Berserker, and the same nonsense that had led to him being ostracized, even after moving to Hollywood—

Gatsby blinked. Hollywood? He had never been there.

&quot;Old sport, I&#39;m Jay Gatsby!&quot; Gatsby said, waving his hands in front of Thomas&#39;s eyes and towering over Lewis. &quot;You are safe. How was your self-imposed demolition run?&quot;

Gatsby stared at Thomas, and suddenly a massive rectangle of <em>words</em> appeared above Thomas, too tightly packed for Lewis or Thomas to read. 

&quot;Ah, I see.&quot; Gatsby&#39;s tone was one of intrigue. Was it good news or not?

Thomas&#39; eyes widened in disbelief as the words hit his eardrums. Why was the white-haired boy speaking so slowly? What&#39;s with the unnaturally low tone? <strong>Why did he not understand the words?</strong> Thomas looked at the blond-haired man for any signs of acknowledgement over this surreal speech, but then…

Ssooo... hheee... awaaaaakessss... !

Thomas&#39;s heart rate went up a notch. Something was wrong with this situation. Something critical. If he had heard correctly, the kid had said something about doctors. A quick glance around confirmed his words. Those machines he was hooked to and those cables that ran through his arms and chest, they looked like they belonged in a hospital. Looking down, he also seemed to be wearing some sort of white hospital garb.

Gatsby&#39;s rectangle of words went unnoticed as Thomas pondered his situation. Had he been drugged by the hospital staff? That must be it. There was no other explanation for why everything seemed so...so slow. Not just the words, but his movements, and his breathing. Now that he had properly woken up, <strong>he was constantly aware of how slow everything was</strong>.

Thomas suddenly winced as a sharp, stabbing pain hit his head. It was as if a rodent was slowly trying to eat its way out of his skull. He pinched the bridge of his nose in a futile effort to dull the pain, and as he did so, his thoughts slowly drifted back as he tried to make sense of his stay in the hospital. He massaged his throat a bit as he turned back to the two Servants.

&quot;What...&quot; Thomas struggled with a weak, hoarse voice, as if the words had gone through a dozen graters before reaching Lewis and Gatsby&#39;s ears.&quot;...happened? Speak...faster...please.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

How he spoke, as if everything had been going slow as molasses was enough to make Lewis turn his head in confusion. He still didn’t get what happened. Lewis tried to explain it again. 

“We are speaking fast Barnes! I said you’re at the doctors! The doctors put you here and said you have to be here for a bit! Got it? You were sleep for a two days! I waited here right by your side and made sure no one got close to you after that big bully beat us. And then today this man came by! His name is Gatsby, and he likes daises and he brought you this note!”

Lewis went to the counter, grabbing one of the small paper cups and filled it with cold water along with the card Gatsby had made, bringing it back to Thomas. He would need the water anyways, and the note was simply for the thanking. Had the boy taken both, Lewis would watch his master intently, something strange kept nagging at the boy. . . Why was he acting so slow? Did he hit his head and he thought they were slow too? It made it sound like it. Lewis looked at Gatsby for a moment to see if maybe he had deduced something. . . . Nope. Nothing.

He was about to question his master’s peculiar behavior when his attention was snagged by a giant box! The once white insides becoming filled with hundreds and then thousands of black specs that filled it. It looked like ants all scurrying about! Lewis tried to inch closer to it, confused as to what it could have been, when Gatsby let out an interested sound.

“What is it? What is it? What do you see?”

He gestured at it vaguely, before speaking extremely quickly, as if his voice were put into a record player and sped up.

&quot;When I was penned into the world, people envisioned me as a sort of symbol for American prosperity. Every sentence in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> has been overanalyzed. The book is a patchwork of symbols, as am I.&quot;

To demonstrate, Gatsby pinched his arm slightly, and it blurred before Lewis&#39;s eyes, and skin became words before Lewis&#39;s eyes.

<em>This is a valley of ashes — a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens.</em>

&quot;If I&#39;m a symbolic idea, then every person represents something, see? An ideal, a dream, or something. You&#39;re like a little microcosm of the American Frontier, Lewis.&quot; Gatsby pinched the explorer&#39;s cheek. &quot;Thomas is far more complicated.

And all because of a ‘big bully’? But who was this bully, and what did he do to him?

Before he could answer those questions, the man spoke up. His skilled tongue allowed his words to ring true to Thomas&#39; ears. He had clearly understood everything this time.

&quot;My... oldest memory...?&quot; He repeated in his raspy voice, wincing once more as the pain in his head thickened.

What was his oldest memory? Thomas scoured the archives of his brain, trying to answer Gatsby&#39;s question... but with each digging, the pain in his head grew greater. Three times more, four times more, ten times more. It was like trying to open a locked door, except the handle was burning hot and spiky. The harder he tried, the more he winced. The pain steadily increased until he couldn&#39;t take it anymore, burying his head in his hands to try to ease it… but after a while, he started breathing heavily, sweating bullets as he realized the situation.

&quot;I... don&#39;t...&quot; He began, once again trying to access his memories...

His stomach dropped. His heart threatened to explode. A cold, tyrannical urgency was building inside him. How could he not remember anything? This wasn&#39;t right. It wasn&#39;t right. He plunged back into his memories, taking the pain in stride as he searched for something... anything!!! Anything that would make him <em>him</em>. 

But alas...

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Thomas spoke the word, his unfocused gaze and trembling lip betraying his inner panic. &quot;I remember... <strong>nothing</strong>.&quot;

A familiar feeling of wanting to puke washed over him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No idea what Gatsby had. Over analyzing the book? They had symbols? America had the bald eagle as a symbol of itself. . . Was his also that? To demonstrate what he meant, the boy would see a plethora of words,  though while Gatsby may have recognized them, Lewis could only see that they had been what described something. But what was a valley to do with anything? He didn’t know. What he did know however, was he was America’s Frontier symbol supposedly. Then again, didn’t he always know that?

“I know I’m from America’s frontier, I sailed it! Me and Clark and Sacs!”

That symbol stuff was cool, but that’s the basics of him, he thought. What was his symbol besides being in America’s frontier! He wanted to know that! He was going to ask Gatsby another loaded question when he asked Thomas about his memories. Did he also know about them? Or did he simply have the symbol of a memory? Both were plausible, but then one was more important. 

Lewis looked back to Thomas, hoping he’d give an answer towards what was his oldest memory. Was it when he had made bubble tea for them? Or when he summoned the lad? Was it before then? He was almost too excited for the answer, and yet what Thomas said was none of them! He couldn’t remember <em>anything</em> was what he had said, but that wasn’t what confused him. What confused him was his worry! Of course he said it before, but his memory was bad! So, that’s what he had books for! Lewis observed a bit, confused as to why he had been so panicked over it. He said it before right? He wrote things down in those books of his for this exact reason! The American pat the side of the master’s shoulder, his concern showing but not to overtake him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033217267393118258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033217267393118258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Oct-22 01:16 PM">13:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Don’t worry, that’s why you have those fancy books!

His solution was there. Thomas, no matter how concerned couldnt say he was technically <em>wrong</em> with that. If he had books there, those contained information of everything he had, and if he had said he had bad memory, then what was the difference from now and then?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A shame, that.&quot; Gatsby said, scratching his chin. He snapped his fingers, and the box of words contracted into a small orb, before bursting into a spectacle of golden sparkles.

Thomas&#39;s situation was terrible. He had lost in a spectacular way for Alexandria, and all he had to show for it was a fake card that was filled with Gatsby&#39;s genuine thoughts. Though, wasn&#39;t this a blessing, in a small way?

&quot;You&#39;re a lot luckier than you think, old sport.&quot; Gatsby said, locking eyes with the magus. &quot;After what has happened to you, maybe lacking your memories is the best event flag that can happen. Few people get opportunities to rewrite their own chapters in the book of life after they&#39;ve already been printed.&quot;

Gatsby&#39;s eyes were unnerving. As a magus, it was clear to determine that Gatsby had Mystic Eyes, yet his pupils were hazy and undefined, like a distant light in a misty harbor.

&quot;That&#39;s something I know far too well. Lewis is an adventurer by heart. Let him guide you on an adventure that lets you see a world free from burden! Write your own story! Do not be stuck on the track of a plot written by another!&quot;

A fictional character like him would never get an opportunity like this. A Heroic Spirit could not revise their own past, and that was double for someone who had been written about by an author.

&quot;<strong>Do not turn out like me.</strong>&quot; 

That hopeful gaze was turned into one of yearning, before quickly vanishing again as there was a knock on the window. The three jumped and turned to look at it.

A nurse, gaping, was pointing at Gatsby.

&quot;Drat! I&#39;ve been found out, old sports!&quot; Gatsby cursed, fumbling with his checkbook. &quot;I must escape, posthaste. Lewis, we must meet again and talk about America and your companions! My door is always open. You&#39;re an explorer, so I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll find me. Think of it as part of the challenge!&quot;

Gatsby nodded to Thomas, and scampered to the door.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033267752858820658 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033267752858820658><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Oct-22 04:37 PM">16:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Toodleoo, old sports!&quot; Gatsby said before sprinting out the door, only to be followed by a mob of nurses.

And exhaled. And inhaled. And exhaled. And he kept doing so as calmly as he could while listening to the boy. Fancy books… he kept books? He couldn&#39;t remember ever doing such a thing... but the kid seemed intent and sure of himself when he spoke. Thomas nodded shyly at this information, his concern somewhat assuaged by the friendly tap on his shoulder. These books, if they existed, would certainly be very helpful in finding what he had lost.

For some reason, Thomas was intrigued by Gatsby&#39;s cloudy eyes. He didn&#39;t know... or rather didn&#39;t remember anything about Mystic Eyes at all, but his <em>instincts</em> told him that they were special, somehow. That they were something to look out for. Thus he listened carefully to the man’s words. The message was clear as day:

<strong>His memory loss was a blessing in disguise</strong>.

He talked about books, about people imagining him in some form or another, about writing his own story. Thomas could not understand his bravado, for even the concept of a Servant eluded him. But the severity of his advice, <strong>that of not becoming like him</strong>, struck a chord within him. Ignoring the sheer regret with which the phrase was spoken was difficult. Even if only for a second, the man seemed truly alone and vulnerable.

For the first time since waking up, Thomas felt concerned for someone other than himself, despite knowing almost nothing about the man.

That same man quickly fled the scene when the nurses got wind of him. An impromptu and frankly silly exit that left Thomas with a weak but amused smile on his lips. 

&quot;...he&#39;s quite popular, isn&#39;t he.&quot; Thomas said, weakly holding Lewis&#39; hand as he looked at the open door.

Now, there was one thing left for Thomas to know. He turned to the boy, gripping his hand more intently.

 &quot;May I ask what your name is?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="23-Oct-22 11:20 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
