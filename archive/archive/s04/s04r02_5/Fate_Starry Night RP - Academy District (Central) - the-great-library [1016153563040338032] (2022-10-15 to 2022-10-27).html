The air of early dawn was cold and fresh as it wove its way across the city’s many canals, causing ripples atop the water that scattered the morning sunlight like diamonds spilled across the surface. In the waking hours of the city, its streets were still moderately sparse, but naturally activity had already long begun. Small business-owners opened shutters and diligently wiped their store-fronts, gondolas carried anything from goods to people, and the occasional mage late to work could be seen skating along the mana rails while trying not to lose hold on any of their belongings.

A pair of Master and Servant joined this pleasant bustle.

Electing not to walk the ground, Ā-Q&#236;ng playfully strode atop the rails separating street from canal, though her usual balancing game was bereft of her usual joy and simply done as a distraction to keep her mind occupied as it sorted out its thoughts. Having kept Alexander waiting for long enough, she finally spoke up shortly after exiting their Hotel’s main entrance.

“There is a story I want you to listen to first, Master.”

There was light in her eyes, but it was dim.
A smile on her lips, yet it was empty.

It wasn’t like she had been lying to him up until now, let alone pretending to be someone else, but it was a much subtler change than that. Even if murky, a river remained a river, simply preventing an observer from being able to see what had collected at its bottom. Only now the trickle of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s words flowed clear and pure, offering her Master a peek at her heart.

“There was once a venomous Jade Serpent that lived alone in the mountains. It owned a flock of goats which it treasured very dearly, so much so that it would even repel a giant ape that would try to harm them. The Serpent’s fangs were sharp, so it was able to hurt the ape despite being much smaller, but the ape would return. Again and again. And the Serpent would hurt it. Again and again. Before long the Serpent realized that it enjoyed fighting the ape, even if it caused it great pain.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng kept her fingers interlocked behind her back, her face hidden from Alexander’s view as she gazed wistfully into the azure sky.

He was gentle and treated the Serpent with much kindness, so it quickly fell in love with him. But the nice man already had a lover, someone he treasured more than anyone, even more than the Serpent treasured its own goats, but the Serpent couldn’t accept that. It was jealous. It wanted the man for itself. And so it sought to kill the woman. But the woman…

“Once taking a single look at the woman, the Serpent found that it could not kill her. She was too beautiful. More beautiful than the sun or moon or even the stars. With just a single glance, the Serpent grew to admire this woman, to worship her, and ashamed of its own selfishness it slithered away back towards the mountain it came from, never to be seen again.”

Having seemingly come to the conclusion of her tale, Ā-Q&#236;ng raised her finger to tease its continuation.

“Of course the Serpent never stopped regretting what she did, but there was nothing she could do. The woman was dead, and she was at fault. Then she died without being able to do anything about it, and sometime later she came back to life and decided to be good instead, but then she found out that she was never the only one. There are a lot more Serpents spreading a lot more venom all the time, and…”

Helpless and weak.

Halting her pace and facing her Master once more, she insecurely admitted, “...I just do not know what to think about it.

“Until yesterday I always thought that evil would always be defeated by good, with small exceptions here and there, but to think that it wasn’t just Serpents that spread unhappiness, but people too… it makes the world seem a lot more sad.”

Her tale thus complete, Ā-Q&#236;ng now sought an answer. Head cautiously tilted, as if hesitating to pose the question, she inquired, “So what do you think? Do you also think the world became a lot more ugly because the Serpent stole its beauty because it was jealous? If only the woman was still alive. I think everybody would understand, you know? How silly it is to make the world uglier than it already is…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Had Ā-Q&#236;ng been his own child, he would have prompted them to get down. However, he trusted Lancer was acrobatic and durable enough to maneuver the railings. For the most part, Alexander accompanied the servant in silence. She seemed intent on going to the library before sharing her feelings.

Hearing Ā-Q&#236;ng break the silence, Alexander’s eyes would turn towards her. The girl intended to tell her story and inform her master of her sorrows. Listening to Ā-Q&#236;ng speak, Alexander’s face would turn towards the floor. He carefully listened to every word she spoke, digesting her story fully. Ā-Q&#236;ng did not specify it to be her own tale; however, Alexander could not think of any other reason why she would speak it.

Alexander took a few moments of silence to ponder both his servant’s story and her question. Despite her often cheery attitude, Ā-Q&#236;ng carried torturous baggage; such was to be expected of a servant. They all had a reason for a second chance, after all.

“Ā-Q&#236;ng, there is no such order in the world. Good and Evil are things we are taught, unnatural attributes applied to natural things. The serpent did not choose to be venomous; it did not choose to be jealous. Instead, I propose that these things are natural to its being, don&#39;t you agree?” Alexander fixed his glasses as he spoke, his personal ideals flowing from his mouth. 

“I think the world is made uglier every day. Sadness is part of life, whether it is natural such as the death of a loved one, or unnatural through the actions of people.” As Alexander spoke, his mind wandered to his dead wife. Her death was his deepest scar; his philosophy and his actions were an attempt to move on from such pain. “Despite this, I do not have the correct answer to your question Ā-Q&#236;ng. The serpent had no choice in the direction of its life; perhaps the evil you see now is the same. Perhaps these things are evil because w</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032028229432770601 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032028229432770601><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Oct-22 06:31 AM">06:31</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>e were taught to see them as so.”

Alexander stared back at Ā-Q&#236;ng, curious to see if she had a response. Alexander’s answer may not have been the one Lancer was looking for. However, it was what he believed. The collective knowledge of people was flawed, not the world itself. He sympathized with Ā-Q&#236;ng’s story; he saw her pain as the result of the world he hated so much. His entire goal was to change that world, to rid it of biases. Before revealing all of his thoughts and goals, he first wanted to know what Ā-Q&#236;ng thought.

Ā-Q&#236;ng stared at Alexander in utter bewilderment, wide-eyed and breath caught in her lungs, forgetting even to breathe as he shared his view of the world with her.

“All the pain I caused was normal? Just the natural outcome?”

Her chest began to ache and her throat to burn. The air trapped in her lungs was slowly building up pressure, but still Ā-Q&#236;ng neglected to release her breath as she was confronted with a notion so utterly ridiculous and… forgiving?
To say that her venom was simply the natural course of nature was to absolve her of any crime and responsibility, forgiving her every act no matter how heinous or barbaric. What purpose did the concepts of good and evil serve if they were simply imagined labels conjured up by outdated scholars attempting to bestow order upon the lawless flow of life, and for what reason did mankind continue to cling to this erroneous understanding when all it brought them was guilt and self-doubt?

“Pff-”

A strained sound breached her lips as her body could hold its breath no longer, but the shape it took was quite unexpected.

“-ha… hahahahahaha!”

Tears started to form at the corner of her eyes, wiped away into the sleeves of her puffy cardigan, only to leave slightly reddened marks to mark their short-lived presence.

It was hard to tell exactly how she took her Master’s wisdom, whether she truly even understood his intent and whether she was able to take it even if she did. But all became clear when she once more faced him directly, no longer turning away from him as there was nothing left for her to hide, a soft smile to greet him with. It was neither happy nor sad, sitting uncannily in the valley that existed between them, but one thing was clear even to the most untrained of eyes. Her current expression was bereft of the previous doubt that plagued her. She had not abandoned the weight she had chosen to carry on her shoulders of course, but for once it seemed like she finally knew what to do with it. Even if-...

“...what you said was stupid, Master.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng giggled at her harmless insult, a vocal expression of her relief, but a sharpness remained in her eyes as they continued to be locked on Alexander’s own.

It is a way to distance yourself from your part in this world and run away from your responsibility… like I have. Heh. So perhaps that really does just make me a force of nature then?”

She was quick to playfully shake her hands in a manner that conveyed that she was just joking, though one could not help but find a kernel of truth in her jest.

“Still. Thinking that way is a small comfort. A very gentle sort of forgiveness, and for that I am thankful, but if it is a choice between being natural or not, I would rather be abnormal. Enjoying fighting I can accept, even if people get hurt because of it, and the same goes for all the other problems I have caused, but there is one thing I can never forgive.”

“The woman from the story,” Ā-Q&#236;ng’s tone hardened ever so slightly as she braced herself to utter just a single name, “Her name was Xī Shī.”

The mere sound of it seemed to silence the world around them, as it too allowed itself a brief pause to behold it, though perhaps it was simply the reverence and care with which Ā-Q&#236;ng treated this particular name that gave off such an impression.

Geese would fall from the sky, flowers would wilt, and even the moon would hide because it felt too embarrassed to be in her presence. And I was the one who killed her. I stole her from the world, and now everything is normal again. Normal and natural and ugly.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng heaved a deep sigh. The admittance of her crime no longer caused her pain as it did before, but it still cast a somber shadow over her features. Alexander’s words had helped her accept that her actions were simply a natural progression of events, an act as ordinary as cattle feeding on grass, only now viewed through a different lens, and while this view brought her comfort, she rejected it nonetheless.

“But it is weird. Nothing has changed, but I do not feel as heavy as I did before. Perhaps talking really did help?

“I still do not fully agree with what you said, but I also have never lived in a world without Xī Shī, so perhaps that is impossible for me. Still. Your way of thinking is cold and distant.

Perhaps his words had just gone right over her head, or maybe she really did understand his thoughts but just found them truly absurd. Either way Lancer&#39;s reaction was far from what he expected. Even more she proclaimed that his response was &#39;stupid&#39; yet the look on Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s face indicated that she still derived something of significance from the statement. 

Although the servant had looked to internalize Alexander&#39;s words she continued to verbally reject them. Hearing about Xī Shī, Alexander could somewhat understand how Lancer felt. She believed that she robbed the world of something truly magnificent, a sin that could not be undone. Ā-Q&#236;ng spoke words of admiration for the very woman she killed. It was a painful existence, one that many wouldn&#39;t be able to endure. 

&quot;Cold and distant?&quot; Alexander repeated these words in light of Lancer&#39;s question. He had never seen his viewpoint as such. It was reality, one he was willing to face and change for the better. Still Ā-Q&#236;ng wasn&#39;t entirely wrong. It was a philosophy that kept Alexander from indulging in smaller pleasantries, absorbing him into the things that mattered and rejecting activities that offered no progress to his goals. 

&quot;I suppose I was raised to see the world this way, Ā-Q&#236;ng. My entire life was inside a velvet room studying politics and philosophy. The only world I&#39;ve ever known was through a textbook. I see things for what they are worth and nothing else, as if they were words on a page. This mentality is required for an effective leader...&quot; Alexander paused after his brief justification. He had spoken his worlds with a cool bravado that had been instilled in him. However, just this once he would be willing to break character. It was only fair, Lancer had opened up to him, he may as well return the favor.

&quot;Though, there was a slight reprieve from my studies. I only had one friend</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032541269819412480 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032541269819412480><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Oct-22 04:30 PM">16:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>in all of my life, her name was Helen, and she would become my first wife. She was my opposite through and through. She clicked well with other people, empathized with even the smallest creatures. She was smart and cunning, she knew how to make me smile. Helen was the best mother our children could have ever asked for and the only person I ever needed. I think you two would have gotten along really well.&quot; Alexander&#39;s speech would waver as he spoke, his throat grew sore holding back all emotion. However, if Ā-Q&#236;ng payed close enough attention she would see a smile drawn across Alexander&#39;s face. It was the first time she had seen a glimpse of happiness on his face and perhaps the last.

&quot;All things end Ā-Q&#236;ng, even love. When Helen died I turned back to my work. She was the better half of me, the part that kept me anchored to any sense of decency. This much I can admit.&quot; Alexander&#39;s front teeth bit tightly on his lip, his demeanor rapidly changing. &quot;Macedon is what&#39;s important to me now, it&#39;s not just a city but an empire. I&#39;m going to use my power to free the world from crooked knowledge. If we can all start again, all of the pain, ugliness and coldness of the world won&#39;t have to exist.&quot; Alexander thought the way he did because he believed it to be an inevitable truth. A truth that he intended to change.

To specify Helen as his first implied the consequent marriage to a second, one who had already been named in Alexander’s self-introduction upon summoning his Servant, but considering the sheer quantity of his fathered children it was difficult to tell whether or not Anita was just one of many others to have filled the gap left by Helen’s passing.
This was clearly a sensitive topic whoever, one near and dear to her Master’s heart, and thus Ā-Q&#236;ng remained quiet and carefully listened as Alexander shared with her his own plight. Oddly enough, it bore some resemblance to hers.

“We are not that different then, Master. Perhaps that is how you managed to summon me in the first place?” she mused, resuming their journey as she started walking backwards, still precariously balanced atop the rails yet showing no signs of slipping.

“I think I would have been happy to meet Helen as well if she were still alive. She sounds a lot nicer than my mother. I would always end up getting scolded if I came back home late or if I got my clothes dirty back when I was not good enough to beat Grandpa White when playing yet. That is why I learned how to get better so I would not get dirty. But still she would be mad at me when I did not behave. When I hurt soldiers for cutting up my goats. And when I brought strangers to our home. I could never hide anything from her, and when I tried, I would always get in trouble. I always hated that about her, but most of all…”

“...she was always there when I went to bed; always woke me up before the sun came up. She would make me hot ginger tea in winter and tell me stories when it was raining. And when I ran back home crying after what I did to Xī Shī, she gave me a hug and told me that everything would be alright.

“What I am trying to say is… I was happy to never be alone. I think you were too when Helen was still around. But right now you are alone again. And your children are too.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng stared off into the winding canals for a minute as she thought of how best to give voice to her thoughts, her eyebrows and forehead scrunched up in deep contemplation.

“When I first came here I was just running away, you know? It was scary thinking about what I did to Xī Shī, but thanks to you and Mister Fox it is a little easier now. Xī Shī is gone now, and I am never going to be able to forget her, so I think I am going to start looking for something left that is beautiful in this world. Just yesterday I thought there were only ugly things left, but after hearing about how happy you were with Helen I changed my mind.
That is what I want to do. But what about you?”

“I do not understand what you mean by using your power to free the world from crooked knowledge’ or ‘starting again’, but if that is what you want to do then I want to help you.”

“How-ev-er!” assuming an authoritative stance, Ā-Q&#236;ng put effort into pronouncing each individual syllable for added impact.

“When I felt crushed after what I did to Xī Shī, my mother saved me. I am sure you must have felt just as sad when Helen died, alone and broken. But did you know-?”

Hopping off the railing, she landed gracefully on her feet as she let her Master patiently wait for the answer to her question. A vibrant wave of magical energy washed over him as his Servant’s heel clicked on the asphalt, soaking the earth with the verdant hue of her body’s vitality. Ripples appeared on the water. Just one at first, but in time the surface bubbled as more and more shadows started to appear from underneath, until with a playful splash, a number of carefully arranged clusters of bamboo sprouted next to the fence.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1032699348024315975 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1032699348024315975><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Oct-22 02:58 AM">02:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The sun shone brightly that day, relentlessly leering down at the exposed concrete of Alexandria’s civilian walkways and water channels, yet with a jade splash, nature returned to man’s creation, the sky-ward reaching bamboo stalks now providing shade for the nearby passers-by. A refreshing scent of crisp mountain air now lingered in the area. They were not meant to obstruct of course, merely framing the one’s view of the canal like a painting and sticking close enough to the railings so as to not steal precious space away from the gondolas depending on the water for traversal.
It was a gorgeous sight, not at all out of place in Alexandria’s focus on aesthetic city planning, making it seems like an official incentive to beautify its iconic water system.

Still slightly leant forward, Ā-Q&#236;ng gazed at her work as she spoke, “Each stalk is not alone, you know? They all share the same root, especially in tight clusters like those, and each sprout is part of one big family. Helen might not be here anymore, but you still have your children, no? She helped to raise them with you, so they must have loved her just as much as you did. I know that I loved my mother very much, so I think I would have been very sad if she left me alone one day.”

“Then again,” chuckling in a self-deprecating manner, Ā-Q&#236;ng must have found her own words somewhat amusing, “I have decided to spend this second life of mine selfishly, so I am in no position to judge. Just… remember that children are always happier when they are not alone.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The memories were warm and understanding of her mother&#39;s place in her life. As a father Alexander understood how hard it was for children to know why their parents acted the way they did, but Ā-Q&#236;ng seemed to have a pleasant understanding of her mother&#39;s love. 

Alexander&#39;s stomach would drop as Lancer mention the notion of loneliness. She wasn&#39;t wrong, he was a particularly lonely individual. Despite being surrounded by family Alexander was always alone, facing his worries as a one man army, viewing the world as a battlefield littered with discourse and sorrow. However, Ā-Q&#236;ng mentioned something that Alexander had never taken into consideration... Were his children lonely? Since Helen&#39;s death he pushed away all of the children they had together, sending them to live far away and to indulge in their studies. The kids he had with Anita weren&#39;t raised nearly as hands on with the exception of his heir, Atalanta.

Above all else, Alexander&#39;s mind wondered what Lancer would really think of his plan for the world. Would she still be willing to side with him if she knew about his conquest and the people who suffered in his name. In the end It didn&#39;t matter, she didn&#39;t have to know. He was just happy to have someone on his side.

Alexander would step back as Ā-Q&#236;ng lept from the railing, creating a rising patch of bamboo to form an artistic scene in front of the pair. It was magnificent display of Lancer&#39;s home scenery. Given the current conditions of the world, Alexander had never seen such a thing up close before. 

&quot;Perhaps you are right Ā-Q&#236;ng... I just might call my children tonight and tell them of my adventures with a loud mouthed martial art enthusiast.&quot; Alexander cracked a grin as he spoke. For the first time Ā-Q&#236;ng had experienced his attempt at humour. &quot;Ā-Q&#236;ng, if you intend to live this life selfishly then I suppose it&#39;s only fair I help you achieve that goal.

Though she had never even met her Master’s offspring, the sentiment of seeking out one’s parents when feeling lonely was something shared by all. Not even becoming an ageless Heroic Spirit could rid her of that desire, and so it stood to reason that it would only be more pronounced with those that yet lived.

Her smile froze at Alexander’s playful prodding however.

“I see, so you were a mean person after all. That means no holding back for our next play-session. Even Grandpa White only learned not to ride my goats without permission after I broke his bones once or twice~”

Ā-Q&#236;ng declared so proudly, answering her Master’s pointed humor with an innocuous threat of her own, though her comically exaggerated scowl made it clear that she was only bluffing. At least in part.

Regardless, her act quickly melted away at his mention of their destination, reminding her that they had yet to cover much of the distance that laid between them, thus urging her to resume her pace in the form of nimble little hops that were faster than walking, but not quite on the level to force her Master to change his current stride.

“Going to the library is a little unrelated. The nice fox I met yesterday, Reynard, he talked to me about our stories being written down and told to other people. That is why we have not been forgotten. If so… I just want to see if anybody remembers what happened to Xī Shī. I know she died. It was me that did it, even if I did not mean to, but I ran before I could know for sure. So now I want to know for sure. Even if it took me becoming a Servant not to be afraid of finding out anymore.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng casually folded her hands behind her back again as she moved down the street in measured bounces, perhaps making a game of imagined footholds she arbitrarily placed on the ground in her mind. Looking back at her Master over the shoulder, she returned the topic to him.

“What about you? Now that we know who our allies are, what do you want to do next? Even if I am still unsure about the loud Master from yesterday, I think he and Caster are actually nice. They just do not seem like it at first. But the dragon on the news… even if we are on the same side, I do not want to work with him.

He didn&#39;t take the time to warn Lancer that the answer she finds might not be what she wants, he assumed that she was already well aware of that possiblity, in fact it was probably what she expected.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what kind of people our allies are, we are obligated to help them, and I will do so if need be.&quot;.

Thankfully she was quick enough to turn her face away, she hoped, the curtain of her hair serving to veil her expression from the man who held her reins.

She did not answer the authority with which he issued his rational yet cold reminder, instead ignoring it and moving on. To the perceptive eye it was clear. This was not the forgetfulness of an inattentive child, but a deliberate act to avoid a confrontation born from conflicting views.

“Technology… just like the rocks you shoot with your stick?”

Ā-Q&#236;ng casually continued the conversation, her aim not necessarily to sate her interest of what the world considered ‘modern technology’ in this day and age, though it would be a lie to say that she did not listen to her Master regale her of his Kingdom’s might and glory at all, albeit with clearly lessened interest.

In time they finally made it to the library, a welcome distraction for the recuperating pair, but as one could have expected, the answers which Ā-Q&#236;ng sought would not be so easily revealed. Even in a library as big as Alexandria’s. Or perhaps its overwhelming size was at fault to begin with?

Tales of her living. It contained them all.
One posited that she died the moment Ā-Q&#236;ng’s Qi struck her, while another told of a story in which she and F&#224;n L&#237; lived the rest of their days in joyful retirement. Was her death quick and painless? Did she succumb to the wounds dealt to her slowly over time? Perhaps Xī Shī never died at all, her beauty transcending the mortal realm altogether?

Of the countless stories Ā-Q&#236;ng asked the local librarians to read to her, none served to dampen the unease she felt of Xī Shī’s uncertain fate, only further denying her the closure she sought as it was obscured by ambiguity and mire. It must have been an odd experience for the kindly librarians that were willing to help her. An illiterate child that had yet to learn to read, asking for myths and fables of the distant Orient, yet only growing more silent and despondent with each one, even if the practiced cheer and gratitude of her demeanor would try to convince them otherwise.

When it was time to leave, Ā-Q&#236;ng did so reluctantly, though she also understood that there was nothing more to gain from wasting her Master’s day with her unfruitful interest.

Thus they returned home.
Having both gained and lost something in this unexpected little excursion of theirs.
Their bond as Master and Servant had no doubt grown, having allowed the other a chance to glimpse at each other’s vulnerabilities, though that closeness brought with it something else. Though a mutual respect existed between them, they yet held on to their own values, even if they may prove to be incompatible, though to what extent remained to be seen.
