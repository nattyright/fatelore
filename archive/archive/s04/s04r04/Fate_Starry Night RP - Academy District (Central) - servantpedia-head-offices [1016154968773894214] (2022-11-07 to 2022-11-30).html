Specifically notes about the forum user known as <em>CCoBenjaB</em>.

Thomas couldn&#39;t get them out of his head since the enigmatic conversation they had had a few days ago. Eager to learn more about them, Thomas went on a search and dug through his previous chat logs with them. It was an effort that took days and yielded very few results. It seemed that BenjaB was secretive, or at least somewhat modest about sharing details about their <strong>Greatest Work</strong>, even with his past self. He had to dig deep to find anything worthwhile in the mountains of shitposts and pointless discussions these two have had over the years. Talk about two shit heads.

This little search proved to be a nice distraction from his thoughts. Having the opportunity to focus on one thing, to have a goal and work incrementally towards that goal: that was good. It felt good. <em>Natural</em>, even. He was convinced that this was how his old self worked, and tasting some of the dopamine associated with that way of working uplifted his mood some.

There had to be some clue somewhere that would help him understand what this Great Work was all about. Hopefully, this trip away from his home would prove fruitful. To avoid being harassed by anyone who might enter, Thomas disguised himself as best he could by wearing a pair of sunglasses and a mask, trying desperately to shield his face from view. Even his outfit was surprisingly normal compared to the one he wore at Commodan.

In any case, he wouldn&#39;t learn much by standing on the sidewalk. Fixing his costume a bit, Thomas walked down the street and passed through the door of the building, avoiding suspicion as best he could as he studied the layout of the place.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And yet...

That&#39;s all it took? Sunglasses and a face mask? All Thomas had done was essentially strutted in and nobody had given him a third, second, or even first glance. With the summoning of Servants on both Alexandria and Republic&#39;s side, an influx of Servants had been summoned, and a few needed to be archived.

The first floor of the building had several plaques and memorials for important Servants that had been summoned in Alexandria and archived by the office building. Servants like Alberich, Gottfried von Berlichingen, and more had paintings alongside their plaques, commissioned by the artist Servants that Alexandria utilized in the Culture and Academic Districts.

Besides that, two elevators and a fire escape stairwell were plastered around the room, with a guard casually waving people into the elevators.

As Thomas looked up, he saw a few cameras swiveling back in forth. It would be wise not to look at one. As soon as you looked at a camera, it saw you.

Yet, again, this was it? The premier data storage for all Servants in the known world, and its security was on the same level as a secondary school football match. Whether it was disheartening or helpful was up in the air.

He hadn&#39;t done his homework by researching the security of this place ahead of time, but there was no way a place this important could be so unguarded… right? Thomas glanced furtively at the workers, at the guard under the elevator. Not enough people. Something was… <em>had to be wrong</em>.

Or.. maybe the real difficulty would come later, once he got deeper into the office trenches. There could’ve been a catch too, like some of these ordinary-looking workers were Servants or something. In any case, Thomas did not relax and paced away a distance from the elevators, carefully weighing his next step.

No one caught his eye on this floor. The archivists and people working on ServantPedia™ had to be further up the building, towards the upper floors. Climbing the fire escape was definitely out of the question, so the dilemma was this: would the guard let him into the elevator, or would he stop and question him? And if he questioned him, would he be able to get out of this situation or would he be thrown out of the building?

The guard seemed easy enough with his indifferent way of getting people into the elevator. Maybe if he went in confidently, he would slip through the cracks?

&quot;...only one way to find out.&quot; Thomas walked with intent, nodding to the guard before nonchalantly entering the elevator going up with the group.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="18-Nov-22 06:07 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thomas casually slipped into the elevator with the rest of the group. However, just as the elevator was about to close, the security guard looked up at Thomas. He squinted, causing the hairs on the magus&#39;s arms to stand up.

&quot;Buddy, no sunglasses indoors. You know the office etiquette. Just because one guy can walk off doesn&#39;t mean you can all go disregarding the rules now.&quot; The guard said, putting down his magazine of <em>Olympia Insider</em> and waving a finger at Thomas. The door shut, leaving Thomas to take off his sunglasses. Immediately, babble began among the other people in the elevator.

<em>&quot;Have you seen the ServantPedia™️ records we need to import from Nirvana? There&#39;s too many to write! My fingers are broken.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;What about one of the publishing Servants?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Decompiling Nirvana&#39;s database takes priority over us. Even the playboy got called over to Nirvana. Haven&#39;t see him since.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;God, Rebecca from ServantSource™️ is such a bitch!&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Did you see that little girl who won us a point in the tournament? She&#39;s soooooo cute!&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;I wish her Servant would step on me.&quot;</em>

&quot;<strong>Hey.</strong>&quot; An older man nudged Thomas. His face was wrinkled but not unkind. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you before. You a new hire? You seem pretty familiar. Haven&#39;t I seen you somewhere before?

Uh oh. What would happen if Thomas was recognized as a failure of Alexandria?

First crisis avoided. Thomas sighed with relief as he found himself inside the elevator, the same one that was currently climbing the floors toward his goal. Onto the next step. CCoBenjaB said he...

Thomas flinched as the older man nudged him, interrupting his introspection short. You couldn&#39;t have chatted with your colleagues instead of bothering me, Thomas screamed internally as he racked his brains out for a way out. There was a short pause before he spoke..

&quot;...do I look familiar, sir?&quot; Thomas answered the old man, fixing his mask a bit. &quot;Well, if you say so. I can&#39;t say I remember you either, but you&#39;re right, I am the new janitor. Student job, started a week ago.&quot;

He looked away from the old man wearily and sighed, as if the deduction that he was a janitor was something obvious. Inside, Thomas was nervous. He really, <em>really</em> hoped the old man was astute enough to make the connection. His laconic demeanor, his deceptively young age, and the mask he wore <em>should</em> all indicate that he was really a teenager doing a boring cleaning job.

Buy it. Buy it. Buy it! Repeated Thomas, forcing himself not to look at the old man, looking straight at the elevator door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thomas&#39;s cover was safe, possibly? The man had bought the most telltale and default story in the entire book of stories? Did ServantPedia™️ even need a day janitor?  The man seemed honest enough, yet Thomas&#39;s story was completely and utterly...

<strong>...lame.</strong>

&quot;Well, son.&quot; The man slapped Thomas on the back. &quot;You&#39;ve landed the easiest job in all of Alexandria. A few months ago, it would&#39;ve been the hardest, yet one of our messier employees hasn&#39;t been in for a little while. Big drinker. Left everything everywhere. All Servants are walking caricatures, but he took the cake!&quot;

The elevator dinged open, and the man stepped out, chuckling to himself. This floor was a slew of cubicles. Was it worth getting off here?

Or, perhaps, it would be worth more to follow that man. He seemed to know his way around an office. Choices, choices, choices!

&quot;Wait!&quot; Thomas exclaimed unconsciously as he stepped out of the elevator, following closely behind the old man. &quot;Can you... tell me more about this employee? I&#39;m sorry, I know it&#39;s not my place as a janitor to ask for gossip about my co-workers, but I&#39;m just... really curious, you know? And I might as well learn more about them if they&#39;re someone to look out for... right?&quot;

Thomas cracked a tight smile through his mask, visible only through the creases in his eyes. It was a risky move to engage a conversation with an employee in the workspace, in the <em>open</em>. He risked putting more attention than necessary on himself, which would ultimately lead to him being outed sooner or later. Nevertheless, he couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to learn more about BenjaB, so soon after he had infiltrated the building too. Getting to know him quickly and leaving the building was a better alternative than snooping around aimlessly through the cubicles.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Eh, what the hell? There&#39;s no crime against teaching a new kid the ropes. I wish I had someone to ask about the Starbucks™️ culture where I worked.&quot; He eyed Thomas, amused. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised. Those Starbucks™️ baristas could be <em>vicious.</em>&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Cassius. Been editing articles on Servants for over twenty years! South America, mostly. Ah, but you probably don&#39;t know what that is. Bah, you kids...&quot; Cassius grumbled to Thomas as he led him through a grid of offices and cubicles.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thomas delightfully accepted Cassius&#39; offer and followed closely behind, skittishly fixing his mask and avoiding the eyes of the other workers in order to make himself more forgettable. He hoped they were all sufficiently absorbed in their work to not question his existence twice.

While part of Thomas was rather intrigued to hear about those vicious Starbucks baristas™ or that South America thing, his real purpose was further down the line in his speech.

Thomas sat in the chair that was indicated to him, pulling out his phone to take notes as he listened intently to Cassius&#39; story. He barely spoke a few sentences, but many details had already caught his attention.

First, the time of his alleged summoning coincided with the creation of his account on the Alexandrian forum some twenty years ago. If he needed confirmation that it was indeed CCoBenjaB they were talking about, there it was.

Second, the fact that he was disorganized and yet a pleasure to work struck Thomas as rather strange. Had he always been disorganized and a drinker, or was this a recent phenomenon? What was it about this wife, and what happened to her? Had she been a Servant too, or was she a regular human that bonded with BenjaB?

Thomas had many things he wanted to ask, but he had to play it safe. One thing at a time, without rushing or asking too much. He had to give the impression that this was a regular office chat, not an interrogation. He adjusted his mask again before addressing Cassius, scratching his head briefly in thought.

&quot;No Cassius sir, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever heard of a Great Servant Summoning before. What is it?&quot; He asked as he tapped on his phone, crossing his legs to get a little more comfortable. &quot;And... again, sorry to pry, but could it be that this Servant started drinking heavily <em>because of that incident with his wife</em>?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Surprised you came here for your studies instead of just going to London.&quot; Cassius chuckled. Little did he know that Thomas was older than him, even if the latter didn&#39;t remember it. Maybe Thomas had known about this leak, back when he had memories.

&quot;Twenty years ago, Alexandria suffered a data leak. A lot of information was classified, and Alexandria&#39;s administration was scrambled. I still worked here at ServantPedia™️, but it affected us, too. In-progress articles, classified Servants, and more were dumped into the ether.&quot;

Cassius shivered at the thought, dozens of sleepless nights flashing before his eyes.

&quot;This all stemmed from human error. Human accounts were hacked. So we moved to Servants. Servants can be controlled, and they are far better webmasters than we are. They&#39;re also far better musicians, writers, and scientists. Alexandria summoned them all. It&#39;s how our cultural center has become so massive. You know that airhead Wagner, or that dunderhead Paganini? Summoned during &#39;85.&quot;

&quot;Incidentally, ServantPedia has a partial Saint Graph Record Log of many of the summoned Servants, since a lot of them were new. I shouldn&#39;t show you, but it&#39;s interesting stuff!&quot;

Cassius clickclacked at a computer for a few moments, before poking his head over the cubicle and looking around. He gestured for Thomas to look over with him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044373073413025922 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044373073413025922><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Nov-22 08:05 AM">08:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As Thomas glanced at the monitor, he would see a list of True Names of Servants that had been archived in ServantPedia™️ during 2085.

Thomas&#39;s eyes stopped halfway down the list as he reached a peculiar oddity. A name was <em>missing</em>. 

Wait, no. Not missing. Thomas read the name, but it slipped from his mind instantly. No matter what he did, it just vanished from his mind like a puff of smoke. Yet he was <strong>definitely</strong> reading it. What was going on?

Thomas thought this decision made sense. After all, why bother scouting and training people limited by their human nature when you can summon a Servant to carry out your orders? They didn&#39;t need to sleep, they didn&#39;t need to eat, they were better than human workers in every way and they could be easily controlled with Command Spells or Kill Switches. Turning to them to replace labor was a logical conclusion, and  probably one of the biggest factors in leading Alexandria to prosperity. Or at least Thomas thought.

As instructed, Thomas stealthily approached Cassius&#39; monitor to glance at the screen, studying the names of the Servants displayed there. As he had said, Niccolo Paganini was among the summons. Coincidentally, he was the only one Thomas somewhat recognized, simply because he was often mentioned on the Alexandrian forums. But none of the others rang a bell. <em>And especially not the last one.</em>

Thomas squinted as he looked more closely at the last name, staring at it intensely to the point where his eyes began to sting.

&quot;Who...&quot; He began, trying to read the evasive name, to no avail. He looked at Cassius, blinking several times to wet his dry eyes, with a mixture of confusion and urgency. &quot;What&#39;s that last name on the list, sir? I can read it, but it’s like my brain won’t accept the information… did you do something to it, like with <em>Magecraft</em> or something?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He traced Thomas&#39;s line of sight to the odd name. He frowned in confusion. &quot;That&#39;s weird. These archives have been locked and verified for decades. Nobody can edit them.&quot;

A clinking sound was made as Cassius tapped the screen like one would a gauge, as if that would edit it. He refreshed the page, and still the blank name stared the two in the face.

Judging from the confusion plastered on Cassius&#39;s face, he wasn&#39;t sabotaging anything. It seemed likely that the man was experiencing the same phenomenon. Cassius looked to check the Servant&#39;s identification number:

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■</code>

&quot;I&#39;ll call up IT and have them look at it after lunch. That&#39;s really weird. Nobody has permission to edit logs like this.&quot; Cassius frowned, slightly troubled. Nonetheless, he bounced back quickly. Working for a constantly updating database wasn&#39;t without its quirks—or site breaking bugs.

The computer booted down.

&quot;Anyway, what were you saying?&quot; Cassius responded, in thought. &quot;Ah, right. That Servant. No, he was a pretty excited fellow when he first started out. I mean, can you blame him? We&#39;re living on floating cities <strong>we</strong> built, in a city <strong>we</strong> shaped. It must&#39;ve seemed like paradise to him. Then, he tried to summon his wife to join him after he had managed to procure a spare S.E.R.V.A.N.T Frame, and it didn&#39;t work out.&quot;

Cassius shrugged. &quot;He got a little moodier, and would occasionally drink on the job. He apparently partied a <em>lot</em> in life, so it&#39;s only natural that it would happen as a Servant. Vice. Smoke. Booze.&quot; Cassius&#39;s expression darkened. &quot;Then Nirvana&#39;s database was integrated, and the Librarians borrowed him to go through the data, and he just shut down. He stopped. When Republic came knocking on our door, he lost faith.&quot;

CCoBenjaB&#39;s loss of faith was not just due to the lack of cooperation from Republic and the NHE. It was an accumulation of things that slowly undermined him. The failed reunion with his <em>Servant</em> wife, the recovery of the Nirvana database, which Thomas briefly knew about, and finally the invasive docking of Republic. He was pushed over the edge, forced to pull out his <strong>Greatest Work</strong> to fix everything. His decision wasn’t so sudden and abrupt after all.

&quot;I see...&quot; said Thomas, scratching the back of his head in contemplation. &quot;Sounds like he&#39;s been through a lot. I feel sorry for him, truly.&quot;

It seemed the evasive name on that list wasn&#39;t Cassius&#39; work. Seeing how he, a supposed veteran among ServantPedia™’s workers, knew nothing about it, then it was safe to assume it was not a conscious decision made by an administrator or some other higher authority. ServantPedia™ had nothing to do with it. It was likely something or someone else screwed with the database independently and against ServantPedia™&#39;s wishes. Weird. What made that Servant’s identity so important that it had to be hidden. Not scrubbed off from the archive, but <em>hidden</em> in plain sight…

Well, it was of no immediate importance to Thomas. He had come here with the intention of learning more about BenjaB, or at least enough to unveil the secret behind his Greatest Work. That unreadable name thing mattered little in comparison to what a Servant could accomplish once he had <em>lost faith in humanity</em>.

&quot;Sir, you said he wasn&#39;t very organised and left everything everywhere.&quot; Thomas asked Cassius, getting up from his chair. &quot;If that’s true, could you point me to his office? As the janitor, it is my duty to make sure his workspace is neat and clean for his return. I&#39;m sure a Servant as diligent as he is, or was, will eventually come to terms with his issues and come back to work once the heat has settled. Don’t you agree, Cassius sir?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Yeah, you should probably get to your job.&quot; Cassius brightened again. &quot;His cubicle is in the back corner with the window view. All Servants have their workplaces marked with their Class Container&#39;s name. You should be able to find him.&quot;

Standing up, Cassius led Thomas outside the cubicle, and pointed in the direction he should go.

The Servant&#39;s class read Caster, and the name... had the same issue as the one on Cassius&#39; list. So it was <em>BenjaB</em>&#39;s name they couldn&#39;t figure out back then. Did he do this to himself? If he did, Thomas couldn&#39;t figure out his aim. One more cryptic action that needed figuring out.

Now in front of BenjaB’s desk, Thomas bent down and picked up the wine bottles, changing their placement so they wouldn&#39;t disturb him while he searched. The first thing Thomas did was boot up the computer. While he waited for it to turn on, he inspected the photos that littered the desk, pulling them out of their frames to see if they had any writing on the back. Names, dates, notes. Anything that looked like a clue would be considered useful and a step in the right direction. He also snuck a glance at that to-do list, hoping to maybe find clues about BenjaB’s next moves or something along those lines.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Drat. He would have to go fishing for clues before cracking open the computer.

Assuming there were clues that even lead to the password.

Every photo had a woman in it. Pale, blond, and lovely, with hair tied into a bun with curls. In other photos, a bespectacled man stood beside her, clearly delighted, as if he had been lucky to just be included in the photo. On the back of one was a date:

3/10/48 - Never forget.

The to-do list for March had a massive list of things that were supposed to be done. Thomas glimpsed through them, and found a massive list of ServantPedia™️ articles. At least a hundred, and most likely more. It was definitely a month&#39;s work, and yet one thing stuck out. For every thing that was supposed to be done, there was a checkmark with another date: <strong>March 1st</strong>. Had this man finished all of his work on the first day?

Was that even possible? It had to have been several hundred pages!

Taking on that much work in a single day was no doubt a feat that only a Servant could accomplish. He may have been a shithead, but he was a hard working shithead. Very impressive.

It didn&#39;t take a genius to deduce that the woman in the photos was BenjaB&#39;s lovely wife, and that the nerdy guy with the happy expression was the man himself. He wasn&#39;t very narcissistic apparently. He only had eyes for his wife, as he shamelessly decorated his office with her every image. He must have really loved her, Thomas thought. This fact only added to the gravity of his painful past. The failure of her summoning must have had a huge impact on him. Perhaps this one event was what pushed him to finish his Greatest Work, regardless of the actions of Republic and the NHE.

The date on the back of that photo read March 10th 2048. Or was it 1948? Or even 1848? Thomas wasn&#39;t sure. What he was sure of was that none of these dates coincided with his summoning in 2085. If that date meant anything, it was probably related to something in his or his wife’s personal life, while they were still alive and kicking.

Thomas&#39; gaze returned to the computer and the password it was asking for. It probably wasn&#39;t something as obvious as the date on the picture. Thomas needed to dig deeper if he wanted to crack that code. He checked the stack of paper on the typewriter, looking for any texts or writing materials BenjaB might have left behind, then his hand went to the pi&#232;ce de resistance: <em>the filing cabinet</em>. He saved this part for last because he knew it was the most likely to contain something useful. Might as well exhaust every less important option before going through with it.

Thomas looked at the photos again, scratching his head as a curious thought resurfaced. Cassius previously mentioned that BenjaB failed to summon his wife, right? If so, how did he get these photos? Did he recreate them with some kind of Magecraft, or...

<em>They already existed and he just reprinted them?</em>

Thomas took the photos out of their frames again and lined them up carefully on the desk. Then he pulled out his phone to photograph the photos, running them through a reverse image search site on the CWW. If these photos really existed somewhere, he could track them down and discover <strong>BenjaB&#39;s identity, or at least his wife&#39;s</strong>. Alexandria took pride in its archives and such, did it not? Now was the time to see if that reputation held out or not.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Many of them were extremely old archive sites, with photos of old Heroic Spirits before ServantPedia™️ had been fully established. However, each time Thomas looked at the file names, site titles, or anything that would possibly hint at a name, he was met with the same thing he had seen before: ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■.

This was going far beyond a simple piece of Magecraft, hacking, or editing. Several of these sites were decades old, outdated, or simply forgotten. Even Magecraft had no right to be so extensive, unless it was cursing Thomas specifically. That left two options: Thomas was cursed, or this was far beyond a typical piece of Magecraft.

Cassius had been unable to see the name as well, so it wasn&#39;t just Thomas. That left one option: a piece of Magecraft. If the individual in question, there was only one thing that could be so broadly expansive that it would affect both Thomas, Cassius, and every site Thomas had seen.

<strong>A Noble Phantasm.</strong>

If that was the case, then... <strong>shit.</strong> Was there anyway to break something like this? Without a Servant, unlikely. Thomas was on his own.

As Thomas began digging through the filing cabinets, the typewriter in the folder suddenly spat out a <strong>DING!</strong> that caused Thomas to jump up. Several papers flew out like a blizzard, before binding themselves into a small paperback bound with paperclips.

And so, Thomas ran.
