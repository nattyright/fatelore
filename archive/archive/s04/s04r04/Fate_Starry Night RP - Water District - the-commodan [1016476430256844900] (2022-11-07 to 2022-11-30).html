Even Hannibal&#39;s attacks didn&#39;t seem to stop him. In her less than stable state, she began to consider if the other team was actually two servants, that they were cheating to some degree.

Mikhail&#39;s final assault was something she was not expecting but nonetheless, he&#39;d find himself facing the cellulose barrel of a plant pressed between her palms, aimed directly for his lens. In the commotion, it popped and something embedded itself in the eyepiece and pushing against his eye. It did not pierce it but there was a distinct pressure against it.

This was going to be the end for her but she wasn&#39;t going down without trying, even in her condition. If Alexandria was going to lose, there was at least going to be a martyr this time...

Yet the punch collided with the rubble behind her and the brute hung his head in shame.

&quot;Huh!? You... don&#39;t <em>want</em> this victory?&quot; She rasped accusingly, face contorted in not only pain but insult. After all that abuse and careful positioning, he was just going to give up? That wasn&#39;t the doctor she remembered. What was he getting at, what trick was he about to pull. &quot;What&#39;s the catch? I... owe you now?&quot;

Cannot kill you... trying to kill a defenseless opponent... accept my surrender... all those words filtered into Amelia&#39;s turbulent mind and the hallucination before her began to disappear and be replaced by an equally terrifying man but one with a completely different spirit. 

&quot;OK... if that&#39;s how... you wanna do it... I... accept... your loss,&quot; her words coming out tense and parsed as she willed herself to stand before the cursed giant and a faint light returned to her ruby eyes. &quot;Just do... one thing for... me. Kneel... and show them... your choice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Doing last minute checks on his equipment. The roars of the crowd could be heard, muffled though the walls but their anticipation was still palpable.

“Word is that enemy master is yet another tough as nails mercenary.”

Barrett said to Mehmed as he slid a grenade launcher onto his rifle with a satisfying click.

“That’s three-for-three so far on mercs. Man, the market sure has gotten busy since I started, and I sure as hell ain’t getting younger.” He continued in a joking manner.

“Maybe once we win the war, this I’ll start my own company, go private and work security or something.”

Barrett let out a small chuckle.

“I’ll watch you back out there partner as long you watch as long as you watch mine. Although, your back is a lot sturdier than mine.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The ruler was dressed in a different attire from what he had worn in previous days. Gold plated armor dressed the outsides of his body and limbs, his joint&#39;s carefully exposed to allow for agile movements. His left shoulder possessed a lion shaped pauldron, it&#39;s eyes studded with diamonds. A gold chain wrapped around his chest attaching a royal purple cape that flowed down to his knees. The cape served to conceal the pouches of ammunition strapped on Alexanders sides. Most noticeably he did not have his glasses. It was a much fiercer and less sophisticated look that still did a good job at flaunting Macedon&#39;s wealth. 

Glancing down at the time Alexander let out a frustrated sigh. He had no idea where Ā-Q&#236;ng was and it was just about time to start. Infact he hadn&#39;t seen Lancer since she ran off the other day. He wasn&#39;t sure exactly what he said to turn her away but he assumed it must have been the nature of his conviction. If Alexander&#39;s servant couldn&#39;t share his ambition, then perhaps she would have only held him back anyway. But still, there was no way he could take on a master and servant on his own. Not showing up wasn&#39;t an option either. Gritting his teeth Alexander silently reminded himself that this was for Macedon.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041959136247685181 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041959136247685181><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="15-Nov-22 04:13 PM">16:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Momomo-mo Mo-momo#8008">@The Morbdustrial Revolution</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

My armies consisted of a lot of mercenaries as well.&quot; Mehmed was leaning on a wall, arms crossed, as he waited for Barrett to finish his check-up. 

&quot;Although, this is a little different, I guess? Alexandria is not known for being able to fight, after all it is a city of knowledge. But I would have thought that the republic was more invested in winning the holy grail war. Do they maybe not have the support of the entire city? Or are they weaker than they let it seem? Well, not that it really matters too much. Let&#39;s just get this behind is master, I still have some other business to attend to.&quot;

Barrett knew what Mehmed was thinking about. It seemed like he really REALLY wanted to conquer the flying tower. But no matter how much he would think about it and try to justify it, there was nothing that could come out of this other than a headache.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Showtime.” Barrett said to himself, shaking out his limbs before stepping into the arena.

He wasn&#39;t one to get nervous, let alone show his emotions through any physical means, but the still missing Ā-Q&#236;ng instilled the monarch with a pit of anxiety. The roaring crowd and entrance of the Alexandrian team meant that it was only seconds before Alexander&#39;s entrance. What would they think when he entered without a servant? Would the fight be called off? There were too many variables to consider. No matter what happened Alexander knew at least one thing for certain, he would fight tooth and nail for his Empire. 

<strong>&quot;On the Republic side the Leader of Macedon has come to test his metal! Give a warm welcome to Alexander Vladisnov!&quot;</strong>

The announcers voice echoed through the stadium, Alexander walking towards the center with a cool bravado his hands waving to each side of the crowd. Lowering his hands  Alexander&#39;s  posture became straight and cold, the exact opposite Barret. Everything that Alexander wanted to convey to the crowd was worn on his body. 

<strong>&quot;Accompanying Alexander we have the small but fierce Ā-Q&#236;ng!&quot;</strong> The crowd would cheer only for a moment before coming to an awkward silence. Where was Ā-Q&#236;ng? Had she forgotten to walk out? Unsure the announcer would begin to give her intro once more. Would Lancer show up this time?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1042239256791359488 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1042239256791359488><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Nov-22 10:46 AM">10:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Momomo-mo Mo-momo#8008">@The Morbdustrial Revolution</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ChristmasForJuan#4990">@ChristmasForSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perched on one of the many reinforced support beams holding up the massive LED Screen suspended above the arena, Ā-Q&#236;ng was far removed from the cheers of the packed venue below her, the people’s swelling excitement reduced to a muted murmur lost in the wind. That was until this day’s combatants entered the field, at which point the announcer’s booming voice shook the stage, seemingly causing the entirety of the Commodan to vibrate as each of the many speakers only served to spread the noise farther and wider.

The day the 3rd Match had come.

Ā-Q&#236;ng had not seen Alexander since that day at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#central-park</span> almost a week ago, surviving off the Mana Batteries she had taken for herself after running back to his Suite and returning his other gifts to her, and roaming the city alone without a clear goal in mind ever since. She had even considered leaving her Master to fight alone in the Tourney altogether, unwilling to be complicit in his cold crusade, but before she knew it her legs had carried her here regardless. Was it due to a sense of duty perhaps? An obligation she owed him for summoning her into this world? Even she herself was not entirely sure of what had driven her to come.

If mistaken for a civilian, it was obvious that she would not be allowed into the restricted areas reserved for the combatants, and it went without saying that she lacked a ticket to allow her official passage into the spectator’s stands. Even if she identified herself as a Servant, being unaccompanied by her Master without proper documentation or permits allowed her even less freedom, and so before she could stir up any more trouble than she already had, Ā-Q&#236;ng had eventually decided to simply scale the structure herself.
But now she could no longer call this a simple whim.
Wandering over to the Commodan on the day of the Match was one thing, but now that she had gone through the deliberate effort of entering it, there was no point convincing herself that this was all just an accident anymore.

“...”

Still conflicted, she watched as a lone figure strode out into the battlefield by himself, his image reflected in the massive digital screens that took the liberty to display some unnecessary trivia beside him via flashy graphics, paying extra attention towards his lineage and country, as well as his quite unusual number of fathered children. They painted him as a ruler and a family man, though would he be a match for the illustrious Barrett von Meer, a famed mercenary notorious for being an accomplished Magus Killer, one in whose veins still flowed the blood from the Old World?
…or at the very least that seemed to be the story the marketing department seemed to be spinning to attract any last-minute viewers for their televised broadcast.

It would seem that Republic is not beyond saving after all, as it appears that Mr. Vladisnov has kept his kid at home to fight the battle himself. How unfortunate. Republic may have started strong in the first round, but if this keeps up…&quot;</strong>

The annoncer kept vamping without breaking a sweat, a testament to his experience, buying himself and the staff time to confirm whether or not Alexander was truly going to fight a Master and Servant Pair by himself, and whether or not the rules even allowed for such a one-sided beatdown to occur. Not that he minded, nor did the majority of the audience. An easy win for Alexandria was not unwelcome, especially after their morale had been boosted after their previous victory, close as it was, but sadly that would not be the case after all.

Like a green speck smudged over one’s glasses after, a blurred streak descended from above, momentarily evading the stadium’s expensive replay cameras before coming to a halt not too far from Alexander’s side, revealing itself to be a girl clad in verdant robes of Chinese origin, their foreing nature clashing heavily with her Master’s armored golden attire.

It appeared that Ā-Q&#236;ng’s sudden entrance had caused quite a stir, the announcer already spinning his own story and feeding it to the jeering audience as fact, but none of that mattered to the Servant as she took a small step or two towards her Master, stopping at a distance that made them seem more like strangers than partners.

“Master…” she muttered with a disgruntled look, the warmth she had once reserved for him now gone, “Even now I do not agree with what you said. To kill and be cruel, I still do not understand what your goal at the end of it all can be, but I also realized that perhaps this is my fault. It is because of me that you had to live in a world without Xī Shī, but that does not mean that it is alright to just rip and tear it  apart while she is gone. If you are that serious about your wish, then show me.”

Raising her left arm, Ā-Q&#236;ng extended it towards the middle of the arena, her index finger pointed squarely at the enemy Master.

She was serious.
For the moment she lacked a reason to follow Alexander, her previous impression of him now an outdated facade he had used to get her to cooperate. Not unlike how F&#224;n L&#237; had treated her so kindly in order to win her over to his side for the coming war…
Neither seemed to have had particularly malicious intent, but if she was going to subject herself to the command of another and aid them in their goals, she no longer wanted to be kept in the dark about their motives.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, as much as Mehmed enjoyed his little growing fanbase, he was still not going to be 100% happy about being a lowly fighter like that. But there was nothing he could do about it now.

Mehmed would listen intensely as the announcer was introducing Alexander and starting to talk about his little kingdom. This second Life of his really did know how to tease Mehmed. 

&quot;Alexander, is it? The rightful king of Macedon... How amusing... I always looked up to him, to know? To what he achieved. You seem to have a similar mindset, seeing as you stand here, in a foreign land that&#39;s not yours. It just depends if you have the same skills now, I guess. You do seem pretty confident, walking up here without a serva- Again? <em>Another</em> Child?

It had been a week, perhaps she really did intend to cut ties with him, leaving the Ruler the battle on his own. However, just before he could fully give up all hope, Lancer would swoop in, the crowd cheering at her presence. 

Alexander smirked as Lancer presented him with an ultimatum of sorts. He had to show Ā-Q&#236;ng his true fighting spirit, give her a reason to follow him, or lose his servant forever. Alexander scoffed at the idea. What right did she have to give him orders. He had done everything to accommodate Lancer in this new world, and yet she abandoned him because of a minor philosophical dispute. Despite this, he had no choice but to entertain the ultimatum. 

&quot;Let&#39;s set one thing straight Ā-Q&#236;ng. I never lied to you. Everything I&#39;ve ever told you was the truth. Although I am sorry for not telling you everything. First I&#39;ll show you the true spirit of Macedon, and then I&#39;ll tell you everything there is to know about healing the world.&quot;

Alexander looked away from his servant walking up to his opponents. His hand grasping at his pouch of white gems. &quot;Barret, I wouldn&#39;t have expected such a qualified opponent. I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll do a good job at showing off what Macedonian tech is capable of. Don&#39;t disappoint me now.&quot; Alexander teased Barret with bashful words. Despite his teasing, Alexander did feel fortunate to have such an opponent. Someone like Barret would be the best way to show off Macedons advancements in weaponry.

&quot;Well I certainly hope I can live up my namesake someday.&quot; Alexander replied, turning his attention to Mehmed. &quot;You&#39;re quite the accomplished leader yourself. Just like you once did, I seek to bring my people into a prosperous age. My cause is much the same as yours once was. It&#39;s unfortunate that we should meet as enemies.&quot;

At least no directly. He never lied to her; not technically. All he did was omit somewhat crucial facts about himself as his Servant continued to build her own image of him in her mind as he showered her with kindness, making it unnecessary for him to so much as lift a single finger as she was the one to deceive herself from the very start.

So long as he pretended not to notice, naturally this would mean that he was not at fault for Ā-Q&#236;ng perceiving him to be a different man than he had always been from the start, absolving him of all responsibility. Thus he did not lie. All he did was nudge his Servant in the right direction and encourage her naive fantasies.

She frowned at her Master’s rebuttal, unable to say anything as he was ultimately right about not having lied to her since their summoning, though it went without saying that she was not the least bit satisfied by his answer. Her frustrations were based on an emotionally charged perceived betrayal of his trust, so no amount of rationale or reason would be able to wash away the vexation gripping at her heart.

Alexander had said his piece however, his confidence palpable as he did not even consider the notion of himself losing, already talking about his plans after he had attained victory. With no more words to spare for his Servant, he thus walked off to greet his opponent, leaving her to follow behind him.

Taking a deep breath to disperse her petty thoughts, she turned to face her competition as well, the Master being not too dissimilar from her own, while the Servant-

“‘Another’ child?” Ā-Q&#236;ng repeated out loud as he seemed to be surprised by her age, “Does that mean you know Reynard as well?”

Although the Servant introduced as Mehmed II by the booming speakers seemed quite exasperated at the seeming lack of adult Servants in this Tourney, the candidness with which they spoke was very welcome, and had they met under different circumstances she would have certainly enjoyed his company should he have agreed to play with her, however her current mood did not allow for such a thing.

“Mehmed, was it?” she thus posed a question, her voice neutral and strained, “Is it ok if we did not fight right now? I want to watch my Master’s battle if that is ok… but I know that is a lot to ask.”

Although she came with an offer of peace, her body remained tense and alert, her faith in chivalry eroded by her experiences in her current incarnation.

“If you don’t agree, that is fine too…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hearing the bell ring Alexander pulled a white gem from the pouch that his hand had been resting on. His shotgun being drawn from behind his back. With Barret taking the initiative, Alexander assumed a defensive stance. 

As soon as Barret raised his gun a white gem would explode at Alexander&#39;s feet, quickly shoving him out of the way, dodging the bullets by a very slim margin.  Alexander then aimed his shotgun towards Barret, a red bullet flying from the barrel towards the ground beneath Barret. Should the crystal hit the ground a large wall of flames would errect where Barret was standing, blocking sight from Alexander.

As Barett’s hail of bullets was met with the crackling rumble of Alexander’s explosion, the audience answered their fervor with a deafening roar of excited cheers, their cacophony of voices washing over the arena like the untamed waters of a broken dam. It would appear that this was going to be a battle of the Masters, an extraordinarily compatible match-up of two warriors sharing a similar skill-set, making it impossible to divine which of the two would emerge the victor. The betting ring was certainly happy about it as a number of equal bets flowed in for either side, though most withheld their wagers until the seasoned combatants they entrusted their month’s salary to revealed their trump cards. They had seen enough arena matches to know that the two Masters were still just feeling each other out, testing the waters to see how far they could go, and saving their most powerful attack until they had assured their victory.

That being said, a crucial factor of the battle had yet to join the fray.

Upon landing, a single length of bamboo sprouted beside her feet and was plucked as easily as one would a flower, and though it was easy to assume that this was the armament she had chosen for her weapon, she did not yet allow for it to perform its function, keeping it restrained and silent at her side, her eyes locked on the ongoing conflict before her and only sparing cautious glances at her opposing Servant to assure that they did not move to interrupt it. It was clear that her full attention was not on him however, merely relying on her sharpened peripheral senses to keep note of his presence.

And so she continued to watch and judge, to see just how far her Master was truly willing to go for the sake of clawing out a victory.

“What do you think?” she eventually called out to Mehmed, her fellow observer, “Which of our Masters do you think is going to win?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Hmmm... Alexander&#39;s technological advantage is really not that easily disputed. And he doesn&#39;t seem to be an amateur in battle either unlike some of the members in the grail war. I&#39;d say my little master will definitely have a hard time before him... It will be an interesting fight at least.

Barrets opening punch would just graze by Alexander&#39;s head as he stepped back. He still needed to warm up, despite this fact he still felt somewhat nimble. Barrets punches appeared oddly easy to see despite their speed, although still fast enough to not be perfectly defended against. 

Alexander would continue to step back as Barret unleashed his barrage. Alexander did his best to block each consecutive swing, brushing Barrets arm away with his gun while avoiding any critical shot&#39;s the face. 
After Barrets first few punches, Alexander would do something unusual. Instead of stepping back he would step into Barret placing his hand on Barrets chest, a white gem being crushed against him. The explosion of the gem would create a wide manga barrier pushing the two some 15 ft apart. The force of expanding barrier would feel like taking a solid punch from a boxer.

To banter. To be equals. To have the freedom to laugh and joke as Mehmed did with his Master.
It was a relationship she thought she had started to build with Alexander, but at the end of the day he was a monarch first before being a father or a friend. Their bond was always going to be that of the superior and the subservient, just as it had always been and just as it would always be. Perhaps she was wrong to expect more from her life as a Servant?

“My Master seems to be able to keep up with yours even without their toys… sorry, that is probably my fault. For playing with him and getting him used to how I fight.”

He had picked up on her martial arts rather quickly. As Reynard did. And anybody else receiving her ‘lessons’ directly with their flesh. His limited exposure only granted him very rudimentary enhancements however, merely refining his movements and letting his body move more freely, but it was clear that he was able to handle Barett’s barrage more confidently than he would have before, even to the extent of being able to limit the damage he received from it altogether.

Ā-Q&#236;ng’s eyes narrowed as she noted the influence she had had on her Master.

But that still left the unknown variable to her side unaccounted for.

“Please do not interfere. I promise your Master is going to be safe even if he loses, and it is important for me to see this through to the end.

As he landed he rolled across the ground before suddenly stopping in a kneeling position, rifle raised.

<em>THUMP</em>

The underslung grenade launcher fired a round which soared straight towards Alexander.

<strong>BOOM</strong>

The explosion and resulting dust cloud completely covered the area where Alexander stood.

&quot;Gem Magecraft huh?&quot; Barrett casually spoke as he reload the grenade launcher. &quot;That stuff is pretty damn expensive, especially since the false scarcity turned into real scarcity once all the mines went underwater.

He tried to throw a quartz rock down to provide him defense but it wasn&#39;t enough to surpress the blast. Alexander was sent back in his own tumble across the ground, a cloud of dust and ruble now separating the pair of warriors. 

Standing back up Alexander dusted himself off, pushing through the pain of the blast &quot;Macedon is a nation of immense wealth and power. These gems and the weapons that utilize them are just a small fraction of our capabilities. I assure you, whatever the price may be, it&#39;s a worthwhile one.&quot; Alexander replied to Barrets comment with what sounded like a commercial for Macedonian weaponry. He spoke just like a sales person, trained to say the right things given the opportunity. 

As Barret reloaded his gun, Alexander would place a red and white capsule into his shotgun. Shortly after a green flash in the dust would give birth to a cyclone of wind which would clear all of the dust. The jagged rocks created by the explosion would get sucked into the cyclone, making one or two cycles before flinging towards Barret. As this happened Alexander would fire a Jasper to Barrets right creating a wall of flames. The onslaught of rocks and wall of flames only left a path on Barrets left side.

The impact of Barrett’s grenade rattled the ground with its violent impact, the force of which blowing Alexander back after he had just managed to minimize the lethality of the explosion. Yet his Servant did not lift so much as a finger as she watched her Master’s struggles.

“Losing their right to exist…” Ā-Q&#236;ng pensively echoed Mehmet’s accusation, one shared by nearly all of Alexandria’s inhabitants, “Republic really are the bad guys, are they not?”

She could not be so sure herself as she lacked the proper context and knowledge to understand why her employers behaved the way they did, not being able to gather too much information herself in her week spent roaming the city alone, but it was clear to come to this conclusion based on surface-level observations alone. To the masses, Republic perfectly fit the bill of an oppressive invader after all. But that was the sentiment of the locals. Mercenaries hired to fight this war would not necessarily share this patriotism.

No matter. She would get her answers from Alexander after the conclusion of his battle, but that still left an unanswered question.

“What about you then? Why do you fight when this is not your home?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Jeez, how many tricks do you have. I think you’ve already burned a small fortune so far.” Barrett continued to taunt.

However, Barrett could see that he was being cornered. There was fire to his right and rocks flying at him from the front. His left was clear but Barrett knew that Alexander wouldn’t just let him run that way. 

“Alright, here’s a trick of my own.”

Barrett raised his metallic arm towards Alexander. Mana hummed throughout the arm as it transformed to a cannon.

<strong>BOOOOOOM</strong>

A massive beam of pure mana surged forth from the arm cannon, tearing apart the ground as it raced toward Alexander.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s simply natural that things like that can happen and refusing to accept that is more than just foolish.&quot; 

Mehmed tilted his head again, watching the show his master was offering for him and letting out a chuckle or a stupid remark here and there. &quot;I must say, I&#39;m impressed by how far humanity has gone in order to make all sorts of military knick-knacks. Just seeing how far cannons have gone is jaw-dropping.&quot; Mehmed said and showed his smug grin once again. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want me showing you what a real explosion looks like? I don&#39;t mind a little showcase.&quot; 

A-Qing continued to ask questions and Mehmed found it to be bad manners to ignore her, which is why he did continue to answer her once again. &quot;Usually I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s a bad and good side in a war but... The republic really doesn&#39;t do itself any favours by keeping their entire reasoning top secret. So maybe they are just vicious barbarians who wish to burn these long-aquired books about humanity. That would be a pretty shame however...&quot; 

Mehmed then placed his index finger on his chin, tapping jt a bit while thinking how to properly explain his reasoning for joining the war.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045090214017773638 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045090214017773638><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Nov-22 07:35 AM">07:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

&quot;The easy answer would be because I was summoned by my master. After all, you also agreed to fight for the republics side at first, did you not? But if I&#39;m completely honest, it&#39;s because of curiosity and to see another perspective. After all, I was on the republics side long ago, being the one attacking the weaker city... The lives that were spent, the great men that emerged as a result of it... I consider this as a sort of tribute to most of them. That and as a challenge to myself. I want to show them I would have been able to defend against myself! Hah, I&#39;ll show them alright. Just wait, Guistiniani! And Hunyadi, too.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, Alexander&#39;s opponent was smart. Barret fired a powerful charged shot through the wind cyclone, destroying it in the process. Despite not falling into his plan, The Macedonian King would never underestimate his opponent. Alexander had a backup plan in case Barret tried to force his way out. 

Pointing his gun forwards a blue light would shine between the crevices of Alexander&#39;s weapon, mana flowing from his body into the weapon, pushing the gem inside past is normal capacity to store mana. The weapons trigger was pulled, this time no gem would fly towards Barret, instead the stone would explode just at the tip of the barrel, creating a nearly transparent barrier that would halt Barrett&#39;s charged shot in it&#39;s path. An explosion emitted from the collision, Alexander&#39;s cape swaying behind him as the wind pushed past.

The barrel on Alexanders gun flipped open as he placed a Ruby inside, his reload speed considerably faster then usual. Even though Ā-Q&#236;ng had sat out of the fight, it seemed her passive buffs on Alexander were still a problem. 

&quot;Barret, you are witnessing just the surface of Macedonian technology. Yes, we have spent a fortune, but with that investment we have created a perfect harmony between Magus and weapon. Our greatness knows no boundaries&quot; Once again Alexander replied to Barret&#39;s comment with a statement about the greatness of Macedon. 

Again, he would pull the trigger, this time from behind his shield which disappeared right after the weapon was fired. A blue shimmer accompanied the red gem that was ejected from the barrel, hurtling towards Barret. The mana charged Ruby heading for Barret packed a great amount of destructive power. It&#39;s explosion radius would be within 20 feet, the power of the blast twice as strong as a standard grenade.

Barrett sprinted as fast as he could away from the incoming attack but was still struck by the explosion. The blast launching him across the arena where he landed in a crumpled heap.

Battered, bloody, and with his metal arm limping, Barrett pulled himself up and raised his rifle once more towards Alexander. However, he only gave a smirk.

&quot;Mehmed.&quot; Barrett softly spoke. &quot;By this seal, defeat Alexander Vladisnov.&quot;

There was a small flash of red light from Barrett&#39;s hand and in that instant, Mehmed felt that he had been tagged in.

Barrett then swiftly turned his aim towards A-Qing and fired a grenade right at her. After fumbling with his rifle, Barrett then fired with full-auto one-handed at the Servant. Such conventional weapons would have little effect on the typical Servant but the attempt to distract was obvious.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="24-Nov-22 09:48 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Much like a child being told something they did not like to hear, she kept looking forward, averting his gaze, and instinctively refuted the words she knew possessed an inkling of truth.

She knew her ideals were too vague.
She wanted to maintain the beauty of the world, perhaps even restore it in the memory of Xī Shī, whose extraordinary beauty had changed the course of her life, but she knew not the measures that needed to be taken to accomplish such a feat. And so she did nothing. Simply stopping the occasional crime here and there as she happened upon them and living her life ‘nicely’. Aimlessly. Perhaps they simply did not understand? How could anybody who hadn’t looked upon Xī Shī understand? At the very least, this manner of thinking was Ā-Q&#236;ng’s last straw, the final resistance she could muster up to deny the well-meaning advice of others, not realizing that perhaps she was the one who did not understand. That she was the only one still dreaming in a world where everybody else had already woken and moved on.

“I see, so you were doing it for yourself,” she commented as Mehemed shared with her his reason for fighting, but her tone was far from being dismissive, insead regarding his motive with some manner of envy.

“It is so simple. And nice. No wonder you can move and act so openly and free if you live your life so happily.”

Was it the same one he had shot at Alexander before? But why target her of all people when her Master still seemed relatively unharmed? Their fight was far from over.

Not that she had time to speculate and consider.

The arc of the grenade was set to explode near her feet, so even should she want to side-step it, it would explode on her location regardless and require further distance to steer clear from the dust and debris from the blast. Not to mention that Mehmed would be inconvenienced by the effort as well. Thus the choice of what to do was simple if one assumed that these grenades worked similarly to Alexander’s gems and exploded on impact. For the most part at least.

Her open palm thrust forward to catch it, acting like a pillow as it softly pressed against its side, altering its trajectory ever so slightly by gently nudging it as opposed to presenting it with any sort of harsh resistance. Her body moved to accommodate. Like a leaf carried down the lazy stream of a river, one would be forgiven to mistake her actions for a dance as she guided the grenade behind her with no more than a gentle caress, extending its flight-path and finally releasing it towards the empty edges of the arena where it would harm and disturb no one.

The detonation followed soon after, invoking a heated gust that would have no doubt toppled over her balanced pole, if only it hadn’t since already found its way into her grip once more, now used to deflect the relentless hail of bullets visited upon her by Barret. Again. Why persist on attacking her and leaving himself open to his opponent.

A better chance to finish him off would be unlikely, but Barrett should be the most aware of his vulnerability. So he must have used it as a trap, to lure Alexander in while his attention was elsewhere. A dishonorable act to achieve a cheap victory.

<em>“Do it then,”</em> Ā-Q&#236;ng coldly goaded Alexander in her mind, <em>“Attack him when he is weak and show me who you truly are.”</em>

She would move to stop him if he were to do so of course, but she still needed him to act first. To prove with his actions what he had already confirmed to her with words, and only then would she be able to make up her mind once and for all.

…but of course she was gravely mistaken.

Naturally this was all because her eyes were on Alexander, not Barrett, and unfamiliar as she was with his weaponry, she failed to notice the iconic red glow surrounding his hand when he was crumpled on the ground, his command to Mehmed soft and quiet amidst the ringing of the previous explosion and thus perfectly obscured from her senses.

Her bamboo continued to receive Barrett’s volley, unlikely to withstand a second, but neither did she move. In her anticipation to see how Alexander would exploit this situation, her eyes were blind to the actions of the Servant just beside her, oblivious to his sudden surge of magical energy as he was enveloped with the full might of his Master’s Command Seal.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045265637498429550 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045265637498429550><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Nov-22 07:12 PM">19:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href=discord_assets/SPOILER_download-DDFF9.gif> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=discord_assets/SPOILER_download-DDFF9.gif alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_download.gif (3.79 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045265770961174598 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045265770961174598><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Nov-22 07:12 PM">19:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><s>Please forgive the shitpost xD</s></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Mehmed truly believe that his master was more than capable, seeing him being toyed around with like that was rubbing Mehmed the wrong way. He would need to have a serious talk with him after the fight. 

That was of course if he survived that fight. That very last attack from Alexander seemed to really pack a punch, sending his Master flying. However, it was impressing how Barrett still managed to get back up, even if he was hit full-force, despite failing to dodge that attack. 

Still, Barrett turned out to be a very persistent bugger, still getting up despite the way he looked now. A bloody mess that could barely stand up... But he was standing and that was all that mattered. And the fact that he was raising his rifle once again could only mean he was not done yet... 

Or so Mehmed thought, but a whisper in his head made him realize that his master was throwing the towel after all. <em>By this seal, defeat Alexander Vladisnov.</em> It was a shame, but this decision only made sense to Mehmed. After all, this was a war and not a game.

&quot;Bwahahahahah! Oh Master, that&#39;s dirty of you. A cheap act like that?&quot; Mehmed looked at his master with a playful expression of disappointment, tsking tsking a little bit and shaking his head before he turned towards Alexander. 

&quot;Now then! I won&#39;t let that command seal of yours go to waste. And that battle of yours did fire me up somewhat, so I feel like I have a right to vent a little bit. Alexander, leader of Macedon! I must admit, you honor your name. Your ingenuity when it comes to warfare and your skills in battle impressed me. However, a king should not only know how to conquer, but also how to defend, don&#39;t you think?&quot; 

And with that Mehmed simply raised his hand, slowly manifesting his Dardannelles Cannons. The size of these cannons were enormous, making Mehmed look like a little dwarf next to them. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, there were 7 of these cannons aimed right at Alexander. 

&quot;Beware! These cannons brought down kings, no, emperors even. They were my keys to Konstantiniyye. They brought the roman empire to their knees. I wonder if you are able to withstand them. The theodesian walls were not able to, but maybe you will surprise me.Now show me what you&#39;ve got, king of Macedon. The cannons to tear down an Empire! Show them your might! Sahi-Topu! Dardannelles!&quot; And with that Mehmed lowered his arm, signalling his cannons to shoot at the target. All 7 cannons immediately blasted away, the cannonballs flying towards Alexander. Would he find a way to come out of this scenario alive?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ā-Q&#236;ng looked at Mehmed with a look of stunned confusion. Why laugh? Why now?
…what were those cannons?

At once her body vanished from sight, gone as if she had been nothing more than a trick of the light, before somehow appearing before Alexander in the same instant, as if she had always stood there all along, placing herself between the cannons and him. Should they be allowed to hit, he would die, that much was obvious, and thus her body moved almost entirely on its own. To preserve his life.

The thought of striking Mehmed had crossed her mind ever so briefly, although now that the cannons had already manifested, she wasn’t entirely sure that getting rid of their source would delay or perhaps even cause them to vanish altogether, and she could not afford herself to waste such crucial time, not when their assault was imminent.

Magical energy burst out from her meager frame, amassing every last drop available to her and channeling it all for this single retaliatory effort, though despite it all, it yet paled against the sheer quantity currently enveloping the Servant threatening to blow her into smithereens, his stores of energy surpassing hers already even without the aid of a Seal, his might thus empowered to a degree that far eclipsed Ā-Q&#236;ng’s ability to resist it. But resist it, she would. Never again would she witness a life be taken. Xī Shī’s garden had no need for bloodshed.

The Commodan rumbled. The earth trembled.
Even from the spectator’s stands above, the countless audience members could feel the arena groaning as concrete and steel shifted to accommodate the absurd amount of magical energy Ā-Q&#236;ng forced into the ground, re-shaping it and claiming it as her own, saturating the entire environment with her memories of home, the mountainside of Yandangshan.

<strong>“...nothing stands between the Maiden of the Grove and her quarry…”</strong>

The cannons ignited. Not once. Not twice. But seven consecutive times, visiting upon their target a storm of fire and steel. Only seven. A mere seven. Ā-Q&#236;ng had once opposed an army of 2,000, and would now call upon this achievement to resist Mehmed’s own.
Her magical energy solidified and the earth’s churning halted for but a moment as she finished her preparations, her Secondary Noble Phantasm now ready to answer her command upon invocation. There was no time to waste. Slamming her hand into the ground hard enough to draw blood, her voice rang loud and clear as it called the name of her strongest ability, her pitch shrill from the stress of her exertion.

But this was not an explosion of flame, but the spilling forth of nature. One by one, a staggering number of fully formed bamboo stalks broke free from the shackles of concrete and emerged into full view, smashing into the cannonballs fired by Mehmed in a desperate attempt to destroy them… to divert them… to at the very least slow them down?

Tens of them collided with the first, but were reduced to dust and ash upon contact, unable to offer up any resistance whatsoever. Then fifty. A hundred. Two hundred. More and more would come to replace the stalks that had been pulverized, each desperate to accomplish what the previous had failed to do. But it was useless. Even pushed to the very limit of her ability, the most Ā-Q&#236;ng could summon were 2,000, the same number of men she had once disposed of in a jealous rage, but 2,000 was far from enough. Though the entire arena had become an unrecognizable landscape, this power was only meant to be used against humans. Cannons were weaponry utterly foreign to Ā-Q&#236;ng, so it was only to be expected for her every effort to be futile.

She could feel the inevitable end approaching as her valiant bamboo forest was ruthlessly decimated before her very eyes, her every attempt to resist Mehmed’s empowered attack meeting with abject failure.

The cannonfire finally reached her, her forest now no more than a heap of charcoal and splinters, and now it was time for her to join her creations.
A massive explosion rang out, dwarfing the earlier invocation of her Noble Phantasm, the impact so forceful that it rattled the glass fixtures in the arena, even cracking some, and causing the massive television screen hanging over the arena to dangerously sway side to side despite its many safeties and fortifications. Crushed rock and debris spewed out of the massive crater left by where Ā-Q&#236;ng had intercepted some of the cannonballs headed for her Master, though plenty still managed to slip past as she was unable to stop them all.

But what became of her?

Despite bolstering her defenses to the absolute limit by gathering whatever fading remnant of magical energy were left to her after the invocation of her Noble Phantasm, this was never an attack any Servant was supposed to meet head-on, no matter how tough. Like a doll tossed aside without care, her body was flung towards the outer edges of the arena, only stopping once she was met with the walls surrounding it, sinking deep into their embrace as they absorbed the full impact of her crash.

Oh?&quot; Alexander&#39;s attention snapped to Mehmed as the servant cackled over his Master&#39;s cowardice towards the combat agreement. Still, Alexander couldn&#39;t really blame his opponent. He&#39;d probably do the same thing given the situation. There was no honor in warfare. Words like honor were reserved for people willing to lose.

Infront of Alexander was seven weapons of mass destruction. Weaponry that only a servant could create. Staring down the Noble Phantasm the King smirked. To face down such a legendary weapon of war, lead by an equally legendary King was an thrilling. He had no doubts that this attack would be his undoing, although this was a fate he could quickly resign himself to. Should Alexander die, then it was up to his heir to carry on the will of Macedon. But should his weaponry succeed in persevering his life, then he could show the world the Macedonian tech that could withstand a Noble Phantasm. 

Alexander grasped at his hip, there were nineteen diamonds remaining. His shotgun was designed to elevate his defensive gems to the level of a servants attack. For a Noble Phantasma however.... He&#39;d have to use them all. As Mehmed prepared to attack, Alexander loaded two diamonds into his shotgun, a magnificent blue aura pouring out the vents in his weapon. He would fire two gems, building a mana barrier twice as strong as the one used to deflect Barrets attack, and then two more more, and then two more again. Each gem pushed beyond it&#39;s limits by Alexander&#39;s weapon, firing them them until he had no more. The usage of his artificial circuits sent intense pain throughout his entire body, his muscles constricting from the strain on his spine.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045830162652078130 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045830162652078130><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Nov-22 08:35 AM">08:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Upon building the barrier, even Alexander could tell this wouldn&#39;t be enough. With Mehmed&#39;s hand signaling the canon to fire, he was both out of time and resources. However, he was not completely out of options. Ā-Q&#236;ng moved with lightning fast speed, shaping the ground to resemble a completely different location. Just moments earlier it seemed like Lancer wanted nothing to do with Alexander, but she couldn&#39;t let another person die. 

Alexander looked wide eyed amazed at the power that his own servant had hid from him. Even though the display of her power was impressive, it still wasn&#39;t enough. The canons ravaged the bamboo forrest blowing Ā-Q&#236;ng to the side. Alexander prepared for the impact of the remaining canon shots. 

Sparks of electricity and crackling as loud as gunshots would ring out across the battlefield as the Noble Phantasm made contact with Alexander&#39;s mana barrier. The barrier cracked, each layer giving in one after another. The walls of Macedon would give in to Mehmed&#39;s canons, just like many kingdoms had before. The barrier would give in mitigating as much damage as possible, an explosion of massive proportions shaking the arena, the steel beams vibrating under everyones feet. A cloud of smoke and rubble now obscuring Alexander&#39;s last known location.

As the rubble cleared, Mehmed and Barret would be able to make out Alexander&#39;s new location. He was pressed against the wall. What little remained of his armor was no longer gold and silver, but instead painted a dark red. His body was pressed into the concrete wall in such a way that he was stuck in a standing position. His hand was still wrapped tightly around his gun, although this was only because of the intense shock delivered to his own body while building the barrier.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045830275797635103 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045830275797635103><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Nov-22 08:36 AM">08:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>If the couple listened closely they could hear a faint gurgling.

<strong>IT&#39;S OVER FOLKS! WITH THAT SURPRISE ATTACK, BARRETT VON MEER AND MEDHMED II ARE THE VICTORS! ALEXANDRIA TAKES THE LEAD IN THE HOLY GRAIL WAR!</strong>


Barrett slowly strolled over to imprint of Alexander in the wall. Rifle slung over his shoulder and his metal arm sparking back to life.

&quot;Good fight Alex.&quot; Barrett compliment jovially. &quot;I 
 admit, that fancy new tech of yours is pretty scary. If this was just a fight between mortals I would&#39;ve been in serious trouble. However, that little fact seemed to have slipped you and your Servant&#39;s mind back there.&quot;

Barrett raised his flesh hand, showing off the red crest on the back. A third of it had faded in appearance. Barrett then patted Alexander on the shoulder.

&quot;Don&#39;t let it get you too down buddy. I felt like I helped demo your wares decently and the fact that you&#39;re still breathing shows just how good it is. Keep an order open for me, I want to pick up something nice after Alexandria wins this war.&quot;

Barrett gave Alexandria one last friendly pat and walked back toward Mehmed.

&quot;Thanks for the save there partner! You&#39;re the real MVP of this match!&quot;

Barrett raised his metal arm for a high five from Mehmed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
