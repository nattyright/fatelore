The session with Barrett had gone as expected: An overwhelming defeat for Aida. For anything that the librarian had over the grizzled vet, he had three more things to make up for it. It was a child up against an adult, a fact that Mehmed found enjoyable to watch while Reynard observed with a dull expression. He waited around 10 minutes and upon realizing that Aida hadn&#39;t landed a single blow on her opponent, he stepped in and raised his hand.

<em>&quot;That&#39;s enough. I&#39;d rather my Master still be alive, thanks.&quot;</em>

And Barrett stopped, for he had proven his point. He did give Aida some modicum of praise, however, since her persistence to endure his attacks for 10 whole minutes was astonishing. But one could not win fights by simply defending, and although Aida&#39;s arsenal of ink and clothes was more than shocking enough to Barrett, he seemed to have a solution to all of her moves.

Was it Aida being too weak? Or Barrett simply having the superior mindset?

Regardless, he seemed to respect her a bit more, albeit his judgement was still the same.

<em>&quot;Do not fight in the tournament. Your opponent won&#39;t be as kind as me.&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039300283693543424 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039300283693543424><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Nov-22 08:08 AM">08:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">March 25, 8:00 AM</code>
Carrying Aida back home had been a slog. She could still walk, but the old injuries from the fight at the bazaar had reopened, causing her to lean on Reynard for support. The fox reluctantly obliged, albeit he discovered that he could barely endure her weight. Who knew that the curse of the wolf applied even in such scenarios? This left Aida with no choice but to rely on her jellyfish, sitting on it as it brought her back home. No room left for Reynard, of course.

The two spent the rest of their days at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-dust-jackets</span>, with Aida insistent on resuming her duties despite her recent injuries. Cathy and the remaining members of staff certainly didn&#39;t approve, but couldn&#39;t stop her, at least not until Aida was suddenly told that she had been put on paid leave for a week. Apparently, she had booked those holidays herself and in person, even though she had no recollection of the fact. Her mind instinctively homed in on Reynard and his antics, but it was too late to protest as the staff insisted she take her holidays and blocked her off her desk.

And so, Aida remained in her room, with Reynard being close and distant at the same time. He hid in the corners of the building and would hiss when approached. A sign that he did not want to be disturbed. He spent a few days like that, reflecting on the matters at hand.

<em>&quot;Without a doubt, this woman still plans on participating in the tournament.&quot;</em> He sighed, munching on an apple he had found in the garbage. <em>&quot;Getting beaten twice wasn&#39;t enough. Worst of all, I&#39;ll keep being dragged into this. Ugh.&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039300368439455846 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039300368439455846><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Nov-22 08:08 AM">08:08</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
It was hard to tell whether Reynard was frustrated or worried. Despite his reluctance earlier in the encounter with Barrett, he had taken every form of precaution to make the librarian&#39;s life easier. Despite being under a Command Spell, he had done his best to hide it, pretending to follow Aida willingly in order to save face for both of them. He also relented from assisting Aida in her fight against Barrett, since it would have interfered with the man&#39;s lessons and potentially gotten his Servant involved as well. All he needed to do was keep his Master alive, which he had succeeded in doing so.

He had hoped that a defeat would humble her and bring her back to earth. Make her realize how outmatched she was. Instead, Aida kept pursuing those childish ideals of hers.

<em>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you shoot?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;A-Attacking me from behind?! No fair!&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;You lazy fox! Why aren&#39;t you helping me?&quot;</em>

Honestly, what a pain she was. Still ranting about things like fairness in the face of war and defeat. Reynard even remembered her looking like a complete airhead when Barrett kicked her in the face, causing her glasses to fall off and for her to stare absentmindedly at the air. What was that all about?! 

Although, she did look cuter without them on.

...

Reynard sat for a while longer. His tail swung side by side. He was deep in thought on what he should do next. What path should he take? In the end, he couldn&#39;t think of much.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039300500585197628 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039300500585197628><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Nov-22 08:09 AM">08:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...Maybe I should just check on her.&quot; The classic answer for someone who had no answer. Just to keep things fresh, he decided to do so without hiding in the shadows. Just a face to face conversation, since some things could only be assessed in plain sight.

He entered Aida&#39;s room, finding his Master still sat on that large jellyfish. Kurage, it was called. An amusing name for such a vile creature.

&quot;If it isn&#39;t my favourite Master!&quot; Reynard exclaimed with a bright smile, ears raised and tail twitching. &quot;Are you enjoying your little holiday? I certainly hope so. You know, there is actually a lot of-&quot;

Before he could continue the small talk, he felt the murderous glare emitting from the ink familiar. If it could growl, it would have. Live long enough in the animal kingdom and even the slightest glance could speak volumes.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t <em>you</em> look at me like that. I did your best to protect your Master, mind you. I&#39;m a fox of my word!&quot; Reynard slammed his palms on his chest, before motioning his arms towards Aida. &quot;She got hit, slammed and smashed so hard that dirt got all over her face. Especially around her eyes. With those huge goggles of hers, you&#39;d think she was a tanuki! Hahahaha!&quot; He mimicked two glasses by placing fingers around his eyes.

&quot;The fact that she is here in one piece is proof enough. Right? C&#39;mon, Master. You can agree with me on this one.&quot; He stared at her, expectantly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039300526438879334 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039300526438879334><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Nov-22 08:09 AM">08:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not only was she able to cash in all the paid leaves she&#39;d saved up over her short career, she also managed to do it right before an internal waiting list had been put up for any future librarians who wished to take days off following the immediate upheaval of the tournament. A rare literary movement had been sparked following the clash between two entities who had been almost deified in their respective cultures, which really was just a romantic way of saying that visitors stormed the libraries to peruse their historical collections...only to simply forget to return all the books to their rightful places. Locating lost books, among other items, had plunged Alexandria&#39;s libraries into unprecedented turmoil.

Not that it was of any concern to Aida, of course! Following the relief of her duties, she had been put under house arrest, metaphorically speaking. Not only were her colleagues insistent that she got plenty of rest, they even went so far as to remove her desk from her workshop, curtesy of Route 934&#39;s team of capable hands that specialized in the transportation of the most cumbersome goods. Overloaded desks included, of course.

With nothing to occupy her down at the workshop and not wanting to go back to her auntie&#39;s, Aida had no choice but to make the most out of her room. She&#39;d spent the better part of her days <s>desecrating</s> decorating her room with mini ink animals, letting them parade around the room like automatons until the inky fabric deteriorated and bleached into the wood. Then she&#39;d pull the ink out of the wood and restart the process again, with a different batch of animals.

They perfectly matched their young Master&#39;s mood.

&#39;<em>Pffffffffffffffffffffft.</em>&#39;

A rather high-pitched raspberry greeted Reynard. An inky fox with a piccolo stepped rather ungraciously over the back of Reynard&#39;s foot, leaving inky pawsteps on his shoes as it rejoined the formation with the other animals. On the other side of the room, Aida lifted her gaze from the animal parade and fixed it on her Servant. It was quite cool, with none of the passion she had displayed when they were training with Barrett. It looked about what anyone would expect from someone who had been grounded with most of their toys taken away for a good few days. 

In short, she was bored out of her mind. Even her jellyfish looked more animated than she did. 

But all that changed the moment Reynard put on his sycophantic display. Aida was bored, not dejected. There was a clear difference between the two, and as Reynard opened his mouth to a wide-toothed grin, he would be reminded of just how wolf-like his Master could be. With a flick of her wrist the miniature fox that had been parading at Reynard&#39;s foot turned on its colorful kin, the piccolo in its hand now more akin to a peashooter as it blew on the end and shot an ink pellet that headed straight for Reynard&#39;s nose!

Why are you looking at me like th-&quot;

<em>squirrrt</em>

&quot;AH!&quot; Reynard squealed, his vision dimmed as a blob of ink has splashed directly on his face. His eyebrows and brow were surrounded in darkness, giving him the befitting appearance of a masked thief as he desperately tried to rub it off to no avail. Who was the tanuki now?!

&quot;You looking to pick a fight with <em>me?!&quot;</em> Reynard snarled, displaying his sharper teeth as the tiny ink fox quivered in fear, dissipating into nothingness to avoid any form of retribution. The Saber scoffed, directing his annoyance towards Aida instead. Of course, it seemed like Aida had no time for his antics, giving him the cold shoulder as she usually did. Anytime it was just the two of them, it felt like any enthusiasm left Aida&#39;s body and was replaced with contempt and annoyance.

&quot;Well, pardon me for trying to liven up your mood, <em>Rapunzel.&quot;</em> He harrumphed, mocking her with a reference. Even though Reynard wasn&#39;t exactly cultured, he seemed fond of spending his free time reading fairy tales, even if it was simply to insult them. &quot;You would think that after realizing my &#39;ignorance&#39;, you would have done your best to enlighten me. Instead you seem content spinning balls of yarn inside your cozy little tower.&quot;

The fox seemed to be referring to Aida&#39;s misguided view of him. About how he was uncultured and vile because he didn&#39;t know any better. Of course, it offended him even more to be thought of in that way.

&quot;Am I not a handsome enough prince for you?&quot; He groaned, looking at the nearest window and hoping the ink spray wouldn&#39;t be permanent. &quot;Surely I am more entertaining than this little puppet show you have put up? Imagine having such a unique style of Magecraft and using it all on <em>this.&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040538875493351484 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040538875493351484><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Nov-22 06:10 PM">18:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
It was a backhanded compliment, but Reynard&#39;s praise was genuine. He still wondered on what exactly Aida had done back at the bazaar, donning her familiar like a suit of armor. Normally, he would mock that, but even he, fool as he was, knew how impressive that type of Magecraft was.

So how did a dunce like Aida figure that out? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Reynard felt the ink leave his eyelids. The liquid felt less like liquid and more like putty under Aida&#39;s administration. With more flicks of her wrist, she kneaded the dark blob into something that resembled a large pepper and attached it to the tip of Reynard&#39;s nose, giving it a crooked shaped that resembled the nose of a witch.

&#39;If <em>I&#39;m</em> Rapunzel, then <em>you</em> are Gothel the witch.&#39; Aida huffed indignantly, bouncing on her familiar as it bobbed up and down, as if ready to agree with whatever its master had to say. &#39;Oh, how dreadful. To what torments must I endure before my handsome prince can whisk me away from this horrid place?&#39; She placed the back of her hand on her forehead and feigned emotion. &#39;Oh, woe is me. Whatever shall I do?&#39; 

Reynard wasn&#39;t the only storymaster in the house. For every ludicrous tale he spun with his words, his Master matched him equally. Her acting was simply divine - in the sense that it was obvious that she had played house far too many times in her youth, and that whoever she&#39;d lived with did nothing to stop her foolishness.

Aida cracked open an eye and peeked at Reynard from under her hand.

&#39;You are far too young to be a prince,&#39; she judged him harshly, no holds barred. &#39;A little princeling you may be, but have you ever held a crown?&#39; The nose attachment weaved itself into a crown under Aida&#39;s command and flipped itself over Reynard&#39;s head. Unfortunately, it was a tad bit too large for him. Rather than sitting at the top of his head, it instead fell around his neck and made it look as if he were wearing an oversized, spiky collar.

They didn&#39;t seem very well-coordinated, perhaps due to Reynard successfully stealing Aida&#39;s attention away from them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040638681075159150 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040638681075159150><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Nov-22 12:46 AM">00:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a flick of a wrist, she immediately shifted the weight of the ink from his face to his nose, causing his neck to crane forward while he appeared unsightly.

&quot;Grrrr!&quot; The fox snarled and Aida would only add to his frustrations, mocking and demeaning him like a common mutt. This wasn&#39;t rehearsed, but an exceptionally good improvisation. Aida addressed him with such wit and fervor that he could have seen her words put the court of animals to shame. What else would one expect from a naive librarian who most likely dreamed during her downtime at work?

Which is exactly why Reynard was irritated, because he could tell the source of her inspirations. He had begrudgingly done his own research and seen what sort of characters were in fairy tales. Princes of most noble ilk, married to princesses draped in silk. Wicked witches aiming to deceive and vicious beasts one would rather not perceive.

For Aida to disregard him with a low brow joke gave him a good idea on how she viewed him. No, that was simply how most readers viewed him. And it ticked him off.

<em><strong>&quot;HRAAAAGH!&quot;</strong></em> The remaining ink blot concerto went silent. Reynard had released a growl loud enough to match a trombone, his arms wiggling between the crown before tearing it in half and tossing it away. His tail drooped and his ears looked more like horns. Clearly he wasn&#39;t too pleased.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041141492019888159 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041141492019888159><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Nov-22 10:04 AM">10:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;And who knew the princess would be so vile? So vicious. So <em>incompetent!&quot;</em> Reynard screamed. &quot;Why are you here right now? Is it because of your own power? No. <em>This waste of a fox brought your sorry butt all the way here.</em> You were <em>this</em> close to losing your legs, and even closer to losing your life.&quot;

His smile turned cruel. <strong>&quot;I could have let that happen.</strong> What would you have done then? Have you ever given that a serious thought?&quot; He was fuming, but truth be told, he simply felt hurt. Not that he would admit it, of course.

&quot;But I saved you. I cannot think of a reason why, of course. Maybe I planned on using you, maybe not. Maybe I genuinely cared.&quot; He laughed. &quot;But really, I don&#39;t care for the reason, because at the end of the day, I gained nothing from it. I was a fool, because the first thing you decided to do after getting pummelled, was to go <em>get pummelled again!&quot;</em>

He slapped a nearby stool in frustration, before dragging it forward as he advanced towards Aida.

&quot;And of course, I had to drag you back again. Like a dog. At that point, I should have just let you be. But curious as I am, I peeked at your injuries and noticed that the old ones had reopened.&quot; He said, eyeing the jellyfish. The only reason Aida was constantly on it was because she had been so reckless with her health lately.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041141559426551899 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041141559426551899><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Nov-22 10:04 AM">10:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;So, like a fool, I decided to disguise myself as you and ask for a lot of holidays. I could not imagine you being happy to work while still injured. Then, I just vanished from view, since I know that you already despise me. Well, I hate you back too!&quot; He stuck his tongue out.

Eventually, he reached Aida. He then placed the stool and climbed on top of it, now towering above her and the jellyfish as he stared both of them down.

<strong>&quot;Do you know how shameful it is to spell this out loud?!&quot;</strong> Reynard shrilled in her ears. &quot;It would be comparable to me explaining my tricks and deceit in meticulous detail. Imagine if the bumbling bear knew of my plan to poke him with bees, or if the conniving cat knew of my schemes to stick him in a farmer&#39;s hole. Ridiculous!&quot;

&quot;And yet, here I am, speaking. You know why, Aida? Because you&#39;re the <em>worst!</em> Never in my stories have I encountered someone so gullible yet so insistent. So naive yet so forceful. You keep talking about justice, and truth and winning the Holy Grail War...<strong>But what have you done to help?</strong> <em>I&#39;m</em> the only one pulling my weight here. You&#39;ve burdened me with your childish dreams and I&#39;m frankly <em>sick</em> and <em>tired</em> of it!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041141781514960970 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041141781514960970><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Nov-22 10:05 AM">10:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He blew hot air in her face. Aida was able to see every tooth and fang in his mouth as he hissed at her like the wild animal he was supposed to be. His eyes were filled with anger and frustration, but there was a tinge of shame to them. After all, he was merely rambling because someone thought ill of him. What better way to feel better than to put someone else down?

&quot;If someone like me is still a villain in your eyes, then you&#39;re about as <em>bad</em>.&quot; Reynard gave the closest thing to an angry laugh. &quot;We could be partners in crime even. Just like how I used to be with Isengrim. Hah. No wonder you&#39;re a wolf too. You&#39;re just as selfish and lazy and <em>fat</em> like him!&quot;

Aida&#39;s glasses were now covered in spit and steam from how close Reynard was screaming at her. It got to the point that she could sense her jellyfish being ready to counterattack if the need arose. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In fact, it was just like any other time they&#39;d gotten together for more than a few minutes. All attempts at communication - if what they&#39;d been doing could even be called that - would burst at the seams like a cheaply made dress, revealing all that was vile underneath. Reynard truly spared no mercy today, so much so that even Aida was caught off guard. Who&#39;d have thought that mere words could elicit such violent responses from a Servant whose existence was made from those very words himself? 

But rather than gaining immunity to words, Reynard seemed to suffer from them greatly. Fiction was his reality. It gave him strength, but it could also take it all away. The naivete in Aida&#39;s insults seemed to be the perfect weapon against him, the implications lording over him even more so than Command Spells. Reynard&#39;s outburst was unsightly even by his own standards. It was a rare sight compared to the indifferent attitude he usually displayed around her, and it finally made her realize that she&#39;d touched a nerve.

That realization came too little too late. Reynard invaded her personal space with slander and spittle, venting out every ounce of frustration that had been piling up within him. He bashed on her ignorance, pointed out her hypocrisy, he recounted every single one of her mistakes that she&#39;d so happily passed off as justice, and ended on possibly the worst note a fox could ever toot - he compared her to his worst nemesis, the wolf Isengrim!

&#39;...So that&#39;s what you think of me.&#39;

Aida took off her glasses and began to wipe spit from the lenses on her dress. She did it meticulously, all the while refused to meet Reynard&#39;s eyes. It was a rare act of submission. Was she feeling guilty because everything Reynard had said was true?
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043627166602113024 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043627166602113024><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Nov-22 06:41 AM">06:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;How long have you been holding all that in?

I can&#39;t do anything but sit here and complain. I&#39;m every bit as lazy and incompetent as you thought.&#39;

<em>plop</em>

A drop of water fell on her lenses. She realized that she was crying. Miserably, she wiped her glasses dry and place it back on her face, her iris strangely dilated behind them as more tears swirled around her eyes. 

&#39;I hope you&#39;re happy. I hope you&#39;re satisfied now that you&#39;ve finally proven how unworthy I am. I hope you&#39;re feeling good about all of your good deeds that I&#39;m clearly too obtuse to appreciate! Oh, what a saint you are!&#39; The sorrow rapidly disintegrated into fury as she jerked her head up and glared at him.

‘Yes, I&#39;m having a hard time! And why wouldn&#39;t I be? The other Masters all have their Servants, but me? I don&#39;t even feel like a Master. I research, I fight, I clean after your mess all around the Guild. I have no choice but to do everything all on my own, all while you were off chasing after ladies and nicking food from the kitchens!&#39;

Tears were flowing freely down her face now, but she didn&#39;t care anymore. &#39;But the truth is, <strong>you were never there when I needed you</strong>. You always show up fashionably late, after I&#39;ve made a complete fool of myself. <em>Then</em> you swoop in and save me and expect me to treat you like a knight in shining armor?&#39; She stared at him in disbelief.

&#39;And you think the storybooks did you dirty.&#39;

She threw Reynard a look he could only be able to describe as contempt. There was no way around it. He had stepped way over the line, and Aida had never been someone who knew how to hold her emotions in check. She judged him openly, even more so now than she&#39;d ever done. &#39;Tell me, Reynard, just how am I supposed to feel gratitude towards someone who would only rescue <em>after</em> watching me suffer?

Reynard&#39;s limitations of pen and ink had been undone, allowing him to show exactly how he felt and perceived the world around him. Of course, his first instinct was to use this newfound freedom to hurt, as was tradition for the fox.

When Aida replied in her typical, cold demeanor, the fox harrumphed through his lips. He had expected that reaction, for it had become the librarian&#39;s trademark at this point. Anytime he brought up valid complaints, his Master would constantly brush them off, for he was nothing more than a Servant. A tool to be used. He was sure that Aida didn&#39;t care at all about his circumstances and that they would return to the same old song and dance in a minute.

It didn&#39;t happen. Instead, she became quiet, avoiding the fox&#39;s gaze as he now towered above her with the aid of a stool. She removed her glasses, eyes looking downward as she wiped traces of spit off them, along with some other watery substance. She did all that while still continuing on, ranting about the past and Reynard&#39;s words, reaffirming them as truth while her voice grew heavier with each passing second.

<em>plop plop</em>

Eventually, her body gave in, instinctively crying at the flurry of emotions that she was feeling in that instant. Reynard just stared at her in bewilderment, his ears droopy and his tail static. He stood still and silent, as if worried that any further movement would spell the end of him. It made no logical sense: This wasn&#39;t like a hunt, where there were predators and prey. Yet it felt tense all the same, with the Saber feeling as if one more wrong word would have killed his conscience.

He didn&#39;t think he was wrong.

<em>Then why didn&#39;t he feel like he was in the right?</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043715596732334081 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043715596732334081><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Nov-22 12:33 PM">12:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Aida then attacked. Perhaps she did so because she noticed Reynard faltering, or perhaps she was simply the type to speak her heart out regardless of the situation. She got closer, shaking the stool with both her words and actions as she lamented of the various times that the furry companion had let her down. The amount of antics he had done, both lecherous and gluttonous. The number of times Reynard had saved Aida from situations caused by his own negligence. The constant, prideful behavior where he expected to be praised simply because he did something that he viewed as good, without considering what others thought about it.

It was only his view that mattered after all. Others might as well be specks of dust.

Just like how it didn&#39;t matter what he thought about himself. The readers were those who decided.

When Reynard made that connection, he felt like puking. His face turned pale and his fur lost that trademark fuzziness. He could barely stand straight with every word coming from Aida&#39;s mouth. Never in his life had he met someone so earnest and critical about his life. He couldn&#39;t even bear to look back to his Master, who was glaring at him with contempt and showing him exactly for who he was.

He wasn&#39;t even the vile fox that he had thought he was. The so-called trickster that represented a symbol for the weak. No, instead, he was a controlling, manipulative, vicious animal. One who wanted power over his Master more than anything else.

<em>&quot;I don&#39;t even care about you, you four-eyed bug. Stop putting words in my-&quot;</em>

But if he didn&#39;t care, why bother helping her in times of need? A Servant such as him could have easily thrived if Aida had succumbed to her own hardships.

<em>&quot;-I needed to keep her alive for my own survival. Plus, it would have shown my worth and usefulness as a-&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043715638406946866 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043715638406946866><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Nov-22 12:33 PM">12:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But if he cared about how she viewed him, why not help her earnestly? Anytime the Saber assisted Aida, it was always in a shady, indirect way. He always helped when it let him show off. Or when it would lead to a situation where he could curry favor.

<em>&quot;-I was merely being humble! What sort of show off would constantly flaunt their exploits every single moment-&quot;</em>

But it happened at the office. At the hospital as well. All those times Reynard had helped, was it for Aida&#39;s sake or for his? Was it for the peace of mind of knowing that his Master was alright, or was it for the selfish reason of knowing that he was a good person?

<em>&quot;I did a good thing, therefore I&#39;m a good person.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Aida is alive, therefore I&#39;m a good Servant for keeping my Master alive.&quot;</em>

But did he ever ask Aida if he was good? Did his Master ever view him as such? All he did was impose his view of &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39; on his Master, without ever considering their opinion or feedback on the matter. He was no fox, because foxes weren&#39;t foolish enough to believe in such stupidity. He was no different than a wolf and a lion. Prideful and greedy.

He was a book that only wanted to be interpreted in a certain way. All other interpretations could eat his tail. That is the type of life Reynard wanted. Not a peaceful one, nope. He was just fooling himself. What he wanted was a life of <em>his</em> book being read in <em>his</em> way. 

No wonder a librarian wouldn&#39;t stand for that.

<em>rattle rattle</em>

The stool had started to tremble from both Aida&#39;s voice and Reynard&#39;s motions. Had it not been a hot and bright spring day, one would think that it was a cold winter outside. The fox was trembling, his body shaking from frustration, anger and sadness. It was always hard to admit that you had flaws, but for Reynard, it was like having ones livelihood on the line.

If he couldn&#39;t even be a fox, then, what was he?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043715702923735142 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043715702923735142><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Nov-22 12:33 PM">12:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;But I helped you!&quot;</strong> Reynard screamed, his pitch causing Aida&#39;s ears to buzz. &quot;I looked for ways to stop you from losing your life in a Grail War. I asked the doctors about all sorts of ways to help you back when you were at the hospital. I tried to make sure you got enough rest after you got discharged, <em>and somehow I&#39;m the villain?!&quot;</em>

He refused to admit that he was wrong. He stomped the stool repeatedly like a petulant child that had been denied dessert.

&quot;How is that bad? Am I not doing my best to protect you? You did everything else on your <em>own.</em> Why did you pursue our opponents in a public market of all things? Why did you immediately ask to spar against one of our allies when your legs haven&#39;t even recovered? Do you think I&#39;m sadistic enough to enjoy it when I see you get hurt?!&quot;

He snarled, shouting with enough furor to rival Aida&#39;s glare. Perhaps she had really summoned a Servant that best suited her demeanor. Just like her, Reynard refused to back down.

In fact, he was so furious, that he had neglected his precarious balance on the stool. The next stomp send him flying like a catapult, right towards Aida. He landed graciously, legs on her lap and face in her chest. Normally, he would enjoy it, but he couldn&#39;t even do that. Instead, Aida felt a warm wetness in her as Reynard slowly lifted his head up and revealed his best attempted at a death glare, which was betrayed by a light stream of tears trailing from his eyes.

&quot;Even if you hate me,&quot;

&quot;even if I&#39;m despised,&quot;

&quot;even if I&#39;m a selfish, manipulative fox that takes advantage of na&#239;ve librarians,&quot;

<strong>&quot;I still want to prove that I&#39;m a good person!&quot;</strong> The only honest word that came from a fox on that day. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her arms instinctively came around him, but there was a distinct lack of warmth in the embrace. She held Reynard rigidly, bewildered beyond belief. 

&#39;You want to <em>prove</em> that you&#39;re a good person?&#39; She whispered.

She felt something unlock within her, like a jigsaw puzzle suddenly falling into place, and the world blurred as a new rush of tears streamed uncontrollably down her cheeks. Except those weren&#39;t touching tears. Nor were they tears of anger or sadness. They were tears of shame. 

She, too, had wanted to prove herself. 

She had wanted to prove to none other than her auntie dearest that she, too, was capable of shouldering Alexandria&#39;s fate. Nothing was too outrageous for the sake of achieving her goal. Nothing would stop her, not even if she had to act completely out of character and leave her cushy desk job behind for a barbaric act of violence. Fighting had never been her forte, just like kindness had never been Reynard&#39;s. One tug from the enemy and she was flailing, and how was that different from how Reynard was struggling now?

She resented her own thoughts. Always quick to draw parallels between life and her beloved storybooks, her encyclopedic brain betrayed her at this crucial moment as a horrific thought wormed its way into her mind. 

<em>You aren&#39;t so different after all,</em> the small voice said. <em>Look at you both. Biting off more than you can chew. Trying to be someone you are not.</em>

<em>No, we are nothing alike,</em> she shook her head fervently. She was ashamed at herself for even comparing herself to the fox, but all the same the small voice continued.

<em>But what of the damage you&#39;d done to dear auntie?</em> It quipped, almost gleefully so. <em>Coming and going as you please, did you even apologize for ruining her kitchen?</em>

Aida snapped. The poor fox bore the brunt of her emotional turmoil as she slammed him down like one might do if they were angry with their teddy bear. Thank god they were on Kurage the jellyfish, and Reynard felt himself rebound against the familiar&#39;s soft exterior like he were riding a trampoline.

&#39;Why do you want to protect me anyway?!&#39; Aida pursued her prey, her voice starting to crack. &#39;What do you mean, &quot;prove yourself&quot;?‘ She sounded frightened all of a sudden, which was unusual for her. ’Do you even care about what you do, so long as the outcome is the one you want? <strong>Do you even care about <em>me</em>?!</strong>&#39;

The librarian couldn&#39;t believe the insolence in Reynard&#39;s words. He claimed to want to be a good person, when his actions had shown anything <em>but?</em>

She broke into tears, channeling her frustration at the little scamp by attempting to slam him down hard on whatever lurked below. The fox had already experienced this abuse plenty of times, but would be surprised to be saved by Kurage&#39;s gelatinous exterior, preventing any harm at the cost of making his face feel sticky for a bit.

When he reemerged, Aida&#39;s face was just inches away from his, tears flowing down as her voice started to crack with every wild question she tossed in his direction. This was the fury of a librarian that had never had to express such emotion before. It was only befitting that Reynard felt confused as well. In all of his adventures, misadventures, tales and tragedies, he had never encountered someone so direct and genuine. So oppressive and forceful with her words that he felt like he was being drowned.

The fox was known was being witty, but he felt like his voice had disappeared in that instant. It took three words to fool a bear. Ten more for a cat and thirty more for a king. But all of those individuals were villains. They had it coming, in storytelling&#39;s terms. But what about Aida? What sin had she committed? There was nothing for him to fool and warp. No weakness to expose, because Aida was wearing them on her chest and showing them for him to see. Her direct approach was the closest thing to a direct counter to the fox&#39;s antics.

But he couldn&#39;t just stay silent.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043995144485097602 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043995144485097602><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Nov-22 07:03 AM">07:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;D-Don&#39;t ask me questions that not even <strong>I</strong> know the answer to!&quot; He shouted back, his animal instincts taking over as his tail and ears grew bigger while his voice reached greater highs. A common strategy of woodland creatures to attempt to look intimidating when facing a fearsome predator.

&quot;I never asked for you, and you never asked for me either. That much is true. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised you still keep me around in the first place.&quot; The fox scoffed. &quot;But I&#39;m not <em>heartless.</em> It&#39;s <em>you</em> that viewed me that way. Why <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> I protect you? You&#39;re my lifeline, after all. If you weren&#39;t here, I wouldn&#39;t be here either. You&#39;re just-&quot;

He bit his lip, knowing that it was only a half truth. Reynard did cherish this new world for all the opportunities that it offered, but opportunities were just that: Dreams. Dreams that he didn&#39;t know the full scope of. Which meant that even if he died, a part of him knew that deep down he wasn&#39;t missing much. A dream could remain a dream.

But on the day of his summon, when he saw Aida cry at summoning an incompetent Servant, he was shocked.

<em>&quot;What do I do?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;No one has ever cried in my stories.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;No one has ever wanted someone like me to play the role of a Servant. Why is she so disappointed? She should have known better. Fool.&quot;</em>

Yet Aida kept crying. It infuriated the fox, for he hated unfamiliar situations. He was smart, but only as smart as the book allowed him to be. The character of Reynard was never given much depth when it came to intimate matters.

Perhaps, that is why he appeased her. He stopped her crying, for better or worse, especially with the abuse he got afterwards!

Yet he didn&#39;t regret that choice. Never once did he feel like he had been in the wrong to stop Aida&#39;s incessant crying.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043995196049870929 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043995196049870929><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Nov-22 07:04 AM">07:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The next time, it was after their first fight. Aida was crippled, unconscious and Reynard was facing two foes at once. His instincts urged him to save his own skin and runaway, but the moment he stared at his Master&#39;s condition, his arms moved on their own.

Was it pity? Self-preservation? Wanting to curry favor with Aida, much like he had tried to do now? Was it genuine kindness or anything but?

He didn&#39;t know. All he knew was that it felt <em>good.</em> It felt good to be obedient. It felt good to know that you had done something your Master would have expected of you.

Then why did he always avoid facing Aida directly? Why did he offer his charity in the shadows, preventing Aida from thanking him personally? Why did he always avoid Aida&#39;s plans and only help her in his own, special way?

<em>&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m stupid?&quot;</em> The thought confounded him. How could he, the smartest trickster in the forest, be <em>dumb?!</em> Surely, this was a mistake? Surely, the author would reveal something that would tie everything together and explain his irrational decis-

No. It wouldn&#39;t. Because Reynard <em>was</em> the author now. He could decide his own story, yet had been too concerned with rewriting what remained in the past. He tried to change others&#39; view of him without ever taking notice of whether he was changing himself or not.

It was impossible for people to do a 180. Bigger men than him had tried. Yet he had pursued that goal regardless. What a complete and utter fool. He felt like shriveling up and disappearing under Aida&#39;s dress.

Which is what he proceeded to do, much to the librarian&#39;s embarrassment. His vulpine instincts took over as he buried his face into her groin and hurriedly covered himself underneath her long dress. It was warm. Safe.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043995238898860055 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043995238898860055><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Nov-22 07:04 AM">07:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I <strong>care</strong> about you being happy! I <strong>hate</strong> seeing you sad! I <strong>hate</strong> thinking that I made someone feel sad! I <strong>love</strong> when people say that I made them happy! There!! Are you happy now?!?&quot; He shouted, sneezing through her clothes as Aida felt snot run down her legs.

&quot;I wanted to prove that I was a good person. All you know is that I&#39;m a trickster, a fraud, someone who cheats people out of their money and eats hares that got lost in the woods. Those damned books caused this!&quot; Reynard screamed.

&quot;But I&#39;m more than that! Why can&#39;t I feel happy when I do something good? Just because I lie, does that mean that I should not tell the truth? Just because I cheat, does that mean I cannot help those in need? <strong>Why have you humans written me as so?!&quot;</strong> He sneezed again, breaking into a tantrum. It seemed like Aida&#39;s questions had fried his brain, perhaps in a way that she hadn&#39;t even intended. Could she truly relate to a character from a book that had to deal with centuries of typecasting?

But then, why did Reynard constantly act so standoffish? Why did he keep insulting her? Why did he assist her in the most convoluted of ways? Perhaps, the fox hadn&#39;t truly understood humans after all. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t as if his stories had been penned by otherworldly beings. Sometimes the people he encountered on the streets of Alexandria seemed less human than he was. 

What defined humanity anyway?

<strong>&#39;KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&#39;</strong> 

A high-pitched scream nearly pierced Reynard&#39;s eardrums. He was nearly squished into a noodle as Aida dropped to her knees, her kneecaps crushing the poor fox into the jellyfish&#39;s lumpy tendrils until he was, once again, firmly lodged inside. Only his head remained visible on the surface, like the budding flower of a potted plant. 

But his vision remained dark, as his face was muffled by a thick frock of frills and lace. Aida&#39;s dress covered his head like a thick duvet, giving him a full taste of the horror of her choice of attire as it nearly asphyxiated him under its weight. 

Then came a hard smack across his cheek, the pain fortunately lessened by the layers of fabric, yet he felt the impact nonetheless. His head was turned sideways with the momentum of the slap. Then another came. And another. Not all of them were slaps. Some of them landed on the top of his head, bobbing his head in and out of the jellyfish. It didn&#39;t hurt much under the dress, but the shame! Oh, the shame of being abused like a glorified whack-a-mole toy!

&#39;Not&#39;—<em><strong>smack</strong></em>—&#39;a single&#39;—<em><strong>smack</strong></em>—&#39;story&#39;—<em><strong>smack</strong></em>—&#39;told you&#39;—<em><strong>smack</strong></em>—&#39;to hide under&#39;—<em><strong>smack</strong></em>—&#39;a lady&#39;s dress!&#39;

<em><strong>SMACK!</strong></em>

The final blow sunk his head so far into the jellyfish that it took him a few seconds to reemerge. Aida&#39;s distorted voice echoed through the jellyfish&#39;s coagulated body.

She&#39;d tried to look away from it, the superficial  desire to prove herself a woman of substance and weigh her own worth on a scale. &#39;How do you know what makes me happy if you don&#39;t even ask?!&#39; 

<em>SMACK!</em>

&#39;I hate people like you! Why do you always assume what&#39;s best for me? Why can&#39;t you just be normal and ask me what I want? Oh no, Aida, you are not cut out for this. Don&#39;t be silly, Aida, and listen to me! Don&#39;t waste your talent, Aida. Get your head out of the clouds, Aida. You are destined to fail if you don&#39;t heed my advice, Aida! I&#39;m <strong>sick</strong> of people like you trying to dictate me! Why do you all insist on writing the story of <em>my</em> life?!&#39;

<em>POMF</em>

A huge weight crumbled on top of Reynard, his forehead lighting up with pain as it collided against Aida&#39;s on the other side of the fabric. Aida curled up into a fetal position and sobbed into her hands.

&#39;What&#39;s so bad with being a storybook character anyway?!&#39; She hiccupped, not caring about her tears ruining her beautiful clothes. &#39;If you hate it that much, then I&#39;ll gladly switch places with you.

All he could do was find solace in the animal instinct of burrowing underground, a survival technique that had been adopted by many foxes in the past, fictional or not. He drowned out external noises and focused on his own feelings: Why did he feel so hot whenever Aida tore down his words, when he was a character known for being cold and calculating? Why did he not have the courage to face her despite being brave enough to lie in a king&#39;s face?

<em><strong>&#39;KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&#39;</strong></em>

He didn&#39;t get the opportunity to figure that out, for Aida had already gone ballistic at the sight of the fox digging under her dress. She could feel his hands and snout all over her legs, causing her to kneel and crush Reynard with the aid of Kurage. He was completely submerged inside the jellyfish, his head being the only thing exposed to the outside world.

What little there was of it, at least, since he was still buried by Aida&#39;s dress. As she moved around in an agitated manner, he caught a whiff of soft textures and strange odors, which proceeded to then suffocate him as the lady&#39;s hold grew heavier.

<strong>SMACK</strong>

Then the slaps came, one after the other. &quot;OW!&quot; Reynard screamed, with such a terrifying and shrill voice that one would think Aida was partaking in some arcane ritual of some sort. The screams kept coming with each of the librarian&#39;s slaps, but Aida did not care. In fact, her own voice overpowered Reynard&#39;s, as she gave him a lesson on manners while also chastising him for his impudence.

How dare he be like the rest? How dare he and everyone else decide Aida&#39;s life for her? Could she not be trusted with her own decisions? Why did everyone seek to undermine her?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044408563424034866 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044408563424034866><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Nov-22 10:26 AM">10:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
There was a lot of pain in those blows. For both her and Reynard. For once, even the fox could feel it. She wasn&#39;t abusing him out of sadism—<em>or at least he hoped so</em>—but because Reynard reminded her of those who never saw Aida as <em>herself.</em> It was always Aida, the librarian. Aida, the ink weaver. Aida, the daydreamer. Titles assigned to her since birth, since her introductions, without taking care to verify whether Aida embraced those titles with pride or not.

It made the fox feel even more frustrated. He desperately craved to be unique. To feel as if his struggles were his and his alone. And now, he had to deal with the revelation that his own incompetent Master was dealing with something all too similar. <em>And he was far too blind to see it?!</em>

He didn&#39;t even care about being Aida&#39;s Servant, yet he somehow still felt like a disappointment.

<em><strong>BONK!</strong></em>

Not even Aida&#39;s massive attack to his forehead could hurt him as much as that statement. In fact, the librarian took it a lot worse, breaking into tears once more as she cradled herself into a fetal position. It got to her clothes, ruining that exquisite fabric of hers as she ranted more and more about how foolish Reynard sounded.

<strong>&quot;Don&#39;t you dare say that!&quot;</strong> Reynard hissed, emerging from her cloth like a nun out of convent. He immediately grabbed her by the hands and dragged her forward, headbutting her once more. Her glasses almost fell off from the impact.

&quot;It&#39;s easy for you to say, since you idolize your books with the mentality of a child. What do you even know about a storybook?! My story is already written. My message and moral is known to all. There is no depth to me that hasn&#39;t been already dissected to death by annoying scholars such as yourself.&quot; The fox pounced at her, pinning her down by the shoulders and having their faces meet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044408601768382514 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044408601768382514><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Nov-22 10:26 AM">10:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;At least your story has yet to be written.&quot;</strong> Reynard asserted, his voice sounding slightly calmer. &quot;Reynard&#39;s story might have ended, but Aida&#39;s story can continue forever more. The least I can do as someone who experienced it myself is to make sure your <strong>story ends up right!&quot;</strong> He clamored. 

&quot;You only get one chance to write your story, so are we to blame for making sure that it ends up <em>perfect?</em> Even a dunce like you should be able to piece two and two together. I don&#39;t know about your auntie. I don&#39;t even know what everyone else wants from you, but there is nothing I&#39;d like less than <strong>for you to end up like me.&quot;</strong> He glared at her intensely.

&quot;And you&#39;re right, I never asked you what you wanted. Because frankly, <strong>I don&#39;t know what you want!</strong> Do you really want to win for Alexandria? Is that <em>really</em> it? You want a Holy Grail just to make your own city happy? Don&#39;t play dumb with me, we both know that isn&#39;t the case. I can sniff lies with ease, so either you come clean or I&#39;ll just accept that you&#39;re a hypocrite.&quot; Reynard gave another light growl, still keeping Aida close. This was his ultimatum to see what sort of person Aida Moretti truly was. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She imagined herself scattering as the pain blossomed from the middle of her forehead and spread to the rest of her head. She swore that she could almost feel her brains sloshing around. Even with the Wolf&#39;s Curse in full effect, the emotions Reynard had packed into the headbutt managed to penetrate it and reach his master like a hammer, a painful <em>knock! knock! knock!</em> on her head that yelled at her: <em><strong>wake up!</strong></em>

<em><strong>&#39;No!&#39;</strong></em> She screamed in retaliation, curling further into a ball so she didn&#39;t have to deal with all the energy Reynard was suddenly exuding. Even his fur seemed to have brightened up as he bounced back and chased her with renewed vigor. The exuberance pained her. She didn&#39;t want to deal with any of this right now! Let her wallow in her sadness! Leave her be!

But Reynard had already latched onto his prey. In a burst of strength that surprised perhaps even him, he turned the tables on Aida and pinned her to the floor. The role had been temporarily switched. It was now Aida&#39;s turn to endure as the fox tore into her ego with...with...

Self-deprecation?

Was that even possible, coming from an egoist like Reynard? 

The surprise clammed her up for but a moment, but it was enough for Reynard&#39;s words to get under her skin. Reynard the fox, as awkward as he sounded, was trying to cheer her up? Had the whole world turned topsy-turvy? She gasped, her breath halfway between a laugh and a snort of derision. 

&#39;I don&#39;t have - a story,&#39; she managed to choke out in between gasps. <strong>&#39;My story ended ten years ago.&#39;</strong>

Just why had the Throne brought Reynard to her side? Just to expose her insecurities?

&#39;I don&#39;t know what I want, alright?!&#39; She grabbed a cushion and slammed it into Reynard&#39;s face, so she didn&#39;t have to look at him anymore. &#39;I love fairytales! I love Alexandria! I love my auntie! I love Cathy, and Audre, and everyone at the guild! I love them so much, because there is nothing else! I have nothing else! I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if I stopped loving them!&#39; 

Another cushion smacked Reynard across the face. Aida was running out of things to throw. Kurage the jellyfish looked between its master and its Reynard anxiously, as if it couldn&#39;t quite decide between its master and Reynard which one was doing more damage. It seemed that its master was winning in the physical department, at least...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045796887585894470 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045796887585894470><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Nov-22 06:23 AM">06:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite his Saber Class status, he could never hold his own against Aida due to the Wolf&#39;s Curse. He had accepted that reality long ago, except those rules seemed to be fading with each finger gripping Aida and dragging her closer. That was enough for him to tell that his Master was distraught. Too distraught to overpower him.

While he was somewhat enjoying that feeling of dominance, snickering inside at all the things he wanted to pay Aida back for, he was interrupted by a smooshing pillow that Aida flung at him with renewed vigor. It didn&#39;t hurt, but he could still feel the impact, forcing him to release his grip and take a few steps back.

&quot;Mmmmph!&quot; He grunted, biting at the pillow and letting polyester fall down as he tore it to shreds. He then spat it out, feeling icky at the invasive cloth strands that now filled his mouth. Reynard would have been furious, had he not known that this strength was coming from Aida lashing out. Her hurried gasps could still be heard. Her hair was a mess and her face even more so, filled with tears and flickering glasses. She started going into delirious rants, the kind that annoyed Reynard even more.

But there was less crying. Part of her even looked like she was smiling. Laughter escaped from momentary gasps here and there. It made Reynard feel rather warm.

At least, until he started saying more and more ridiculous nonsense. It really ticked him off. He had already laid out his heart bare for her, how much <em>denser</em> could she get?!

<em>POMF</em>

Another pillow to the face, blocking his vision entirely as he instead grumbled and clenched his fists. In an act of impulse, he grabbed the pillow and tore it at the edges, releasing more tufts of fake feathers that littered the room like snow. Kurage wouldn&#39;t appreciate it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045848719473520761 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045848719473520761><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Nov-22 09:49 AM">09:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Why are you telling me what you love? Do you think I care? <em>I&#39;m not even mentioned on that list!&quot;</em> Reynard shouted, raising his arms in confusion. &quot;If you&#39;re so dull that you can&#39;t think of anything you want. If you&#39;re so foolish that you&#39;re already happy with what you have, <strong>then why don&#39;t you own them?&quot;</strong>

He asked. His tone was acidic, but Aida could tell he was attempting to guide her somewhere. &quot;If you love them so much, <strong>marry them!</strong> Why are you so worried about them leaving? Why do you think you will be <em>&#39;nothing&#39;</em> without them? No, if anything-&quot;

A malicious glint in his eyes appeared, a nature that had been honed by pages of villainy. 

<strong>&quot;-They should be nothing without you.</strong> If you don&#39;t own them, they don&#39;t matter. Simple as that!&quot; Reynard laughed for a minute, before reverting to a snarl. 

&quot;Surely someone as dumb as you can figure that out? Why are you crying like a petulant child then? Is this your way of appeasing me?!&quot; Reynard did not mince his words, his voice almost sounding like he was threatening Aida. He marched towards her, every stomp shaking the room as his figure appeared more distorted and fantastical underneath Aida&#39;s watery glasses.

&quot;Does Cathy care if you love her? Nope, she probably just hopes you&#39;re fine enough to show up at work soon. Does your auntie care if you love her? Nope, she probably just hopes you don&#39;t do anything reckless and foolish. Do <em>I</em> care if you love me? <strong>No!</strong> I only want to avoid having a Master that annoys me with their constant crying!&quot; The fox spat out.

&quot;Your love is just a burden. Your worries are unfounded. If you want something as childish as everybody being happy, <em>then you could at least try being happy yourself.</em> Can&#39;t you put two and two together?&quot; He continued his advance, walking across the pile of junk him and Aida had created and grabbing a pen from the floor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;And I don&#39;t care if your story ended ten, twenty or even a hundred years ago,&quot; Reynard reached Aida and grabbed her hands unceremoniously, before forcing the pen into her palms. &quot;you&#39;re still here. You can write your own story. Even if it&#39;s the ridiculous story of a librarian thinking she can win a Holy Grail War. Bah.&quot;

He spat his tongue out in his disgust, but also held her hands tightly. &quot;I hate to see idiots pursue foolish dreams, but if you&#39;re going to insist on that, do it for something less ridiculous than love. Be greedy, for God&#39;s sake! If you can&#39;t find something to wish for, then simply wish for something you want.&quot; He said with the tone of someone who was tired of drilling common sense into people. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a moment, she couldn&#39;t tell whether Reynard was trying to frighten her or encourage her. He couldn&#39;t truly overpower her with strength, so he turned to the next thing: words. Words, unreliable as they were, expensive and catastrophic if spoken by the wrong mouth. But still the Saber tried, swashbuckling around the room and flapping his arms in wild gesticulation as he parried Aida&#39;s words with his own. 

<em>TO HELL WITH YOUR IDEOLOGIES,</em> he seemed to scream at her very soul. <em>TO HELL WITH YOUR BENEVOLENCE!</em>

He was denying her entire reason of being. He was tearing her apart, then building her anew by the use of his own reason. An animalist, survival-of-the-fittest kind of reasoning that had managed to preserve him for millennia, and now he was imparting it onto his Master in a rare act of generosity. 

Aida blinked. She was so shocked by his words that she had forgotten to wipe her tears. 

&#39;A burden? Me?&#39; No. No, no. This was all wrong. She had never...she would never...

She felt the weight of the pen in her hand. Reynard had given her back her prized tool, and was now clamoring for her to ditch her childish tendencies and draft her own path. What was going through his mind as he handed over the very tool of his creation? Didn&#39;t he loathe his creators? Didn&#39;t he want to redo his own story? Had he made the right choice by placing the pen into the writer&#39;s hand, or was he condemning himself to the same old fate?

<em>WRITE.</em> The pen suddenly weighed a thousand tons. <em>BE GREEDY AND WRITE.</em> 

Was it really so easy? To stop...loving. To ditch...everything. Think for herself. Was that it? Greed, was that what she&#39;d lacked?

She reached inside herself, and found nothing. The story she was meant to write, the one that belonged to her and her alone...

Now it was her turn to look at him expectantly.
