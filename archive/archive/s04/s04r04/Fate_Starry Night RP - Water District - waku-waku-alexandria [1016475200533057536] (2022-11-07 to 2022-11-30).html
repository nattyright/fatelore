She could feel the sand crunch underneath her feet and the sun warm her back. It felt good here, no recycled air, no cold electric lights and no one supervising her every move. She was free once again. 

Only five days had passed since her fight to survive Republic&#39;s onslaught, five days since she had the wind ripped out of her chest and confined to a bed. Now she stood on a beach , no pain clouding her mind and no broken wings stopping her flight. 

It was a miracle, pure and simple, that she was out there. Yet it was not one of science or even magecraft, but the unexpected kindness of the very people who grounded her in the first place. It was almost impossible to wrap her head around how such a monster on the battlefield could act so friendly off it. There clearly was something going on with Mikhail and her past experiences made her wary of the man. 

He overthrew tyrants and sought freedom yet found it taken away from him all the same. Tragic but it did not make sense to the girl. Sure, maybe you couldn&#39;t outrun your past but didn&#39;t you always have the option to do something about it? If anything, it sounded like he gave up and resigned himself to such a sad fate.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1042299298764832818 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1042299298764832818><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Nov-22 02:45 PM">14:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Maybe that was what she could not grasp. Even on that city, there was always some way she could break free, if just for a minute. It was enough to keep her going until the next opportunity. Why couldn&#39;t he see it the same way?

She shook her head, trying to clear the thoughts. Most of them disappated with the action but the feelings lingered a bit more. She felt content just to stand there on the beach and soak in the moment for just a minute more. It was good to be free but was that enough for her, really? 

Once again the unknown fate of her siblings gnawed on her mind and that minute became two as she tossed the thought around. And once again, she left the idea behind as the thought made her limbs feel restless with every second more she mulled on why she got the chance to leave and they didn&#39;t. 

<em>Ok it was a new day and there was no sense to waste a moment more on this.</em>

<em>&quot;A deep breath in to flush the mind, a deep breath out to cast away worries. A deep breath in to reinvigorate the body, a deep breath out to flush away bad humors,&quot;</em> So said her adoptive father many months ago to calm her wild mind and once again his trick helped the child of wind.

She opened her eyes again and looked out over the beach and the gentle waves before turning around to find the place she originally set out to find when the pair left. Wait that&#39;s right, Hannibal was nearby. What had she been doing this entire time?

&quot;Hey Rider! Have you found the entrance to the water park yet?  Sorry if I got a bit distracted on my end.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When she arrived, Rider was already rubbing the bridge of her nose with her fingers. &quot;Ugh, annoying damned gatekeeper...&quot; Dressed in a stylish one-piece swimsuit, sporting her favoured colours, with her hair down, she made her way towards her Master. &quot;Can you believe that they won&#39;t allow Surus to wander with us? I mean, he&#39;s a good boy! He&#39;s very well-behaved for his size, you know!&quot; Rider vented as she ran her hands through her hair.

The hype for them died down a bit, allowing them some peace, apart from the occasional fan, of course. This was mainly due to the fact that the next round was ongoing. She never caught who was fighting so she will probably have to catch up when they get back.

&quot;I can make it up to him when we get back to Benji&#39;s. He won&#39;t mind if we give him a bath there, right?&quot; Of course, the amount of water needed to wash an elephant of Surus&#39;s size was a concern.

Which hurt more than anything really. . . Did Thomas not find him useful? Was he not fun? Lewis didn’t know anymore. . . But what he did know is that he walked about, not exactly lost—curse his noble phantasm— but at the middle of Waku Waku Alexandria, the sounds of others having merry drawing him there.

He was to go here with Thomas again. They were to win, but what would they have done with winning? Lewis thought back to Alexander and how he had said that this winning wasn’t for him, but for his own people, for Macedon. They were fighting for Alexandria, but also, was Macedon not worth saving too? But not even that, how was he supposed to have won against that servant and the metal man? Lewis tried to think back to the fight, how no matter how hard he fought. . . Ryujin seemed to have something for him. Was he not strong? He didn’t seem weak, but maybe Thomas soon found him weak.

To those who had went to enjoy the water park, it wasn’t hard to see that there was an oddity, a boy that wasn’t in his swimming trunks, nor in any swimming attire at all. Rather, Lewis had been in the same clothing he had been summoned in, the long but also fitting soldier uniform that he had. To many who cast glances they knew who it was, the boy who had lost the first fight of Alexandria, the failure of their first round. Some whispered, others shushed and yanked back their children who tried to get closer, meanwhile Lewis stood there. . . Aimless.

Was there something she kept wanting to ask but couldn&#39;t find the time? Or was it moreso she kept running away from something bothering her? Who knows though the place she dragged Hannibal to may prove a hint in of itself.

&quot;Mhmm, I can kinda see why. Can you imagine how many people would mistake him as an attraction if he walked into a pool? They don&#39;t want us dipping into their profits!&quot; Like a drop of the wide and white straw hat perched on her head, any such concerns seemed to fade instantly from Amelia&#39;s face. Red eyes glinted at the sign of a potential future scheme they could try. &quot;But for now, I think the free tickets should be good enough.&quot;

&quot;You said you saw the gatekeeper of the place by the way? Take me over, especially now we lost the fans,&quot; Amelia brushed her white and green hair aside, hanging from her back in two loose braids along with a few flowers woven in. Her outfit was according to her unique tastes, a waterproof floral-print chiffon gown and a two piece green swimsuit underneath. 

The trip took little time now that they weren&#39;t bound down by others wanting their autograph and entrance was easy enough. Deciding what to do in the place was surprisingly easy too as already Amelia was trying her best to draw Hannibal over to the thrill rides.

She wanted to say something back at the hospital before their opponents arrived. While they did help speed her recovery through the use of Caster&#39;s potion, it also gave Amelia a reason to escape situations where such a topic could be brought up again. Today was no different. Even if her time with her was still in it&#39;s first month essentially, Rider knew better than to try and hold her Master down in a single spot for too long at this point.

&quot;Surus was pretty popular among my men now that I think about it. Though, I think that was just to get some extra treats out of them actually...&quot; The Rider thought about it, the more obvious the scheme became for her. Curses, Surus! Food supplies on a campaign were harsh enough already! 

All of the rides and attractions was overwhelming for Rider. Did they even have enough time in the day to try them all? What if she wanted to go on one a second time? Would they have to give up on one attraction for another? There were so many questions at hand that it would&#39;ve overwhelmed a more lesser mind. Thankfully, Rider was a tactician! 

&quot;Master! We should plot out our course if we want to make the most out of today.&quot; Fortunately, this place has a map kiosk and a legend showing every attraction they could visit. Now all she needed to do was to figure out a campaign path for them with perfect stopping points along the way. Now maybe she can figure out a way to bring up that topic again...

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Before she could get into formulating her actual plan, the sight of a Servant distracted her. &quot;Hey, Master. Isn&#39;t that the other Rider from Alexandria over there?&quot; The sight of his attire made him stick out completely from the rest. Curiosity got to Rider as she started to make her way towards them. She never interacted with anyone from their side so a hello wouldn&#39;t hurt as much at least.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043704327862222848 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043704327862222848><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Nov-22 11:48 AM">11:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Planning out a fun day? Man, you&#39;re starting to sound like my mom. Lets go down that giant toliet bowl thing!&quot; She grabbed onto Hannibal&#39;s hand, intending to yank her away with the sudden movement, only to find herself swinging around her and in view of the map Rider held. &quot;Oh they&#39;re calling it the Nirvanan Plunge now? That&#39;s tacky. Pretty sure people got messed up from going there...&quot;

&quot;Now come on, we got thrills to feel and rides to slide!&quot; Amelia tried again to yank Hannibal her away, now applying a bit of wind to be more persuasive. After a few good pulls, Amelia took a break and realized she was actually distracted by someone else for once. She had to drop Rider&#39;s hand and lean forward to see the guy properly.

&quot;Oh! That&#39;s the little Rider, yeah! Glad he was able to make it out here and have some fun - wait he&#39;s not having fun. That&#39;s just silly. This is a place you go <em>only</em> to have fun. Let&#39;s go grab him and teach him what fun feels like!&quot;

The other Rider of Alexandria would see a girl with skin and hair more bleached out than his own confidently striding towards him, a determined, enterprising look locked directly onto him. It was reminiscient of the very pioneers he had spent plenty of time with on his Great Western Odyssey. She strolled through water and crowds with the same ease and gusto before getting close enough to address him.

He didn’t often pay attention to the sneers, the gazes, nor the yanking of bodies away from his vicinity but now he did. But, soon a shadow looked over him. 

He had only rose his head to see if it had been Thomas, to see if maybe his master were no longer upset, but found disappointment when he saw another person. Her voice was nice, and to think she had invited him to join them on the escapade of the place, he could have easily smiled but his eyes still showed a tinge of sadness to them.

“My master isn’t here, I don’t want to have fun without him. .  He’s upset with me.”

A clear rejection had came from him, and it was evident he was speaking the truth. Had the girl recognized him, she could easily see that the blonde had also been missing in action as well. Lewis tucked his feet onto the bench, cr punching into a small ball as he put his head onto his knees. He didn’t want to have fun in Waku Waku Alexandria anymore. He wanted to be by Thomas’ side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Your mom? I will have you know that you can never go wrong with a proper plan, Master!&quot; There wasn&#39;t a lot of time for Rider to make her case before Amelia already ran off towards the other lonely Servant. A soft sigh left her as she rubbed the bridge of her nose. This girl is going to cost her most, if not all, of her sanity by the end of this tournament. However, she can&#39;t really say she hates it...

The intense aura of a mood killer was heavy around Lewis. She could&#39;ve saw that she was able to see it at one point. In fact, the colour of his outfit matched his attitude at least. All he was missing was the rain. Well, they <em>are</em> at a waterpark so it isn&#39;t that far off actually.

&quot;Geez. He&#39;s upset at you for losing <em>that</em> badly? I mean, even our opponents were pretty good sports about losing. So I don&#39;t see the reason for your Master to just kick you to the curb for losing like that.&quot; The girl&#39;s Servant joins her as, even with their different outfits, their looks were difficult not to notice with their recent rise in popularity. Although, depending on how the next matches, that popularity is likely to be short-lived. &quot;That is the reason for it, right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044440362627907686 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044440362627907686><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Nov-22 12:33 PM">12:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

We can&#39;t have that happening,&quot; Amelia&#39;s face softened immediately and shook her head in disapproval at the lack of the servant&#39;s master. From what she recalled, he supposedly was a real interesting case. Someone super old yet super young. Wonder what things he knew or could do for a young entrepreneur such as herself. He was kinda cute too, that certainly helped. &quot;Oh wait, you are last round&#39;s participants. Yeah I can see the reason for your mood. It&#39;s not fair how they treated you.&quot;

She took a minute to scan over the boy who shared the same class as her own servant and it as a bit hard to see outside of the garb what made them similar at all by looks. Busy as she was with other pursuits, she knew very little of the guy. Granted she knew there was a curious case with his master so maybe mysteries came in pairs? 

&quot;I don&#39;t get it though, losing a big thing like that is rough but there&#39;s also no better way to shrug off the bad vibes than clearing your head with some thrills. He should be here right along side you. Hey Rider, how about we go find his master and drag him out here so all of us can have fun and not worry about all the heavy stuff for an afternoon?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was all he could repeat, he didn’t know <em>what</em> the match could have been so important to him about, but he knew the basics of it. Alexandria costed him something important. With Hannibal’s new addition, Lewis looked even more depressed. So they had won too? He didn’t watch the television or news without Thomas, so he couldn’t even have seen them as winners. . . Though luckily, Amelia had a way to remedy it by trying to comfort him. 

“The crowd was quite mean, it even made Thomas upset that they treated him so harshly. . .”

Lewis looked at the winning duo a bit as they decided what to do with him. He was a servant without a master, currently, and to make it more awkward, a kid without much supervision. Amelia’s suggestion however, made his expression twitch though. They’d go find his master? He hadn’t expect done much searching on account of Thomas saying he wanted space from <em>Lewis</em> but technically it’d be those two looking for him instead. The question the master asked would be answered with another.

“You want to go find Thomas? He’s upset with me, but maybe he’ll talk to you? I can try to find him if you want.”

Fight sounded more brutal than ours and that&#39;s saying something. Republic&#39;s got some messed up people fighting for them and their demands.  A real rough group of bullies is what they really are. Thomas and I were the people to stand up against them. Its only fair you&#39;d be mad at failing but hey! This is actually a team effort.&quot; 

Amelia sympathized with the losing pair for obvious reasons. Someone was demanding the very lifeblood of their city and sending monsters to seize it. She took sympathy to the distraught servant and gave him a couple pats on the shoulder.

&quot;Of course I do! He&#39;s clearly got a problem and I&#39;m gonna do what I can to help a fellow member of my team. I had a brother back home who slipped into some similar episodes and honestly the biggest thing to help is getting him out of the house, doing things, showing him he&#39;s valued regardless of the event and giving him the push needed to work on the issue.&quot; She didn&#39;t think of what she was saying in the moment, Rider&#39;s comments flipped a switch in her brain and already she was in comforting mode. Hannibal had heard Amelia mention home before and issue with brothers would likely picque her curiosity. 

&quot;So to help your master, I was wondering if you had any idea where he likes to hide and any details about your &#39;break-up&#39; that might help me figure what&#39;s going on up here,&quot; She said, pointing to both her heart and mind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

People like Thomas and Amelia were putting this lives on the lines to save Alexandria against the nightmares of the Republic. Did they really deserve to be treated as such just because they decided to stand up while the others couldn&#39;t? The fame they got for winning ended up leaving a bad taste in her mouth if this is how they treat the ones who lose. 

Well, there wasn&#39;t much they could do about it now. Though it did leave Rider with a different outlook on the city. At least Benji was nice. 

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re that Lewis guy, right? I&#39;m sure you could track down Thomas easily even if he made an effort to hide from you.&quot; To help Amelia with cheering him up, Rider gave a rough pat on his back while she hyped him up. The Throne gave her a general idea about Lewis given the fact she knows about his True Name. It wasn&#39;t much but she got the basic theme at least. &quot;We can talk to him for you. Amelia here has been helping me get out of a similar situation actually. So if there is anyone I know that could help, it&#39;s her.&quot;

With the mention of family again, Rider couldn&#39;t help but think of the questions she wanted to ask her previously. Unfortunately it looks they have something else to do before she could get her alone. Could she really have planned this much ahead of time to keep dodging Rider? If so, she had to give her credit. However, this was Hannibal she was dealing with! She can&#39;t keep outmaneuvering her much longer!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1046231339441061958 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1046231339441061958><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Nov-22 11:09 AM">11:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#1250">@nimbus</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Such a mean group. . . Bullies yeah! That word!”

Amelia was correct with it! They were such a horrible group, and with her terms it made it even better to express himself on it! He crossed his arms, a true kid with his looks as he nodded fervently with the duo. He felt a bit better that the others sort of agreed with him on it, for all he had seen were the pitch fork waving Alexandrians that seemed to want nothing more than to exile them.

“You’ll meet ‘em?! That’s great! And you’re right, Meriwether Lewis of America’s Purchase! Since you’ll talk to Thomas you’re friends then.”

Lewis began his uncomfortable kicking again, his feet moving from his chin to the ground and back and forth. . . They’d meet Thomas! That was good! After having met Alexander and Ā-Qing, maybe bringing him <em>good</em> people on their side was all he needed! That was a good idea. Good idea!

“Well, he met someone from the Republic who’s my friend, and her master made him feel pretty upset. . . But, he didn’t seem to mean ill, he said he’s from a place like America! M—<em>Macaron</em>! Yeah that! And then Thomas walked away! I can ask Sac where he is, i know she’d will find him, I’m sure of it! I gave him space because he asked for it, and since you’re here, technically <em>you</em> can talk to him. And then you can make him feel all sorts of better!”

It was an easy solution to him! Lewis got off the chair, quick to go into his knapsack and pulled out the automaton that had been in it, and without much clarification for the others, he was off! It was time to find Thomas!
