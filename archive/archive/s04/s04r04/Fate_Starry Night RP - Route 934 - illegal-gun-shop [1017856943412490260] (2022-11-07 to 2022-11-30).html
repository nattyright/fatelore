It was surprisingly calm for this entire time. After visiting Amelia and Hannibal in the hospital, Manco went to a restaurant with Mikail to find more unique flavors. Unfortunately the food there wasn&#39;t that good, so Mikail decided to make some homemade food so he could prove that everything made at home is always better.

And there they were drinking tea in the living room. He made some panzerotti - basically small deep fried calzones. He made them with high quality ingredients, available to him thanks to all the money he had after doing mercenary work and selling guns for so long. They were crispy, full of cheese, homemade tomato sauce and expensive mortadella, garnished with a big amount of freshly grated parmesan.

&quot;Manco, Italian food is quite nice isn&#39;t it? Especially if it&#39;s homemade! The chicken soup from that <em>&#39;restaurant&#39;</em> got nothing on this. By the way, does thyme go well in black tea for you? It might be weird, but i sometimes make it with thyme. Maybe i&#39;m just used to this.&quot;

He added thyme to the tea this time, as he liked the combination. He put an obscene amount of sugar in his teacup though, making it practically overshadow the flavor of thyme and annihilating all potential health benefits the herb might have.

&quot;Oh, hey. Just remembered. You said that your wish was to see your city again. Is there more to it? Since i do not have an actual wish, would be nice to accomplish the wish of a friend. And it&#39;s easier to do if i understand my friend more...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1042136941300293843 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1042136941300293843><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Nov-22 04:00 AM">04:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So this is Italian? Interesting&quot; 

It was a refreshing change towards the food, a nice tribute to how simple is at times better. But also it gave the monarch a nice break from the latin food. By no means he dislike it even the chicken soup Mikail seen as not as good was no exception. But eating the same king of food all the time does tire one&#39;s palate even the one of a servant who has no real need for food. Or maybe it was because he didn&#39;t had a need for food that he was able to get a bit more picky about what he ate as he really need to worry about nourishment and could only focus on the different flavors?

The though were stopped once Mikail suggested to put Thyme on the tea, Manco was curious and agree to it only for him to add more sugar after the initial sip although he would admit he loved the aroma. 

&quot;That is really all there is to it, I&#39;m curious about what has happened.&quot; he said as he put his teacup down. &quot;Does my people still exist, has all sings of my culture disappear or had they mingled with other and fused together to create something new? Many questions but only that, I am a ghost of the past Mikail, I have no plans to take over my land again although I did admit I though about it at the beginning&quot; 

His confession came as nonchalantly, but ultimately Manco wonder what would be the point of him seeking to conquer once again. The world was for those he lived in it, someone like him had no real right to intervene beyond of why they had been summoned, if so then at the very least he would look and see if time had improved the land or not. 

&quot;What about you Master? We survived so far and we may continue doing without your wish being granted. Are you okay with that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of course i can cook. And the violence is not mine a lot of the time anyways.&quot;

As Manco talked, Mikail grabbed one of the panzerotti and took a bite out of it, before drinking out of his teacup filled with oversugared borderline syrup-like tea afterwards. The panzerotti was truly delicious, his cooking skills were still completely intact it seems. Many people would kill him for adding so much sugar though.

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure your people did fuse with other people and became something new. I heard that back when the continent of south america still existed, it was a melting pot for different cultures from all across the world. A lot of people immigrated there. And why specifically take over your land? You can just go there, people will like you. I&#39;m sure that Cuzsco still exists out there, it was a big city back then. It&#39;s very likely that they remade it into a nomad city before the world got completely flooded.&quot;

After hearing Caster&#39;s question, he paused for at least half a minute. He either did not like the question or thought of how he should answer.

&quot;Maybe. The thing is, i am aware that my wish is stupid. I know that i shouldn&#39;t do this. My curse is still not that strong, i can control it outside of battle. And i can easily just end my cursed bloodline by dying of old age. But something still tells me to die in combat. Is it regret? Is it just some idiotic whim? I don&#39;t know.&quot;

He picked up the gas mask lying on the table beside him and looked at its souless lenses. He killed so many people with his face hidden by this thing - aristocrats, criminals and people who wronged him. Even if many of those kills weren&#39;t justified, they were at least justifiable. But thinking about all who he taken life away from still made him feel bad.

The wisdom of the king was also a bit of introspection, different people lead different lives. His life could not compare to any of the lives of his subjects it was  beyond the issue of which carried more importance as there was no real point of comparison. What he and his subjects experience and even the way they experience it was too different. He was a king and so he wished to live and die like one, he would guess something similar for his subjects but he had too many to be certain. 

&quot;Even so I will tell you this, death only comes for those who do not seek it. I wonder if death is that whimsical or just plain cruel.  But in all my life none of the ones I saw die ever wish for it, that doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t die peacefully some did some did not. But even when they said that they wanted to die or wished for death to free them from their existence, they were just words none of them truly stopped living,...&quot;

In between the words of the king a tone of melancholy could be heard, after all what is victory without loss. While Manco had achieved his fair share of success it had not been without sacrifice. His words make him think of those who follow him at the beginning only to die along the way; the many soldiers who gave their lives so the empire could expand. Manco had no regrets about it, as regretting his path right now would be to deny the value of their deaths but at the same time it was a responsibility that as a king her carried. 

&quot;In my eyes Mikail you don&#39;t really seek death, but you have no idea how to live either.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think you&#39;re right with this. Almost every terrible thing that happened in my life was outside of control. Both because of other people and my curse. I want control.&quot;

Mikail set the mask back down onto the table, turning his head to look at Manco once again before making a deep sigh and continuing to talk.

&quot;This is not how i lived my life so far. I was a different person back then. Until my father died. This was when my curse first activated. I have killed so many people for revenge. They say that to live ones life solely in pursuit of revenge is a suicide note written with the blood of the people you harm. I stopped myself before this path lead me to death. But this only set me on another path to death, just a slower one.&quot;

He was speaking in a calm voice with a stoic expression on his face. It seems he was more prepared to talk about his past now than he was when visiting his former opponents back at the hospital.

&quot;Death does frequently happen to those who do not want it. But it does not discriminate, it just takes. Death comes to those who want to die too. You just lived in an old time. Back when survival was still not guaranteed. Their instincts did not want for them to die, so when they said they wanted to die it was always lies. But i am a man who doesn&#39;t lie, in a modern time where instincts are less influential. The only deception i have is withholding information.&quot;

Then Mikail took another sip of tea and switched to a smile after hearing more of Manco&#39;s words.

&quot;No one knows how to live. Just some people are more convinced that they know than others. I wish i was those some people. Still full of hope and motivation. Like that Amelia girl. She&#39;s just like who i was in the past. A rebellious freedom obsessed kid. If i was still that kid, this grail war would&#39;ve gone so differently.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1043237642705326110 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1043237642705326110><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Nov-22 04:53 AM">04:53</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

We heroic spirits aren&#39;t that special when you think about it. We just moved forward towards what we believed what correct. Its akin to an instinct, but most people hides from it. I cannot blame them, this world is a harsh place, life hits harder that any enemy so taking that extra step, taking that risk is something not everyone can do.&quot; 

The face of his people came to mind, they were afraid even when he returned and told him of the land he and the others had found they were afraid. Was it something as simple as fear towards change? Manco wasn&#39;t sure. 

&quot;Then again just taking the risk is nothing but the first step. I am not going to pretend I completely understand your circumstances. But right now you are being half assed&quot; as the words came out of his mouth his expression changed into a more lax one. 

&quot;This is merely my opinion but one doesn&#39;t need to lie to delude oneself. What one doesn&#39;t know, what one purposely looks away and many more things can make one come to the wrong decision. You claim you are okay with dying yet you still struggle to survive. Honestly I feel you don&#39;t really know what you want. But you have been surrounded by dead so long it came as the natural answer&quot;

He would move his hand and give Mikail a soft pet on his head, as if talking to a child. 

&quot;Is easy to miss but deep down you still a bit of a brat. Well you still have time, whatever happens make sure is your decision and yours alone&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That doesn&#39;t mean they know how to live. There is no such thing as the correct way to live. This whole &#39;knowing how to live&#39; thing is pointless. People don&#39;t know how to live, they know how they want to live. How do i want to live? I don&#39;t know anymore.&quot;

Mikail frowned as Caster talked. It seemed to him that Manco really didn&#39;t understand his circumstances. Manco acknowledged this, but it did not improve Mikail&#39;s mood.

&quot;Half assed? Struggling to survive? I told you already. I want to die, but i want to do so without feeling like a coward. Not just give up and take some cheap and easy way to die. And who would I be if I just give up in the middle of a fight? I am committed to this idea, and it&#39;s in no way half assed.&quot;

He did not expect for Manco to try and pat his head. His natural instinct was to immediately move Caster&#39;s hand away from his head, but instead of doing so he accepted this, as it brought back memories of his father. He temporarily averted his eyes from Manco as to avoid seeing the disparity between the Caster and how he remembered his father looked like, and after a few seconds Mikail gently grabbed his servant&#39;s arm and slowly moved it away.

&quot;...You might be right. I wanted something back when I was a kid. I wanted to be a hero. Someone who saves lives and stops malevolent people from harming others no matter the cost. Maybe the selflessness of that role turned into some kind of twisted sense of martyrdom as i grew up. But how do i get on the path of a hero now?&quot;

He stood up from his chair and started to walk around the room in contemplation.

&quot;I don&#39;t think i can just suddenly start being a &#39;hero of justice&#39;. There&#39;s nothing i can do other than to wait for an opportunity. What do you think? Is there a way for me to do something about this myself?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044692219199754281 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044692219199754281><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Nov-22 05:13 AM">05:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

To be a hero you just need to pick a side&quot; he said as he looked amused at his master new epiphany. &quot;Although I guess I should warn you that justice is really a relative topic. Take me for example, for my people, my subjects I was a hero who gave them a golden city for them to live and defended them from any enemy but...&quot;

The expression of the Inca turn more serious as he was aware it was his own turn to share part of his doubts and though about this topic as he could tell his words would have an effect on his master decision. &quot;... from the perspective of all the tribes I conquered I was nothing but a violent tyrant who came to take their land  and invader they needed to defeat.&quot; 

&quot;For better or worse conflict does lead to opportunities, heroes emerge in times where there is fear and suffering and considering our defeat, chaos is slowly looming over this tournament&quot;

While his words were grim it was also common sense. Seeing how much both sides had put into this tournament he assumed both sides would eventually made a move as neither of them would honestly leave their destiny to luck or fate. And while he had his reasons their defeat had given Alexandria a fighting chance, hope was a powerful energy and a right motivator. 

&quot;I can keep my familiar keeping an eye on the area but right now we really don&#39;t have much that we can do now. In all honestly I hope to be wrong and that the tournament does led to a peaceful solution. But you need to make sure of what you wanna achieve as a hero. Think properly if the current you still wants to be the same hero as when you were a kid or if you just want the status of hero. Im fine with either, but this decision will affect what we will do from now on Master&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was already picked, and it was Republic. But now neither side gives me anything - I won&#39;t get much from Republic after losing and I don&#39;t like Alexandria that much. I think the correct decision would be to not take a side and fight for myself. Maybe I&#39;ll just ignore the war and help people instead.&quot;

He listened to Caster with a blank expression on his face. While it was interesting listening to what the servant thinks, those words seemed to him like something that doesn&#39;t help with deciding what to do next. Mikail was someone who didn&#39;t like picking sides other than his own, something that Caster didn&#39;t really understand at the moment.

&quot;Everything you have said so far about justice involved sides and big groups of people. You were a king in your life. A true leader. I am not one. The last time i was a leader, I abandoned everyone who followed me. Your wisdom doesn&#39;t help me here, i&#39;m gonna be someone who helps individually, not a hero of the people. And you know what? Screw the tournament. I have a suspicion that there&#39;s some shady things going on in the background and whichever side wins this war is incosequential. Let&#39;s do our own thing.&quot;

Unlike what Manco thought, his words had completely no effect on his master&#39;s decision as Mikail already decided on something completely different beforehand.

&quot;I know what I want to do. I don&#39;t want fame or the status of a hero, too late for that. I have the reputation of some kind of boogeyman, no amount of heroism can fix that. Instead, i will help those who no one else will help. Those who were wronged by someone and want revenge but do not have the power to get it. They would eventually find power and go on a path of revenge like the one i have gone through. But i will avenge them before that, so they use their power on something actually worthwhile.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045411721344471040 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045411721344471040><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Nov-22 04:52 AM">04:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But that much was okay, while he had shared his wisdom and taken the situation seriously enough as to not leave any misunderstandings   Manco never expected that Mikail would listen to his words at all. It wasn&#39;t really a complain towards Mikail character it was an issue of both of them were just too different in their way of thinking and how they had lived their lives. 

Still, what was important for Manco was that Mikail took his own decision, he only shared some more options with him. Mikail had total freedom about whenever he would listen or follow his words and while he didn&#39;t wished to tell Mikail what to do he had an objection about his words. 

&quot;Being a hero is picking sides, no matter the scale in which you work you will need to pick a side. In this case you picking the side of the helpless or those who no one else will help. While your reasoning sounds actually quite noble don&#39;t delude yourself about the true implications. You will act as judge and executioner from what you are telling me, which could easily work don&#39;t misunderstand but you need to also be aware you may end up doing more wrong than good in the long run. Not like I will stop you, I&#39;m quite curious about where this new path is gonna take you, just felt like presenting you some fact you may had ignored.&quot;

It was quite amusing for Caster, Mikail new decision was neither a smart nor stupid. It kind of remind him how he went out of his way to try something different. But that is why he loved humans after all.

&quot;Well doing our own thing works for me, and you are probably right that whoever wins will be inconsequential. Because neither side will admit defeat so worse case this whole city will turn into a damn war zone.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;So I guess our next step should be to prepare so regardless of what may happen it doesn&#39;t end with this whole city in ruins.&quot;

While Manco spoke about it nonchalantly, he seriously consider how far these two cities would take it. Would Alexandria just give up the information? Would The Republic just invade regardless and take it and they cover it up somehow. He didn&#39;t knew how this new world worked exactly but he understood politics, and his master instincts were spot on as far as he could tell. Yet whoever were to made the first move would depend on the tournament.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Believe me, this is quite selfish. This is not about helping everyone nor saving people. This is about avenging people so they don&#39;t waste their lives on a path of revenge themselves. I know how much destruction a path of revenge can create, I was on one before. Avenging is way less personal, so the destruction will be way less than otherwise. I will help people who are in a similar situation I was in at some point in my past. I am helping people who are like me, not that heroic. And don&#39;t worry, I am fully aware of all the implications and I accept all possible consequences.&quot;

Mikail crossed his arms, closed his eyes and smiled.

&quot;Or maybe it is still heroic and not that selfish. In a way this is like I&#39;m helping my people. Like you did. It doesn&#39;t matter that only one group thinks that you&#39;re a hero, you&#39;re still a hero. You can&#39;t cater to everyone at the same time after all.&quot;

Then he listened to Manco&#39;s next words in a relaxed pose. 

&quot;I have a feeling that this city is gonna turn into a battlefield for Republic and church empire morons or whatever they&#39;re called to test their weapons on. Wait, you said prepare? Oh right I still have to load my magazines and do all that. And maybe check on my guns, i&#39;m pretty sure Uluu Toion is in a not very good condition after shooting a reinforced obliterator round. Well, i&#39;m off. Go brew some potions for the possible next battle i guess. Tell me if you&#39;ll need something.&quot;

After that Mikail quickly grabbed one panzerotti, went to his gun workshop room, closed the door and started preparations.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1046142359022338158 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1046142359022338158><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Nov-22 05:16 AM">05:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While the resolution his master had achieved was no ideal in any way it was good enough. It was amusing enough for Manco to want to see what fate had in store for his master. 

He continue to drink his tea and eat his dinner with a smile as he wonder what to do now. 

&quot;Inti&quot; he said as his crimson condor appear on his shoulder tilting its head as he waited for Manco&#39;s order. &quot;Keep an eye on the area.&quot; 

The bird flew out of the window rapidly as the servant let out a sigh. He would walk to a map of the city Mikail had and observe the different sections. He would need to call have him keep an eye on each sector, for that he would need to give more complex orders after his condor were to come back from its first flight then re deploy it each time to a different area in order to see if something was beginning to occur. But besides that there was nothing much. 

&quot;Yep is a total waste that such a guy is so determined with dying when he could easily live as my personal cook&quot; He said as he took another bite of the panzerotti.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
