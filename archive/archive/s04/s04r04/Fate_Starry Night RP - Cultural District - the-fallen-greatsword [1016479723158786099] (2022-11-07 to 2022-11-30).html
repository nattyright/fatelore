Inevitably so, considering the enigmatic allegiance of the caller, that was perhaps inevitable. While Lea’s choice of Servant proved to be a fruitful one, the amount of attention that the Tower of Babel brought was much more than Lea had bargained for.

Nimrod’s confidence in the tower was only slightly comforting when considering the constant prods at its integrity. The sound of cannons colliding with solid objects was fascinating, but the thought of being hit by one quickly quelled her excitement.

“Hey, look here Berserker, your tower loses out to this one.”

Lea’s jests and ignorant comments were surely familiar to Nimrod by now. The slight hint of nervousness that laced her voice, however, was not. Ever since she first got wounded, her demeanor had been noticeably less energetic.

She still shared the same goal as he did. If she didn’t, she would not have made her way into such a high-security building for the promises of whatever reward might help them emerge victorious in the war. If it turned out to be a trap, Nimrod could cover her bases.

It was logically a risk worth taking in Lea’s evaluations. That’s why in spite of all her reluctance, she made her way alongside Nimrod to the Fallen Greatsword.

To see the same wish as the King— that much, in spite of her sassiness, was in-line with Nimrod’s expectations.

Her extreme fear whilst doing so, not as much.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whilst on a little trip round the city his fortress had been attacked by some vagabonds. They had shot 4 cannonballs straight through the tower’s exterior. It hadn&#39;t left any permanent damage but he was insulted that they had even made the attempt. He had intended on hunting them down before receiving the message to come here.

He had found the message quite insulting to say the least but he was curious as to what exactly they wanted of him. He frowned at Lea&#39;s remark but didn&#39;t serve if with a response. He was indeed quite used to it by now. A part of him perhaps even found it comforting. This hesitation that had plagued her movements since facing Gabtsy was an annoyance. It would simply slow her down, inhibit her skill. As irritating as he had found that woman who first summoned him he would prefer her over the girl in front of him now

No words of encouragement or support. That was the best she would get from her servant although that was to he expected. He had yet to say anything good about her since he had been summoned. Although these words did seem a bit different. There was a glimmer of warmth. A sign that perhaps his intentions were to help in his own way. Alas he said nothing further until they arrived at the entrance of the museum. He gave it a once over. His tower would surpass it in time at this moment though he would sort out the business he had been called for</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1042554081740341389 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1042554081740341389><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Nov-22 07:37 AM">07:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

We are on the same side. Were we to be enemies, I would not have offered you the invitation.&quot;</strong>

The voice that rang outward from the tower was accompanied by a harsh, processed crackle, but was still noticeably organic. It was quiet, unbothered, but nevertheless displeased by the King&#39;s shouting and screaming. No doubt, this was the one who penned the invitation, the one who sent the falcon to deliver it.

<strong>&quot;Come inside. There is much to discuss.&quot;</strong>

On cue, the iron fortifications surrounding much of the lower layer of the Fallen Greatsword began to move, pulling themselves open a revealing a path inside. Two-dozen golems waited to greet them, yet they showed no hostile intent. Instead, rather, they foremost row parted to allow the pair to step inside the middle of their ranks. An escort? How bizarre.

At the very least, they were inside now. The golems marched on, guiding them through the once-museum, much of which had been transformed into a massive, sprawling forge. Even from there limited position, they could see rows upon rows of automata forging away, molten metal flowing like water, arms of all kind being tested.

This was a blacksmith&#39;s paradise. Just who was this mysterious &quot;benefactor&quot;?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Its a charming but classic messaging system.&quot;

Carrier pigeons had long outlived their usefulness, but there existed stories of the regal birds flying through enemy lines while half-injured to death, saving countless soldiers with the key information.

Normally, Lea would excitedly gush about such stories the moment the opportunity came up. But for now, speaking of her fondness of the manner of invitation was the most she could do.

Provided, it seemed like that was an unfavored demeanor by the Hubric King. 

&quot;I— I am composed! I won&#39;t let you keep me away from my &#39;distractions&#39;. They&#39;re half the reason I&#39;m here!&quot;

The primary reason Lea joined the war was to witness spectacles like these that she would not be able to otherwise. A path she would never be able to see if she had accepted the bird&#39;s nest provided for her.

That excitement hadn&#39;t faded. Just muted due to circumstance. 

&quot;More than that— why don&#39;t <strong>you</strong> be more careful! What good would your shouting do if this had been a trap-&quot;

Lea&#39;s uncharacteristic worries over her own well-being were quickly dismissed with the spectacle that unravelled in the Greatsword. As though a parting waterfall, the steel automata paved a convenient path for the two of them to traverse.

A subconscious sigh of relief engulfed Lea&#39;s demeanor as the both of them made their way into the structure.

&quot;... After spending so long in the tower, it feels kind of nice to walk on solid ground again. Can&#39;t that tower park? Set it back on the ground for a few days.&quot;

Although, the sight of a structure originally built to preserve knowledge and history was perverted into one to mass-produce weapons was far from a &#39;nice&#39; one.

Lea understood the importance of having a big army. Her respect for whoever had summoned them here turned ever so optimistic.

She didn&#39;t feel as though she had the energy to fawn about it over a cup of tea, however.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Soon, they found themselves heading up a set of iron stairs, across a catwalk overhanging a lake of molten metal, and into a seal-off chamber, overhanging it all, a block of steel in the very middle of this factory. The beating heart.

<em>&quot;OUR GREAT HEAVENLY GENERAL WILL SEE YOU NOW.&quot;</em> Spoke one of the golems. Which one exactly? It was hard to tell, given how they all looked identical. Still, they parted once more, this time allowing Lea and Nimrod to step forward and enter into the chamber.

The heavy iron door opened effortlessly, and they would be allowed inside the dimly lit chamber. A circular room, lit only by crackling embers. An anvil sat at the centre of it all, and sitting at it, working intently on a hefty-looking claymore far too large for any human to wield, was their benefactor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slowly, Saber would raise from their seat, leaving the red-hot blade behind as they walked over to greet their guests. They took a moment to look over the master and the servant alike. Though their eyes were not visible, one could feel the harsh judgement being passed upon them.

<strong>&quot;Second rate.&quot;</strong> The Heavenly General replied simply. <strong>&quot;I cannot say that I am surprised. Arrogance and whimsy do not compound into victory.&quot;</strong>

A lengthy sigh escaped their androgynous lips. As though they had been expecting to receive subpar materials, but nevertheless found themselves surprised by just how subpar they truly were. Still, they had a duty to upkeep. They stepped forward once more, stopping a few feet short of Lea and Nimrod.

<strong>&quot;Still, I have done better with worse. Tell me, you fight for Alexandria, yes? Would you be willing to do whatever it takes to attain victory in the name of the Holy Neo Empire?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They passed through a gateway, a portal that transported them from the angelic vistas of Alexandria&#39;s Italian decorum to the grinding, harsh and blasting heat of the forge from Hell. Simon had caught sight of the tower that caught the attention of most of Alexandria&#39;s denizens, a gray spire that dared to scrape the surface of the sky with its magnificence. 

This plunged deep into the sky. Roiling steam billowing out from the wound and trailing down the edge of the metal. 

Simon feels himself shrink just by the entrance, the marble entranceway itself trailing deep into a clanging inferno of Blazing heat and floating embers. 

&quot;...S-so...this is it,&quot; he says, subconsciously drawing closer to Saber&#39;s side as the hairs on his neck bristle. This felt like a deathmarch.

&quot;This is our last ch-ch-ch <em>gulp</em> chance...do you think it&#39;s a trap? We can turn back, Saber.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was the first thing to strike Saber. Not the sudden change to their environment. Not the smell of hot molten metals and the furnaces allowing them to melt.

Her choice of clothing was optimal for this kind of heat, at the very least. The matriarch, however preferred the cool of the ocean. 

“It is.” Grendel’s mother was cool, and calm. Hopefully enough to freeze the nerves that Simon was feeling. “If it is a trap, then we are already too late to turn away and run. Let us meet this head on still.” Her blade then came into her hand, not the ancient work of art, but instead an equally large piece of metal. Slightly rusted at the edges and in desperate need of some attention. 

“We push forward, child.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That&#39;s lame. Floating structures are sooo overdone, it&#39;d be so much cooler parked. It is better than the flat we had in Alexandria, though.&quot;

In contrast to Nimrod, Lea showed little interest in the integrity of the building. That wasn&#39;t a point of contention for her. The building itself wasn&#39;t as important as how well-fortified it was. To that end...

&quot;Extra reinforcement never hurts! Its a little bit dull that the role is filled by non-flesh automata, but... it might be necessary.&quot;

Humans and humans clashing wasn&#39;t pretty. She had come to terms with that recently.

&quot;Dollfights aren&#39;t too bad either. Don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Even if no matter how hard they tried, they could never replicate a human&#39;s voice and demeanor— theatres existed for a reason.

And in this play, Lea played the role of a haughty but ignorant bystander that ended up swallowed by fate.

That haughtiness made her fears take a backseat for a short while.

&quot;I&#39;d say the second-rate would be the person who would send out an invite with minimal explanations and neglect an introduction on top of that. Hmm?&quot;

A small piece of anger urged her to taunt the unknown figure as she was so used to. Her prior timid demeanor dissipated, just for this short moment.

&quot;I&#39;ll accept whimsy, but I don&#39;t think you get to talk about arrogance after designating yourself &#39;Heavenly General&#39; among rock puppets.&quot;

Taking a step forwards, Lea pushed her forehead against the General&#39;s with lunacy-filled eyes. 

&quot;You called us here because you want something from us. Whatever your offer is, you serve to benefit from it too. <u>So why don&#39;t you cut the tough guy act and tell us what you want already?</u>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He stepped into the room curious to see this General first hand. The first thing he noted was the weapon he was working on. A forger perhaps. Maybe this man was someone of note after all…. Unfortunately the man had to open his mouth and sour any chance of a good first impression

He began to draw his sword preparing to kill the man who had summoned them here. Truly he began to wonder why there were so many unsavoury characters about.

Simon nods, shakily, following behind Grendel&#39;s Mother as both drive forward into the glowing bowels of the museum. Her sword trails behind her, a relic even amidst the stone forge that engulfed them. Grendel&#39;s Mother still cool and sharp amidst the smelting. Simon takes a small page from her, simply puffing his chest as he tries to command confidence. Perhaps Nikolai had sought him out as a weak link, one that could be easily pushed out of the tournament. He&#39;d have to work yo convince whoever called him here otherwise.

&quot;I thought this museum was supposed to be the pride of Alexandria. What happened to it,&quot; the boy mutters to himself, deciding to take stock of the stout walls caving in heat and steam. He&#39;d been able to pay some semblance of attention to the news, but this had completely fallen off his radar. No doubt the news of a heavenly general arriving in Alexandria didn&#39;t have much weight to Simon, seeing as he didn&#39;t even know what that was. The continued politics of the war and world eluded him. 

&quot;I almost feel like they want us here to give us a weapon...or craft us into one...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They stated it in such a manner-of-fact way that it sounded less like a rebuttal and more like a statement of fact. As though even now, as Nimrod threated to kill them, they did not consider them a true threat. In fact, Berserker drawing their sword only seemed to add fuel to the fire.

<strong>&quot;Especially not with an unrefined hunk of iron like that. You will not win this war with such lacklustre tools as this. Come!&quot;</strong>

They turned on a dime, marching across to the other side of the forge, where a large haphazard stack of weapons, armour, and trinkets. Each one of them was a marvel in their own right, a masterpiece fit for a king. Yet, with how they were all haphazardly piled up, one would think them discarded.

Simon and Grendel&#39;s Mother marched into the Fallen Greatsword, but they didn&#39;t get far before they were intercepted by a group of golems. Glass-lensed eyes looked at them, before beckoning them to follow.

And so, they would lead the pair down a winding path, through catwalks and overhangs, deep and far into the facility, before stopping short of a bridge leading to a strange-looking platform, floating amidst a sea of molten metal as though it were a rock floating in the lava.

It seemed they were expected to cross.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They departed the blind world of shadows, and fell way to the light of the molten forge, its orange glow flowing past both and presenting a blinding light that ebbed into a brilliant and smoldering glow. And then they saw them. Stalwart golems, with eyes of flattened glass that returned their own surprised gazes back at them. Simon&#39;s surprise, it might be better to say Grendel&#39;s Mother was more stonefaced than they were. 

&quot;Saber, if they wanted us dead, they would have attacked,&quot; Simon whispers, pulling softly at the hem of her dress while following behind the nickel and copper warriors, their bronze shoulders lifting their clockwork shoulders, while their golden pauldrons drew sparks from their occasional scrape against the gravel walls. Their gestures had the stop and go of a tin soldier, their own craned necks twisting at obscene angles as they lift stiffly towards the path. Intended to cross. 

&quot;Let&#39;s just remain calm. We can deal with whatever comes...you said we&#39;ll face it head on, right? Then we will.&quot;

The arrival of the heavenly general was something Grendel’s Mother didn’t exactly care for. One of the vain parties in this vain competition, that’s all they were. Golems soon began to direct them, until they reached a sea of molten iron. The bright orange hue ignited upon her dark slate skin. “I agree child. A calm approach is what is needed.”

Similarly to the general his tone was matter of fact. If his eyes locked onto his prey the King truly believed that he would not fail in ending their life as long as he willed it. It didn&#39;t matter if his own abilities didn&#39;t match up, his confidence reached no bounds. And insulting his sword one of his treasured items only bolstered his determination.

Not yet? Yes, you heard correctly, dear listener. The blacksmith, who had just offered them a pile of treasures, with an army of golems at his disposal, would not help them move it. Why?

<strong>&quot;They must first be tested.&quot;</strong>

Perfectly on cue, the ground beneath them shuddered, the entire chamber they were in moving through some mechanism unseen and unknown. It was a tense few seconds of motion, their &quot;generous&quot; host standing in absolute silence as they moved, up until the point that they stopped, and the door popped open.

They had been brought to a platform in the midst of the molten metal, upon which stood another servant and master pair, the only characters in this tale. Then, as soon as the Alexandrian faction had arrived, the bridge behind the Republic faction suddenly retracted, sliding away and leaving them stranded.

<strong>&quot;You must prove the worth of my creations. Bring weapons against this Shield, and test armour against this Sword.&quot;</strong> The Heavenly General spoke, loud enough for Simon and Grendel&#39;s Mother to hear. <strong>&quot;Once I am satisfied they have been sufficiently tested, all of you will be free to leave.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fascination she felt over the weapons were erased as the Republican pair walked into the field. The intentions of the blacksmith were disgustingly clear.

In order to test the capabilities of each item, a battle to the death would be demanded from the four. All the participants of the Holy Grail War understood that they were to risk their lives. This trial should have been an easy one to undertake.

But Lea had only developed the fear of death after having entered the War.

“‘Prove’, ‘test’, you’ve been unbelievably rude since earlier. Haven’t you ever learned hospitality?”

It was for only a second, but Lea’s voice unmistakably wavered. Shook enough that any onlooker would be able to identify it.

“The weapons are alluring, but I’ll pass on the offer! You can play around with your toys on your own time. I’d rather not get treated like a doll!”

A convincing reason. Convincing enough to fool herself. <u>She didn’t want to put a label on her own cowardice</u>, so she deflected the true reason elsewhere.

“What about you two? I’d bet money you didn’t get to hear much when you got brought in, right? I’d recommend against staking your life for some dumb spectacle like this. And what about you, Berserker? Go on, call this whole event a farce like you always do! Clearly something like this isn’t worth a King’s time!”

Reaching out to the Republic-side, and then to her own Servant, with unmistakable desperation lining her eyes. Just one person was fine. Lea just needed <em>someone</em> to agree with her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In fact, they and the Berserker both towered, even from their elevated perch, and he wondered if even now Saber was taken aback by someone overtaking her in size. 

The Master at least seemed to have some sense, balking at the idea of forced combat, about risking their lives...but Simon did catch something from the knight. They would all be free to leave...did that include he and Saber...

&quot;I don&#39;t think we have a choice,&quot; Simon says back, taking a look around the room. Heat and flame belch from the molten lava that bubbled beneath them, and their only saving grace out was the lone platform in the center. Automatons stood at the precipice behind them, watching silently and blankly. They were not being given a chance to fight...they were being told to fight. 

<strong>or else.</strong>

&quot;Sir...or madam, uh...do you mean what you said? If you&#39;re satisfied, we can all leave? Saber and I included?&quot; He needed clarification, but this figure didn&#39;t seem like one to back out on their word. Not to mention, he noticed right away that Saber&#39;s body remained stalwart.

The knight, and the King. It was clear the King would be one of the opponents, along with the girl stationed at his side. His Master. 

“The boy is right.” Saber seconded Simon’s bleak outlook on the situation. “Weapons must be tested with blood and sweat. It seems like we will be supplying those things, by our battle.” 

“Now then, King of an age long past. Are you prepared to bleed?” Her grip shifted upon that ancient piece of metal she called upon. It’s rusted and cruel edge was prepared for a fight. The child was placed behind the matriarch, and she gave a look to him. It communicated one thing clearly ‘do not get in the way.’</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;That&#39;s not true!&quot; 

The bubbling floating up from the curling smoke below wavers as Simon shouts, locking eyes with the &quot;king.&quot; He saw no royalty, however; he only saw a man with a glint of power held in his eyes, and one he could lord over anyone he deemed below him. He knows the type well. 

&quot;Saber has more of a place than someone that would pass judgement so easily! Even if she hates me...she stands by my side, she teaches me...if she has no place just because she&#39;s not human...than I don&#39;t either. And I wouldn&#39;t want one, if people like you are the ones that make laws like that!&quot; 

His chest heaves, his breath lost, but the shine in his own eyes reflect back at the King Berserker. Where had this fury come from...the boy was fine with wallowing in his own misery, standing dejected in his own lack of self worth. But Saber was different...she was strong, courageous, unflinching. She had purpose, and he&#39;d be damned if anyone said otherwise. 

&quot;Saber...I know you hate me...but if I can do anything to help...just tell me. I can&#39;t stand those words...I want him to take them back. You&#39;re life isn&#39;t suffering...it never was.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="23-Nov-22 07:24 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Those truths doomed Lea.

People fought for many reasons. However, the exact reason mattered less than the amount of <u>passion</u> a soldier brought into battle. The greed for fame could be just as powerful of a motivating factor as protecting one’s own family was. As long as the soldier’s motivation to fight matched their nature as a person, they could continue to fight.

Despite her ignorance and recklessness, ‘fun’ was a deep and powerful motivator for Lea Krause. The stories she used to read that portrayed warfare interested her in the most innocent manner possible. Thanks to that high morale, Lea devoted herself to the concept of winning the war as earnestly as she could. Even if their effectivenesses were questionable, she put a great deal of effort into maintaining her hand-crafted weapons, and fantasized how she would act when put into a battle. Much like this one.

That was no more. Her once infallible confidence had shattered, and her curious innocence evaporated into thin air. During her first battle, she learned how scary it could be to be threatened with death. Not to just read it in a book and dismiss it callously— <strong>death</strong> came incredibly close to catching up to her.

Her reason for fighting disappeared, and alongside it, her self-esteem. That left the near-empty husk one last reason to continue fighting.

— A matter of simple survival.

Because having come this far, she no longer had a choice.

A soul-sucking dread sank into Lea as soon as she heard Simon’s logical rebuttal. The affirmation reinforced her currently helpless situation. Confirmed how she was only sinking deeper and deeper into this pitfall.

However, the amount of passion Lea could derive off of fighting to live, in comparison to from her own personal enjoyment, was limited. As the curtain of the battle rose, the emotion that surged through Lea was not passion, as it was rightfully meant to be.

It was desperation.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044912008744685588 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044912008744685588><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Nov-22 07:47 PM">19:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Berserker! Keep me covered!”

Shouting out with a lunatic glare overtaking her expression, Lea grabbed a single weapon out from the pile while using Nimrod’s large figure as cover. Maximizing the duration of her safety by hiding behind Nimrod, before she took in a deep breath and charged towards Simon in a frenzy.

She slid past Grendel’s Mother’s side, leaving her side completely vulnerable. Her heart palpitated as the understanding that her body was left completely open sank in. She expected Nimrod to keep her protected, but that did little to help calm her psyche.

“I couldn’t run even if I wanted to, you meathead!”

The weapon Lea chose to carry while retorting against Nimrod was a shield. Clearly made from the finest of metals, but in spite of its bulk, its weight hardly seemed to slow Lea down.

Her desperation set to max, with the heavy metal doing nothing to help give her an opportunity to reconsider her actions, Lea continued to dash forward towards Simon. As quickly and haphazardly as her feet moved, it was also clear just how much she ended up cowering.

Admittedly against a shield that heavy yet nimble, the amount of force that would push Simon from a tackle would be significant, but in her current state, it should be more than easy to dodge her strike.

— Although, what little sane parts remained of Lea’s mind urged her otherwise.

At the last moment when Lea predicted Simon would attempt to dodge, she took out her gun.

A two-stage bullet that exploded upon contact with a target. Normally, it would be suicide to use it at such a close proximate range, but with the shield to cover her, Lea felt crazy enough to take the risk.

Fuelled by almost nothing other than desperation, Lea pulled the trigger.

<em>Bang.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A shield...maybe she wasn&#39;t trying to end him? It was wishful thinking, something Simon took as truth as he himself dodged the strike and saw the streak of light that carried itself down the muzzle of the pistol, its wide maw housing doom for Simon&#39;s open body. Mere seconds to react, but it almost felt like he stared into the barrel for a whole lifetime. 

<em>Don&#39;t panic, don&#39;t panic, she&#39;ll kill you if you panic! You have to stay calm, for Saber&#39;s sake! Forget about Nikolai, or father, or Alexander or Amelia. You have to save yourself here.</em>

Something touches her hand. It almost feels like a bean bag, or no...smoother than that. Like a sort of gelatin that was caressing her and pushing against her steady aim and up towards the ceiling. There was nothing there...was jt her conscience? Wait, no, that&#39;s stupid, there&#39;s definitely something physical there. <strong>Magecraft.</strong>

The bullet soars and pierces through the open air, digging into the ceiling and giving Simon a moment to breathe and start making his escape before the explosion rocks him forward. Rolling under Lea, stonework and rebar fall to the platform and billow out into a cloud of dust, sending him into a coughing fit as he blindly makes his way to the sound of Saber&#39;s own onslaught.

Kicking off from the ground jumping straight over her. His Mighty Hunter skill had already been in effect allowing him to predict her movements. As an ogre she was even more animalistic in nature making the skill even more effective. She would make fine prey. As Lea went past her side he launched two arrows down on her in quick succession. Having been crafted by the expert blacksmith they flew down at her at blinding speeds intending on piercing straight through her back.

A quick response to Simon&#39;s speech. While he did not care for his feelings about his servant he could respect that level of motivation especially from such a young child. His own vassal could do to learn a thing from him in that regard. If she went against someone like that with an iron will while still cradling her flimsy motivations… Well if he hadn&#39;t been her servant then she would have lost here. As the King fell back down to the ground he unleashed one more arrow aimed straight at Simon&#39;s back as he attempted to approach the stash of weapons. Lea could rejoice because Berserker was her ally in this conflict.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber and Berserker were both eager for the kill. That was for certain. 

Two arrows were loosed as the king had moved out of the monster&#39;s striking range. With a quick twist of her torso, the spinning movement Grendel&#39;s Mother had initiated changed her course again. 

One arrow was knocked away by the blade as Saber landed while the other cut through her flank. Only to be met by her boiling blood spilling forth and consuming the arrow as if it were nothing. 

The Matriarch&#39;s supernatural sense of where those she feuds with kicks in. Head snapping towards Nimrod. &quot;The boy. Is not your target. But what would I expect of such a man. A king is always the worst of those he rules.&quot; Her voice was raised, tossing the blade she had called upon in an attempt to protect the child from the arrow which sought to pierce his heart. 

Saber then began to dash forth. Claws and fangs growing from her body. Going to pounce right upon the king and tear at least pieces of his flesh away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The joviality in his speech, the lighter lilt that came with utter superiority. If his Master wasn&#39;t going to hesitate, than he wasn&#39;t either. 

His shields wouldn&#39;t be able to hold it, but maybe they&#39;d offer a split second of resistance...or maybe could throw it off balance but for a moment...anything that might calm his nerves. Of course, as he turns to meet what might become steel laden doom, the clash of ancient steel and new age metal sends a sharp chime in his ears, the boy himself flinching and clasping his head. He looks down, squinting against the wavering vision of heat and pain, noticing the dull and green glare shining back in his own eyes. Saber&#39;s...Saber. Her own sword...

&quot;Well, I guess I don&#39;t need to look for a weapon...&quot; He mutters, hefting the blade...or trying to at least. Simon grunts as the staggering weight nearly pushes him over the edge of the platform, but manages to hold himself in place. It wasn&#39;t THAT much heavier...than he was. How Saber could heft such a thing only spoke more to her overwhelming strength, and one that he wouldn&#39;t let burden itself with protecting him.

&quot;She&#39;s not going to be able to protect me this whole fight...if anything, I might have to protect her. That Berserker is strong, and it looks like he&#39;s more than able to keep up with her. I have to help out,&quot; he whispers, but scans the area for the other Master. Even if he had a plan, the other Master wouldn&#39;t make it easy. She was actually trying to kill him...they both were! After that Servant even said they&#39;d all go free. Just what had this war done to her? Or was it always this easy to come to this conclusion. 

Simon reaches for his gem magecraft, tossing two before the cracked stone before him as they give a burst of blue light, two spectral blades standing ready to pierce the other Master. Where would she try next?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In spite of that, Lea chose her own guns as her first means of attack. Continuing to disrespect the Blacksmith’s wishes while prioritizing her own safety, she holstered up the shield.

<u>If she didn’t attack, she’d get killed back.</u>

She had no qualms with taking someone else’s life, but no matter how inhuman her obsessions may have been, the same couldn’t be said about her emotions. The <u>empathy</u> for the amount of fear she would inflict on her opponent from her lunatic charge dulled her mind.

Her own parent’s adamant refusal to allow her to join the war replayed in her mind.

Gatsby’s warnings about the true nature of war haunted her nights.

Most importantly, however, the fear she could clearly identify in Simon’s eyes, just as vivid and real as her own, choked her conscience.

—Simon’s jewels flew straight and true, but to little effect. Lea decided to forsake her opportunity at a stellar offense by picking up a shield of craven defense. As long as she decided to hide behind that shield, it would prove difficult to directly hurt her.

That acted both as a boon and a bane. It made her safety steady, but it restricted her options. After all, at the end of the day, the battle would continue as long as both sides were standing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045293562637602836 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045293562637602836><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Nov-22 09:03 PM">21:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She wanted to end the battle as soon as she could.

Lea dashed past the azure explosion and attempted to push her shield directly against Simon’s body. Her guns were unreliable when taking into account his bizarre ability, something she attributed to Magecraft for the time being. As much as Lea ignored her parent’s advise to study Magecraft, she had still been taught a few basic principles. Magecraft was unable to do anything that was scientifically impossible for humans to, at least, <em>theoretically</em> accomplish. No matter how much of that gelatinous… substance, she assumed, Simon could produce, she doubted it would be sufficient to block a tackle from a shield of this magnitude.

That being said, equally as immovable as her borrowed shield may have been, a primordial might laid in Simon’s hands.

In the case two weapons of equal calibur collided— <u>the one with the stronger willpower would emerge triumphant</u>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He could only scoff at the women&#39;s words. On the battlefield the king saw no reason for such maternal protection. Saber and her master were partners thus he should be treated as such.

The light of the forge growing dim, Berserker now standing tall like a shadow. 

<em>”mother…”</em> A voice from long ago. Echoed into her memory. Weak, injured, on the brink of death. <em>”k-kill…. Them… all..”</em>. It continued to speak. 

“I will… my child.” Grendel’s Mother responded to no one. Remaining upon the ground. For far too many seconds to be comfortable, especially for Simon. 

The King had seemingly triumphed against the Monster. 

Seemingly is the key word there. 

The Matriarch’s Ethics of Blood Feud skill activated it’s secondary effect. Her heart, began to beat once more. As the arrow lodged into her chest began to dissolve away. 

Her body raised high. Looking more akin to a statue of some forgotten divinity than the monster which The First King had slaughtered. A beautiful blade then appeared within her hands. Ancient, Silver, Runes inscribed upon its body. This was Saber’s Noble Phantasm. Equally powerful and beautiful. 

It was pointed right at the king. And she lunged closing the gap, one clawed hand out stretched. 

It gripped his bow tightly as she drug the king forth. Threatening to stab the man right through. Or at the very least cause one very messy cut through his flank and side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The king&#39;s taunts drowned out as he watched Saber cheat death itself, her figure rising once more to challenge Berserker and stand tall against his oppression. Of course, he had his own battle to fight, Simon turning back just in time to see the other Master barreling towards him, the unwavering gaze more than enough to inform him that she was preparing to ram him. 

Simon holds his hands out, a shimmer in the air spreads in front of him to act as a shield...one that cracked and pushed inward against him from the weight of Lea&#39;s march. 

It was far too much for the boy to handle, and the effort only pushed him back further and further on the platform, the magma below belching up embers as it desired to consume him. 

He fell off the edge, with hot wind whipping about his hair and cloak, eager to singe his cheek with glowing flecks of molten steel...

But he stopped midway, just below the lip of the platform, as the lava below swirled and wavered from looking through a lens. He had a platform of his own. 

Taking a small chance to enjoy the victory, Simon reaches in for two more gems, throwing them over the edge while hovering near the lip out of site. If the swords could distract her, maybe he could find a way to get the upper hand. He had a sword of his own...that had to be useful.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The spongey wall cracked apart before long, however, and the sensation Lea expected finally collided with her charge.

The grotesque sensation of pushing someone to their death. 
“… I’m sorry.”

A single hesitant apology left Lea’s mouth, but— her remorse was cut short by the bursts of explosions.

“What—?!”

Quickly stepping backwards to block the sudden bursts of attack— by the time the jewels collided against Lea’s shield, she had stepped too far behind to confirm Simon’s state visually. So with bated breath, she just waited for him to launch another attack, emerge from underneath the cliff, or anything. She lacked the valor to approach near the cliff herself, so she waited for Simon to make the first move.

Although, his jewels had failed a second time. The weapon in Lea’s hands was one of <u>absolute defense</u>, at least in the context of this battle. As long as it could meet the attack in time, it was likely that most of Simon’s attempts would be thwarted.

It limited Lea’s offensive options, but it also made the efffectiveness of Simon’s attempts questionable at best. In order to best a shield designed so highly, Simon would have to tag along the Blacksmith’s demand that this battle be held to test the designed weapons.

Or, if not the weapons the Blacksmith offered himself— something analogous to their powerful design.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;HYAH!&quot; 

The boy gives a battle cry, shrill and cracked from adolescence, but a cry nonetheless! As his platform rises, Simon takes aim and flings Grendel&#39;s Mother&#39;s sword, watching the jade blade circle through the air...

<em>clang krtkrtkrt</em> 

It didn&#39;t make it very far, as the sword simply took a short lob and landed squarely between them both, skidding past Lea&#39;s feet. His cheeks flush red as he realizes just how well and truly weak he was...

Without waiting for retaliation, Simon shoots a bubble of air at Lea, strafing around her and attempting to catch the hands wrapped around her shield. His only weapon...and it was useless in his hands. Maybe he could do the same with her. He tosses another Jewel behind her, hoping to keep her attention divided as he works to disarm her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Might met might. While both overwhelming forces, Saber was akin to an immovable object while Berserker was the unstoppable force. 

One would have to give eventually. 

So Grendel’s Mother touched her own blood soaked chest. Loosening her grip upon her blade enough to give Nimrod the advantage. And allow his blade passage, only to be met by her now bloodied hand.

There was no grandiose final exchange of blows, unlike their Servants had been going through. Nothing but an unceremonious <em>clank</em>.

Simon&#39;s attempt to blow the shield out of Lea&#39;s hand was successful. The sudden loss of Simon&#39;s sword, the weapon she had been most cautious of, made Lea let her guard down. For no longer than a second, however.

Reacting to the shield leaving her hands, Lea instinctively grabbed her gun again. If she shot at this timing, where her own vision was still obscured by the shield for an instant, Simon likely would have struggled to prepare a defense in time. If nothing else, Lea had good reflexes.

But even though she would have unhesitantly shot prior, this time, her finger remained on the trigger with a tense expression.

It wasn&#39;t as though it was fear over taking another&#39;s life. That was the least of Lea&#39;s concerns at the moment.

To say today was a rather cocktail day for Simon was an understatement, and his bout of slight confidence when staring down the barrel of a gun was enough to give the boy slight pause along with the wielder behind it. The battle between Saber and Berserker raged behind them, but in this moment, there was a battle between the eyes of their Masters. 

&quot;I&#39;m Simon,&quot; the boy whispers. His hands raise, open palms facing Lea as his eyes shakily focus on the gun pointed straight at his temple. He had been on a high beforehand, but now...well, the gravity of the situation took hold. And that was enough for him to consider their position. After all, this didn&#39;t have to be a battle to the death...

&quot;This is just a test...right? I know we&#39;re on opposite sides and all, and...and you would win this fight. I don&#39;t want to kill anybody, though. And I&#39;d hope you don&#39;t either.

Of course however, the King had other ideas on how to end their current engagement. 

The tip of the arrow head was lunged forwards as if it were the blade of a knife in berserker&#39;s hands. So she would respond in a brutally simple manner. 

Her jaw contorted in that moment, becoming the maw of a monster. Biting down upon the arrow itself. But it did not stop the fist of nimrod from making contact with her nose. 

A loud <strong>CRUNCH</strong> was heard as fist connected to her face, and as arrow was shattered into many small pieces. 

Saber then took her foot, not yet processing the pain of the strike to her face, and pushed Berserker back. Moving forwards, blood streaming steadily down from her nose. The Matriarch was moving in to kill with her blade.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The voice of the Heavenly General rang out from their vantage point. They had watched much of the confrontation in silence, silently observing the results of their work. However, the tone of their voice was anything but pleased. Rather, it seemed to be more annoyed than anything.

Tch. The human element always proved to be so lacking. Still, they had gotten enough data to suit their purposes. 

<strong>&quot;The test is over.&quot;</strong> The blacksmith declared, and right on cue, the bridge over the molten metal stretched to reach the platform once more. Dozens upon dozens of golems immediately stirred to life, setting about the hefty workload that was now in front of them. <strong>&quot;You are free to go. I shall have the equipment delivered shortly.&quot;</strong>

A pause. Then, they spoke again.

<strong>&quot;Get out.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A sigh of relief left Lea as the battle concluded with neither party having sustained injuries or spilt any blood. Her leg still ached from her last battle. It wasn’t a particularly pleasant reminder, all things considered.

“The name’s Lea Krause. Nice to meet you.”

Setting her gun down, having the clash concluded, Lea finally felt comfortable enough to introduce herself. Both times when she fought like this, once it was settled, she felt as though she could have a comfortable conversation with the other person. How bizarre it was to put your own life on the line.

The Blacksmith’s dismissal was nothing but white noise to signify her own safety by now. As infuriating as his arrogance might have been, by this point she paid it little mind. Whether she got to test the shield sufficiently or not, she couldn’t care all too much. The tool meant to protect her served its purpose. That was all that was important.

“I dunno if I’d call it second thoughts. It’s just… I fought so desperately to try and live, but seeing how… um, pathetic that last-ditch attempt at a throw from you was, I started to think that maybe I shouldn’t be trying so hard against someone so weak.”

For someone who had been in a state of sheer hysteria just moments ago, she didn’t seem to mince words much at all. Even if her words, meant with the best intentions, ended up trampling over Simon’s earnest desire to protect his Servant— she cut through him with the most honest words she could muster.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1046764418911969360 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1046764418911969360><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Nov-22 10:28 PM">22:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“… I used to think weak soldiers were worthless, but I change my mind. You should keep it that way. Not being strong enough to take a life is pretty charming, you know?”

Words that applied not only to Simon, but to Lea herself. She had long since lost the fangs required to take a life. As meaningless as this clash might have been, at the very least, Lea Krause came out of it with the slightest increase in confidence.

“Heey, Berserker, let’s go back home! No need to waste any more time around here!”

Lea wouldn’t be able to make Nimrod’s wish come true anymore. She had lost much of her motivation to take up arms.

Even still, with a refreshed attitude, she recalled the king to her side. Her troubles were far from over, but having her expectations so pleasantly betrayed seemed to have brought her more than a little bit of comfort.

“… Oh, by the way, weird taste— but girls like those tend to like forwardness. You’re on the right track, I’ll be cheering for you.”

Whispering to Simon, Lea pointed backwards towards his Servant, whom he had made zero efforts to conceal his affection for.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His final weapon was shattered and his fist connected with her nose with enough force to possibly break it. As he was pushed back he was finally able to take back his sword or what remained of it. His treasured sword had been reduced to a jagged mess, its blade almost completely gone. He had been left defenceless so when Saber moved into kill he raised up an arm attempting to use it as a shield from her blade. Luckily it was at this time the Blacksmith interrupted their heated battle causing the two servants to pause mid action saving him an arm. The king though had no gratitude for their host 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>Silence</strong>

Despite the fact that he had been losing, his confidence was left unscathed. He still remained confident in his own victory. Such was the pride of this King. Still Grendel&#39;s Mother had gained his respect despite not being human. And that was an accomplishment. With his declaration complete he turned and began to exit heading home as Lea had requested expecting her to follow behind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
