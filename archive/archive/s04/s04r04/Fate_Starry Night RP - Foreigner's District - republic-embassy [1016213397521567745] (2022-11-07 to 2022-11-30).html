With Alexandria’s win in the last round and being unable to secure the spot for the current round, all they could do was get the fourth round and secure yet another victory for The Republic. At the rate it was going, they wouldn’t <em>need</em> to force their teammates out of the tournament.

If none of them had the decency to win their fights, then what rights did they have to the wish?

And next time, Zahhak wouldn’t be held back by a limited pool of mana. Nikolai had absolutely zero idea about his own strength as a Magi, but that didn’t matter much. So long as he didn’t keel over when Lancer went all out they’d be sure to win. A soul or two might perish in the meantime, yet it would be all worth it when he got to finally find his sister.

He did not even bother to acknowledge the protestors outside the building this time, despite their best efforts. Their signs had been updated to include the fact that <em>their</em> faction had won the last round. As if that would matter. 

“<strong>Like. Last. Time,</strong>” he called over his shoulder to Lancer. Go in, get their slot in the fourth round, get out. How could they say no to their sole victor in the Tournament?

Unless they counted the outstanding debt on his back from Waku-Waku. He already had a payment plan settled, so there was little concern.

If there was, though, his shield would talk for him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041411633571967126 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041411633571967126><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Nov-22 03:58 AM">03:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Nikolai reached the door first. He pushed on the door, and–

Glass shattered. Sheer weight broke the polished glass into rough dust. He stumbled past the now ruined door frame and into the lobby of the building once more. If it weren’t for his shield, the man would’ve surely fallen to the ground in sheer embarrassment. 

“<strong>Huh?</strong>” he asked aloud. Despite the helmet, everyone around could guess his facial expression as he stared at the remains of the door. Dumbfounded. The door had been a push one, right? It said so right on the…

“<strong>Hrm.</strong>”

He turned back around and ignored the laughs and mocks from the small crowd outside. It was The Republic’s fault, after all. Who put ‘Pull’ in such hard to read size? And backwards as well!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Never before had he felt this much magical energy running through his shoddy little S.E.R.V.A.N.T rig. He felt like a real, true GOD!

<strong>&quot;Kuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu... Kuhuhuhuhuhuhu...&quot;</strong>

Before you ask - yes, he had spent all night and all morning giggling to himself like that. What did he have to laugh about? The lead he had worked so hard to establish had just been squandered! Such an irritation. He would have preferred to sully his hands in that arena of fools no longer, but desperate times called for dire measures...

The time for mercy was over. Whoever stepped in the coliseum with them? <strong>They would not survive.</strong>

Lancer followed Nikolai closely, stopping when he stopped, walking when he walked. As Nikolai accidentally smashed through the door, he would turn to see Zahhak, ready with a sharp comment to--

<strong>&quot;Kuhu! Kuhuhuhuhu! Kuhuhuhuhu!&quot;</strong>

--still laughing. Still just laughing. Was he even present? It seemed like he was in some manner of trance, as though sleepwalking. No matter what happened, he simply kept laughing. Kuhu. Kuhuhu. Kuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuha.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Protestors blabbing, secretaries pointedly ignoring them, blah blah blah. Nothing changed, and that was fine.

As the two reached the receptionist&#39;s desk to continue the Nikolai position of telling, not asking, there was a odd sound coming from the wall near the doorway. Nikolai didn&#39;t recognize the sound. Was that the <em>music</em> that he had heard so much about? What a comforting sound, like destroying a jewelry shop.

<em>Ding.</em> A piano key rung out from behind the wall. <em>Ding.</em> Another note rang out. Zahhak had never heard a piano like this before, yet the sound seemed familiar, as if he had heard something similar once.

<em>Ding.</em> Another key.

<em>Ding.</em>

<strong>CRASH!</strong> A grand piano smashed through the wall of the embassy at extremely high speeds. It rolled once, twice, then thrice before skidding to a stop in front of Nikolai and Zahhak. A rain of keys followed from the spinning of the piano, hitting both Zahhak and Nikolai on the head.

<em>Dingdingdingdingdingdingding.</em> The keys fell like musical raindrops. 

At the new visitor&#39;s entrance to the embassy stood a familiar face. Hadn&#39;t Nikolai seen that feathered hat on a poster somewhere, and Zahhak <em>definitely</em> knew who he was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From the very walls? This would prove to be a day to be remembered. Or forgot. It depended on which way this clown swung.

And with the decision on how to enter the main lobby, this Servant certainly swung <em>against</em> them. Nikolai had to admit, though, that his song flowed nicely. Perfect, even. He knew this piece from somewhere, right? 

“<strong>March. Of. Swiss. Soldiers?</strong>” he asked the Servant. Even if his guess on the piece was completely wrong, his guess on who this was had no chance to be. There had been rumors, murmurs, and posters of this one all over town. 

“<strong>Paga...Pag-Pagi–You.</strong>” he acknowledged. His shield raised, then slammed back down into the ground. A large boom echoed in the room, and out the lobby doors. An attempt to silence the protestors. 

“<strong>What. Show? Happy? Or. Angry?</strong>”

Nikolai stood on guard, ready to attack at a moment&#39;s notice. He could not focus all his attention on such a task, largely in part due to Zahhak. That damned laughter failed to leave his mind, too entrenched in the crevices and cracks. Maybe this direct threat to their lives would do the trick to knock that humor out of the serpent&#39;s system.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikolai was not gentle, and Zahhak certainly wasn&#39;t a man. This language was lost on the duo.

“<strong>Risky. Words,</strong>” Nikolai said. The Servant had nerve, to declare himself the victor when their supposed <em>fight</em> hadn’t even started. Even now, they were only a minute into their meeting and no blood had been spilled on the ground.

The pair might be known to the city, but they surely didn’t know the new powers that Zahhak held in his claws. With the pair bonded, these two clowns stood zero chance against their raw might. 

Especially if his ‘partner’, the Master, looked to be yet another weak one. Seriously, how many Masters didn’t even have a shred of muscle on their arms?! You’d think a couple of them would’ve gone to the gym in preparation for this Tournament!

“<strong>So. Two. Choices. Leave. Fight.</strong>”

“<strong>Which?</strong>” He raised his shield. His instincts told him to go all out immediately, but those were best ignored.

The dragon&#39;s ceaseless laughter would finally reach a crescendo, like an orchestra swelling at the climactic moment of the opera. Casually, he would stroll forward, walking around the piano and up to Paganini, looking him up and down.

<strong>&quot;Well, well, well! If it isn&#39;t the wayward musician, lost in the dead of night!&quot;</strong> Lancer&#39;s voice was difficult to read, halfway between taunting and complimentary. <strong>&quot;Oh, how the time flies! Why, it felt like only yesterday I encountered you limping about like a stray dog without a master, so afraid of the world around him...&quot;</strong>

Casually, the dragon swung an arm around Paganini&#39;s shoulders and pulled him close, as though he were an old drinking buddy, and not a near-stranger. To Gatsby and Nikolai, the sight must have been absurd. Hell, for Paganini, experiencing it must have been absurd. It seemed as though Zahhak himself was the only one clued in, and asking him what was going on was assuredly a fool&#39;s errand.

<strong>&quot;Tell me, how does it feel? To be free from the shackles of good and evil, enlightened by the love of Angra Mainyu? Is it not blissful? Is it not grand? Is it not everything you have ever wished for and more?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;If it isn&#39;t the snake. The bile you utter spoils my ears like a poorly tuned instrument.&quot; Paganini shrugged off Zahhak&#39;s advances and turned towards the hole in the wall, and by extension, the protestors outside. 

This audience had once roused Paganini&#39;s heart, and made him yearn to perform. Now, he felt <strong>nothing</strong> for them. Their cheers were as unappealing as the screeching of crows and the laughter of demons.

Nothing, nothing, nothing! Zahhak had replaced Paganini&#39;s motivation with nothing.

&quot;<strong>It is acceptable. I no longer need redemption. I feel no desire to please them, and I feel the desire to stack their corpses high and play the greatest songs ever, for nobody but myself and my partner. You and your brute included.</strong>&quot;

Paganini turned to Gatsby, then to Zahhak, then back to the crowd still cheering.

&quot;Is this it? What you wanted to parade?&quot; He asked Zahhak.

Pausing, the dragon would pace around the room, ignoring Nikolai, Gatsby, the confused embassy staff, and the cheering crowd alike as he walked back and forth, back and forth in a strange, purposeless march.

<strong>&quot;Both of us made deals with those that the masses decried as evil. Both of us raised to the height of prominence, only to be brought crashing down by those same self-righteous fools! And we are both here, in this disgusting little speck of a city, this monument to the foolishness of the past! And now, NOW, I have shared with you the greatest gift I have to offer!&quot;</strong>

Lancer turned, looking at Paganini with an unusual warmth, a kindness that could rarely be seen in those bitter, bitter eyes.

What was Paganini doing with Zahhak? The dragon looked nothing like any friend Paganini had, and Paganini had few friends. Nonetheless, something was off about this dragon. Gatsby growled as his eyes glowed, his eyes going over Zahhak.

A dream burst into his eyes. A man swallowing bile and transitioning into a dragon. Evil. <em>Evil</em>. <strong>Evil</strong>. A representation, nay, a symbol, of defying fate for the sake of ego.

&quot;<strong>Kill him, Paganini.</strong>&quot; Gatsby whispered, before manifesting a machine gun and turning on Nikolai.

Nikolai could only watch in confusion as Zahhak not only approached the Servant, but <em>embraced</em> him. And he didn’t even fight back! Clearly there had been a prior meeting between these two, and it ended neutrally at worst between the two.

At least the laughter stopped, if only for now. The way Lancer then paced back and forth relentlessly, though, only drove Nikolai further up the wall. That, and his odd behavior.

If there were to be a fight, it should’ve happened by now. Did Zahhak plan to get close and comfortable, then stab them in the back? Or did he seek to try and get someone on the ‘inside’ of Alexandria on their side, so to speak? The Servant certainly looked to be at least tolerant of their existence.

Maybe he should be the one to do so. Give the cart a shove, so to speak. He stood in the perfect position to do so, as well. All it would take is one good perfect and Gastby would be on the ground. Perfect to curbstomp him into a mush.

No, that’d be wrong! These two would be no real fight, anyway. What fun lay in a one sided massacre? They should do what they came here to do and leave. 

Thus, Gatsby got the first move.

“Kill him, Paganini.*”

Those were the go time words alright. By the time Gatsby had turned around, Nikolai had already raised his shield. The massive rectangle of black quickly grew bigger as he charged the blonde. If he didn’t get out of the way, he’d be on a very short trip from ‘where he stood’ to ‘a pancake against the wall’.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Outside, the crowd cheered at Paganini&#39;s offensive move. The musician pointedly ignored them, something he never did before. Instead, he had his eyes pointedly on Zahhak. The musician prepared to swing his violin towards the Lancer, yet as his blow got near, it felt as if his violin was sinking through several layers of murk.

Was his hand staying itself on purpose, or was Paganini <em>against</em> the idea of harming Zahhak? No, unacceptable!

Paganini swung the violin, yet the power of the strike was lessened substantially. It was nothing more than a love tap.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>THRASH!</strong> Gatsby turned to see Lancer&#39;s Master charging towards him. Gatsby&#39;s machine gun fired onto Nikolai&#39;s shield, and words suddenly erupted onto the shield. Nikolai was one with his glorified steel wall, and felt words creeping around the edge of his shield. What did they say? Could Nikolai even read?

Nikolai&#39;s shield crashed into Gatsby, and bent around the Servant. The barrel of the gun pointed through the shield, straight at Nikolai&#39;s gut.

<strong>RADTATATATATATATATATAT!</strong> The weapon spewed bullets at Nikolai, harmlessly passing through the shield.

A talon reached out and poked Paganini on the forehead, tapping as he continued his lecture.

It nearly did too. He prepared to feel the impact of some scrawny puke thud against his shield, and even braced himself for the extra weight.

Yet his shield got cold feet at the last moment and swerved out of the way. Or, something like that. The specifics of how the blond’s gun got past his defenses mattered little to the reality of the situation. 

Each shot came out in rapid succession, and his armor ate the generous helping of lead with much hunger. The cascade of bullets surely tore the outside of the protection to shreds, and he knew that if those actually penetrated his armor his guts would spill out on the ground. What remained of them, rather.

So, he flicked his shield upward. The bottom flew up with plenty of force and collided with his hands. If he wasn’t prepared, the weapon would surely fly out of his fingers.

Meanwhile, another set of fingers balled up. His free hand shot past the protection of steel, right towards the face of Gatsby. If his shield was worthless in the face of the machine gun, then surely the scrawny twerp would be unable to defend himself against his raw strength.

And for good measure, Nikolai tapped into his Origin. How many times did that make it in the last few days? Six? Seven? More than he’d done the month prior. It felt all too easy as the casual rage and bloodlust spilled over into his consciousness, its power imbued into his limbs. 

To the pathetic Servant, all he would see is his foe grow in size. None of the internal stresses that went behind the increase in power, but the product. Such was the strength of a Master aligned with Zahhak.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Bonk.</em> Paganini thawked the violin into Zahhak&#39;s skull without even blinking. <em>Bonk.</em> The violin thwacked the dragon yet again. Each strike from Paganini felt like a club covered with several layers of padding. It ached, yes, but it wasn&#39;t even remotely fatal. It was more annoying than anything.

&quot;I see.&quot; Paganini said, before striking at the dragon again. At last, Paganini seemed to come to the conclusion that the damage he was doing was minimal. Maybe if he put more back into it...?

&quot;You give me the gift of freedom to do what I want, but I&#39;m not free to kick your ass? That&#39;s in extremely poor taste, snake. I promised to turn you into a violin, and I intend to keep my promise.&quot; Paganini vowed, before strumming his violin like an electric guitar, blasting Zahhak back and causing his eardrums to rattle. Surely this advantage didn&#39;t extend to sound, right?

Yet Paganini considered it an attack. The crowd cheered at Paganini&#39;s solo. Even his fights were comparable to his shows. It caused Paganini&#39;s blood to boil.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikolai didn&#39;t expect this. In all honestly, Nikolai probably expected Gatsby to let go of his weapon and disarm himself. In a way, Gatsby had been. Instead, he seemed to prefer being airborn to actually giving up his weapon.

Gatsby&#39;s eyes went over Nikolai. This man was a brute, bordering on the edge of a chasm of animalistic tendencies. The unbridled wrath of nature, given form. If nature allowed for the use of heavy arms and riot gear.

Lunging for his gun in midair, the machine gun typewriter morphed into a massive pile of blank checks, which settled into a cushion beneath Gatsby. He floated down to Nikolai&#39;s level in a cloud of financial irresponsibility, before flinging a piece of rock at him.

<em>Donk.</em> It rolled off Nikolai&#39;s helmet effortlessly.

Wonderful. 

Yet Paganini seemed to be struggling with Zahhak. No matter how impressive of a Servant this Lancer was, Paganini was extremely strong. What gift did Zahhak give him?

&quot;Nuts!&quot; Gatsby cried at Zahhak indignantly. &quot;Paganini would never take gifts from strangers. There&#39;s only so many exploding violins that someone can send before he learns not to trust snakes like you. I can smell a villain a <strong>mile</strong> away, old sport.&quot;

The look on Zahhak&#39;s face was one of equal amounts disappointment and fury. His rage had been held back by the potential of a bond, of Berserker proving worthy of carrying his cause. Now? He held no such delusions of friendships.

<strong>&quot;&quot;Very well. If you will not stand by my side as an ally, then you will stand under me as a slave!&quot;</strong>

The dragon reared back their head, and in a moment of rage, unleashed a torrent of flame out from their maw, a stream of fire aiming to utterly consume Paganini. He&#39;d burn for his foolishness, and then that idiot blonde would burn, too!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What a surprise. This was the Master? As pathetic as predicted. Much like the last two times, this fight would be awfully boring. Either he got a hold of the blond and caved his skull in, or it resulted in a trump card that put him in the dirt. 

Just the thought got his vision red. His fist shook. It would not come to that yet again. This fool would <em>die</em>, if only to prove Nikolai as strong as he looked.

It was a rock fight? Fine. He’d win. While Zahhak spewed his flames, Nikolai took a step back. A rather large piece of wall, a few bricks still held together by the dried mortar, looked promising. He bent down, picked up the debris, and rolled his shoulders.

“<strong>Here,</strong>” he said, and pulled his arm back. Thankfully, he did not grow larger as his arm started to fly forward.

“<strong>Catch.</strong>”

Nikolai hurled the makeshift ‘ball’ towards his foe, who had all the time in the world to predict where it would fly. However, now that it was airborne, it sure did fly a lot faster than it had any right to…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Spittle flung from Paganini&#39;s mouth as he shouted at Zahhak. The evil dragon could feel the utter hatred and wrath radiating from the Demonic Virtuoso. Zahhak&#39;s flames engulfed Paganini, before being dispersed by the shredding of Paganini&#39;s violin. His hat fell off as a smoking heap.

Again, the crowd cheered as Paganini dispersed Zahhak&#39;s attack, along with getting a burst of music as well. Paganini was less than pleased. They were cheering for him <em>now</em>? When he didn&#39;t even need them? He was unburdened. He didn&#39;t need their false sympathy now.

Paganini stood in front of them, looking at the crowd with utter contempt. His face was twisted into a sneer, and he looked violently ill. Black veins crept across his face, and across his fingers. 

Long ago, Zahhak had infected Paganini with an imitation of a great curse. It had tainted the musician to the core, and it had erupted against Nimrod. Now, however, it was time to ascend.

An Alteration of Paganini&#39;s Saint Graph.

&quot;<strong>The song has stopped playing.</strong>&quot; Paganini sighed in contempt. &quot;<strong>What are you all babbling about. &#39;Paganini! Paganini!&quot; Where were you in my slumps? Where were you when I was hated by the masses?</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Yet you stand with me now?</strong>&quot;

The crowd lie on the ground, stunned. Several photos had been taken of the fight, and soon it would be streaming on Fatechan™️ and Alexandria&#39;s CWW. More people would arrive to see Paganini defeat Alexandria&#39;s most hated adversary.

Yet they would instead see Paganini defeat <strong>his</strong> most hated adversary: them.

&quot;<strong>IL CANNONE GUARNERIUS!</strong>&quot; Paganini said, blasting a cannonball towards the crowd, knocking pedestrians aside. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m sorry to spit on the dream, and yet...</strong>&quot;

Laughter erupted from Paganini&#39;s throat as he turned back on Zahhak, his Master, and Gatsby.

&quot;<strong>They did this to you, Gatsby. To me, as well. They all spat on me, and they walked all over you. They deserve this!</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nikolai&#39;s crude boulder of debris hit Gatsby square in the arm, dislocating his shoulder. Gatsby fell in a grunt of pain. Logic would dictate that the debris would&#39;ve shredded Gatsby apart like a cannonball, yet words appeared on the debris, before quickly vanishing.

&quot;Good throw, old sport.&quot; Gatsby grunted as he struggled to his feet. He put his arm on his shoulder, and popped the socket back into place. &quot;I wish I had met you back in life, I could&#39;ve recommended you to Wolfsheim. He rigged the World Series, see. If he had you, he wouldn&#39;t have needed to rig anything.&quot;

Blast, this <em>hurt</em>. Gatsby was too frail—a fictional character made of a thin layer of words—yet he still needed to fight.

Zahhak&#39;s flames suddenly turned into black ink. The flames passed around Gatsby, who suddenly began to shiver. &quot;Cold, cold, cold.&quot; He muttered as icicles danced on his coat. 

<strong>THRUM!</strong> Gatsby heard jazz originate from Paganini&#39;s instrument as the musician decimated the Alexandrian protestors. &quot;Paganini, <strong>stop!</strong> What are you doing?&quot; Gatsby ran towards the musician, before stopping.

Paganini looked different. Almost like... Almost like... Oh no. Was this like that...? A memory flashed in front of Gatsby&#39;s eyes. A memory of something that he shouldn&#39;t remember. Pain. Crying.

Gatsby wheeled on Zahhak, marching up to the dragon that towered over him.

&quot;<strong>What did you do, villain?</strong> Gatsby grapped Zahhak and attempted to shake him. &quot;<strong>WHAT DID YOU DO?</strong>&quot;

But a promise was a promise.

There was no turning back.

<strong>Angra Mainyu</strong> could not be denied.

He watched as the serpent&#39;s venom finally took grip, saw the delirium take hold in real time. Niccolo Paganini, the disrespected and slandered bard, was gone. What remained was Niccolo Paganini, avenger of his legacy, a man who would scorn the masses for their sins.

...He looked so much like Zahhak had in his youth, before the great metamorphosis of his flesh. He barely remembered those &quot;halcyon&quot; days. Nevertheless, seeing him wreak such indignant havoc caused a flicker in those long-forgotten memories.

<strong>&quot;I simply revealed the true Paganini. The REAL Paganini!&quot;</strong> Lancer replied to the Caster, turning to face him, his many teeth aligned in a crooked smile. <strong>&quot;One buried under restraint, inhibition, and convention. Do not speak to me as though I have inflicted some great misery upon him - This is all his own doing.&quot;</strong>

A talon raised up, hooking Gatsby by the chin and pulling his face up, forcing him to look eye-to-eye with the dragon.

<strong>&quot;Though, a nasty little liar like you would know agonisingly little of the truth, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever had happened when he wasn’t around, looked like it reared its ugly head within Berserker. Instead of an assault on Zahhak, he turned his anger on—

The crowd.

Even with the first blast, it didn’t look like anyone immediately succumbed to the strike of energy. However, he could make out the expressions painted on each and every visible face. Confusion. Despair.

Fear. 

Where had he seen this before? The memory bubbled against an invisible barrier, just out of reach. Why couldn’t he remember? It felt important. Was important. Damn it all, it mattered!

But, perhaps it could wait a spell. As Gatsby attempted to shake down Lancer, Nikolai once more raised his shield. Self defense was the only kind he knew. To protect against outside forces against himself. The crowd needed to figure it out on their own.

But if anything coherent still stuck in his head right now, it was how to attack. 

“<strong>Zahhak,</strong>” he yelled over his shoulder. “<strong>Remember? No. Harm. Civ—civill—ci… Good. People.</strong>”

“<strong>Kill. Servant. Only.</strong>”

As Paganini surprised the citizens he had come to charm, Nikolai rushed to surprise the people that loathed his very existence. He rushed forward, right towards the Servant. Ready to knock him into the river.

Once more he tapped into his Origin, but for protection. After all, he planned to bum rush a being well above his pay grade. As long as he could get him into water, he’d be powerless to fight back. 

As long as his own Servant didn’t plan to murder him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was my promise. <strong>Tear it down, BRICK BY BRICK.</strong> Paganini struck his violin again, and music erupted from it. It was a discordant and hammering melody that tugged at Nikolai&#39;s heart strings. As simple as he was, it reverberated through Nikolai&#39;s being.

It was a song of loss and rage. It was Nikolai standing outside his family&#39;s jewelry store, watching them live without him. It was Fereydun and his men tossing chains around Zahhak&#39;s body. It was Gatsby knowing of Daisy&#39;s marriage.

&quot;Guh...!&quot; Paganini grunted as Nikolai pushed against him. Perhaps he was surprised that a mere human was trying to go against a Heroic Spirit. Nonetheless, Paganini retreated several steps under the blunt of Nikolai&#39;s shield.

Nonetheless, Nikolai was a human, and Paganini was a Servant. Their differences were night and day.

Utilizing Gatsby&#39;s manipulation of Nikolai&#39;s shield, Paganini jammed the neck of the violin into Nikolai&#39;s gut—the shield bending as it did so. The force knocked Nikolai back several meters, while Paganini dangled very close to the edge of the building.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was not the true, real, or any of adjective one would use to describe Paganini. The real Paganini was a man who held no contempt in his heart, beyond a hatred for all musicians. He loved the audience, even as he pretended to despise them.

Even this Berserker, a twisted caricature of Paganini from history, was as real as all other manifestations. This mockery of Paganini&#39;s ideals was not even remotely true!

...Right?

Gatsby&#39;s eyes fluttered over Paganini, and Gatsby shuddered. <strong>Evil.</strong> That was the symbol attributed to Paganini at this moment. It was the very same as Zahhak&#39;s. Or was it? The symbol glittered like foil, like a second layer over the first. <em>There&#39;s still time.</em> Gatsby realized. <em>I can fix him.</em>

Now, in order to do that, he had to defeat a demonic dragon that represented one of the greatest evils that the world had ever known, a mercenary that could rip his head off with a thought, and a fundamentally corrupted and altered Servant.

All against him, one of the weakest Heroic Spirits in modern memory. It was a long shot.

&quot;<strong>What are you implying, old sport? Just because I—</strong>&quot; Gatsby swallowed as Zahhak stared at him. &quot;<strong>—didn&#39;t truly exist, everything I said is a lie? Or perhaps..</strong>&quot;

&quot;The little dragon prince is implying something else? You&#39;re one to talk, <strong>old sport.</strong>&quot;

Paganini&#39;s music entered his ears, and tears began to well up in Gatsby&#39;s eyes. He didn&#39;t remember Daisy&#39;s wedding, but when he returned from the Great War, and he had learned the truth, he had wept. He had <em>lost</em> her. Her smile, her heart, her love.

Those feelings were <strong>real</strong>, no matter what this dragon implied.

The sounds of screams and chains filled his ears, and his mood darkened. He would never, <strong>never</strong> allow himself to be bound like that again. This time, his rule would TRULY be eternal.

<strong>&quot;I am one to talk, O&#39; Great Gatsby. After all, it takes a liar to know a liar, does it not?&quot;</strong>

Suddenly, a clawed hand would grasp Caster by the neck, hoisting him up off the ground. However, it was not painful. It did not hurt. It was not meant as an attack. Not yet.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ve read your dreary little book, you know. A sordid tale of the insignificant lives of insignificant people and the insignificant tragedies that befell them. A true insult to the paper it was printed on. The ink must weep, to know it was wasted on such tripe!&quot;</strong>

Not even his own Master was an exception. For a brief moment, Nikolai remembered his past with absolute clarity. His family, successful in their ivory tower. Without him.

Before this emotion could drive his actions further, the air was instead driven from his lungs. The Berserker, understandably, struck back at his charge. Again, his shield proved worthless as the instrument forced him back several meters. He managed to stay upright but was left breathless.

A swirl of emotions fought for control over his mind. An animalistic rage collided with a sobriety long unknown to the man. While the rage was winning, and would easily win, it left him unable to move. 

Those stares, from earlier, he had seen them before. From that dreaded night. Was it because he longed to forget, or was it like the many other lost-to-time moments he could no longer recall? And why could he still not remember what had happened to Sapphire? 

Slowly, his gasps for air turned into deep, hot breaths. In. Out. In.

“<strong>Grrrrrwwrrl,</strong>” he growled. The shield slowly slid off his arm, and then rushed to the ground. As it rocked back and forth, it was joined by his thick, padded gloves. 

Thick, sharp claws sprouted from hands covered in hair. Rough, short stubble coated every inch of skin. Fingers twitched, curled in a half moon shape. 

“<strong>Servant!</strong>” Nikolai pointed at the Berserker with a thick, stunted claw. “<strong>Why. Don’t. Die?!</strong>”

With his last word roared, he spread his arms wide and rushed the Servant. What did it matter that he was from The Throne of Heroes? His heart beat just like his. Air went in and out of his lungs.

He would bleed the same as the rest. Anything to quell the confliction of emotions inside Nikolai’s head. Anything to remember and forget, all at once.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would march over their bodies as he took his rightful place as the greatest. And yet...

Why did he not feel better?

Pondering this question, Paganini pointedly ignored Nikolai until the last moment. As he turned back towards the walking crisis that was Nikolai, he blinked in surprise. What, was the brute turning into an animal? 

That was fine. Paganini would skin him and wear him as gloves.

That was, until Nikolai tackled the Berserker, sending them tumbling into the river below. Paganini malded as this happened. Water was how he had lost before. He would not lose to it now.

Paganini and Nikolai tumbled into the canal, where the two thrashed about. Suddenly, Nikolai was pushed back by Paganini&#39;s violin. As the two floated in the river, Paganini struck his violin with enough force to snap three separate strings.

To Nikolai, the sound sounded like the tune that played in his family&#39;s jewelry shop when you opened the door. Then, he breathed in air.

Wait, air?

Nikolai found himself in a dry ditch, with Paganini standing before him. Water was raining down onto Nikolai, drenching his armor. This was no mere ditch, this was the canal. Paganini had used enough force to divert the water. Eventually, it would come flooding back.

Paganini looked up. Rain.

&quot;<strong>Why?</strong>&quot; He asked. &quot;Those people have been making a mess of your embassy for over a month, and they&#39;ve made a mess of me for over two hundred years. You&#39;re an animal, I&#39;m despised. You should be <strong>helping</strong> me.

Il Cannone Guarnerius made a scraping sound on stone as Paganini stepped towards Nikolai, dragging the weapon with him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As if by reading it, it would cement who he was: a man who began and ended within the cover of a story.

&quot;<strong>Hrrk.</strong>&quot; Gatsby gasped as Zahhak&#39;s grip closed like a vice, the Servant scrambling to find any purchase against the monster. Yet Zahhak was too strong, and Gatsby was too weak. It was like fighting a mountain, and yet...

Was he right? To an onlooker, The Great Gatsby was a childish drama about someone who couldn&#39;t get over a crush. It was shallow, vapid, and unassuming. This dark god, who had finished the book that he himself had avoided, had the right to decry his book. How could he refute something he never read?

That was it, then. The person who read the novel had the ultimate authority to decry the state of the story, and the nature of the story. It was a law of literature and fiction.

If the story was vapid, then the character had no right to exist, and certainly had no right to sit on the Throne.

One moment, Nikolai charged the Servant with arms outstretched to rip and tear. The next, they both crashed into the water. Even worse, without Paganini as a hold, he floundered in the water. Pure instinct told him to keep his head above water, but heavy armor made the task difficult.

Yet Berserker made that a non-issue. With a strike on the violin, they were dropped to the mud below. Water disappeared, but surely not for long.

Nikolai barely noticed that, mud or rain. Instead, he focused on the fleeting memory granted once more by the musician. The Jewelry shop. He recognized the tune, surprisingly. It’s gentle melody, even as a child, soothed him greatly. 

And it was gone. Something about a shop. Jewels. A calm tone. What was it again? Why did he feel melancholy? 

“<strong>Hurt. People. Lose. Tournament.</strong>”

Nikolai slowly crawled away, with barely any success. The stone was too slick. Paganini made plenty of ground.

“<strong>Besides. They. Not. Hurt. Me. Past. People. Did.</strong>”

He pointed a finger at Berserker, “<strong>Past. People. Hurt. Too.</strong>”

His hand slowly motioned to the half dozen heads that peered over the canal edge. “<strong>They. Not. Enemies.</strong>”

“<strong>But. Nikolai. Am</strong>”

He planted a boot underneath his leg and pushed forward. He quickly rose from the ground, and once again grew in size. His fist aimed directly at Paganini’s nose, in hopes that it’d get bent parallel with his face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To kill Gatsby now would be easy. All he would need to do was tighten his to its fullest extent, and his neck would collapse under the pressure. He could end his miserable life in a second, snuff out the light of his existence in the blink of an eye.

But where was the fun in that?

<strong>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, James?&quot;</strong> Zahhak taunted, jeering at the Caster held within his grip. <strong>&quot;Have you recognised yourself for the garbage you are? Come now, don&#39;t fret! I won&#39;t kill you just ye--&quot;</strong>

He didn&#39;t notice exactly the moment the pages arrived, but by the time he recognised their presence, it was already too late. A hundred pieces of paper flew against him, pressing against his scales, and burning his body.

<strong>&quot;GYAHHH!&quot;</strong>

It was agony. Yet among the throes of pain, he did not release his grip. No, in fact, it grew <em>tighter</em>. A dangerous miscalculation. For a moment, it seemed as though the confrontation might end with both of them dead. But, for better or for worse...

<strong>FWOOSH!</strong> A gout of liquid flame burst from Lancer&#39;s mouth, arcing straight upward, until gravity dragged it down and it fell upon his body. It ran across his flesh, setting every page on fire, burning them to ash and relieving him of the pain. 

Yet, this solution did not come without cost. Though he was resistant to his own fire, he was not immune. As the last of the flame dripped off his body, Zahhak stood there, burnt, wounded, and <strong>furious beyond compare</strong>.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044534608848494605 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044534608848494605><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Nov-22 06:47 PM">18:47</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Gatsby had earned his ire.

&quot;<strong>NONSENSE!</strong> He roared at Nikolai as water began raining down harder and harder. He gripped his violin with such force and passion that the strings slit into Paganini&#39;s flesh. Black ooze dribbled down his hand and onto the violin, where it hissed and burned.

&quot;I saw your matches. I know exactly what Alexandria thinks of you. If you were lying, bruised and broken on that stage, they would pelt you with stones and bricks and glass until you were crushed by the weight.&quot;

&quot;Until you we—&quot; Nikolai&#39;s fist slammed into Paganini&#39;s nose, breaking it. Instead of blood, black ooze erupted from the wound, spraying onto Nikolai&#39;s armor, burning a hole through it. Zahhak was indirectly making this fight impossible for Nikolai.

More impossible than it was before, at least.

&quot;<strong>NO!</strong>&quot; Paganini screeched at Nikolai. The man felt a sickening crunch as Paganini threw all of his power into striking Nikolai in the gut. Layers of armor, eaten and burned, did little to stop a Berserker with enough power to punch through metal.

Paganini kicked Nikolai again, and again, and again. &quot;This isn&#39;t the way! You should rage against their treatment, and seek freedom. When I&#39;ve finally ripped myself free of their damning voices and chains...&quot; Paganini cackled wildly. &quot;I can play music again, without care. Without needing to be worried about turning into a <strong>fucking</strong> monster.&quot;

A ferocious kick sent Nikolai flying further down the ditch. Paganini followed, absentmindedly strumming his violin. &quot;<strong>Me and my music, together again.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Angra Mainyu is gone. He is <strong>gone</strong>, old sport. Buried under miles upon miles of ocean. He will never come back. He will not!

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">You know that is not the case.</code>

Words flickered in front of Gatsby&#39;s eyes. He heard the clickclack of a typewriter reverberating through his skull. He swallowed. &quot;What?&quot;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">It exists. That is your purpose. To excise The Grail Mud from the world. An embodiment of good and virtue to counteract evil and sin.</code>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Daisy would weep to see such a world.</code>

&quot;<strong>I see.</strong>&quot; Gatsby didn&#39;t bother to question the words appearing before him. He was made of the things. It was probably just his conscious talking to him. Meanwhile, Zahhak was celebrating his god&#39;s grand return.

Gatz&#39;s eyes met Zahhak&#39;s. 

He followed them to the glass.

Gatsby took off towards the shattered glass. There was no time to think. The glass was shattered and broken, yet Gatsby could see his reflection in the various pieces littering the floor.

Wait, his <strong>reflection?</strong> Gatsby&#39;s Mystic Eyes instinctively activated for a reason the Servant didn&#39;t understand. He looked upon himself.

■■■■■■■■?

■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■

Gatsby fell to the ground, screaming. Words danced around him, threatening to rip themselves apart. The Eyes of God do not permit contradiction, not within their own novel, not even for the titular character. Gatsby wheezed as he faintly saw Zahhak sprinting towards him.

<strong>RADTATATATATATATATATAT!</strong> Bullets sprayed towards Zahhak from Gatsby&#39;s machine gun. Windows shattered, and the piano made funny noises as bullets pierced its casing.

Every single still-functioning nerve cried out in agony as Nikolai stumbled backward. A few more kicks from Paganini only made it worse, as the humongous man was reminded of the hierarchy of power. 

Among Men, Nikolai. Among Servants, Berserker. To vie for a higher position meant death and destruction.

As the black blood burned both his nostrils and the ragged armor, Nikolai pushed down the rage even harder. The pain was real. Anger was less real. 

And so was the world, as it spun around and around. A final kick had sent him down. Further along, into the trough. 

“<strong>Who. Cares. Alexandria. Think?!</strong>” He spat at Berserker. 

“<strong>Don’t. Know. Anything!</strong>”

Once more, Nikolai rose from the ground. The water crept up fast. Sooner, rather than later, they’d be submerged again. If this guy got a hold of him then, he’d surely perish. Everything he’d done in his wretched life would be for naught.

“<strong>Already. Monster,</strong>” he motioned to Berserker. “<strong>Monster. Hurt. No. Care. Nikolai. Hurt. For. Reason!</strong>”

What was the reason again? To see someone… someone important. A girl. A family member. That meant sister. <em>His</em> sister. Sapphire. That was her name! He needed to find Sapphire! How could he forget something that important?

“<strong>Resist. Anger.Resist. Fate!</strong>”

Nikolai rushed to meet the Berserker head-on, again. There was little rhyme or reason to the continued assault, but perhaps there didn’t need to be one. 

As the Servant prepared another blow, the other man aimed for his hands. He could eat knuckles, but that instrument would bludgeon him to death if he didn’t try to take it now. Touch claws aimed for tendons and connecting muscles.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A spray of hundreds of dozens of bullets peppered the dragon, most of them bouncing off the bone plating of his skin. A few, however, managed to find purchase, hitting soft spots of the flesh or sneaking through holes broken through his natural armour. 

<strong>--ATATATATATATATATATATATATA--</strong>

But it was a minor tax. After all, if heroes with great mythical swords struggled to slay dragons, what hope did a little lead have? It hurt, most assuredly it did, but Lancer was far beyond suffering such minor pains.

<strong>--ATATATATATATATATATATATATA--</strong>

Zahhak took a few lumbering steps towards the shattered window, grabbing a particularly malicious-looking shard of glass, one with a sharp point and jagged edge. As he picked it up it, he caught a glimpse of his reflection. He saw burning flames, black smoke, a world asunder, and among it all, a towering dragon. He smiled.

<strong>--ATATATATATATATATATATATA-- CRACK!</strong>

<em><strong>STOMP!</strong></em> Lancer sprinted forth, and with all of his weight, came crashing down upon Gatsby&#39;s gun, smashing it into the ground and rendering it little more than a pile of scrap.

How could you?&quot; Paganini responded in clear disappointment. He looked at Nikolai as if he were an untalented pianist who blamed the instrument. &quot;<strong>You are no Heroic Spirit.</strong> I expected too much from a wild dog.&quot;

Yet this wild dog was extremely resistant. Paganini had taken little noteworthy damage. His Spirit Core was still intact, and barring his scuffed up face and a few claw marks, he felt good. Nikolai was another story. He was burned, broken, battered. However, there was one begrudging thing about him that Paganini despised, yet respected.

<strong>He would not stay down.</strong> Logic would dictate that Nikolai would have collapsed in a heap. Yet he got up, again and again. Paganini, too, had gotten up again and again as people despised him. When he erupted into rage, and thought he couldn&#39;t face the crowd, he still stepped out and gave a show.

<em>No, that is not me. That was before...</em>

Nikolai lunged at Paganini in a last ditch attempt to bring the Berserker down. However, Nikolai had exercised a single piece of critical thinking. Why go for the musician when you can simply take away his primary instrument?

Nikolai&#39;s strike cleaved through the tendons on Paganini&#39;s upper arms, causing both to go limp. Il Cannone Guarnerius dropped with a crash.

&quot;<strong>YOU...!!!</strong>&quot; Paganini howled. &quot;<strong>HOW DARE YOU SEVER ME FROM MY LIFE!</strong>&quot; Paganini raged as his arms hung lifelessly. This was not the end. It was <em>not</em>. He was a virtuoso. He was an instrument. His tendons were the strings that made this instrument produce song.

So he would play, no matter what.

Despite the damage to his arms, they moved, tendons vibrating as if plucked by an invisible hand.

They reached for the violin...

It was obvious, in his defense. The musician going for his instrument, as predictable as a fight between Man and Servant. Right before Berserker could reclaim his instrument, it was sent <em>flying</em>. Behind Nikolai. Further out of reach.

“<strong>Sad. Life. Then.</strong>”

With this declaration, Nikolai once again pulled his arm back. As far back as his body could physically stretch. Even if Berserker struck now, it would be too late. Nikolai grew <em>larger</em>. Bigger than normal, bigger than abnormal. If a Magi were around, they’d feel the intake and consumption of Mana.

“<strong>GGRRRRRRRWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO–</strong>” he roared. On par with a proper Berserker, much like the one he faced.

Then, it came back. His fist <em>crashed</em> into Paganini’s face. It would not kill. No, not even come close. At worst, there would be a sore head and whiplash akin to a freak car accident. A Servant was still thus, and Nikolai was still an above-average man.

But it felt damn good, and damn satisfying, to watch his knuckles sink into the face of his foe. Feel the crunch of bones beneath his own. That punch drove almost even drove the rage from his own head. 

Almost.

As soon as he followed through, a head-splitting pain wedged itself cleanly through the middle of his skull. Nikolai fell to his knee, hands clutched against his forehead. Too much. Far too much strength. His body was not made to expend Mana on such a level. He was an engine; meant for steady consumption and proper care.

He had shot pure nitro through his engine block.

Slowly, Nikolai rose back to his feet. Vision blurred, he scanned his surroundings. A familiar place, surely. 

How had he gotten here again? And that other one… they’d been fighting, right? He looked <em>pissed</em>. And Strong. A Servant, no doubt. Yea, they’d been fighting. Nikolai… just decked him. Yea, that made sense. Alright, he remembered now. 

This… was bad. He needed to talk with Raphael. And Three. Time was running out <em>fast</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIbsSIEpPW8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIbsSIEpPW8</a>

A bright light erupted from Gatsby, blinding Zahhak. He hadn&#39;t seen a light as bright since his last glimpse of the sun since being sealed. The Great American Novel was a tool of literature, and with it, Gatsby had ascended into the role of a &#39;main character&#39;, here and now.

&quot;<strong>I am a Heroic Spirit of prosperity, for a better life for all people. Both in fiction, and in life, I represent hope for a better life.</strong>&quot;

<em>Click.</em> The pages of the Great American Novel merged themselves into a copy of The Great Gatsby.

&quot;And tell me, Zahhak.&quot;

&quot;<strong>What better ending to a story is there than the hero of the story slaying the dragon?</strong>&quot;

An onslaught of pages erupted from the book, and flung themselves at Zahhak. Honed to a razorsharp edge, they cleaved through Zahhak&#39;s armor like it was nothing. How was this possible? Gatsby wasn&#39;t even close to Zahhak&#39;s level!

Yet the strikes struck home all the same.

Il Cannone Guarnerius... He had to get it back.

&quot;My violin... that was a gift. <strong>GIVE IT BACK, GIVE IT BACK!</strong>&quot; Paganini wailed helplessly like a child as Nikolai went through a mental episode. Not that Paganini was in a position to judge him.

Angra Mainyu had whispered in his ear, altered his perspective, and turned him into a genuine monster. Yet corruption could not alter one&#39;s fundamental beliefs. It only brought what <em>was</em> and what <em>could be</em> to the surface.

Before, Paganini had loved his audiences, and strove to win their approval, all while despising them. Now, Paganini hated and raged against the audience, wanting to play for only himself.

Pages fluttered down from the sky from Gatsby&#39;s Noble Phantasm&#39;s activation. On them, instead of words, were musical compositions. Despite the destruction of his arms, he reached out and grabbed one.

&quot;<strong>Ah, Carmagnola con Variazioni. Nothing more than a handful of variations. One of my first.</strong>&quot; Paganini cradled it close to his chest. &quot;<strong>As perfect as the day you were finished. Before I was famous, you were there by my side. Nothing more than a dabble.</strong>&quot;

Tears began to fall as Niccol&#242; Paganini cried into it.

&quot;<strong>Where did all that time go?</strong>&quot;

Slowly, other compositions penned by Paganini fell from the Great American Novel, and surrounded Paganini like confetti. Slowly but surely, the corruption by Zahhak was excised.

Then, the pages floated away in the wind. Paganini reached after Carmagnola con Variazioni, yet it slipped from his grasp, before dissolving into light.

Gatsby was a symbol of hope, representing the ordinary person&#39;s chance at excellence. In stories, the hero always prevailed over the monster. The main character always triumphed.

The Great American Novel and Zahhak&#39;s own nature as a &quot;villain&quot; had sealed his fate from the moment this battle began, once Gatsby realized the raw potential at his fingertips.

&quot;It&#39;s over, Zahhak.&quot; Gatsby&#39;s eyes glowed a bright blue as he looked over Zahhak. Normally, his eyes would strip away the falsehoods of one&#39;s existence: their proverbial lies. However, Zahhak stayed as he was. He didn&#39;t revert to a normal human, or fade into ash, like Paganini at the Tower of Babel.

No, Zahhak stayed because this was his true form. This was what Zahhak was, a dragon that spewed bile no matter what he did.

If Gatsby were to create an &quot;ideal&quot; Zahhak using the Great American Novel, something terrible were to emerge. Such a Servant was beyond salvation. Yet could Gatsby actually pull the trigger?

He approahced Zahhak slowly, before the pages morphed into a typewriter machine gun. He raised the gun to Zahhak&#39;s forehead as he scampered away.

Yet he hesitated for one moment.

Paganini seemed to be ‘normal’. Ish. Whatever the hell that meant for a Berserker. Even with the pressure behind his eyes, Nikolai felt no need to continue his assault.

Or, at least he could pretend that was the reason. In good faith, this brawl would never come out in his favor. He needed Zahhak to, put it bluntly, <strong>fucking do something</strong>. Since the Berserker himself had not dissolved into nothingness like his beloved works of music, then the Master still lived.

And how the hell did a scrawny brat like the blond survive an onslaught from Lancer?!

Beyond that, already did the water from the canals pour back. It reached halfway up his shins, and showed no signs to stop. Predictable, but still not what he wanted. 

So, Nikolai approached the wall of the canal. “<strong>Not. Finished. Servant.</strong>”

There would be revenge, it would be soon, and it would be <em>sweet</em>. These clowns had interrupted something rather important. He couldn’t remember it at the moment, but it would surely come back to him after these two were dissposed. Surely. 

“<strong>ZAHHAK!</strong>” Nikolai called as he crawled over the lip of the wall. “<strong>WHAT. DOING?!</strong>”

Slowly, he hobbled over to where he had dropped his shield and gloves. A breather was in order, and his hands felt hot. Surely the people had seen them, and there would be mentions of <em>something</em> in the masses. The less they had to discuss, the better.

“<strong>Finish. Master!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His legs would carry him no further. It seemed that this story was persistent on seeing itself to the conclusion, intent on allowing the climax to play out. Thus, his sprint slowed to a stagger, his stagger slowed to a crawl, and finally, his body collapsed into a heap on the ground.

<strong>”Nnnnnnn… Damn it… Damn it…!”</strong>

Hate.

Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate.

Zahhak hated James Gatsby. He hated him with every foot, inch, millimetre of his being. Every nerve in his body burned with indignation, every one of them a fiery river of rage spreading the burning warmth of hate through his body. His emerald eyes started up at Gatsby, a channel through which his boundless hate was made known. Every fibre of his being, every cell of it, every mote of magical energy, every scrap of steel, all of it was a factory, a factory of pure, unrelenting hate.

“Great” Gatsby. What was so great about him? This conman, this fraud, this liar, this cheat, he presumed himself so Great? So Great that he allowed himself to don the mantle of dragonslayer, this reject born of the modern day? A commoner, who presumed to overthrow the great dragon king? Was destiny so cruel that it was intent on making him play out the same sorrow over and over again? Disgusting. DISGUSTING! 

Zahhak searched the man’s eyes for suitable contempt, but he only found pity. Pity for a king. Pity for a God. Pity from this glorified beggar.

HATE. HATE. HATE!

Alas, there was nothing left to be done except to face the death that awaited him. As the barrel of The Great American Novel pressed against his head, Zahhak closed his eyes, waiting for the bullet that would damn his life, and put an end to his wish.

But it never came.

Gatsby hesitated.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045673257644347442 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045673257644347442><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Nov-22 10:12 PM">22:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWRBkMLOmhA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWRBkMLOmhA</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr2YbOLDag96b7EFdj1gWQQ><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Batistuta.rwm</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWRBkMLOmhA"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Dead Space 2 Soundtrack - Start Spreading The Limbs</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWRBkMLOmhA width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045673289252614255 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045673289252614255><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Nov-22 10:12 PM">22:12</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>ZAHHAK!

...Yes, now would be the time for that, wouldn&#39;t it? After all, Gatsby had just <em>hesitated</em>, and the only reason he would do that was if he <em>lacked conviction</em>, and if one lacked conviction, then they <em>could not be a hero</em>. And if he wasn&#39;t a hero, then that meant it was not his destiny to kill Zahhak.

No, much the opposite. Gatsby&#39;s role in this story would be the tragic hero, who bit off more than he could chew, and died pointlessly.

Slowly, an arm stretched out, pressing against Gatsby&#39;s chest. Then, slowly, the dragon spoke, the words coming out of his mouth barely more than a whisper, a murmur under his breath...
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-diff">-AZHI DAHAKA.</code>
<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

What followed was a blur. Everything all around them was consumed with a blistering light that burned with darkness. The eyes screamed in pain at such a sight. The ears were filled with a sound so deafening that it rang in their ears long after it stopped. The taste of sulphur filled the air.

As the assault of phenomena faded away, Gatsby would open his eyes to find a gaping hole torn into his chest, a massive puncture in the centre of his being. Yet, as he looked it at it, he found it seemed to keep growing wider and wider, more and more of his insides falling out as his flesh disappeared from his body.

And as he looked up, he would see dark skies filled with smoke and ash, the burning remnants of the Republic Embassy. And amid this madness, standing tall over it all, he would witness the cause of this destruction.

He laid eyes upon the end of the world.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No, not his Saint Graph or Spirit Origin, but a chunk of rage that had been ingrained in him for so long that he never recognized the source.

He reached out for the source, the violin. Yet it too slipped through his fingers. Perhaps this was an act of fate to prevent him from squandering this new chance. The madness, the rage...

Gatsby was flung back as much of the Republic Embassy was atomized by the release of a high caliber Noble Phantasm that could rend the world asunder. It was already doing that. First, this building. Then, Alexandria. Then, the world.

Then, Gatsby himself.

&quot;<strong>Guh.</strong>&quot; An entire dictionary&#39;s worth of words and blood erupted from Gatsby&#39;s mouth as Zahhak&#39;s talents as an Authority of destruction and annihilation took root at the center of Gatsby&#39;s being.

Blast it, he was falling apart. An ensemble of words and emotions spilled from his wound. This wasn&#39;t possible. Zahhak shouldn&#39;t have this kind of power.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Recovering Chapter 1 - Success.</code>

He couldn&#39;t recover from this. He had to destroy Zahhak this time. No, not Zahhak, Azhi Dahaka.  Gatsby looked up at the towering dragon, and blinked as his eyes glowed.

&quot;Aye, that&#39;s you. That&#39;s always been you.&quot; Gatsby choked out. &quot;Wait, no. No matter what, you are Zahhak. Your Saint Graph is Zahhak. Your <strong>True Name</strong> is Zahhak. That will never change, even with a Noble Phantasm such as this.&quot;

No, he couldn&#39;t die here. He had people to protect.

&quot;<strong>You were not a complete evil dragon before, were you?</strong>&quot; Gatsby whispered into the wind. &quot;Yet tell me, how do all stories end, even ones as old as yours? <strong>When the hero is backed into a corner, that is when he showed his trumph card.</strong>&quot;

The pages manifested into a curved blade, clicking like a typewriter. &quot;<strong>Would you like to test a narrative trope that has been imprinted in reality and fiction alike since you were man, beast?</strong>&quot;

Gatsby tested the blade&#39;s grip. He would not miss this time. If Zahhak did not back down, then Zahhak would die, even if Gatsby went with him.

Or worse. It was hard to say.

What Nikolai did know, however, was that this fight was a fool&#39;s errand. They did not make the trek here to trade blows and die with a pair of clowns; high on life and with little to lose. 

“<strong>Zahhak,</strong>” Nikolai roared once again. “<strong>Not. Worth! Back. Off. Now!</strong>”

A tactical retreat was in order. They could always come back later, when this one scampered off to lick his wounds. Zahhak would have a chance to do the same, and come back much stronger. For him to die here… Nikolai would kill him first for having the gall.

The man hastened his pace, back to where he had left his shield. It looked unscathed as he picked up and donned the black rectangle. Felt the same. Probably the same.
