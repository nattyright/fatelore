It was only natural that those few who fought for it would recieve the best its resources could provide. A private, upscale room for its latest patient, a couple guards nearby and all the food and entertainment the city could send one particular citizen. One they not so politely volunteered but still one brave enough to stand against the same odds as its first master and miraculously come out with a victory. There were too many flowers, even for the little Miss Green Thumb, crowding every spare corner of the room that the smell was cloying and perfume-like rather than the floral hints she preferred best. 

She was beyond humbled by the sheer generosity and adoration she received. But after a couple days, the whole thing was starting to get stale and annoying. Worse yet, the doctors said she still had a day or two to go before they&#39;d even consider loosing security enough for her to slip out. Her chest still ached with every breath she took, somethings magecraft and modern medicine still took time to heal properly. Still if Mom and Dr. Toulouse were around, they could perform a real miracle on her and get her going the next day. That was wishful thinking though, they were so many miles away and for once, she came to miss the two of them and a few of the rules they put on her.

Still she wasn&#39;t entirely without them. Uncle Benji looked incredibly tired and beaten down when she first woke up from surgery. Apparently Blanche had given him hell for even letting her consider entering the grail war in the first place and especially for going against an armed mercenary. Amelia got a similar tirade the second she could properly stay awake and speak regularly but she knew that was how Mom showed she cared. There was no fiercer advocate for her than the one who risked it all to begin with to give her a shot at a normal life.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039935984617406555 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039935984617406555><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Nov-22 02:14 AM">02:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>At the place of honor at her night stand rested a bouquet of morning glories, a note written in the Caster of Toulouse&#39;s immaculate penmanship that resembled a monk&#39;s illustrated manuscript. It was a simple note but his brief praises and wishes were worth more than the rest of the flowers in the place combined. 

Uncle Benji, despite his crushing workload that seemed to swamp him down with all the panicked demand among Alexandrians for mystic codes to defend themselves against the percieved threat of Republic goons, managed to stick by Amelia for all the time she was in the hospital. Though he still commandeered a supply closet for some of his work he didn&#39;t trust to his apprentice. Right now, he was reading an issue of the Alexandria Times and Amelia couldn&#39;t help but lean over and spy what one of the articles said. 

<strong>Breaking News: ALEXANDRIA SCORES SURPRISE VICTORY IN GRAIL WAR, WIND AND LIGHTING TRUMP STEEL AND FIRE</strong>

She had a smirk at that headline, better the people think that than Hannibal doing the majority of the work while Mikhail mysteriously let her live. Survival was all she could manage against that monster. She knew he burned himself out by the end and got sent to a hospital as well but he truly defied belief on what a human could survive. She hated to be bleak but it was true, she was lucky and nothing else. 

The article went on to mention a brief summary of the fight with plenty of praise for Hannibal and herself and a brief biography of the new victor though that started and ended with her time with the Calloway family, be it Blanche or Benji. Good, at least they didn’t mention anything about the city of her birth</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1039936068155347014 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1039936068155347014><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Nov-22 02:14 AM">02:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It did make her think, however, of those left behind on that secret city of ambition and knowledge. She had never given them much thought in the past year or so, distracted as she had been with the allure of servants between Delphi and Alexandria. How were her siblings doing without her to lift their spirits and come to their defense. They were all born as experiments, just like her, meant to be tested and exploited for the advancement of the human race. None knew the people that gave life to them so they made a family for themselves and now they were separated, for what, seven years now? 

Amelia now had a power they all had dreamed about and she was not fighting for her siblings but as a representative for a city far away from them. And the wish she set out for this war? She had never given it much thought other than perhaps gaining some cool treasures or knowledge from the city but perhaps that wasn’t good enough. If she was going to put her body through this kind of abuse at least one more time, simple greed wasn’t going to cut it. Perhaps it was time for a new wish…

And with that, her mind drifted back to the end of the fight she had just been through, why had Mikhail stopped, why did his blind rage suddenly subside at the sight of what he had started and could easily begin? Amelia certainly didn’t think of herself as a child but she saw the images of how she looked at the end, battered and nearly broken, the gleam gone from her eyes, the curls in her hair slackening. It really was a pitiful sight. Was it possible such a notorious killer such as her opponent still had remorse? Anything was possible but she doubted she would ever find out.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That is what they earned for Alexandria. Both of them paid heavily for it. Some more than the other, seeing how Rider has completely recovered while Amelia was still bedridden. Servants, huh?

Despite all of that, she could&#39;ve done better. She knew this. She was <em>still</em> hesitant. If she wasn&#39;t, then maybe...

Her gaze drifts towards her Master in bed. Rarely has Rider been seen leaving the chair next to her. To think this girl was foolish enough to dive into combat like that with such a condition. Curiosity began to stir inside of her. Guilt tinged through her whenever her eyes fell over the various recovering wounds she still had. Just who was this girl? 

It wasn&#39;t long before Rider noticed that she was staring probably longer than she should have. With a shake of her head, she hoped to regain some kind of composure. 

Luckily, the smirk caught her eye once she saw her lean over to spy on the article. She couldn&#39;t see herself but she had a pretty good idea on what it could be about. &quot;Another fan letter, Master?&quot; Rider finished with a smirk on her own.  &quot;I wonder just how many fans you gained overnight. I know all the florists of Alexandria definitely are fans of you at this point.&quot; It didn&#39;t take much for Rider to reach out and flick one of the many flowers in the room.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Honestly Manco didn&#39;t wanted to be here at all, while he had given them the victory and he refused to recognize it as a lost the reality not only Rider and her master knew but also all of the spectators was that he had lost. Is not like he regret his choice, he went along with his word and breaking his own worth would bring even more shame and even more his master seemed to agree so there was no issue. 

Except that one judged someone as one truly is, if the situation were reversed he wouldn&#39;t doubt of making fun of Rider and her master for making such decision so he was well aware that he needed to prepare himself for that.  That is how he saw the world, praises and gifts for the victor while shame and curses for the loser. He was really suprised that his master wanted to do face to face but he already knew that despite his reputation as a killer his master had a soft spot for kids. Something he shared to the point that he would had probably stopped his master either way had he not regain reason. 

&quot;Don&#39;t get restless I come in peace. Me and my master have something from you.&quot; he said as he showed the pair a bottle.

While broken ribs are a serious injury, thanks to his magic crest he is resilient enough to more or less ignore it for some time. The doctors tried to insist on Mikail getting at least some treatment, but they weren&#39;t persistent enough and were easily convinced by him that he could handle it himself, not caring whether some Republican goon will have health problems due to lack of professional help.

It was evening of the next day after the tournament round. By this point Manco brewed another healing potion, but instead of immediately using it on himself Mikail decided to give it to Amelia as an apology for almost killing her and causing so much pain.

And there he was, at the entrance to the other pair&#39;s room. While he was still an intimidating presence, without the guns and all the ammo pouches Mikail looked smaller than he was at the arena. But he still had the audacity to still have the gas mask on despite the broken ribs making breathing painful. The gas mask hid his face and caused it to be impossible to see the impression on his face, making it seem like he didn&#39;t feel pain. And there were no bandages at all on his body, also creating an illusion that the battle didn&#39;t even hurt him.

&quot;Amelia, are you alright? When i punched you it felt different from breaking bones of regular people. It was like your bones turned into dust the moment my fists reached you. I&#39;m almost worried. No, i think i&#39;m actually worried right now. I don&#39;t even remember the last time i was worried about someone.&quot;

Mikail then grabbed the potion out of Caster&#39;s hands and proceeded to approach Amelia.

&quot;Manco, what are you saying? It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re trying to piss of Rider.&quot;
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040307267603546293 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040307267603546293><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Nov-22 02:49 AM">02:49</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As he walked forward, it looked like the guards wanted to stop him yet hesitated. There was no big reason to stop him, seeing that if he wanted to kill Amelia he would&#39;ve just done that at the arena, all the rumors about him still evoked a negative reaction.

&quot;I know that you have a lot of questions right now. You&#39;re probably especially confused about why i didn&#39;t kill you. There is something that the rumors about me ignore. Everyone i killed in this city were criminals, and it was always done for money. I had a reason and an excuse, even if that excuse is quite hypocritical. But here it&#39;s different. I do not really have wish in this grail war, and you are a relatively innocent person. I&#39;m still not desensitized enough to just kill someone innocent for no reason.&quot;

He then moved his arm, moving the potion closer to Amelia. 

&quot;Manco&#39;s healing potion. The same one that you tried to borrow from me and i destroyed afterwards. He made another one. Since you already had a surgery and your bones are no longer dust, it will only take about a minute for it to fix your bones... Do you need help drinking the potion? You can ask Rider or the doctors to help you if you still don&#39;t trust me.&quot;

After that Mikail turned his head away to look at Hannibal.

&quot;Oh, and Rider. Don&#39;t worry, Amelia&#39;s words were fulfilled, i wasn&#39;t left unharmed. I&#39;m just good at hiding pain i guess.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040307412537725078 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040307412537725078><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Nov-22 02:50 AM">02:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, a lab rat like her was long used to such things and if anything she kinda liked it. Compared to the cold, analytical gaze of cameras and researchers or the bewildered stares of regular citizens noticing her irregularities, there was something warm and well-meaning about Hannibal&#39;s look. In some ways, it was the same look Blanche and Dr. Toulouse had first given her when they escaped that city. Maybe this would be the perfect time to tell her the truth, Uncle Benji certainly didn&#39;t mind. 

Her ruby-red eyes rolled away from the newspaper and locked with Hannibal&#39;s single exposed eye and a gentle smile reassured the servant. 

&quot;I guess so, Rider... though I&#39;ll certainly take an article in the city&#39;s biggest journal over another basket of flowers,&quot; she joked back before continuing on a more serious note. &quot;I think they&#39;re just happy they&#39;ve still got a chance going forward. Wasn&#39;t really my choice for that fight. I was really hoping I didn&#39;t actually have to fight, sorry if I sound a bit selfish...&quot;

She paused for a moment, glancing away from Rider. She wasn&#39;t afraid to tell Rider about herself or her past but it was a big leap of trust to do so. For as talkative and outgoing as she could be, <em>that</em> was one thing she shared with no-one. The past was the past, right? It should stay there. Yet if that fight proved anything, it tended to come back even if one did their best to run away from it. She took a deep breath, her chest aching still from the injury. Hannibal could see determination but also some degree of vulnerability settling over her face as she moved to speak.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040672917643595868 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040672917643595868><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Nov-22 03:02 AM">03:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yet Rider would have to wait as two new people or rather two old opponents stepped into the room, bearing gifts and smiles as if the brutal battle had never happened. On either it was impossible to tell if it had taken any toll on them at all. Though perhaps it did and it was expressed through their words. The girl in bed sighed and pivoted in bed to face the newcomers, making an effort to sit up and show them  her own strength.

&quot;Thanks? I&#39;m glad you delivered on your promise,&quot; Amelia said, questioning her own words. Manco and Mikhail were intimidating opponents and yet oddly friendly people. She had fully thought the whole thing from before was just to mitigate the hate from the audience but they were really here and really friendly. She couldn&#39;t help but notice the hair raise on the back of her neck, that couldn&#39;t be helped especially with her mind drifting back to those days of her past. Those people acted kind too but had their own motives for that and their other actions stained any acts of kindness.

&quot;I&#39;m doing alright, Mikhail. Thank you for the concern. I didn&#39;t expect you to come here but the help is appreciated,&quot; Hannibal would notice Amelia&#39;s speech become more formal and her body tense in the presence of their former opponent. Amelia did not frown or make any kind of negative response, instead keeping herself as polite as possible.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040673062653272104 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040673062653272104><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Nov-22 03:03 AM">03:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;That&#39;s very thoughtful. Its good to see that there is a man underneath the rumors and one who wishes to care so much about the innocent. You do have a cruel line of work however and it is not one I can agree with pursuing. Freedom is the idea I value most and life is the most essential of freedoms. You take that from people, even if they deserve punishment,&quot; she nodded, controlling any emotions she may be feeling for the moment, a form of conditioning governing her actions even if the words she spoke were the truth of how she felt.

 &quot; I am thankful you did not take my life and value the innocent but I saw that state you reach in anger. Is it not a matter of time until you take the life of someone you see as innocent, unable to control your own actions? What will you do then? I can not control your life but I honestly wish you find a different path to take,&quot; She waved Mikhail&#39;s hand away as she slid off the bed and onto her own two feet, taking the potion for herself even as she saw lights dance in her eyes. It had been the first time she stood in several days  but she needed to demonstrate her own resilience and will here.

&quot;I thank you once again for coming her and making my recovery easier. That is indeed very kind but I honestly hope you choose a different profession  and find some peace for yourself. It&#39;s never too late to turn around.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps some of her curiosity would be sated by whatever was going to come out of her mouth. However, whatever mystery was going to be unveiled was ruined by the entrance of their opponents making a surprise visit.

&quot;You got a death wish or something, Caster?!&quot; Rider erupted forth as she stared daggers at Manco after his brazen comment. Even if she leapt off her chair to defend Amelia, it seems these two were truly on a peaceful mission and not one to assassinate Alexandria&#39;s newfound source of morale, or so the headlines call them. 

This just made her more suspicious of them. Although, it would be rather low of them to attack a hospital during an event like this so perhaps they were telling truth. Just to be safe though, small sparks arced around her hand. A small warning, if her glare wasn&#39;t already one, of course.

&quot;It&#39;s fine. You didn&#39;t leave the arena unscathed so there&#39;s no reason for me to try and snuff out your life. However...&quot; The fact she left them hanging on what she could meant gave her just enough time to slug Mikail over the head. The temper on this one! &quot;That&#39;s for shooting Surus, you bastard!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1040951594465906788 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1040951594465906788><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Nov-22 09:30 PM">21:30</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Large Seel#7550">@Large Seel</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seems you&#39;re familiar with a lot of deceitful people. I will say this now, i am not here with an ulterior motive.&quot;

&quot;I do not pursue this. And &#39;never too late to turn around&#39;? You do not know how the criminal world works. Once you&#39;re in, the only way out is death. But i did not choose this willingly either. I simply had to...&quot; Mikail suddenly became quiet. It seemed that he hesitated about what he wanted to say next.

&quot;And about freedom. I was a leader of a rebellion movement on one nomad city once. I lost control of myself and was filled with hatred for the upper class there. The rebels shared this idea. Eventually, after almost every aristocrat in the city was killed, the rebellion succeeded. At a very big cost. It blew over and the only thing left there was an unstable anarchic mess. Then something happened that made me need to escape. So i illegally escaped it on a ship, with my destination ending up here. And in combination with my previous gunsmithing experience, this escape made being a criminal the only path my life could take. So ironically, my path for freedom took away my freedom.&quot; There was a barely noticeable hint of sadness and regret in his voice, which took a lot of effort to suppress. 

But before it got out of his control, he instinctively cast potential energy reinforcement and quickly moved to the side. It was because of Hannibal&#39;s fist approaching his head, whose words had gone completely unnoticed by him while he answered to Amelia. He mostly avoided Rider&#39;s attack, but it ended up cracking one lens of his gas mask.

How many more fucking times will i have to repair my gas mask? And it&#39;s not my fault that elephants are humongous creatures. I was shooting at you and Amelia while using an automatic weapon most of the time, of course some stray bullets hit your big friend. Like what was i supposed to do, sit around and do nothing? If you don&#39;t want people hurting Surus, maybe you should just not send him to combat. And what am i saying? He wasn&#39;t even hurt by the bullets, Manco did most of the work there.&quot; Despite what he was saying, they could understand from his body language that he felt relieved by this opportunity to change the topic. Then he spent several seconds checking the amount of damage on the gas mask with his hands before he started talking again.

&quot;Amelia, i&#39;m not only here to help you recover, i also have some advice. You have a very good ability, but you&#39;re not using it creatively enough. Your wind was quite strong from what i could tell. Did you think of throwing razor blades at the enemy and controlling them with the wind like a swarm of bees? You could also shoot a bow or throw a knife and make the projectile home in at the enemy. And don&#39;t be afraid to fly around everywhere. Send yourself into the air frequently and be unpredictable, good positioning and fast movement are key to winning battles. You like freedom, so try out different things - you don&#39;t have to do specifically what i suggest. And also please don&#39;t get onto the elephant both at the same time, it prevents some sort of teleportation ability of Rider from what i saw from rewatching the battle.&quot;

Then Mikail started going away and grabbed Manco by the arm. &quot;Let&#39;s go. I heard there was another restaurant you wanted to try?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041053538618458192 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041053538618458192><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Nov-22 04:15 AM">04:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan, Nubby&#39;s Ghost Writer</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But why the anger? Those words are nothing but my greatest praise for you. As there is no one who can measure up to her, so seeing a bit of her in you is my way of recognizing you.&quot;  

There was no lie in Manco&#39;s words, as even when giving praise the action was more akin to just stated a fact. It was his own brand of egoism, actions nor consequences really matter as long as he remained faithful to his own code. Still Rider anger was something he sort of enjoyed, compared to the A-Qing or the fox brat she was someone he could see as a sort of equal but this was hardly the time for a conversation. As sparks appeared around her hand the old king answer in kind with golden embers around his arm. Sure they had come in peace and was not such a sore loser he would act on his opponents before they were ready but it was a king&#39;s way to answer in kind. 

That is until she took a more serious approach aiming to pay back Mikail smashing his master mask and leading to his quite fair complains. Yet instead of this put him on guard it only make Manco laugh. She was correct after all a debt must be paid. 

&quot;Well that goes for both sides I will be sure to pay you back for what you did to my familiar Hannibal&quot; he made sure to let her know he had puzzle her name before turning to Amelia after Mikail finished saying his piece. 

&quot;Young lady, while I don&#39;t fully understand what you did to get Hannibal into such state at the end I want to warn you about it. While it may be a powerful weapon it may also hasten her demise if not used correctly. While I wont make excuses, part of why I surrender is because If I wanted to beat her I knew I would need to completely crush her till nothing remain. I really wouldn&#39;t mind if it came to that  a fight is kill or be killer after all. But I refuse to kill or be killed someone who is not oneself that is all&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;But that is all, hopefully we will meet again under better circumstances I am looking forward to what you two may achieve in the future&quot; 

As he was being pulled by Mikail the king gave  them a last curious look before smiling as they left. A desire to meet the rest of the contestants began to blossom in Manco his curiosity sparked in a weird way. 

&quot;Oh? Well There are many actually but I guess we can start with this one who seemed to had a nice chicken soup&quot; 

The pair would leave Amelia and Hannibal on their own, the issues resolved for both parties could go on with their business and objectives. Regardless the truth remained Alexandria had tied the score the whole tournament had taken a new and more chaotic turn no one would be able to guess and Manco was excited to see it unfold.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
