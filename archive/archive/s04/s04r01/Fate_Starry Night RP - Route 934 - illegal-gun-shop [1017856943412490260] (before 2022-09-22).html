He was dressed in military uniform and had his guns and ammo on him despite the casual enviroment, but he did not have a gas mask hiding his clean shaven face and short blonde hair - not hiding your face is already casual enough, he thought. 

Then suddenly, he quickly stood up from his armchair and determinedly headed towards his old, almost oversized wardrobe. There was a servant frame within it which Mikail bought less than a week ago using his gun money, hidden behind all the clothes and placed so carelessly, that it was to the point it looked like it was about to fall. He carefully picked it up and slowly carried it to his gun workshop, barely avoiding walls of his cramped apartment. It was placed onto the already prepared summoning circle on the floor, surrounded by different machinery and and many different unfinished guns. For the next ten minutes the man stood here and looked at the frame, thinking about of all his past choices that led to this point, wanting to simply turn back and leave while still knowing that it&#39;s far too late for such actions.

&quot;I am ready for this.&quot; Mikail assured himself.

He walked to the corner of the room, picked up a small, dusty notebook and opened it, rapidly scanning the words which were written. It was a servant summoning chant, not necessary, yet important. After spending some time memorizing the incantation, he started cleaning up the room, moving objects that might get in the way away from the circle and mopping the floor to get rid of dust. Eventually the gun workshop was clean - the floor was shiny and suddenly there was way more space to move around in then before.

&quot;This is when it starts.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018567921942937770 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018567921942937770><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Sep-22 03:05 AM">03:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Mikail puts on his gas mask, picks up a combat knife and approaches the summoning circle. A cut is made across his hand as he clenches his arm into a fist and lets blood flow onto the circle. Then a chant is started.
&quot;Let fire and flames be the essence. Let lead and steel be the foundation. Let rise a wall against the wind that shall fall. Let the four cardinal gates close. Let the three-forked road from the crown reaching unto the Kingdom rotate.&quot;

&quot;I hereby declare, you shall forever be my ally. My strength shall be your sword, your experience shall be my knowledge, together we shall know no fear. If you hear this will and this reason, then answer.&quot;

The summoning circle was turning exponentially brighter, drowning the workshop in blinding light.

&quot;An oath shall be sworn here! We shall overcome all troubles! We shall defeat our enemies!&quot;

&quot;Appear!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked as old as Mikail itself if not younger yet Mikail could feel it, that appearance was not to be trusted as even when he was just standing there the man irradiated power. 

&quot;Servant Caster, Are you my...&quot; As he began to spoke he opened his eyes and to say that the sight in front of him was not what he was expecting was an overstatement. It was enough to make him fell silent for a few moments, quite the amazing feat in all honesty if he weren&#39;t so puzzle by the current situation he would probably give Mikail his most sincere praise for achieving something no one except his wife had achieved while he was in life. 

But still even so he was a king, a king is forgiving at least to an extend. While part of him wanted to be mad at Mikail for the disrespect he was showing him by summoning while wearing a such a mask the action itself was enough to make him quite curious. 

The silence was broken by the servant laugh, he laugh loud and hard not giving any care if his sudden laugh could be perceived as an insult for the man that was obviously his new master. 

&quot;It seems I have been summoned by quite an amusing human&quot; The servant laugh began to die down and suddenly he examined his master frame and mask for a few moments. 

&quot;I am Manco Capaq, the first Inca let me ask you. Who are you and why have you summoned me?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In a few moments, there stood a young man before him.

When he heard the word &#39;Caster&#39;, gears started turning in his head.  While he was a strong powerhouse who made every criminal in the city scared whenever he was around, his reconaissance skills were inadequate and medical knowledge was even worse. He had no need for strong servants like a Saber, as even the strongest army is nothing without support and reconaissance. A Caster is a perfect servant class in this situation - they&#39;re almost always intelligent and frequently possess flying familiars perfect for scouting and knowledge in the ways of healing. 

Mikail expected a reaction like the one shown by the servant. He is familiar with being ridiculed for wearing a gas mask so frequently, even if if it was a long time since anyone actually did this since almost all criminals, the people he interacts with the most, are scared of him.

&quot;I am Mikail Bernstein, illegal gun dealer. You can call me Mike. You already know this, but you were summoned for a &#39;grail war&#39;, in which there are two sides. I am of Republic side since Alexandria has no meaning to me. I joined the war since if i win, i will have a better life in the future, and if i die, it doesn&#39;t matter, as i got my revenge a long time ago and have no regrets.

No sign of being annoyed nor even pretending to be calm he was completely calm which on one side meant he knew better than to snap at the easiest nag but also...

&quot;I see, well I imagine as much.&quot; While he didn&#39;t doubt some others may summon a servant for a variety of purposes his master appearance already told him enough of this situation. 

Still he took another moment to observer his master, he began to grade him as he ponder his words. Leaving aside the first impression of how he looked so far the guy was acting in a decent matter. It seems that overlooking his aspect seemed to be first idea. 

&quot;But if we are to continue our talk I would rather it be face to face&quot; His master had shown quite the courtesy when speaking with him, he would rather prefer a more vocal appreciation of him answering Mikail summon but was being patient. But even someone as patient as him had his limits, as he asked for Mikail to remove his mask his tone shifted into a more serious one. 

&quot;So far you seem like an amusing master which is something I am greatly pleased but if I am to go to war with you I rather seen the face of my subject.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But i do believe we should talk over a cup of tea. First i will prepare some things for tea and then take off my mask. Follow me.&quot; Mikail then proceeded to go to the living room once more. There was a big table in the middle of the room surrounded by several wooden chairs. On that table there was a teapot, two teacups, two teaspoons and a sugar bowl. &quot;I prepared the tea itself before you were summoned. I did not prepare anything to go with tea yet. Wait here for a minute.&quot;

Mikail then went to the kitchen. He took a loaf of bread, cheese and some salami and made multiple open-faced sandwiches out of the ingredients. Then the sandwiches were put on a big plate and Mikail opened the cupboard, a short while later the rest of the plate was soon filled with different sweets - chocolates, butter cookies, cupcakes and a big variety of different candies. This was a strange sight, an intimidating soldier with a gas mask that made him look almost soulless was caringly preparing food to have with tea for a servant that he just summoned and knows practically nothing about. Then after bringing the plate to the living room tea was poured into both teacups. &quot;Sorry for not preparing this beforehand.&quot;

Mikail agressively took off his gas mask and put it to the side. He looked like a relatively old man with a burn scar on his neck, but the face itself had no distinguishing features. &quot;You are right, talking face to face is required in this situation.

More than what was being offered it was the fact that something was being offered, his master was obviously a weird one but weird in the good sense. For many, either a magus or nor a servant was just a mere tool, that is not too say that a servant was human, but regardless of they being a tool or not respect was something fundamental when it came to make this relationship work.

So far Mikail was acting as good as anyone who summoned him as he could ask. It was a good thing that Manco&#39;s mental age didn&#39;t matched his appearance as right now he was basically an old man in the inside. According to some records he lived close to a 100 years and they would be wrong as far as he could remember he was close to 120. During that much time one is bound to change perspectives, although obviously some would remain as well. 

&quot;The action itself speaks more than what you present&quot;  Even when no needing to eat or drink he went and reached for sandwich, respect is a two way street after all. As a ruler he knew, he cannot demand respect if he doesn&#39;t shown it in the first place although the person needed to be worthy of that to begin with and so far Mikail was filling the bill, in more than one way. 

&quot;Well if I had a question I need to ask right away it would be...&quot; he paused for a few seconds. &quot;Why you seek a better life? Is your current one not enough? Is there something else you hope to achieve by Participating in this war?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hm.&quot; Mikail seemed confused by this question. &#39;When did i say that i seek a better life?&#39; he thought. &quot;No. I seek a better death. A better life is simply what would happen if i get very lucky.&quot; His voice remained monotone as he speaked, not showing even a hint of emotion. He did not realize how different his values are compared to everyone else at this moment in his life and thought that the servant in front of him would understand his words. &quot;This war is the only place where i can die without feeling like a coward. I had no choice but to participate in it.&quot; 

Then Mikail put two teaspoons of sugar in his tea and mixed it with the spoon until the sugar was dissolved. After that he reached for a sandwich himself and took a few bites before washing it down with tea. &quot;Damn, this expensive salami is way better... Ahem. If i suddenly get inexplicably angry, try not to look me in the eyes, yeah? I won&#39;t elaborate.&quot; Even though he knew that he should explain his curse as soon as possible to avoid future problems, a part of him did not want to tell anything at all.

&quot;Anyways, i would like to know what you&#39;re capable of. Any reconaissance capability? Healing? Destruction?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A mix of surprise and concern began to invade him as he repeat his master words inside his mind. The way his master said it made it look unimportant, anyone hearing him could easily think he was talking about someone else and not his own possible death which would unnerve anyone who hear it. 

But the Inca remain silent, a bit disappointed but it was his own fault for misunderstanding his master previous. He had taken his previous words as Mikail wanting something better for himself which was something he could relate to a degree. In his eyes it was part of human nature to seek something better be it either a place to just a simple object. It was simple ambition, the will to seek and reach a goal but in this case the goal his master seek was death.  It was commendable to a degree though, not many would be able to face their desire to die in such a way that they wanted to die with a sense of purpose. 

&#39;That is dangerous&#39;  he though as he gave his master a smile. The question came back to him, in more than one sense. What to do? Should he try and convince his master to live? Just observe? Did he even had a right to intervene? His master was his subject but being a king doesn&#39;t mean he controlled each and every single one of his subjects. 

&quot;Well before I mention my abilities let me clarify something.&quot; he said as he mimic Mikail and taste some of the expensive Salami. &quot;I have no intention of dying, so as far as I know I will be forcing you into that extremely lucky situation.&quot; 

For now he would observe, he will see how far he would go for his wish to die. 

&quot;So please don&#39;t take it against you. I have something I wanna do as well so despite your wishes I will go for victory and survival.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So many different flavors, so many new things that weren&#39;t in his time it was really easy for him to get lost in his own curiosity. Maybe once formalities were done he would ask his master more about this. 

&quot;When it comes to my abilities, I have some elemental magic I can use which would be normally be my main form of attack although I personally like to do something else.&quot; 

As he spoke a golden flame erupted from his shoulder, but it didnt burn the king it easily looked as if the flame was part of his body. Suddenly the flames began to take shape slowly forming themselves into a red condor which looked at Mikail with curiosity. 

&quot;If you reconnaissance I have this guy. While I can show you enough  respect to no lie to your face I don&#39;t intend to share all my abilities with you right off the bat. Who knows what sort of enemies we may found so I rather keep some details to myself.&quot; 

Even when saying that it took Manco Capac less than a minute to slowly share most of his abilities without an issue. He explained how he was able to give the condor and his other familiar some complex orders although he refused to elaborate too much on the how. But he did share the uses each of his familiars had and even some restrictions of what they could and couldn&#39;t do. 

&quot;I can create some healing item I believe but I will need time to do so, and for my largest attack? Well On that area I&#39;m sorry but I feel like you should see it by yourself , my words alone couldn&#39;t make justice to explain what I will show you. But let me tell you this, I doubt there are many servants who can survive once I unleash that on them. &quot;

The conversation was going quite well before he though of something. &quot;So what about you Master? What are your abilities?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And while I do not know what is the goal you desire to reach, i am sure that it is greater than that of mine. I will not let my wish of death stop you from reaching your ambition. Just know, if an unlikely scenario occurs in which sacrificing me will let you complete your objective, do not be afraid to do so.&quot;

Mikail took some time to admire the summoned fiery condor. He even stood up and walked closer to Manco to inspect the bird, ignoring all rules of etiquette. &quot;Hm. This bird will be good for recon. I like birds. I think. Your healing capability seems to be more than acceptable. I do not need to know what your largest attack is, i am already happy knowing that recon and healing are within your skillset.&quot;

When Mikail was asked about his abilities, he got excited and grinned widely. &quot;Well you&#39;re in luck, i am one of the most dangerous mercenaries around here. First of all-&quot;He took out a gun. It was a grossly oversized pistol with a magazine at the front, by all means it looked like an overexaggerated parody of a gun. &quot;-this thing. The Uluu Toion pistol. Named after a siberian demon. Shoots full-sized shotgun shells. There are two special ammunition types for it, but for now i will explain one.&quot; Mikail pulls out a single enormous rifle round out of one of his ammo pouches. It was colored bright-red and almost glowing. One could feel the energy trapped within simply by looking at it. &quot;Obliterator rounds. Some of the most powerful bullets in the world. My greatest creation. I have only five of them and making another one will take way too much time. But they will be very useful for this war, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; He then puts the gun and the bullet back to where they were.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020765374297419906 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020765374297419906><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 04:37 AM">04:37</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;That is not all. I also have a smaller pistol and two spells. You do not need to know much about that pistol. The spells are interesting.&quot; Mikail formed his hand into a fist and pointed it in the air. Then a small, fiery bright red explosion appeared at the end of the fist. &quot;I can cast explosions from every part of my body. That was a very small one. Useful. Another spell of mine lets me reinforce potential energy of objects, but i cannot showcase it here because i don&#39;t want to destroy everything.

By no means he agreed but it gave him better insight of what his master looked for. And while it didn&#39;t really ease his fears as he could already foresee that his mentality was bound to lead them into troublesome situations but that was something to address in a few moments. 

It was his time to listen to his masters words, while he was okay with both keeping some secrets from each other a basic knowledge of what his master was capable was definitely something he needed to learn. The more he heard Mikail speak the more convinced he was of this. It was amusing even, his master was odd in all sense of the word even as a magus he was odd. Then again more than a magus he was rather a fighter who just happened to know magic. But his conclusion was something akin to what Mikail had mentioned before, they seemed to cover each other lacks quite well. 

While Manco Capac was arrogant and righteously so, he wasn&#39;t stupid the knowledge of this era let him know the weakness he possessed as a Caster. While he was by no means weak or useless he knew he was in a bad position if it came to fighter power type servants like the Saber or Lancer class. So if they wanted to win they needed another type of edge and it seems like teamwork may be the edge they both needed. 

&quot;It is quite impressive, you are honestly more amusing than a regular magus.&quot; he looked at the guys. Honestly surprised by how weapons has evolved since his time alive. &quot;I feel we can work well together but I think we have a few things we need to make clear before hand.&quot;

He took a moment before continuing petting his condor head a bit as he picked the best possible words. &quot; I respect your commitment with what you want but what do you think about strategic retreats? I feel this is an important point to discuss so each can assume a role in this partnership.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hm.&quot; This was the moment when Mikail should finally tell his servant about the curse. It was necessary, as if he doesn&#39;t tell this beforehand it would cause a lot of headaches and misunderstandings in the future. On the other hand it was something he really wanted to avoid talking about. It was not something he could control, yet he felt guilty and embarassed about each and every time the curse took him over in murderous rage. 

His emotions screeched inside his head, wanting for him to simply stay silent, but a question emerged out of his mind - &#39;Could I live with myself if i back off here like some pathetic coward?&#39;. The answer was no. He hated cowards, and the mere idea of being one disgusted him way more than the act of telling about some curse that he was sometimes embarassed about. He had to tell this.

By the time his train of thought reached its final destination, an entire minute had passed. A painfully long, deafeningly silent minute. He hadn&#39;t even noticed that he placed one of his hands on his chin in deliberation at this point. Then he finally finished his session of staring into nowhere while sorting out thoughts and started speaking once again &quot;I approve of tactical retreat. A good maneuver in war, keeps you alive to so you can fight more battles in the future, nothing cowardly here. But i cannot promise to do this reliably. My magic crest, it is cursed. Sometimes it makes me fall into uncontrollable rage. It ruined many generations of the Bernstein bloodline before.

Although to be fair the language itself wasn&#39;t completely gone, some remained even to this day but it wasn&#39;t the same Manco had just spoke. The difference between the two being as clear as day and night, not even someone who spoke the language could understand what the Inca had said. What they new was something that had been evolving, changing with time while what he spoke was the root language which originated it all. 

But at the same time Manco wonder if he was messed as well, as while he understood how dangerous his master and how annoying this whole situation could be there was something rising inside of him. Curiosity and interest, this was a really interesting situation. A messed up master, a messed up goal due to some really messed up situations and even so his master wanted to take the hard way out. It was laughable as much as it was amusing and as a King Manco wanted to see how much more amusing thing his master would show him.

&quot;Very well, I  understand  then I shall be the one in charge of deciding when we need to retreat then. Don&#39;t worry, a king has its pride as long as we have a chance of winning I dont believe in just running away. &quot; he reassured as pet his condor once again. 

He spoke again and the bird fly through one of the windows. 

&quot;I will have him stand watch outside so I can learn of the surroundings if you don&#39;t mind. Well I need to make some preparations if we gonna fight other teams so unless you have more questions, show to a place I can work in peace&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, you can try of course.&quot;

&quot;I think you can work in peace in the storage room. I sold most of my guns before joining this war, so it&#39;s mostly empty right now.&quot; Mikail stepped out of the living room into the corridor connecting all the rooms together. Then he pointed at one of the doors. &quot;It&#39;s over there. Go make your healing items there i guess. There are some mana batteries in a small box on the floor there, use them if you need to. I&#39;m off to the gun workshop. I gotta fill up some magazines with bullets for the small pistol.&quot;. 

He went to the gun workshop, grabbed some empty magazines and a box of bullets and sat down on the floor in a cross-legged position like the one someone would go into during meditation. Then he started putting bullets into the magazines, slowly and tediously stacking them on top of each other. Despite the tedium of such activity, it was somewhat akin to meditation for Mikail.

Eventually all of the magazines were filled. Mikail stood up and walked back over to the living room. He started drinking the now cold tea that remained in his teacup and began watching the television at the end of the room that he forgot to turn off before the summoning and did not notice before this moment. It suddenly seemed way less boring, as watching television no longer something out of boredom, now it was a useful tool to distract him from all the worries he has about the grail war. He needed distractions, as otherwise it would be difficult for him to stay calm for long.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The situation was less than ideal but is not like he could do anything about it, it could also be much worse. 

&quot;You wont end up in the Uku pacha just because you wish for it Master&quot; he said as he entered the storage room. The place was tidy and clean and just like his master had said it had enough space for him to work there without any issues. 

He took a seat in the middle of the room, he took a deep breath as he began to work, it was weird what he could do now. He had never been that good of a artist in life so finding himself in the position of being able to create items was something that was only possible for this version of himself. He hadn&#39;t lie to his master about the healing item he could but there was something else he needed to create. It was an object which  had been linked to his story regardless of the version. 

He hold his hands apart and in between a golden glow appeared, it was a simple golden bar but for Manco, it was the reward for what he had achieved for both him and his master to stand a chance in whatever may come for them this was essential. A smile appeared on his face as he focused at the task in front of him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
