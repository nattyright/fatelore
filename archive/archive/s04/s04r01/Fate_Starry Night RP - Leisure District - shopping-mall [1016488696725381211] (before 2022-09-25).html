To change into his combat suit would draw far too much attention. It wasn&#39;t every day you saw someone walk the streets adorned with gold clad armor; this was for the best. Additionally, it had the added benefit of letting the pair make a pit stop. On the way to find an open ground to fight, Alexander figured that Ā-Q&#236;ng and him could take a few detours. It would be in his favor to get the Servant well adjusted to the city layout and the ways of modern times. While she was implanted with the necessary information upon being summoned, experience was still an important factor when composing ones self. 

The two would find themselves standing just in front of mall entrance. The leisure district was vast. There were large buildings so tall that seeing the top was a dream away. Just looking through the shopping area, Alexander could tell how diverse the options were. He hoped that Macedon could one-day have a district like this. 

&quot;So Ā-Q&#236;ng what do you think? I figured it&#39;d be fun to do some shopping and sightseeing before playing. If you&#39;d like we could buy you knew clothes or some modern knick knacks.&quot; Alexander would bend down as he spoke, trying to treat Ā-Q&#236;ng as he would one of his children. Through these actions Alexander aimed to get the servant to open up to him more, laying the foundations of a bond, thus bolstering their teamwork.

From the moment she had stepped out of the building her Master called home, she was assaulted by a cacophony of experiences entirely new to her, starting simply with the sheer quantity of people that crowded the streets. It had been the first time she had seen people with skin-tone as rich as the forest soil, and sometimes even darker still, but what truly left her speechless was the seeming lack of any hierarchical structure among the populace. She was never one to worry about status and breeding herself, the limited education granted to her by her mother making her aware of its existence yet not finding much use for it in her secluded capacity as a village goat-herder, but even a Gibbon would be startled if the sky suddenly turned red. This did not affect her in anyway way of course, those people bustling around her may as well have been as her favorite ants which she made a game out of by dancing between their paths during her lengthy days on the mountainside, avoiding stepping on each and every one despite the untamed foliage of the verdant pastures, but the fact remained that a scenery that had accompanied her for her entire life had now inexplicably changed for reasons that eluded her.
Men and women now carried themselves with equal pride. The line between commoners and nobles was blurred to the point of non-existence, and should she have voiced her amusement at her Master’s manner of dress, she was now greeted with more styles and patterns than she could count. The streets exploded in a torrent of untold lights and hues, but to let them command your attention was to fail to behold the true spectacle of the modern era.

Her breath faltered in her throat, eyes wide and legs failing to keep pace with her guide as Ā-Q&#236;ng directed her gaze heavensward.

Much like the mountain-range whose image the skyline invoked, she could not help but liken it to the buried jaw of a colossal dragon, long buried, yet whose fangs still pierced the earth to remind those that would make their home upon the land of its faded glory. An involuntary shiver ran through her spine and echoed to the very tips of her fingers, the sensation traveling as far as the very balls of her feet. She, who had called a mountain her home, could not help but be possessed by the urge to leap between these man-made recreations of nature’s miracles, and she would have done so, had it not been for her Master’s retreating figure threatening to leave her behind. Snapping back to reality, Ā-Q&#236;ng hurried to return to his side and deny him the pleasure (?) of looking for a child lost in the crowds.

As they traveled a small number of adjacent districts, a likely effort of Alexander’s to allow his Servant to regain her bearings and acclimate to the modern times as well as imprint the city’s layout in to her inquisitive mind, the two would eventually arrive at the Leisure District, one of Alexandria’s more well-to-do areas. Its plentiful parks and gardens and lack of office buildings allowed it the luxury of being one of the more serene districts, and while the sporadic instances of children’s laughter and dog barks never quite allowed for a true lack of noise, those lively sounds instead filled its inhabitants with comfort and warmth, proof of the people’s happiness.

“...I feel sticky?” she voiced her mundane complaint as she curiously rubbed the skin on her forearms, but to no avail.

This much should only be expected however, seeing as the mall her Master had brought her to was on the very edge of Alexandria’s boundaries, hence exposing the nearby building by the constant assault of the salty ocean breeze. Naturally the buildings were constructed with that in mind, reducing and in some cases eradicating rust and degradation caused by oxidation almost completely, but to Ā-Q&#236;ng who had never been to the ocean before, this was a completely foreign experience. Sticking her tongue out she tried to catch some of the sea’s flavor, unsuccessful in her attempt, and thus quickly lost interest as Alexander began to speak.

At the offer of being bought new clothes, her face lit up like a star.

“Really!? I never am allowed new clothes unless I outgrow my old robes, but since I stopped growing that has not happened for a long time!”

The prospect of sparring with her Master pushed to the wayside in favor of being able to grant a place in this new world, even if only by mimicking their odd sense of fashion, her eagerness to try something new was less inspired by the prospect of being given a present and more a desire to strengthen her ties to this second chance at life.
To any onlookers however, her reaction was simply that of an ordinary child rejoicing at being bought a gift.

“This one, I want to try this one~”

Tugging Alexander by the sleeve, she dragged her person-sized wallet to a shop several stores deep within the mall, the mystery of how she was able to spot something so far away in the distance doubtlessly related to her nature as a Servant amplifying her already sharpened senses, before pulling him before the mannequins in question, shuffling between the stalls to pull out the relevant articles to complement her two outfits of choice. One for warm weather and one for cold, both allowing for sufficient range of movement to be used even in battle…which was quite likely all things considered, seeing as she showed no signs of returning to her old robes should she be allowed to keep her new apparel.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020275208533327923 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020275208533327923><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Sep-22 08:09 PM">20:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Visual Reference for the new Clothes:</code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020275280666972200 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020275280666972200><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="16-Sep-22 08:09 PM">20:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20Leisure%20District%20-%20shopping-mall%20%5B1016488696725381211%5D%20%28before%202022-09-25%29.html_Files/Yue_Outfits-EC19B.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20Leisure%20District%20-%20shopping-mall%20%5B1016488696725381211%5D%20%28before%202022-09-25%29.html_Files/Yue_Outfits-EC19B.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: Yue_Outfits.png (197.34 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

The city was a new experience for a mountain child, and just as Alexander predicted, experience was far more impactful then downloaded information. Of course Ā-Q&#236;ng was also a child, and she acted like such. Raising ten children of his own, Alexander knew how to the win the heart of a child, and it seemed his approach was working on the servant. However, Alexander was still perplexed on the idea of this giddy child being a powerful weapon. Despite this, He had no doubt that Ā-Q&#236;ng was strong. On the walk with Ā-Q&#236;ng he had begun to recognize her as a well cut diamond. She shone with a childish joy, but was pristinely cut to suit her purpose. This child was most definitely a strong fighter.

&quot;Oh&quot; Alexander was pulled from his thoughts as Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s hand tugged at his sleeve. The king followed behind the child inspecting the price tag of each item she picked out. For someone so new to contemporary fashion, she certainly had a strong eye for the expensive stuff. Alexander would pick up three pairs of each item regardless of the price. He assumed they would probably get dirty and need replacing. 

&quot;You have a good eye for fashion Ā-Q&#236;ng. Although let&#39;s be careful with them, they are quite expensive and you don&#39;t wanna ruin them by accident.&quot; As Alexander spoke he walked the clothes towards the cash register. Placing the three pairs of each outfit on the counter. He took no mention of the final price, instead paying and taking the receipt to check later. If anything this was just a &#39;business expense&#39; in the eyes of the Macedon treasury. 

Holding up the bags of clothes Alexander looked down towards his Servant. &quot;You can put on one of your new outfits at the changing room if you&#39;d like, but do remember we&#39;re about to go fig-... &#39;Play&#39;.&quot;

She had chosen her clothes purely to fit in with those she saw around her while also taking care to keep her limbs mostly unfettered, though that also meant that she neglected to consider the price tag attached to her chosen attire, not to mention the quality and brand image associated with them. As it happened, it seemed that she had chosen a rather costly establishment.
Though simple, her clothes were of excellent make, the subtle brand logo tastefully sewn close to the hem giving off a prestigious presence, which just so happened to match with Alexander’s own, as he too only dressed himself as one of Macedon’s finest. A doting father spoiling his young daughter. Though he was solidly built, at the end of the day he was just a man to the average onlooker, making them appear, for all intents and purposes, as an average pair of upper-crust society enjoying themselves in the eve of the Inter-City Tourney, unbothered by the consequences such as clash would bring.

None of this mattered to Ā-Q&#236;ng of course, her only current concern being her Master’s innocuous words. Looking between him and the purchases he had just made in her name, her features were beset by modest worry as she tried to make sense of the cost.

“Was it too much?” she carefully pried, thinking back on what such purchases meant in her time.

Maintaining their humble hut and tending to their home-grown gardens already took up most of her day, and as Ā-Q&#236;ng could not cook, housework too fell on her on her mother’s shoulders. Thus it was the daughter’s duty to herd their goats and keep them hale and hearty, and consequently, to sell them off to the village butchers for rice and other necessities which they lacked. Her mind had thus associated big purchases to the sad memory of culling her own flock, or in this case, the loss of her Master’s… irregardless of whether or not Alexander actually did own his own herd of goats.

In her own way, Ā-Q&#236;ng understood the weight of an expensive gift, even if that perception was not entirely accurate, but at the same time she was perceptive enough to understand that her Master did not mind it in the slightest. Let alone balk at the purchase, he tripled it without a second thought to prepare replacements, his assuring smile never once leaving his lips as he did so. Not unlike F&#224;n L&#237; who had no issues allowing Ā-Q&#236;ng’s goats to graze on the priceless flowers in his mansion’s garden, Alexander too appeared to be possessed of boundless generosity. Not one purely stained with ulterior motives, but one borne of genuine kindness. While he no doubt expected Ā-Q&#236;ng to fight for him in the war of course, to her he simply appeared to be a nice old man.
Someone she needed to protect like her goat Old White. Someone who protected her like Grandpa White. Hence, she would protect him and be protected by him. Proudly puffing out her chest and performing an over-excited bow, Ā-Q&#236;ng resolved herself to do her best to repay Papa White… though she kept the fact that she continued to refer to him as such a secret from him as he unfortunately did not seem to like the nickname.

Thank you for the clothes, I will take great care of them!”

To Alexander the purchase was a non-issue, barely an after-thought, a tiny drop paling in comparison to his nation’s wealth, but this odd misunderstanding has nevertheless somehow caused Ā-Q&#236;ng to feel greatly indebted to her new Master.
She would need to repay him. In the only way she knew how. In life, F&#224;n L&#237; wanted her to fight, and in death she would do the same.

Shaking her head side to side, she declined the offer to don her new clothes immediately.
Her body felt light and limber, newfound motivation filling her with an aching desire to let loose and make use of the excitement currently making her skin shiver. When next her eyes made contact with Alexander’s own, they shimmered with an eagerness for play.
If one didn’t know any better, it almost appeared like she was ready to fight right then and there.

Despite being a child, Ā-Q&#236;ng showed signs of being financially self aware. This was a quality Alexander lacked as a kid, and perhaps due too a difference in upbringing and circumstances, he found it quite odd. Given some thought however it did make sense. From what he could tell Ā-Q&#236;ng was rather underprivileged, even the thought of new clothes peeked her interest more then the previously mentioned knick-knacks.

Regardless of the price, Ā-Q&#236;ng was thankful. Alexander was glad to see his servant quickly warming up to him. He had essentially been killing two birds with one stone. He was getting Ā-Q&#236;ng acclimated to the modern world and getting her to fit in, all while gaining her trust. 

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome Ā-Q&#236;ng&quot; Alexander replied with a bright smile, bending down to meet her level in an attempt to seem more genuine. &quot;You seem to have fire in your eyes!&quot; Alexander commented on his servants fighting spirit, reciprocating her excitement. At this point Alexander would love nothing more then to see what Ā-Q&#236;ng was capable of, even if only a little bit.

&quot;Well then let&#39;s not wait any longer. I think I know the perfect spot for our little adventure.&quot; Alexander would gesture for Ā-Q&#236;ng to follow behind him, carrying the bags of clothes in his hands. He would lead out of the mall and to <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#central-park</span> .
