“Alright Spriggy, we’re here!” Amelia said as she balanced a crate under one arm and leaned precariously into the door as she tried to open the thing without collapsing under the hefty harness on her back. In she walked into a sparsely decorated room with lamplight filtering in through patchy curtains. A disordered, hazy sketch of white chalk coated the floor in the center and it was that the young magus was slowly trudging towards, pulling whatever was attached to the harness into view. 

“Ok so now that we got everything else set up, figure we should go over the plan one last time right?” The little guinea pig-meet-toad familiar nodded its head in response, jumping ontop of the upturned crate opposite of Amelia.

“So we’ve already done the long boring work of canvasing the place and its bounded field was weakest here at the help’s entrance, meaning that we just have to disguise ourselves briefly and use that counterfeit badge to get the permission we need to get inside and Lord Whatsit will be none the wiser.”

“And once we get on the inside, our cover as alchemical repair should pretty much allow us unrestricted access to most of the building and most importantly, the service tunnels and ventilation. We should take this path here,” Amelia moved a blueprint of the mansion from the city records over the rough chalk drawing of the perimeter and thumbed to a particular level . 

“It should allow us to bypass most of the in-house security and hopefully end up in front of that unmarked section which should be our treasure!” As if on cue, Spriggy jumped down and began prancing about on the blank spot and nudged his snout at the edges, making a concerned clicking sound.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020600795869216768 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020600795869216768><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:43 PM">17:43</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Oh how do we get in? Uhhh to be honest, that’s the one thing I haven’t been able to dig out. Go figure but hey I imagine we can wing that. Between the two of us, nothing can stay safe for long!” The girl shot up, fist clutched around a piece of chalk. Catching herself in her excitement, her eyes drifted back towards the crate and the puppet that had nearly driven her to exhaustion carrying all around the city. “Now let’s get that circle drawn and we can be on our way!”

___

To Amelia’s credit, the plan worked far better than she hoped, letting her sneak right up to the chamber in which the artifact was housed without a soul seeing so much as the intrepid pair’s shadows. They just had to figure out how to get into the room and a powerful but friendly servant was guaranteed to be theirs!

Her first thought was to crack open the lock with a special seed of hers but the handprint and eye sensors stopped that before she even took out the seed. She then eyed the ventilation shaft but Spriggy took one whiff of that and barked incessantly at her whenever she got near. Though while he had her attention, the familiar began pawing against the floor in a burrowing motion and at one set of tiles in particular. 

“Spriggy, what are you doing? You think the way to go is under the floor? That’s crazy…” but also something no one else would expect. This wasn’t ground floor and the weight of a full concrete or steel box wouldn’t work here. 

Using that seed from earlier and fashioning it into a small trowel, she pried away the tiles to find a narrow crawlspace that led straight under the door. One moment later and they found themselves within the vault and the scene was something else.

 Walls lined with hieroglyphics and the vault door guarded by two towering statues of creature that were half man and half jackal. Gold, silver and jewels were stacked in gleaming heaps that shimmered under an artificial sun. The light came down particularly heavy on a box in the center.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020601007350218832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020601007350218832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:44 PM">17:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Alright, Amelia. Here’s the moment of truth you’ve been waiting a long time for. Let’s hope our luck holds out and whoever this catalyst is tied to is a friend. Only one way to find out.</em> She thought to herself as she approached the box and undid the latch. Within laid a gold-plated stirrup, embossed with streaks of lightning, laying upon deep crimson fabric. It was beautiful and the light only enhanced its glory, undiminished by the countless years.

It was hard for Amelia to tell if it belonged to a conqueror or a liberator though, both could look very much the same but the association with a mount and the wind was something she took as a good omen for the times ahead. Now the only thing was getting out. Already the fake sun overhead began to dim and her familiar looked anxiously towards the giant statues.

Wrapping the artifact up and sticking it in her pack, Amelia scooped up Spriggy and made it towards the exit they had for themselves only for a massive stone blade to block their path. Those giant statues were apparently more than just decoration but that was no problem for the young adventurer. With a short hop, she bounced up into the air, above even the giant’s head only to have to dodge again as the second golem swung its spear, hoping to pin her against the ceiling.

She dove straight down, weaving between strikes and slipping underneath their legs towards the crawlspace and going as fast as her elbows and knees could take her back out to safety. Though her wind-based magecraft would not save her against the half dozen barrels that would greet her on the other side.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020601116175638589 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020601116175638589><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:44 PM">17:44</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“An interloper, in my manor? My what an audacious young lady,” the familiar tenor of the lecturer from the museum mocked her, accompanied by a slow clap as its speaker strolled towards the corralled magus. Amelia had been escorted towards the nearest wall of the manor, the lamplight from outside casting shadows on her face. “To have gotten past everything and not be trapped in my vault, I am impressed at your actions. But that does not change the fact you robbed my “tomb” so to speak and I don’t take kindly those who disturb its peace.”

“Thanks mister but it was a lot easier than you think to break in. You’ve got a big hole in your system and I’m not telling what it is. I don’t think it’s something you’d figure out on your own…” Amelia bit back, unconcerned by the threat to her life, if anything the slight smirk on her face told the opposite story. Still she’d need to find someway out soon or she’d end up as stiff as the statues from before. 

“Is that so? I’m afraid time has a way of revealing all secrets and there will plenty of such for you now. Regardless of your method, you have decided to place yourself in my custody and I am sure that you will come to regret your actions.”

She could see the look on Lord Sudbury’s face and knew a lecture was coming. She’d seen i too many times in Lemuria to forget, even as a kid. This would be the perfect time to consider her options. The only two she’d eliminate right away was death by firing squad (Going to have to distract them somehow first) and surrender (I’m definitely not giving myself up to this stuffy jerk). She could dash between them and run away, that wouldnt likely end well. She could fight them but guns were the last thing she wanted to throw herself against and she could already see the tomb guardians peak out of the vault (Not good). That left one feasible alternative, the window.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020601271696248953 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020601271696248953><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:45 PM">17:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Now I don’t know who you are and you don’t seem the mercenary type, but what I do know is that I remember that peculiar phrenology of yours from my engagement at the museum and that you appear fairly young.

Understand that I must however– what the Devil are you doing, girl!” 

The nobleman had been focused on his administration and so it took him far too long to catch on to the fact Amelia had taken a stanchion and hurled it through the closest window. Any other words he wished to berate her with would be stolen out of his mouth as the area around the window decompressed and tossed Amelia out of the window and into the street below.

“Well what are you waiting for, after the lass!”

___

Haha, she had done it! One certain end to her adventures had been avoided and she was now flying away with the greatest treasure she’d likely ever take in her lifetime. Even with the wind blowing around her and the crack of gunfire from behind, she could still feel her heart beating its lively rhythm. This is what it meant to be truly alive and Amelia would let that tailwind carry her all the way back to her stakeout and begin preparing the ritual that would bring about a new chapter in her life.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020601412285116459 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020601412285116459><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:45 PM">17:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Wind and fire, earth and water, let the four prime elements make a compact here today,” she started off slow and breathy, imbuing her breath with mana and using it to activate the summoning circle, causing a gentle breeze to come to life. Meanwhile the shadows of men and larger creatures stirred outside, attracted by the faint glow poking out from the stakeout’s curtains

“The rootless claim their stake in the world today and the four winds blow down all barriers set before them,” Amelia raised her voice and so too did the wind in speed and volume, the circle glowing brighter. She could feel the flow of energy course up from the deepest parts of her lungs and roll out of her mouth before orbiting around the diagram of chalk and blood, a metal puppet sitting crosslegged in the center, a crimson cloth draped over its lap. Someone busted down the front door of the apartment. 

“Answer my pleas, wanderer of the endless plains and sailor of the boundless seas so that I may journey with you,” she continued, the wind beginning to howl and whistle through the many cracks and crevices of the apartment. She could feel the flow begin to tug on her chest as if it was trying to lift something out of her. Footsteps thundered up the stairs. 

“I seek your name for all the virtues of the world and none of its sins so come forth from the circle of the just, Guardian of the Scales!” Amelia yelled, now straining to hear her own voice over the gale and squinting her eyes to still see the servant frame before her. Her heart beat at double march, her bones began to ache as the air within began to contribute too and her stomach churned from the ordeal, yet she could never be afraid. 

The door to the room shuttered once, twice before bursting into splinters revealing the well kept figure of Lord Sudbury now disheveled and hand outstretched at the same thing Amelia desired.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020601447299166208 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020601447299166208><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Sep-22 05:45 PM">17:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Ms.Diddles#9442">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Each completed passage of the summoning chant brought forth a new tremor. Each word imbued the frame before her with power. Each moment made the frame shine brighter than the previous. All of it culminating for a sole purpose; the summoning of a hero from the Throne. 

The ritual reached its crescendo once the final words left her lips. The light illuminated the shoddy stakeout with the beams of shining mana piercing through whatever cracks they could find. In the same moment the door was broken through, the ritual was completed. Not a moment too soon as well.

However, it did not end quietly...

<strong>BOOOOM</strong>

A deafening crash of thunder erupted from where the frame was placed. This, followed by a powerful gust of wind, shrouded the servant from sight from both Lord Sudbury and Amelia. That is until the dust settled, of course...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The origin of which came from the figure sitting down cross-legged in the same position the frame was set up. Streaks of lightning danced across their body as they stood up. 

The settling dust slowly revealed the Servant. Beautiful crimson hair adorned their head with an eyepatch dressed in a vibrant Phoenician purple covered their left eye. The armour they wore carried the same colour for their accents with the shape of their breastplate revealing that they were a woman. 

The lightning was soon focused into the blade in her hand, causing the crackling of electricity to stop as it dissipated, before she took her first breath in this new world she was summoned in. The act was cathartic. To take breath once more after death was something so few are able to experience.

Soon, a wolf-like grin shined through the now-cleared dust as she set her sights on her...Masters? Wait a second...

Her grin was lost to the scene before her as she glanced at Lord Sudbury then at Amelia. To make sure she was seeing things properly, she even lifted up her eyepatch, revealing her heterochromia in her state of confusion.  

<em>&quot;Hah?! Two Masters? This can&#39;t be right...&quot;</em> Hannibal pondered in her mind to herself before setting her eyepatch back down.

The urgency of the situation was lost on her without the proper context. 

Despite the initial confusion, Hannibal only needed to take a second glance at Amelia to recognize the mana connection the two now shared; much less the Command Spells signifying her as the Master. 

She had to be the one.

&quot;You can call me <strong>Rider of Lightning</strong>!&quot;

That was the perogative of the woman in purple and bronze and she made her choice. Amelia found herself getting hoisted up by the firm hands of the servant, remnant static causing her hair to prickle and her heart to skip a beat. She wanted to say something but her brain was running too fast for it to cobble together a coherent thought.

Lord Sudbury had no such inhibition, caught by his own men and taking the time to tidy up his unkempt self. He wasted no time shooting the upstart girl with his iron gaze, his men could do that much more efficiently. it would be a mistake to do so anyway, any such move would turn the servant hostile against them anyway. A different tack was needed.

&quot;Indeed she is your master, and a right clever one at that. You are lucky to have such a magus and doubly so for having me as benefactor. Her guile, your power and my resources, why it would be the ideal campaign any artist of the martial disciplines would dream of,&quot; the aristocrat tapped his cane, signaling his bodyguards, six in number and 12 in firearms to enter the room. Two golems of decidedly Egyptian influence stood cramped in the hallway behind. &quot;It&#39;s an offer too good to pass up on <em>twice</em>&quot; 

And now it was Amelia&#39;s turn to do a double take, mirroring her servant&#39;s brief spell of confusion. Only a second ago, the man wanted to arrest her and likely lock her up, doing who knows what (Maybe even desk work! <em>Yikes!</em>) Was this the power of a servant, that everyone now afforded you a level of respect no matter what you did previously? Several new ideas sprung up in the more mischievous parts of her mind, to be stored away for later.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020945756011630593 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020945756011630593><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 04:33 PM">16:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She looked back up at Rider and gathered herself. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s me.

Her posture shifted, taking a small step back from the noble and his men while she kept her face locked on the servant. Her face matched the wolf-like expression of Rider and her eyes gleamed with an eagerness that could only mean no good. &quot;I gotta ask you and it might be a little strange but are your muscles tired after all that time asleep, like do you need some exercise to get everything going in this new life of yours?&quot;

A slight annoyance to be sure since he wasn&#39;t the one she was talking to. However, because Rider didn&#39;t know if he was important to her or not, she held back her tongue. 

Something didn&#39;t feel right though. 

There were too many bodies for this to be considered normal. Armed too. The golems in the back were a bit much as well. Did they think they were going to summon a Berserker or something? Seriously! 

No. 

The signaling was on purpose. Almost like he wanted to have them surrounded...

<em>&quot;So that&#39;s how this is going to be...&quot;</em> Rider thought to herself as she read the situation more and more. A tight grip was held on her weapon. No sparks or static was present. There was no need to raise suspicion. Yet.

&quot;Amelia Ipomoea, huh? A beautiful name.&quot; She spoke softly as she kept her attention on her. It was nice to hear her Master speak. Her words were genuine and came from a free-spirited heart. That much was obvious to her already. 

<em>Before we consider his offer...</em>

&quot;Oh?&quot; Rider paid close attention to her next words. The careful step back. The wolf-like grin. That <em>gleam</em> in her eyes. These were all signs Rider understood all too well. 

A smug scoff left her lips before she answered. &quot;You know...Now that you bring it up...&quot; Rider placed a hand on the shoulder of the arm holding her signature falcata. She worked her arm around a bit as if to work out some stiffness there was present. &quot;I <em>could</em> use a little workout actually. Knock off some of that rust so to speak.&quot;

&quot;However...&quot; The same gleam was in Rider&#39;s eyes before she continued. &quot;I must ask you this in return. <strong>Are you sure about this?</strong>&quot; Luckily for Amelia, it seemed Rider caught on. All that was left was the confirmation.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021024858638921789 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021024858638921789><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 09:48 PM">21:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagaranara</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Err if it is exercise you seek, why waste your time in this ramshackle apartment? My grounds hold state-of-the-art training facilities that would much more befit someone who drapes themselves in the imperial purple hues of the Roman empire,&quot; the man bowed his head respectfully upon uttering the name of the nation who he held so dear.

&quot;Or if it is a parade ground you seek, my estate has such land in the neighboring district that would best befit your noble class.&quot;

Amelia only afforded the man a brief sideways glance before something struck her about his words. He was a historian and an archeologist clearly by trade yet what made him so sure that Rider was from Rome? Sure the colors matched loosely but being so close to the servant, that conclusion seemed off to her. She couldn&#39;t quite pin it down, was it the curved sword maybe? 

Regardless, she renewed her attention on Rider and wasted no time in deciding. &quot;Yup, I&#39;m sure of it.

The air was silent after both parties spoke their piece. It was a loud silence. One that could be heard outside of this apartment. 

&quot;....What did you say?&quot;

Rider was barely audible with her words spoken. The look in her eyes, while hidden from Lord Sudbury, stared straight past Amelia. For good reason too. If such a gaze was focused on her, it would have surely bore a hole straight through her.

He <strong>DARED</strong> mention that place so brazenly? Not only that but to consider her outfit to be <em>roman</em>?! Rider was going to have none of that. Her grin soon turned into a snarl. Her teeth grinded against each other as the sparks of lightning began to gather on her weapon.

With confirmation from her Master, there was nothing holding her back.

&quot;Im..imperial purple? Roman, you say?...&quot; Rider felt the bile coming up for even uttering those words from her mouth. With a stomp towards Lord Sudbury, a hand gripped onto one of the purple sections of cloth on her opposite arm as if to show him properly. 

&quot;<em>This</em> is Phoenician purple, you bastard! Not the knock-off shit Rome stole!&quot; She spat out venom as she got close enough to grab him, proved when she did just that as she held her grip on his collar. Her weapon slowly surging with lightning as she got in his face. 

&quot;You dare even compare the two together?! Don&#39;t you even have the <em>slightest</em> hint of fashion in that dense skull of yours?!&quot; Rider began to shake Lord Sudbury as she gave him a proper lesson in what <em>not</em> to say in front of Rider. &quot;Rome <em>wished</em> She looked this good!&quot;

A crash of thunder echoed in the room as Rider activated her <strong>Mana Burst (Thunderbolt)</strong> in earnest, shrouding her weapon and lower half with lightning as it arcs in between both points. She didn&#39;t need to use ■■■■■ against the likes of him, but this should be more than enough.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021163336248852600 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021163336248852600><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 06:58 AM">06:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagaranara</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had said something wrong? Impossible. That stirrup had clearly belonged to one of the disciples of Alexander the Great and here the woman stood, draped in Imperial purple and armor that could easily mark her a fan of the Macedonian. Of course that blasted child had to fuel the flames of chaos that were actively ruining his shot at greatness. He&#39;d have to find a way in the future to remove her, preferably quietly.

&quot;My apologies, I most assuredly did not mean to tarnish your name in any - hrrk! Madam, please unhand me!&quot; he set out to assuage any misconceptions only to find the starched white collar of his shirt bunched up and supporting his weight.  It was hard to breathe and admittedly hard to think. His mind flashed back to boarding school and his body appropriately tensed up, anticipating an impromptu visit to a cramped metal closet. He did not grasp the words she was yelling at him in the moment.

Meanwhile Amelia felt anything but numb, her limbs felt imbued with a certain energy, tensed like a spring and ready to go. Only she would not be running away from any danger, she&#39;d love to dive right in it. The hairs on her arms and neck seemed to dance with the ever-polarizing atmosphere. To see the power of a servant first hand and not being its target? Amelia could live off this alone every day.

Her spine involuntarily danced at the thought of it or so she thought until she felt a familiar, warm presence claw its way up her hair and under the helmet from her disguise. Poor little Spriggy always got so nervous around the things that made Amelia giddy. Sure he&#39;d try to guide her away from those things but right now, turns out the safest spot to be is on top of one of Alexandria&#39;s thrill junkies.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021628784862056489 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021628784862056489><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 01:48 PM">13:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As Lord Sudbury felt himself sail through the air and careen towards his men at high speed, it finally hit him...

&quot;You know, I had great hopes for this summoning, that I would receive a Son of Mars and Alexander in equal measure. One of his followers perhaps, a pharaoh or consul even. Yet I find myself standing before the one with the loudest mouth and the most brevity, the Daughter of Athena and Hamilcar. What a poor turn of luck...&quot; the noble ended with a snide chuckle and dismissive shake of his head. His clothes may have been rumpled yet the air around him still remained defiantly dignified. He tapped his cane twice before continuing.

&quot;Now it may be foolish of me to tempt fate again but let us see if there is substance behind your anger and not just the hollow roar of passing thunder. <strong>Princes of Ptolemy, I beseech your aid! Defend against this ruffian!</strong>&quot;

The wall to either side of him shattered as two golems, easily eight feet tall, burst forth and charged Rider. One thrust its spear at her while the other dashed to the side to slash at her flank with twin swords. As if on cue, they were accompanied by a hail of automatic fire from the six guards. 

Amelia, to her credit, would respect one threat to her life and dropped to the floor the instant they started firing.She crawled on her belly until she reached an old steamer trunk and braced her back against it. She glanced up, looked at the fracas, and dropped back down.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021628876436275210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021628876436275210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 01:48 PM">13:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Ok Amelia, this is not the kind of fight that’s yours to take but Rider’s likely to need your help, right?

The mention of her father used in an derogatory manner stopped her advance. Sounds of teeth grinding against teeth were masked by the surging of lightning around Rider. 

&quot;My father was a good man... Far better than to deserve having his good name spoken by the tongue of someone like you!&quot; More of Lord Sudbury&#39;s words went to stroke the fires of rage inside of Rider. To not only mention her father, but one of the great generals of old, Alexander, as well to be used against her, it was as if this man <em>wanted</em> to die by her hands.

&quot;... What grounds do you have to compare me to him like that?&quot; Rider&#39;s words were spoken through gritted teeth. She did her best not to be provoked any further to avoid being tugged along so easily. 

Sure she didn&#39;t conquer as much land as Alexander did, nor did she craft an empire on the same scale, but to diminish the accomplishments she <em>did</em> have was utterly insulting. It was made even more insulting given that the insult came from someone like Lord Sudbury. 

Although, there wasn&#39;t any time to bark back at him. The spear and blade from the golems made sure of that. Clearly he won&#39;t listen to words however. His skull is too dense for that. Best to show him instead.

The blades were brought down in unison against her only for them to miss their mark as Rider used to her <strong>Mana Burst</strong> skill to escape certain death. In a quick burst of speed, Rider leapt towards the flank of the spear-wielding golem, planting her feet against the wall. It was easier to dodge a thrust, after all. 

She had one more burst to use. So, before they could react, Rider launched herself off the wall towards the flank of the golem with the spear to drive her <strong>Mana Burst</strong>-augmented sword into its side, hoping the speed and force would send it careening into the other one.

There was an issue though. The hail of gunfire complicated things for both her and her new Master. She needed a way to deal with them next.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021656676153180200 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021656676153180200><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 03:38 PM">15:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagaranara</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Your father could maintain a proper empire over time and leave it primed for his successor. Can you honestly say the same of yourself? Did you leave Carthage as strong as you found it? Did you die fighting for its glory? As your father did?&quot; Sudbury snapped at Rider. 

What had been initially been a mistaken assumption for him had quickly turned into a finely tipped sword for Sudbury to skewer the servant with. He may never be able to truly harm a servant such as her physically but words could easily leave a festering wound within the recesses of an exposed mind.

She was more volatile than he remembered from his studies and this blind hatred of her greatest foe gave him all the openings he desired.

The golems on the other hand, did not find Hannibal as open a target. The sheer speed and force of the servant far outclassed the constructs and the spearman found itself toppling into its compatriot. The floor caved underneath the impact of both and the golems quickly disappeared from view, only the rumbling echo of their impact giving any hint to their fate. 

With the servant occupied, Lord Sudbury sought to put further pressure on Rider and sent two of the guards around to seize Amelia. The top of her helmet peaked up over the top of a trunk, promising an unaware target and easy hostage. The surpressing fire diminished in volume.

Yet when they came upon the trunk and one leaned over, his head snapped back reflexively as a seed lodged itself in his goggles. The other man backed to the side in order to get a better angle only to slip to the ground as a sudden gust rushed by his feet. A second burst of wind immediately followed, dragging the dazed pair closer together.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021894176520032288 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021894176520032288><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 07:22 AM">07:22</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The white haired girl they were after jumped out and already was growing some type of vine between her hands as she approached them, whistling some high pitched tune.

This would surely wipe the expression off Sudbury&#39;s face for good! At least, that&#39;s what she hoped.

That wasn&#39;t what she got as the next line of words struck Rider to her core. Rather than attack Rider directly, he chose to attack her <em>legacy</em> instead. How dare he! As a damn know-it-all, he should know the reason why! Rome effectively neutered Carthage after Her defeat. She left Carthage because she had to. It was all to have her home avoid the wrath of Rome which still burned for her, even long after her defeat. There wasn&#39;t a single action she did that <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> for Carthage. They all knew that! Her people knew that!... Didn&#39;t they?

For a brief second, it appears as if Rider lost the spirit to fight. This quickly changed when she heard the voice of her Master. That&#39;s right. Servant business. How could she forget...

&quot;R..Right! I got them!&quot; With a shaky voice, Rider cleared her voice and dove straight back into the action. People were less sturdy than constructs of stone so she held back her punches. Her bursts of speed allowed her to close the distance and proceed to strike at the remaining guards. A swift knee to the guts, a clean hit against the jaw, and finally a kick to dispatch the rest. 

Now all she needs is to deal with Lor-

&quot;We should leave!&quot; 

Rider was out of breath. Already? No, her eyes were too focused. Was she... panicking? &quot;We don&#39;t know how many more they have. A quick retreat would be best, Master! I can&#39;t use my strengths in a enclosed space like this.&quot; Good. She made an decent excuse. Hopefully it is convincing enough.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022592830373367830 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022592830373367830><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Sep-22 05:38 AM">05:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagaranara</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A largely successful heist that resulted in obtaining a servant by her own means rather than the supposed benevolence of the city already had her body churning with excitement. The danger of this fight only heightened that and somehow she&#39;d effectively taken out one third of the guards while her newfound comrade looked badass taking out the rest amidst streaks of lightning and blinding speed. 

She honestly could get used to this kind of excitement in her daily life. It made her feel like she was living in one of those spy thrillers, she already had the cool gadgets, the stunning locales and daring-do. This heist provided her with the capable but brash femme-fatale partner, the aristocratic, calculating villian and the stakes to drive the rest of the story forward in Alexandria&#39;s conflict with Republic. Yes, this is the big adventure she was waiting for!

&quot;Yeah, you show them, Rider!&quot; Amelia couldn&#39;t help but cheer on her servant as she demonstrated her power to both friend and foe. That pause was a little funny but it seemed like her words of encouragement let the servant overcome whatever hestiancy she had. The remaining guards fell down like bowling pins to her speed and strength.

All that was left was to wipe that smug expression off the noble&#39;s face, maybe even humilate him with a good prank and they&#39;d win. However, it seemed Rider had other plans as she turned around to face Amelia.

&quot;Huh? But he&#39;s right there! He&#39;s the only one left standing,&quot; She gestured with an exaggerated wave towards Sudbury and followed it up with a pouty look. 

Rider responded and her tone seemed off, less confident, on the edge of taking flight instead of finishing the fight. Amelia&#39;s face softened and tried to find the right words to pick her up as a familiar but fuzzy memory tickled the back of her mind, just out of view. There were words that would work but why wouldn&#39;t she recall them?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022774628755701760 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022774628755701760><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Sep-22 05:41 PM">17:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;You should listen to your servant there, little Miss Ipomoea. The one thing Rider knows best is tactics and her word is as good as you can get,&quot; Lord Sudbury said, now unperturbed by the violence as he took a handkerchief out of his coat pocket and began to clean his glasses. &quot;I will let you escape with this one, for now I see you have done me a great service.&quot;

&quot;Huh? What do you mean by that? She just beat all your forces with like one skill at most. Shouldn&#39;t you be like begging for mercy or devising some clever escape?&quot;

&quot;No, my dear child and I&#39;d rather you not interrupt my thoughts. I had started today thinking I had acquired a sample of a great general and leader such as the likes of Ptolemy of Egypt or Pompey the Great of Rome. Your surprise theft gave me a preview of who that catalyst actually was bound to. The one before us may be a great general yet her utility is limited and her longevity is only marked by her stubbornness.&quot;

&quot;She would be a liability in a proper war with extraordinary peers. I must thank you for saving me from future embarrassment in the upcoming grail war. She may give you one or two spectacular, flashy victories but those do not win a war, neither will her narrow focus on one objective. I imagine after you leave, you will have many questions for her. Ask this one on behalf of me, why did she not end Rome after her greatest victory and allowed them to wither her away over fifteen years while Carthage crumbled in the distance?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Wait, maybe Rider was right. It was best to retreat. Whatever this guy was saying clearly was messing with her friend and she looked in no shape to continue.

Sigh... &quot;You know what, Rider. You&#39;re right, let&#39;s ditch this place. There&#39;s nothing left here for us,&quot; Amelia made sure to give Lord Sudbury the meanest look she could muster as she took Rider&#39;s hand and guided her down and away.
