Finding herself being brought to the Bazaar. 

Scents filled her nose. Almost threatening to overwhelm her sense of smell. However it was a pleasant experience. Bringing back memories of a long distant time. 

The Matriarch would continue to wander. Eventually coming across a small thrift and novelty store nestled into the whole of the bazaar. Ducking low she entered into the building. Beginning to browse and see what might be fitting of her new collection. 

Finger danced along the bindings of books. Across the small section of glassware. And even threatened to pick up the small collection of paintings. Sure. She stuck out like a sore thumb. But she was for once enjoying herself. 

“This one.” Partly spoke aloud and partly to herself, as her hands grazed an old copy of ‘Beowulf’ annotated by the king of geats himself. “This will be quite the lovely beginning.” That time she spoke to herself, in what could be called a stage whisper.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was a short man admittedly, but no more than what might be considered normal, with a balding spot and a mustache so thick that you might suspect they were swapped very recently. His arms held their own bushel of hair, and his wardrobe was only so plain as to allow the myriad of guests to peruse his actual valuables. 

He was expecting all kinds of folks...just not Servants on their lonesome. The odd one maybe popped in every now and again, but normally they had the decency to not be so gigantic...and fierce looking...and more importantly, dressed so...&quot;freely.&quot;

&quot;Ahhh, yes, a fine choice. The classics of our modern world, our earliest English epic. You have fine taste, ma&#39;am. That will be...mmm...$30 bucks.&quot; 

It was actually 10, but judging from her appearance, he was banking on this Servant not exactly knowing how modern currency worked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her face stared downwards to the shopkeep. &quot;30 bucks.&quot; Grendel&#39;s Mother spoke, her teeth seemingly becoming sharper in that moment. &quot;Perhaps it could be a gift.&quot; What was an attempt at a barter was slowly seeming to become more of a threat for a free item. &quot;Now wouldn&#39;t that be appropriate?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unfortunately for Grendel&#39;s Mother, the man was a bit too old and a bit too weary to give much of a care anymore. 

&quot;But, in case you&#39;ve forgotten, ma&#39;am, the whole world is comprised of ships on an open sea. We ain&#39;t been nowhere close ideal for more than 100 years, and that means: 30 bucks, or you give me something of equal value.

He had known from his lessons the size of a Stella Maris was something to truly marvel...but the amount of districts and biospheres was something he was sorely unprepared for. He had to sift through this landscape for a workshop? The only reference he truly had for one was his father&#39;s, and that was a massive library of books, materials, failed experiments and even more books. His own eyes looked as sunken as his father&#39;s as he poured through the map, also taking into account the information gathered from the Republic Embassy. So far he only knew of two other teammates: a man named Lex Stravos and an Alexander Vladisnova. There wasn&#39;t too much info regarding either; not even their Servants. It really did seem like Simon was on his own, the boy running a hand through his alabaster hair, pulling a few strands as he steeps himself the numerous districts, not even sure himself what spot would offer tactics, or even what tactics to use, what cover these districts would provide...he doesn&#39;t even know what half of that means...

He was just a frantic child desperate to come up with the next move all on his own, conspicuous as they come judging by some of the stares from the crowd wandering by, each person themselves laden with an assortment of cuisines and delicacies.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“You wish for an equal trade. For such an unassuming piece of literature.” She scoffs. “Perhaps this and some other items may make a compelling offer for trade.

As expected of someone as brash as herself, more than a few of the shopkeeps and chefs within the district have already experienced the unruly Servant&#39;s &quot;custom,&quot; primarily consisting of her badmouthing whatever she has Ray buy if it&#39;s not up to her standards before being practically manhandled by her summoner in attempts to keep her from whipping out her weapon. As the first half-hour is spent in a heated back-and-forth, eventually the two break even when Capone&#39;s attention is caught by a nearby pizza place. Reluctantly, she takes the time out of her miniature reign of chaos to inspect the stall with Ray, affording him time to catch his breath... though the same cannot be said for his wallet.

&quot;This shit better be good,&quot; she grumpily comments, standing sternly with her arms crossed as she glares down at the nervous chef. Her eyes seem to study him as he tosses the dough, pretending as if she knows anything on the matter of baking pizza other than her bias from her life in the old world. &quot;Chicago pizza was no joke, Paparazzi. I know the place is a fuckin&#39; puddle of mud now, but if all that managed to come outta the rubble was some half-assed recipe, I&#39;m gonna lose my shit.&quot; Her audible detesting of the cuisine which she has yet to try doesn&#39;t do her newfound reputation any justice, something she seems to actually acknowledge as she sighs and leans against the counter in front of the pizza stand when enough people express their annoyance towards her.

He was about to say something about how Chicago pizza was more of a casserole, but then he remembered who he was talking to and he had a genuine chance of getting baseball batted if he said that.

She nudged him so hard he made him drop his pen, but he still turned around at who she was looking at and raised an eyebrow. “Hmm, dunno him. And I know most of the regulars around here.”

He looked at Capone, and some thoughts came to mind. There were a few things they needed to talk about. Sleeping arrangements, clothing, food, stuff like that. But that could wait, dinner was coming and he couldn’t wait.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber might enjoy that, and more than anything, who would suspect a barn for a Master&#39;s workshop? His plan to stay hidden might be easier than he thought, and it might provide the perfect hideout for Scouting out their fellow republic teammates.

&quot;Okay...this might be okay...this might actually work out.&quot; He says to himself, writing a few notes down on the parchment, unaware of an unexpected guest sidling behind him...

Images of his father flooded back as a hand gripped his shoulder, Simon instinctively throwing himself over his notes, though his sheet from the Republic Embassy blew away as he did so. He desperately tried to reach out for it, only for another hand to reach down and catch it. A woman in a tank top holds it up, keeping a grip on Simon&#39;s wrist as she reads its contents. She was only expecting something embarrassing, like fanfiction about a Servant or something. However, the more she reads, the more she tightens her grip on Simon, eyes slowly widening before handing it off to the rest of her party, each baffled at what could be so important to distract from their feast.

Another takes pause before reaching out, eyeing his friend before glancing down himself. Just like her, it was slow at first, as he wasn&#39;t expecting much himself. But the briefing gave him all he needed to know. 

&quot;Oh you gotta be kidding me...&quot;

His hand clasps over the paper, crumbling it before he reaches out and grabs Simon by the scruff of his shirt, the boy&#39;s supplies scattering to the ground as he lifts him up effortlessly to eye level. 

&quot;You&#39;re a fuckin Republic stooge, that right?&quot; He asks through his teeth, breathing heavily into Simon&#39;s face as the boy wrestles with his hand. 

&quot;Let me go, hey...stop you&#39;re hur-&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; he says, shaking Simon hard before bringing him in closer. His veins bulge against his hand, quivering with heat and shaking to fight the urge to slam Simon against the ground. &quot;You think you can come onto our turf and threaten us?

He throws Simon back, the boy rolling over the table and landing hard on the ground, a pained gasp and clamping of his wrist making it clear it was sprained. He groans as he struggles to pull himself up, his map and supplies being thrown on top as the party begins to recede. 

&quot;I hope you die, pipsqueak!&quot; One of the group calls back, snickers and high fives abound as Simon picked himself back up, hiding his face as much as possible while the bazaar carried on like nothing happened...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021221893363204166 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021221893363204166><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 10:51 AM">10:51</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="FlyingDeLorean#6266">@FlyingDeLorean</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Unknown">@Unknown</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite her usual brashness, Capone has the restraint not to take up arms in defense of who is, in her eyes a random nobody, merely observing as the poor lad is beaten down by the Alexandrian locals. A Republican, they say? While the Servant only knows Ray&#39;s brief description of the ongoing events which she halfheartedly listened to, she knows this much; they aren&#39;t Ray&#39;s people. Fortunately for the strange boy before her, Capone doesn&#39;t consider herself as entirely one of &#39;Ray&#39;s People&#39; either, and so in the aftermath of his unpleasant interaction, Simon soon finds the woman standing over him with a somewhat tense, but mostly interested gaze.

&quot;An insider for the Republic, huh? Brown nosin&#39; ain&#39;t exactly a comfortable line of work, if ya catch my meaning,&quot; she comments, crouching down before the man in a rather compromising position given her attire, though she seems as if she couldn&#39;t care less. Turning her head back to Ray, she waves him over, before her eyes turn back to the man before her as her naturally cold gaze gives question as to if she&#39;s here to add another bruise to Simon&#39;s battered body or not.

&quot;Luckily for you, I got a feelin&#39; we can help each other out. My associate and I are doin&#39; a piece on this whole &#39;Church versus Republic&#39; business and we&#39;d love to talk about it over some dinner. The paper&#39;ll be unbiased of course, and if ya need a safe exit back outta this place, we&#39;ll be glad to throw that in too.&quot; Flashing a smile, she nudges her head towards the piece she&#39;s been holding firmly in her hand this whole time, before turning once again to Ray. A silent stare between the two speaks more than words could, with a gentle nod telling him that she&#39;s found someone who can help the photographer out... and hopefully afford her some brownie points with the man so she has a more like-minded partner at her side.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The hero admittedly described her as something more terrible, more ancient than her child. Holding some respect for the matriarch it seemed. Her interest however, dwindled again. Being dragged away by the world around her once more. Beowulf’s writing shifting back to the humans of Heorot. Less about herself, or her child. 

Grendel’s Mother’s gaze drifted away from the book in her hands and back to the streets surrounding her. A spark of green hair caught her attention, most definitely it was Simon. Being cornered by a woman, and a man with a camera. She began to stride into the shadows and watch from a distance, seeing what would happen to the boy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He smiled at him, and helped him up. Despite the Servant’s more intimidating nature, the young man beside him seems to be of a much softer nature, who genuinely wanted to help. With the state between her and Capone, Ray gave a smile. Well, this certainly would gain him a bit of trust between them in his eyes.

“I’m Raymond, photographer and journalist for one of the newspapers. And . . . it looks like I’m in this too. You’ve already met my compatriot, Archer.”

Hiding the pain that was prickling at the nerves in his wrist, the marks around his neck, and the sunken lids of his eyes. He had been here before, crouched and twitching, waiting for when it might be safe to unfurl. Like an insect. Like filth. 

This world was no different from the manor. It was much bigger, but it&#39;s walls were still there. Rigid and sturdy, like a cage enclosing him. No freedom to truly be like the others...no experiences to share with human beings. He saw the same emptiness, the same void in his own father&#39;s glare. They treated him like an enemy, but he knew deep down what they really wanted to call him. 

<em>Husk. Dog. Shell.</em>

The bazaar&#39;s colors betrayed the apathy from the crowd, Simon doing his best to hide his own face from those that didn&#39;t even care to look while he sought his map and documents, hands grazing the ground as he searched blindly. 

<em>&quot;An insider for the Republic, huh?&quot;</em> 

He looked up dumbly, merely reacting to the comment, and receiving quite the show from the woman&#39;s position. At first, he wasn&#39;t entirely sure what he was looking at. But even he was taught simple anatomy, and knew of the dreaded wardrobe malfunction. From his own experience, and witnessing his grandfather suffer at its hands, and he was dangerously close to seeing another. 

He blushes, turning his eyes from the woman to the gun in her hands, the color draining once more as he tried to slowly inch his way back. That gun...was not the ease of mind she thought it was. 

Her associate was a little more delicate, however. Simon glanced to him, finding solace in his more traditional attire, all overlayed with a simple jacket. It was hard to specify exactly what drew his comfort, and the exact words escaped him as he absorbed the view. But simply put: he looked <em>cool.</em> 

&quot;...wait, Archer?&quot; Was all the boy could manage, taking another look at the woman, studying her features once more as the pieces fell together.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021986602316206171 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021986602316206171><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 01:29 PM">13:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>Wait...wait, the reports didn&#39;t mention an Archer or a Ray. I mean...it didn&#39;t mention all of my teammates, but...if they&#39;re asking about the War...could they be?</em> 

Were they the enemy? Alexandrians? Suddenly he envisioned a &quot;safe exit&quot; looking a lot more like a march behind a back alley, the boy rising to his feet as he tries to gather his things together, looking for a possible excuse. &quot;Um...th-thats really kind of you, but...but uh...&quot; 

He looks around, hoping to catch sight of Saber in the crowd. How can she be this hard to spot, she towered practically over some of the stands! That slate grey skin didn&#39;t flash in the throng of beads and cloths swatting in the wind as the crowd shoved past, and he realized he truly was on his own. Did she even have any intention on meeting up with him?! Or did she ditch him immediately? 

&quot;...I&#39;m...allergic to...pizza?&quot; He said, a bold faced lie that could be seen clearly by both, and evidence enough that he wasn&#39;t exactly skilled in the art of deception. &quot;B-besides, I wouldn&#39;t know anything, I just got...I mean, I&#39;m not in the tournament or-or anything, I don&#39;t know what those guys were talking about, I&#39;m just-&quot; he said again before the Republic Embassy document once again slipped away, landing squarely in front of Archer and Ray and proudly showcasing the names of two other Republic Masters, along with his own: Simon Despierro.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shaking her head, she seems content to already give up on who is quickly coming off to her as useless, before her eyes glint upon noticing written roster flutter towards them. The dainty appearance of the sheet begets its importance, with Capone snatching the piece of paper before standing to Ray&#39;s side.

 Leaning on Ray&#39;s shoulder, she hands him the note to look over before using that same hand to pull him close, and giving the photographer&#39;s body a gentle sway while forcing a hardly convincing smile to flash before the man below them.

&quot;Come on now, do we look like the type to rat ya out, mister...&quot; she briefly glances at the sheet, &quot;Despierro?&quot; Lifting her weight from Ray, she crouches down again to help poor Simon dust himself off when she sees him stand, though given that this same helping hand is wielding a submachine, it comes off as more forceful than helpful, and to any onlooker could look more like she&#39;s fixing to shake him down for money. Fortunately this proves not to be the case as she steps back to inspect Simon&#39;s more roughed up appearance, her eyes glancing impatiently to the pizza awaiting them before they swap back to face Simon. 

&quot;We&#39;re here to <em>write</em> the papers, my friend. Not soak &#39;em with your blood. If we wanted that, youse would be lookin&#39; more like a slice of swiss cheese than the fine gentleman I see standing before me.&quot; With the crowd less hostile, but still exchanging glances with the standing trio, Capone as such pulls Ray in to lean with her towards Simon, speaking to him in a hushed tone of which her gentle words betray her stare. &quot;All we&#39;re askin&#39; for is an exclusive.

He put up his hands in a sign of peace. “I promise, I’ll do absolutely nothing to hurt you. I have no intention of getting into a fight with anyone, for as long as I can at least.”

He was tugged in by his Servant and handed a piece of paper, the man would pocket it for later since he didn’t want to be distracted by anything. “My partner here might be a bit . . . crude, but more or less she’s right. All I want’s a story. I promise, I’ll redact any information that could lead back to you, and I won’t publish anything until after this whole ordeal is over.”

Ray liked to think he had integrity as a journalist. He had no ill will in his intentions and kept his word when he made a promise. And with his journalistic intuitions, he noticed something in the corner of his eye. Like a shadow moving.

Ray looked to his Servant, and gave her a bit of a look. He made a lowering motion with his hand and kept glancing at her gun, signaling to lower it and back off. A Servant is never far from their Master, like a ball and chain, and he had no intention of getting into a fight here in public.

He looked back to the boy, and gave a smile, he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a notebook and pen, scribbling something down on it. “One interview’s all I need, and it doesn’t even have to be now. Just give it some thought.”

He tore out a page and gave it to him. On it was some basic information.

Raymond Arkenholz 
The Daily Star

Beneath that was a phone number, the one he used for work. “You can gimme a call whenever you wanna have a talk. Or, don’t. I’ll understand either way, since this is all so sudden and a bit of caution is understanding, given what we’re ‘supposed’ to do.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Simon took another tentative look around, just barely missing the stone-faced Saber&#39;s effortless gliding through the packed crowd that continued to push around them. These two...were not as he had imagined Alexandria&#39;s Masters. If anything, the warm greeting he had received from Alexandria&#39;s citizens was something he expected upon his arrival. It didn&#39;t hurt any less, but he recognized the pain that the people of this city were feeling upon feeling threatened. Like an animal backed into a corner. But did these two truly...just want to talk? Ray had mentioned being in this, so there would be the likelihood that they would potentially have to fight. Here he was, alone, with no Servant to protect him, and yet the reporter and Archer were just interested in the story itself. Maybe this really was a boat of scholars. Some taking to their studies a little more than others. 

&quot;...Okay,&quot; he said, softly, reaching out and accepting the page, staring intently at the name, &quot;The Daily Star.&quot; He would have to seek the business out itself, perhaps without Saber in tow.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022360443840368710 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022360443840368710><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Sep-22 02:15 PM">14:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...I was serious though. About before, I wouldn&#39;t know that much. I&#39;m just here as a representative for my fa...my house,&quot; he says, catching himself. He did still have a duty to represent his father, which could best be done by not idly throwing around the word &quot;father&quot; like some lost child. Well, he was, but a reputation starts by taking on the bravado that comes with a name. They knew he was a Despierro, so he had better start acting like it. &quot;I&#39;m a representative for house Despierro in this war. Maybe...once I get settled, I can pay you two a visit. For the service of the story, of course. A-and, I expect you to keep that promise of anonymity! If my teammates knew I was willingly speaking to the ene...the opposition, it might not be a good look.&quot; Enemy...even starting to say it didn&#39;t feel right on his tongue. Opposition was a little odd too, but technically that&#39;s what they were. He would have to remain firm on that, lest he forget his ultimate mission. 

&quot;I...look forward to seeing you more in amicable situations, Raymond Arkenholz. And you as well, Archer. Though hopefully you will never have to face my own Servant. She is quite the...frightening individual.&quot; His arms crossed and head bowed, Simon took after his father well...at least, he thought so. The air of intended boasting and pride only came off as a bit odd for his temporary comrades, watching a 12 year old in pompous attire try to pretend to stack up to either in terms of bravado. &quot;Yes, my Saber can be quite the stone-faced killer. She was the talk of the boat on our way over, as she struck fear into men, women and especially children. I remember pitying them, for having to stare upon those dark features. Eyes that could steal your very soul, and teeth that could grind it into ether.&quot; It would be most unfortunate if his Servant could hear his...unflattering remarks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Matriarch gliding towards them and reaching at the most opportune time. 

While Simon was describing his own servant the shadow of Grendel’s Mother made her appearance. “How flattering, <em>Master</em>.” She spoke, leaning down ever so slightly to be closer to eye level with the others. Her skin was a slate coloration, adorned with very loose clothes very nearly reaching the point of public indecency, her teeth were inhumanly sharp, and features strong and angular, but most peculiarly was that fresh scent of an ocean breeze(something which Simon had long grown nose-blind towards.). 

 “Introduce me to your friends, child.” She spoke straightening herself back to her fullest height. Head cocked to one side, akin to a dog finding something curious. In her right hand rested a book, the left remained empty for the time being. But seemingly ready to strike at the moment’s notice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Leaving the two to their affairs, she nods along while her attention slowly but surely finds itself tugging towards a peculiar presence, one that has her hairs instinctively stand on end, her teeth gritting without her realizing as she begins to look around.

&quot;Uh huh. Yeah, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re hot shit,&quot; she haphazardly comments, her expression narrowing to a hostile scowl. Her finger quivers over her trigger in impatience, and as her paranoia heightens she nudges Ray to get his attention, her ready stance giving a wordless statement of caution towards the boy. Once her gaze meets the body of Grendel&#39;s Mother, Capone hurries to lift her weapon, readily aiming the loaded gun towards the woman&#39;s lowered head with naught a hint of fear in her eyes. Only aggression.

&quot;Hey- <em>Hey!</em> Back it up, wide load,&quot; she barks, standing before Ray in what could be seen as her actually worrying for his safety. She could sense that the woman before her was alike in nature: a fellow Servant, summoned to aid and protect Simon just as Capone is intended to do with Ray. Though Ray and Simon themselves may be more rational and cordial between themselves as Masters, Capone has every reason to be less than friendly friendly towards the young lad&#39;s summon, especially considering her likewise battle-ready stance which looks to face off against Capone&#39;s own. &quot;We ain&#39;t here to start no shit. Just wanted to ask the kid some questions. You try and take it any other way and that pretty, sand-smellin&#39; ass of yours is goin&#39; right back into the ocean.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ask your questions of the child, and then we shall be on our way. Or perhaps you&#39;d like to be returned to the grave?

The apathy of Grendel&#39;s Mother was of no concern to Capone... she cared not if her enemy were pleading for her life or returning the gesture of hostility so long as she has her own nerve to rely on for confidence. &quot;Only thing I <em>might</em> regret is not livin&#39; long enough to get this interview of Paparrazi&#39;s published, but youse will find that I&#39;m well-versed in not takin&#39; threats lightly.&quot;

All that stops the two from going at each other&#39;s throats is the cessation of hostility on Saber&#39;s side, for once she reverts to her more unassuming appearance, Capone hesitantly lowers her weapon. &quot;I&#39;m the Archer of Chicago, hot tits. And if you think to rat us out to whoever&#39;s settin&#39; up these fuckin&#39; tournament matches, I&#39;ll make sure to put a bullet in you both.&quot; With a strap situated near the barrel and at the butt of her gun, she finally relents and slings it at her side like a satchel, giving a heavy sigh at what could be perceived as relief that it didn&#39;t come to a crossfire. The reality of the gesture however, was that she was still <em>starving</em>, and so with the work of a journalist being better suited to the, well... journalist, Capone turns to leave the two so she can indulge in her lunch, giving Grendel&#39;s Mother a quick glare despite that with her seat still remaining within range of the three people.

 &quot;If that don&#39;t spell it out for you, then I&#39;d read up on the name &#39;Al Capone&#39;. Ol&#39; Paparazzi here plans to write a piece on me if I make nice.

From fear, most definitely. But behind that, ever so faintly, there was a beating of excitement in there too. Another Servant! She was fine one moment, then appeared more beast like. 

He was looking at Capone as she stepped in front, getting ready to fire. It made his spirit feel a bit better, knowing on some level she actually cared. But he knew better than to step between two Servants who were in a spat. But he calmed down when Capone seemed to reach her senses and lowered her gun. She went back to their seats, and Ray nodded towards her. Partially acknowledging things would be okay, and partly as a thank you, for protecting him. He turns back to the two, an gave a nod to the ‘enemy’ Servant.

Through all the fright and anxiety of his heart pounding, he gave a great smile and and looked right at her. “Thank you. I’m glad things worked out amicably for us tonight.”

He gave a smile and a nod, to the Servant and to her Master. “The invitation extends to the both of you. And you have my promise, I’ll include no pieces of information in the piece that can lead back to you, either of you. I don’t think my ‘allies’ would be fond of me ‘consorting with the enemy’ either. I’m interested in the truth, not the War itself.”

He gave one more grateful nod to the both, and went to join his compatriot for the pizza. He sat down at the barstool next to hers, and exhaled. “Well that went well.”

He gave her an appreciative look and a nod. “Thank you. That took a level to navigate that, and I’m glad we’re both not dead right now.”

He gave a big smile, and grabbed a slice of pizza. “Here’s to a successful day. We met each other, met some interesting people, and I got myself a possible new lead on an interview. I’d say today was a nice day.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Come along, child.” She spoke to Simon before taking off. Her business within the bazaar complete.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;S-sure,&quot; he said in response to Ray&#39;s smile, not able to muster the strength for his own, but rejuvenated enough to rejoin the conversation. Yes...Ray Arkenholz...he liked the idea of seeing him again...and maybe even Archer as well. 

&quot;Right, Saber,&quot; he says quickly, joining at The Matriarch&#39;s side as they leave the bazaar.
