Pink, polka dots, lace curtains, cute portraits of animals on the wall and even more pink. If Rider didn’t know any better, he might’ve thought himself to be in the bedroom of a pre-teen girl with dreams of becoming a princess.

But if he paid close attention beyond the decorations, Rider could spot a number of odd post-its on one side of the wall. 

IT IS MARCH 8TH, 2105

CURRENTLY ON NOTEBOOKS L-47, M-190

SERVANT FRAME IS IN WAREHOUSE-82. NOTEBOOKS TO BRING FOR NOTES ON SUMMONING: M-185, M-186, M-187

<strong>DON’T FORGET ABOUT JOHN</strong>

Other post-its with banal information plastered the rest of the wall, and as far as Rider could tell, almost all of them looked recent. Still firmly sticking to the wall, their color vibrant and their ink fresh. How odd…

Before the Servant could further ponder the meaning of these notes, Thomas stepped inside the bedroom with a large drink in his hand. Shortly after him, a monkey waddled inside the room with a second large drink on a tray, which he proceeded to present to Rider.

Thomas immediately sat on his computer chair, turning with a whirl to face his white-haired Servant. He softly blew on the contents of his drink, what Rider guessed by the smell to be coffee, then spoke.

“Now, let’s get down to business.” Thomas said before taking a small gulp. “You’re probably curious as to why you’ve been summoned, aren’t you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The rider, obvious by how he marveled at the scenery of Alexandria. He couldn’t have expected such a place to have. . . Well, so much! The lad had almost tripped over himself once he left that dusty old warehouse, his eyes peeled on everything. The bright lights, the way the world smelled like the ocean. . . The sights of nicely dressed individuals! For such a young master, he was correct. He blended almost perfectly within the crowds. Many children having overly dressed and under dressed outfits almost made the soldier feel like one.

Finally, they made it to the home of the his master, quick to wonder if maybe this magus had lived like the scenery of the land he’d been summoned on. Sadly, he’d been a tad mistaken, for such a mage who he assumed would have been wise and knowing, his room was almost child like as well. Rider looked at his master with an accusing glance, worried that maybe he had been summoned by an actual child, not even taking notice of the fact that not many children would have possessed the knowledge to summon him if anything. He cleared his throat.

“Master, I would think a mage’s home be more. . . Mage like.”

His words were small and his best attempts to be subtle without sounding rude. It wasn’t meant to be rude, rather it was his way of showing concern. He didn’t notice that his master had slipped away, quick to return with cups as a monkey held a tray. There was but many things he could have asked first, but The fragrance of coffee alerted his senses. The rider quickly took a random cup, and like a true child, put it to his lips, ignorant of the contents that he could smell. He made a pause and then a noise, something between a sigh and a hum of affirmation. 

“Thi—this is not coffee. . . And these small orbs at the bottom. What is it? I could have choked on one you know? And why the monkey, does everyone here just keep exotic animals for the fun of it?”

The only thing he could do was sip on his overtly sweet coffee as his Servant’s line of questioning grew more and more intense, the question he himself asked lost in the sea of curiosity that oozed out of Rider’s mouth.

“Okay, one thing at a time…” He finally said as soon as Rider grew quiet. “Firstly, just because I’m a Magus does not mean I should neglect taking care of my house. Just like most things in life, I like my house <em>cute</em>. If it’s not cute, I can neither rest nor focus. The polka dots and the pink are both non-negotiable, alright?!”

Thomas’ sudden outburst was accompanied with a few self-satisfied nods, cementing his position on a subject Rider probably cared little about. But true enough, having spent more than a few years in mediocre houses with mediocre decorations in a mediocre body, taking care of both himself and his environment ranked high in his list of priorities. So high in fact that the only things that mattered more were his work and objective in life.

“As for your beverage, it is called a <em>bubble tea</em>. A cold and sugar mixture of black tea and milk containing chewy tapioca pearls at the bottom. You may eat those as you drink the liquid, they’re meant to be savored both at the same time.”

Thomas stopped and focused for a second, calling the monkey to climb his lap.

As for why a monkey specifically, I needed a familiar small enough that I could easily take control of it, but with an advantageous morphology that would allow him to take care of the chores around my house. Hence, a monkey.”

Snapping his fingers, Apu grabbed Thomas’ half-empty drink and waddled his way back to the kitchen. With those questions out of the way, Thomas folded one leg over the other as he turned the chair back towards the bookshelves on his desk.

“Now, as for your summoning,” He said as he picked an empty notebook and placed it on his lap, turning back towards his Servant. “In summary, your mission is to fight at my side in the upcoming City Grail War against Republic.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was a good answer, but polka dots. . . Was an answer he didn’t expect at all. A room had to have polka-dots? That was just more childish than he looked, and it looks had been deceiving, then maybe while a child he was just a skilled magus. The servant shook his head, shaking the thought off into the atmosphere.

“Bubble Tea?“

The rider took another sip, though his concern with how he was to drink and eat all at once was shown quite easily. The tea and milk a good flavoring, something he had never thought of doing, but the flavor of the sugary drink really was what made him smile. . . With a black Pearl stuck in between his teeth. 

“It’s amazing, I wonder who thought it first. Who came to think that milk and tea with these <em>t—tapoica</em> things would have been so good!”

His misspelling of the word going over his head entirely. He took one more sip, almost finishing the rest of the glass before he jumped onto the bed kicking his legs against the duvet. Ah, 2 questions answered. Rider’s eyes went towards the next subject, the monkey. A Guinea baboon huh? Baboooooon. . zHe hadn’t seen one before, the rider’s kicking slowed, peering at it with more curiosity. An animal he hadn’t discovered, but heard of. He made a mental note of it. He’d discovered one today. 

His summoning had been just as easily explained as the monkey or the tea. Almost as casual as if they were all of equal value. Tapioca, Familiars, City Grail Wars. The rider blinked a bit, his face once again registering the way he said it, then he nodded. He’d be fighting. 

“But why are we fighting? I put my life on the line for a duty but I don’t know what we are fighting for? And why did they choose you? What reason could that even be?”

A stare of displeasure, like that of a parent trying to explain something important to their child, only for that same child not to pay the slightest bit of attention to the explanation.

Not to mention that Rider’s impatience slowly weighed down on him as well. As soon as he was fed answers, he couldn’t help but jump to his next list of inquiries without break. This was gonna be a long day.

“...I was just about to get to the specifics,” Thomas said as he opened the notebook and started taking notes. “That is, before you started interrupting me with the mention of <em>tapoica things</em>. Ta-pio-ca. Pronounce it correctly, would you.”

After a bit more scribbling, Thomas folded the notebook and held it to Rider’s eyes. The page showed one big circle and a smaller circle that seemed to touch it from the side. Thomas tapped the circles with his pencil.

“I trust your Core has already embedded your brain with the knowledge of nomadic cities, is that right? That’s what those circles represent. The big one is Alexandria, the side we will be fighting for. The small one is Republic, our enemy in this war.”

If he hadn’t been so young, Rider might’ve linked him to a teacher speaking to one of his students.

“To make a long story short,” Thomas went on, closing his notebook. “Republic has forcefully docked with Alexandria in order to steal its data. We’re fighting in order to prevent that from happening.”

“Or that’s the gist of it, at least.” He ended as he spun once more on his chair and reached for another notebook labeled <strong>M-187</strong> while he stored the previous one in the bookshelf. He immediately started reading the second notebook, turning the pages quicker than he could read. Or at least, that’s what it looked like. Rider noted, however, that he did not answer to his last question. Was it a touchy subject? The Servant could only guess.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While his master took the time to correct his obvious mispronunciation of tapioca, he had taken the liberty to finish his drink, chewing on the gummy orbs as he was chided. Maybe he was like a child who didn’t fully listen to the explanation. . . He sure didn’t seem to care, yet he nodded when the master spoke, keeping his eyes on him while he talked.

The circles his master drew coaxed a tilt of his servants’ head. A disfigured eight, one large circle clearly almost engulfing the other. When he explained that these were the nomadic cities, then did the memory of the nomadic cities become clear once again. He had learned of it, how these were now the cities left of humanity. That much he remembered. 

His explanation was easy to grasp, the magus going on and on while the boy nodded enthusiastically. So, that was his enemy. The Republic. They were trying to steal data? But for what reason could they have wanted for it? The soldier cocked his head once again to the side, he closed his eyes to imagine what they could have been wanting it for.

“What data are they trying to steal? And don’t they have their own?”

His curiosity and his master’s answers had elicited another question. His master had already showed distaste for it, but it wasn’t something the servant felt he personally could stop. Or had the idea how to stop. But his question was genuine. Had the master thought why they wanted this data? What could this data have that no one knew? And for such a childish look, he was clearly observant. He questioned it again.

“And why do you have to get it? You didn’t answer my question.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It could be any number of things: ServantPedia™’s master copy, the data we recently gathered from the third expedition to Nirvana, folders full of dirt on their higher-ups… we don&#39;t have a clue about what they exactly want.”

And to be frank, Thomas didn’t care at all about what. No matter what Republic sought or for what reason, nothing excused their unsolicited assault and barbaric methods. Really, did they think of themselves as gods? Did they truly expect Alexandria to bend over and kneel to their outrageous demand? Did they think even for the slightest second that the great Alexandria would hand over what it has built for over a hundred years to the first city that came knocking down on its door? 

<strong>Truly, what nerves!</strong>

The faintest of frowns glossed over Thomas’ face as he thought back to the nonsensical circumstances Alexandria had been thrown in. Not a tired frown like he had shown Rider earlier, but an irritated, ‘I can’t believe this is actually happening’ kind of frown.

Thomas closed his notebook and stood up from his chair, closing the distance between him and his Servant with a blank expression on his face.

“Because being ‘peaceful’ means we are capable of great violence. Otherwise, the word would be ‘Harmless’, and I don’t think we’re quite as harmless as some would think.”

Thomas reached out with his hand, the one which had the three command spells inscribed into it, hoping for a handshake. This handshake would most likely seal the deal for Rider’s involvement in the upcoming war.

“Now that you know about our circumstances,” He said, his entire expression screaming ‘no nonsense’. “Do you still accept to fight as my Servant, Rider?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The idea that someone had been so audacious and arrogant enough to demand had truly made the rider frown back. His once curious expression of genuine morphing to disagreement that perfectly  accentuated his features. They didn’t have a clear direct source of what they wanted, yet they demanded it anyway? That wasn’t fair for the primary party at all A <em>huff</em> was made.

His master’s enthusiasm on the idea of fighting for his home was enough to make Rider want to fight as well. A sliver of emotional giddy rose inside him, almost like a firecracker had been lit in his chest, rambunctiously crackling in his lungs and heart. They’d have to win this battle and save Alexandria from having their information stolen, and he was ready for it. He’d fight. His kicking returned, the speed of them almost as fast as his brain racing at the thought of what they’d do. Each foot hitting the bed frame with an ever increased <em>Thud, thud, thud.</em>
 
“They won’t get away with it! Long as they pose a threat towards it, we can help!”

His voice hit an octave higher than he wanted, his already young voice breaking a bit. The crackling in his chest felt more and more heated. Almost like his master was simply pouring gasoline on the once little sparks that went about. Now, they felt lively and erratic. He could do that, he could show that Alexandria wouldn’t hold back! Because for what his master assured them, they weren’t harmless.

The hand the man reached out towards him was enough to make Rider grab it and hold onto it. He knew it meant that they’d be partners. A smile slid onto his face, showing his teeth as if he had made a deal in his favor.

“I accept them, I accept them a lot! We can do this! Let us have the most fun in this fight. We shall win!”

While Rider might’ve been youthful and childish, those traits could prove to be an asset this time. Thomas was certain Rider wouldn’t deceive him on the pretext of falsely accepting their partnership. He said he would fight, and a kid is frank and always tells what’s on his mind… although, by applying that same logic to his entire discourse, then the mention of ‘having fun’ did raise a few questions… but those could be addressed later.

“Now that that’s out of the way,” Thomas started. “I think now is a good time to properly introduce ourselves to one another. I shall start.”

The Master fixed his hair some, tugged on his lab coat to eliminate any folds and rearranged his glasses. It seemed he took great importance in looking his best for these formalities, Rider noted. His hands on his hips, Thomas spoke up.

The boy nodded vigorously when it was time for introductions. It was true he wanted to know what his master was, he was curious what could have summoned him and why he chose him specifically! He wanted to see what his master was!

“Yes yes! I wanna know my master, tell me your name mhm! Mhm!”

His encouragement of this much needed introduction only accentuated his master’s flair. What was he! Who could he have been?! He had to be a master who did so much already, he’d discovered Guinea Baboons, and informed him on bubble teas and had knew magecraft as a kid too, he had to be something of almost as close as the best. And almost then, when he heard his name, the poor master wouldn’t have had registered the idea of what rider could do, rather the rider was much faster than he expected before he had given the master a hug, the kid’s weight thrown across the man in full force. It was Jefferson! It was his Jefferson! 

“<em>Jefferson! Jefferson!</em> You’ve seen me again! It’s me, Lewis! You’re my master?! You are here and look the same too! How are you not a servant though. . . Did you really find out what to do with the information?“

His exhilaration was almost palpable, as if his aura seeped a sweet stickiness that could have easily made even the sweetest tooth rot and decay with ease. He clearly hadn’t heard the man’s full name, Thomas <em>what</em>? But who was this Jefferson?  Lewis hadn’t elaborated much on it, rather he hadn’t elaborated on his own name much either. Lewis? There were plenty of Lewis’ in the world. . . Had the boy thought simply a first name was just as specific for his full name? And how could he have remembered this Jefferson‘s face clearly enough to compare him to his master? It couldn’t have been possible. 

“I told myself I’d see you again! I promised it! And it’s here! You’re here!”

<em>He is clearly confounding me with someone he once knew in life. Judging from his words, it seemed this person was fairly close to him. Jefferson, Jefferson… the name seems familiar, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Did I forget again?</em>

Thomas’ thoughts began pouring in as his Servant kept blabbering, trying to explain his erratic reaction with what little he knew. One thing was sure: whoever this Jefferson is, Thomas wasn’t he. He needed to clear this misconception fast, lest another surprise hug come to break his back.

As soon as Lewis was done talking, Thomas pushed him away and climbed back to his feet, rearranging once again his clothes and his glasses as he cleared his throat. 

“...Barnes. Thomas <em>Barnes</em>.” He said, finally ending his previous sentence. “It seems you think I’m someone else, Ri… erm, Lewis. I don’t know anything about this Jefferson, nor about this <em>information</em> he had to deal with, nor about you.

He wasn’t Jefferson, rather he was Barnes. Two totally different people, from what <em>he</em> said. Lewis shook his head, okay. And the fact that he hadn’t heard of Jefferson was enough to make him shocked too! He was always known as Jefferson! At least to Lewis.

“You don’t know Jefferson?! He’s always been super popular. . . But, I guess he’s been always up in the house for so long maybe he hadn’t met a lot of others. . . But still, I’m sure people had kept him in books around here. He’s made it into a lot of them! Everyone in the states knew what he was like. I thought you too would know, <em>Barnes</em>.”

Lewis couldn’t even fathom the idea that someone just named Jefferson could have been this popular yet unknown. To Thomas, he was just a nobody of the Rider’s imagination, if he were apart of human history, clearly he’d had gone by something better than <em>Jefferson No Last Name</em>. But, the way he called him <em>Barnes</em> clearly meant that he had knew his name was Thomas. Was he just omitting his first name? That, that was odd. But, for his comment on him not knowing a Lewis servant, that always worried the rider more than he knew. 

“You don’t know me? I’m Jefferson’s best best-friend, Lewis! You have to know me right? I did the things, I sailed to places no one had gone before! I’m Lewis. . .

“You sure you don’t know of us? I thought people were happy to have us around. . . Maybe Alexandria isn’t the place for information. . . I’m sure the states would have kept a memory of us.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Clark. Lewis and Clark… no, nothing. Thomas didn’t know, or at best, didn’t remember a single thing about these names.

Of course, <em>Thomas wasn’t surprised one bit</em>.

Strangers waved at him from the streets, yet he had no recollection of ever meeting them. He would often receive calls from people that claimed to know him, yet he knew nothing about. How many times would he go to a new clothing shop only for the workers to call him by name, chummily talking to him as if they had known each other since forever.

To forget about someone was a common occurrence for him. Neighbors, co-workers, fellow scientists from the lab: none were spared by Thomas’ memory issues. If they didn’t remind him regularly, or if he didn’t remind himself by writing and reading his notebooks, then a time would come where he would forget about everyone around him. Like writing in the sand, inevitably washed down by the uncaring waves.

Creepy. Terrifying. <strong>Gut-wrenching</strong>.

Famous people, at that.

Taking a deep breath to calm himself before he spoke, Thomas sat on his chair with his arms and legs folded.

“No. I assure you, I know nothing of you three. I… <em>might</em> have known once, but by now I fear that I have completely forgotten.”

While Thomas didn’t look any different from the outside, the ache he felt in his stomach deepend with each word he talked. He rarely spoke about his issue with other people, but Lewis was not other people. If the two of them were gonna work together to bring Republic down, then he had a right to know. The sooner, the better.

“I, uh… I have an <em>awful memory</em>, so I tend to forget about things… and people. Don’t refer to my knowledge to judge whether you are known or not, Lewis. If you’re as famous as you claim to be, then I’m sure people do know about you. And the same goes for Jefferson and Clark.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But. . . He didn’t even know what the duo was. Rider’s grip on his satchel had slackened. A familiar sense of manic primal worry gnawed on his nerves for a moment. Did people forget the fun he had had? The fun he had <em>during</em> the exploration?

But he could almost feel the silence his master had created for a moment, it’s oppressive force that though Lewis couldn’t comprehend the source of, something about it still kept him from dwelling in his own worries. Before the man could speak, the rider gently put a hand on his shoulder, almost like a child’s intuition of knowing when a parent had been lost in thought. His master needed him, he could help first.

“Well at least you’ve heard of us, me and Clark and Jefferson. I’m sure you’ll remember soon enough! Or, we can have fun and then you can remember the fun we have. . . No need to be sad.”

Lewis’ pats were gentle, soothing even. To Thomas they were to be a consolation. To his rider, an affirmation he’d help have a memory of it.

It felt less like a consolation, and more like a dog’s way of cheering someone up through physical attention.

It could’ve been cute in another context, Thomas wasn’t one to dislike puppies. Only, when it came to personal issues, this level of closedness felt constricting and uncomfortable. He was gonna remember soon enough? How was Lewis able to tell? How would he know if all it took to remember was to have ‘fun’? How could he understand what Thomas went through on a day to day basis?

He couldn’t.

“...thank you for your worries,” Thomas eventually said after an uncomfortable silence, slowly brushing off Rider&#39;s hand. “But neither am I sad, nor do I need cheering up. This partnership isn’t about me or my issues, but about saving Alexandria from the clutches of evil Republic. Let’s keep our internal affairs out of this, please.”

Thomas knew he didn’t mean any harm by consoling him, but he still couldn’t bring himself to accept it. It was like telling a cancer patient that they would get better without knowing the cancer had reached stage 4. A kind gesture, but not an understanding one. And in a way, it hurt a lot more than to be put down by words.

Thomas turned the other side, showing Lewis his back as he looked through yet another notebook on his desk.

“We should start briefing immediately. I shall have Apu make us another round of drinks while we talk about each other’s strengths and weaknesses, abilities and talents, whatifs and whatnots. Is that fine with you, Lewis?”</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 04:45 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Got it!”

The poor boy couldn’t help but wonder what could have made him so quiet. He’d probably not understand much either. Lewis had remembered everything, the sight of the purchase so fresh on his mind he felt he could easily had replicated it in the right circumstances. But his master had bad memory? He couldn’t even begin what could truly fix it.

Thomas’ diversion from the awkward silence he had created was enough to move the boy from the topic. He was correct, they needed to discuss that they could do things in battle. . . As a soldier, it was best to be upfront with their commander, and with a servant, with their master. 

“Mhm! I can tell you lots of what I can do, Clark and Jefferson called me the best soldier out in the wilderness. I’m sure I can help with whatever goes your way, Barnes! What do you want to know first?”

His tone had came to one of certainty, though he had a habit of calling the man by his last name than his first. Yet, patiently, Lewis had waited for his master’s question, his answers already bubbling and brewing on his tongue to be spoken.
