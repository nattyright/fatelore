Ethereal and miasmic. An endless still void of darkness that somehow churned and swirled before his very eyes. The nightmare was not new, and it sent a dull ache through his chest as he realized the haunting that would be coming soon. The sharp chill that would grip the base of his neck and pierce deep into his inner mind to scramble and dim his thoughts into aimless panic had subsided over the years as the boy came to accept that this sight would be with him forever. The sight that let him know truly what he was, and what he would be.

A dream can never truly manifest in order. Human thought, memory, and, most importantly, the subconscious are built and retrieved upon a chaotic network of loose connections and disparate flashes of sensation. To truly be human is to make meaning of this disorder. Personality is fabricated by weaving separate threads through images to derive reaction. Purpose is discovered through interpretation of fulfillment and drive to create, perform or enjoy. Human beings stand atop this world for the simple fact that they can create purpose, image and a sense of self.

The only image that the boy can drive meaning from is the mountain of porcelain limbs and blood soaked visages, all drawn into a blank canvas that betrayed no previous light within their eyes. Empty chasms where no soul had ever truly resided. Faces that resembled his own. Hair that matched his own. Skin much like his own. The decimated, mutilated corpses of mothers, siblings...and even hollowed simulacrums of himself. A mountain of bodies that wishes to house his own atop it. For this was his purpose. To be another in an endless pile of a true human&#39;s drive. A dream can never truly manifest order. Not for a human being. And so, it was constant proof, a reminder that drives itself deep into his very self as he looks on the mountain. This dream repeats because he is not real. He has no purpose. He is not human.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Knock Knock

He was in his room. Reality was starkly prevalent and the awareness of sensation became immediate as he stared listlessly at the clock face sitting atop his nightstand. 6:00 AM. The second hand had just grazed its slender body across the top and ushered in the morning hours as the knock on the door brought him back to conscious thought. He pulls at his bedsheets robotically as his door swings inward. A woman walks through, skin as pale as his own and eyes as strikingly crimson as she captures him in a still gaze. He always noted how long it took her to blink, how unwavering her stare was as he pulled himself out of the large queen sized bed. He often never looked back at her directly, unable to comfortably return her gaze. It was too focused and perfect, as if she was not looking at him, but rather through him, as if he were simply part of the d&#233;cor. He often made it a habit to try and look just to the side of her head. He would find himself blinking more than usual when confronting the servants of his father, the boy even now cursing himself as he did so while making his queen sized bed. The royal blue sheets matched with his pajamas, a two tone blue that he did quite enjoy. It helped him feel distinct, like he could stand out against the dull browns of his woodwork furniture, or the faded cream of his wallpaper. The room was far too big for him, even when it was packed with all manners of opulent decoration, like marble busts depicting former Despierro patriarchs and matriarchs, dressers with illustrious veneer, and a collection of various woodwind instruments, each passed down to the next of kin that possessed the talent to make them sing in the Despierro household. It never ceased to diminish and make him feel miniscule. The blue helped.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018295911841009684 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018295911841009684><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 09:04 AM">09:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>  
&quot;You aren&#39;t dressed, sir.&quot; The woman said, softly, but without emphasis. She spoke as if everything was merely a statement of fact, something he tried his best never to emulate. She often noted his overabundance of exclamation in their conversations, something that annoyed him. 

&quot;I had a bad dream, I&#39;m sorry Priscilla,&quot; he replied, resigning himself to the wrinkled, lumpy mess of his bedspread as he hurries to his closet. Priscilla picked up where the boy left off, smoothing out the sheets and realigning the covers to their correct corners. 

&quot;Your father and grandfather have been preparing for the summoning, they will be finished in mere moments.&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; he says breathlessly, trying to throw on one of the suits just as haphazardly as he made his bed. He was just getting through leaving the tie as a rumpled and pathetic imitation of proper attire when Priscilla gripped his shoulders. She led him firmly to the full length mirror, working to properly decorate him in the house of Despierro, threading the tie effortlessly into a green vest while rolling his cuffs up the length of his arms. Her fingers moved so deftly, and yet her eyes never left Simon&#39;s face, making it all much less like a caretaker and more like a robot. 

&quot;You musn&#39;t be late and disappoint your father. There. You look rather handsome, sir.&quot; There was no weight to the compliment as she slowly led him out the door and into the hallway, its vaulted ceilings only further shrinking him as Priscilla closes the door behind her. &quot;I have to attend to the other house keepers. Caster will be here momentarily to guide you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018296594677911623 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018296594677911623><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 09:07 AM">09:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>  
Simon suddenly gains a veritable interest in the persian patterned carpet, his neck craned away as Priscilla gives him a last pat on the head, the touch cold and remote before she carries on at a brisk pace. Caster. Truly, the last person he wanted to be left alone with was his father&#39;s Servant, especially when it came to today. The news had sent him into a fit of aches and chills when he overhead his father and grandfather discussing it, and it was only hammered deeper when they told him to his face he would be acting on behalf of the Despierro name. The one potential solace was that Caster never lied. If possible, he might be able to ask him something important:

Did his father simply wish to send him to die?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018296636797100103 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018296636797100103><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 09:07 AM">09:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Medusa Island( Soupmaker)</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Having been summoned many years back, brought into the world again at the hand of one Faustus. Funny. That name. It always amused the Caster, just how fitting the name was for the man of the house. Commanding respect and fear all in one. 

Simon however, was not one to be feared. Nor to be respected. He was a meek boy. Always unsure of his place in the world. Something he felt the need to pity, never actually bringing himself to do so though. It did surprise the Caster that Simon was chosen to represent their family instead of Faustus and himself. 

Whatever the reasoning for this, Caster had better things to worry over. Staring forwards as Priscilla scurried on past. 

A lazy knock was heard upon Simon&#39;s door. Promptly followed by the door opening. A sly grin finding itself upon his thin and immaculately shaped face. Green Carnation precisely held to his lapel. &quot;Well. One of us might need to change.&quot; The caster spoke, in reference to Simon&#39;s own manner of dress for this occasion. &quot;Green is a rather... Sickly color upon your skin.&quot; Caster leaned in and began to inspect the boy&#39;s outfit for any other minuscule issues. Only those details which an eye such as theirs could discern. 

&quot;Perhaps, however, The color green is fitting for a day like today.&quot;  The gentlemanly caster turned back towards the door their cape dramatically flowing behind them. &quot;It is too late to have you change, and arrive at the occasion on time.&quot; He sighs, almost disappointed in missing the chance to dress the boy in a more fitting outfit. 

&quot;Now, shall we?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, Caster was a figure that had been in his life since his first memory. From what his father had told him, Caster had been around since before he was even born, having stayed in the house of Despierro as one of a long line of devoted Servants. Casters were by and large a favorite of the family, with each household holding one in high regard. Even with over 100 years of humanity being subjected to the floating illusion of a stable society and a world of greatly diminished mystery, the Despierro&#39;s held a great respect for the reminders of what had once been. His father even still practiced his magecraft and physical prowess to this day, all of it possible with the support and camaraderie (maybe that wasn&#39;t the right word, perhaps business partner was more apt) of Caster. 

From what the boy could tell, Caster held his father in a very similar regard. It was obvious that they shared very similar tastes...and distastes. Himself included. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Simon responded stiffly, walking at a length behind the Caster as each passed through the vaulted halls draped in tapestry and littered with more marbled statues of figures from Despierro. It almost felt like a brick road, one where the echoing steps from their travels only resound and drum through his ears as they grow closer and closer to the next, terrifying chapter of his existence. 

&quot;...Os-I mean, Caster, why didn&#39;t my father volunteer for this? Why send me?&quot;

Does he just want to be rid of me? Why doesn&#39;t he just...do what he did to the rest. The thought of his own body mutilated and split into torn sinew and chopped bone was viscerally present in his mind, at all times, but the fact he was still here did confuse him at times. Surely his father agreed...there wasn&#39;t much to him. He had even sunken to fresh new lows in his last training regiment with his grandfather.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Which was not unusual. The boy was meek. It was hard to actually toy emotions from his being. Make him stand up for himself. The sly smile, typical of caster, soured into a frown for just a moment, something which Simon would not be able to see as they continued their way through the house. 

Marble statues lined their path. The eyes of ancestors constantly staring down upon those who now reside within this place. The silence only being broken by the rhythmic clack of Caster&#39;s shoes upon the wooden floors. Until Simon spoke up, also questioning why he was chosen for this.  

Ever so slightly his head turned over his shoulder. Just enough to place the boy within his periphery. &quot;I have my own theories, on the matter. Being rid of you, is too easy. If he wanted to do so already, you would not be here today. Perhaps it is to test you?&quot; There was a long pause only cut by the sound of the shoes striking the floor. 

&quot;I for one, believe that this grail war wasn&#39;t deemed enough of a challenge for Old Faustus to even bother going.

His incredulity was not altogether surprising. After all, he had been doing rather poorly in his studies and training sessions with his grandfather as of late. If his father wanted to test him, a Grail War seemed like quite the steep call to action. It only continued to speak volumes that Caster would not be the Servant to accompany him as well, although the boy was somewhat thankful for that. So what could he possibly want from Simon? If this was a matter of stature, why not send his grandfather? Based on the last session, he was still powerful enough to hold his own...

He flitted his eyes to Caster&#39;s back, checking to make sure the Servant was paying him no mind before Simon tried discretely to pull a sheet of paper from the sleeve of his coat. He&#39;d been practicing the incantation several times over, fully aware of the consequences of botching the summoning. The very thought of bringing forth a Servant with untamed ability definitely wouldn&#39;t be ideal, and more than anything, outside of his control. His father had told him tales of previous Despierro Masters that summoned unruly Servants. Their statues didn&#39;t decorate their halls, partly out of a lack of respect, but mostly because there wasn&#39;t much to model a statue off of...

Slowly his lips parted, forming over each word of the incantation, his chest tightening as he realized it&#39;s not precisely in his mind like he had hoped. He had to put it together, before he was forced in front of everyone...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;How does it feel, Simon?&quot; Caster broke their silence this time. Asking a genuine question, while keeping their eyes trained forwards. &quot;Bringing another servant into this house. Although, they will not become such a staple as I.&quot; Caster chuckled slightly.

They were further below ground than Simon had previously thought, approaching the cellar deep beneath the mansion. The place where his fate would be tossed up into the hands of the Throne. 

&quot;I...I hadn&#39;t given it much thought,&quot; he said, quickly folding the paper back into his sleeve, perhaps having betrayed the cheat sheet but what harm did it do to give it away now? It&#39;s not as if Caster was going to rebuke him; he&#39;d need to have a semblance of actual empathy for the boy. It&#39;s not as if the two hadn&#39;t talked, but there was always a stilted manner of conversation that stuck between them. It was worse than small talk, it was micro talk. The fact Caster even wanted to know what was going through his mind shook Simon, enough that he didn&#39;t want to waste this opportunity. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m more concerned about just surviving. I don&#39;t know really what to expect...you&#39;re the only Heroic Spirit I&#39;ve ever been in contact with, so I guess I just imagined they were all like you. I just...need someone strong.&quot; 

Caster&#39;s words did strike some kind of cord. After all, if this was a test...he needed to pass. He needed to show some kind of resolve. And the only way to do so was with a Servant of true strength. He often thought of the numerous heroes that might come to his aid. Maybe a shining knight, a king of the battlefield like Artoria Pendragon, or even a warrior that could show true might like Achilles. Human beings by definition, warriors of legend. 

&quot;...I just have the drive to live right now. That should be enough to bring forth someone strong, shouldn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mere meters away from the cellar itself, mere moments from a miracle of modern magecraft. The paper&#39;s crinkle clued him into what Simon was up to in their moments of silence, something which he was not surprised by. 

&quot;I am surprised you did not give it much thought, but perhaps you do have more pressing matters.&quot; The caster moved forwards. Their eyes focused in. For once breaking away from the formality of meaningless small talk, or the needless taunting and prodding of the boy. Trying to actually gain insight into his thoughts, and showing interest. 

&quot;My boy. Simon. If all were just carbon copies of me, well that would just be boring.&quot; He then paused for a moment before continuing. &quot;Strength is an admirable thing to wish for from a servant, but remember. They all have a place upon the throne for showing their unique strengths and skills. Even the weakest of assassins can change a fight. But showing your resolve to live, most definitely should bring forth what you need.&quot; 

He then patted the boy on the head. Usually something he did when showing Simon his place, but this time it was different. It was meant to be a gesture of comfort. &quot;Ah... The appointed hour is upon us. Being fashionably late is not on the docket today.&quot; Caster again turned in a dramatic manner moving forwards again, cape flowing in an equally dramatic fashion. The Cellar door now quickly approaching.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His father hasn&#39;t used this room in a very long time...from what little his grandfather and Caster told him, something happened down here that even Faustus, his father, refused to acknowledge. Something that would even claim him up...

You have my father as a Master. You don&#39;t have to do much to keep him safe...or even satisfied. 

The room itself yawns before Simon as he walks ahead, hands by his side in a form of stiff military March as he walks beneath the stone arch of the doorway. Shadows dance as a pale blue light blinks in the center of the room, casting shapes across dusted bookshelves and long abandoned lab equipment. They marked the early years of an amateur, one that began to look deep into the confines of what made up Alchemy, touching its surface before diving deep into what truly made it stand apart. Simon took great care not to step too hard on the stone brickwork, not wanting to take the two figures in the center of the room by surprise, but not wanting to blend in with the soft hiss of magical effervescence. 

&quot;You&#39;re late,&quot; one says. He turns, towering over the other who begins to shake from an attack of chuckling. Grey hair falls gently across his shoulders as he turns, his own blue cloak mimicking the motion as it flows against him. Golden scrawl and patterns swirl across its surface, reflecting the light. It gave him a halo, an aura that only dimmed the light around Simon all much more. Though it was clear his father, Faustus Despierro, wasn&#39;t even speaking to Simon. 

&quot;I&#39;ve told you before, Caster. To be on time is to be tardy. Today is not a day for lounging.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fitting for one as ostentatious as he was. “I didn’t laze about on this day of blessed days. The boy is here. The time is right.” Caster continued as he walked forwards to his master. Joining the man at his side. 

“Tardiness this tardiness that. Sometimes you are <em>quite</em> the stick in the mud.” The gentlemanly caster lamented for but a moment.  “But that is my lot in this second life, I suppose.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Simon never even figured that his father knew what the words &quot;rest and relaxation&quot; even meant. 

&quot;And you,&quot; he says again, stepping aside to reveal the summoning circle. The light caught Simon off guard, and his face scrunched up to try and shield from the blue glow. Now he could somewhat appreciate Caster&#39;s remark; this was perhaps the wrong day to pick a green suit. 

&quot;You are ready, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Of course he is,&quot; the smaller of the two finally stated, having snuck up behind Simon and placed his withered hands on his shoulder. For a man of his years, that grip had never left Locleon Despierro, his bones still as strong as ever as they jerked Simon towards the circle. They guided him steadily forward, the boy&#39;s shoes even sliding along the stonework as the wizened old figure, garbed himself in robes of worn violet wool, had him face to face with the moment that would truly change everything for him. &quot;My star pupil wouldn&#39;t dare let me down, now would he?

Were Heroic Spirits watching him? Were they sizing up whether he was worthy?

No sooner had steel left his parted lips that he felt it against his neck. Grooved and slender curves of finely crafted claws scraped against his Adam&#39;s apple, and even if he truly did want to continue, Simon found no breath to use as pressure slowly built behind his eyes. &quot;Are you trying to get us killed?&quot; 

He tried to shake his head, but a quick squeeze forsake the notion, and he could hear the strain of spine popping from his father&#39;s grip. The room was beginning to spin...the light was only getting brighter and filling his vision entirely. Oh God, he was suffocating. Stars were flowing in and out of existence, twinkling flashes of blue swarming forth from the glow. 

&quot;A Servant sees fit to make a contract based on the strength of their Master&#39;s resolve. They can hear the oath you&#39;re putting forth, and they can sense hesitation in someone&#39;s words. Never mind the fumbling and stuttering you were putting on. No Servant will come forth to serve an oath like that. That will only attract a monster.&quot; 

His father&#39;s words came through muffled as blood pooled in his head. His fingers twitched and throbbed, feeling having long since left, only replaced with a phantom ache, dull and far away as he could sense his consciousness slipping. 

&quot;They will sense your cowardice, and they will make a pact, of which the statutes will be their own making. You will kill us all, and I will not have everything I&#39;ve built be wrought because you lack the conviction to see through your duty. The words do not matter, boy. The strength behind them does. Do you understand?&quot; 

&quot;P...plugh...&quot; He wanted to plead with his father to stop. The mountain...oh God, he was going to become part of the mountain. His own neck wrangled and bent, bone pulled taught and stretched across a lopsided neck-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018342082882043954 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018342082882043954><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 12:07 PM">12:07</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em> &quot;Do you understand?

&quot;<em>Yeeeeess</em>&quot; The will to live overcame the pain as the words seeped through his clenched windpipe. Immediately, Faustus&#39; hand relinquished plentiful, musty air back to Simon&#39;s lungs as the boy fell to his knees, bruising them sharply. He didn&#39;t care. Not as long as the fuzz from the corners of his eyes receded, and not as long as he could hear more than the panicked thumping of his heart beating against his ribs.

&quot;Start over.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Hehehe, I think you may have broken the boy,&quot; Locleon says, snickering, laying it on thick with a wag of his finger at his son, whom simply ignores the gesture. The danger never left Simon&#39;s nape as he felt his father staring at him. Waiting for another mistake that would need to be corrected. 

He could not afford another mistake. 

The paper...the paper was not going to help him. The chant was so long and so...he didn&#39;t even understand what half of it meant, and he knew that whatever he brought forth with those words would be true to his father&#39;s words and would end up breaking them all in half. He had to simply go by what he knew. 

&quot;Someone strong...I just need someone strong...someone to help me survive,&quot; he muttered, finally gaining his composure and balance. But what could call forth something for such a simple request? 

...Well. It never hurt to simply ask.

But what’s the worst that could happen? She needed to kill her master? End her own second life in the process? It didn’t matter to the matriarch. If it was her choice the throne would never reach for her, would never even consider her or her child. 

Grendel’s Mother began the ascent from her den. Swimming upwards. Climbing towards the light of this second life she was called for. 

The frame began to pulse with energy. With life. Soon to be engulfed in a cocoon of water and light. 

Moments of silence passed. What seemed to go on for an eternity. Then a figure emerged. 

Tall. Skin a gray shade of twilight. Eyes fierce and piercing. Blade of silver held at her side, easily the size of Simon. Smelling pleasantly of the ocean breeze. 

This was the servant he called forth. 

“Saber.” She spoke. In a cold, apathetic tone.   “I am the Mother of Grendel.” The words were almost spat out of her mouth as she stared upon those before her. 

A decrepit old man. A Man who constantly pushed his body to the extremes. A man who could care less about being there. And a scared, helpless child standing in the forefront. The one who summoned her. 

The blade slowly raised up. Pointing towards Simon. Threatening to graze his skin. “Are you the one who summoned me?” Her voice remained cold. Holding the blade with the bare minimum of effort. 

What had Simon summoned?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018375534385831936 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018375534385831936><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 02:20 PM">14:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Killer#6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once the onslaught of light had dispersed, the party beheld her.

Simon had taken a moment longer to adjust, as the smell of an ocean breeze gave him pause. He had never smelled anything quite so...what was the word...fresh? It brought him out of the study momentarily, enough to free the ache around his neck before he finally opened his eyes. It was only natural to fall back at the sight of a blade mere inches from his eye. 

&quot;Augh!&quot; 

His eyes trailed over her form. Saber. Her skin nearly matched the cool sharpness that had threatened to skewer him, cutting the shadows around her and allowing her to stand firmly as a beacon. Her eyes beckoned to the boy just as his father&#39;s did, a quiet demand that soaked him entirely in force. The ache around his neck started to ebb back, his voice hoarse as he tried to answer. Failure to do so might lead to worse problems...

&quot;Uh...y-yes...yes, I am, Saber.&quot; He said, nearly tripping himself once more, silently cursing under his breath as he stood back to attention. He was marveled at how little ground he covered compared to her, noting how his head only reached her abdomen. She was truly towering, and piercing, and her features came together in a form of beauty that was so perfect as to be eerie. She was not human. She had never been human...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018390631221051434 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018390631221051434><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 03:20 PM">15:20</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Not even the beast himself?&quot; 

Faustus took over, or rather simply interjected, not at all interested in small talk and first impressions. Which is to say, his first impression of her was...disappointment. There was barely anything in the annals of epics regarding Grendel&#39;s Mother. He hadn&#39;t even been made aware such tertiary figures could truly abscond themselves to a place on the Throne in their final moments. Not to mention...she would prove troublesome should she note Simon&#39;s tempered personality. Something that could be easily molded, manipulated by her beauty. It wasn&#39;t altogether uncommon for certain Servants to display a hold on weaker willed Masters. If there is an exploit to achieve what you desire, it&#39;s something that shouldn&#39;t be passed up. Unfortunately, what she desires may come in conflict with his own...

&quot;This...well, you did do well to speak with your chest, so I can&#39;t fault you, boy. Saber. How did you earn such a title? Were you not slain in combat by blade? Your very own? Don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s what you&#39;re wielding...&quot; 

A water hag. Pure and simple. They might have been better off just letting Simon do the initial chant. They might have at least gotten some form of Berserker or malevolent beast to at least aim simply at the opposing team. 

&quot;I apologize, Saber, but I need a bit more than just a container. Your skills. What do you have to offer?&quot; 

He needed to know exactly what they might be dealing with. The look in her eyes already told him there was a great deal of vehement reluctance in her presence, a potential lack of devotion. Troublesome. Very troublesome. Perhaps they need a catalyst for an Assassin...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Before letting it come back to her side. “Help. In a tournament. That is why you deemed it worthy to summon me?” Grendel’s Mother spoke, that cold and apathetic tone remained as her face came uncomfortably close to Simon. It almost seemed as if her teeth grew into sharp, pointed fangs. Capable of ripping and tearing flesh apart, yet in the next moment her teeth were more human. Not those a monster would have, yet still there was an edge to be noted about them. 

Her attention was then grabbed by Faustus. The man had some audacity. Questioning why she was brought forth and not her child. “That beast you refer too. Is my own flesh and blood.” She raised up from her intense stare at Simon and drifted her gaze over to that of Faustus. 

“This blade is that blade. But mind you, the King of Geats had fate on his side in our duel. His swordsmanship was very underwhelming.” She spoke taking another step. Blade dissipating into mana. No real malice held in her words for the very one that had slain her. “You wish to know what I have to offer?” The stare then became more intense. Another step forwards. “Very bold for one such as yourself to speak of what they have to offer. When you clearly have nothing of the sort.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Faustus returned the gaze, never breaking and clashing his own steely eyes against her own. Even when faced with a towering figure from the last ages of divinity, he held his ground and his stance  <em>Only another reason this wont end well.</em>

 Simon didn&#39;t have to win, but there had to be a degree of competence on display. And with the way she just now tried to threaten him...

&quot;You seem to misunderstand the nature of this contract, so I shall spell it out for you. The only one who needs to prove themselves is you.

Apathy quickly turned to malice. All directed towards that man. In plain terms, he decided to poke the bear. If he were wiser, more read on her story. He should have realized something important. 

<strong>Never</strong>allow her to hold a grudge or feel the need to Feud with you. For that is when this truly monstrous matriarch shows how cruel she can be. Can cause the halls of Herotrot to quake, worse than when Grendel Harrowed them. Nearly defeat Beowulf in single combat. 

“Then a showing of my abilities you will get.” In the next moment her arm snapped back, then forwards in a quick and brutal movement. A portal appeared and a giant clawed arm reached forth completely ensnaring Faustus within its grasp. A vice that threatened to break his body in half. Then further. And further.

“Quite the good show!” Caster continued to clap wiping tears away from his eyes. “My my, Faustus. You really should be eating your own words right now.” 

He continued stepping forwards, heels clicking. “You see. My monstrous beauty. My master won’t easily be stripped of his beauty.” The caster of opulence smiled. Turning again in a dramatic fashion, yet keeping Faustus just outside of his field of view. 

“Beauty, is the only thing worth preserving. Is it not? Now if you would be a doll, and release him. We can speak more calmly. And civilized? Unlike those Danes you had to deal with so long ago. We here at the Despierro household enjoy civility.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even with his father&#39;s confidence, there wasn&#39;t much that could save him if a monstrous slayer of Danes got just pissed off enough to decide to treat him like one. Though it wasn&#39;t enough he was stuck at a potential murder, but no one else seemed to be taking it as seriously...

&quot;Hehehehehe, if I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you a thousand times, Faustus. That tongue of yours isn&#39;t as sharp as a woman scorned.&quot; His own grandfather was laughing. He didn&#39;t find too much humorous about the scene...though, strangely, he wasn&#39;t feeling much of anything. There was fear, of course, definitely some fear. The slickness of his palms was more than enough to showcase that, but there was something...else. A thought. A lone thought that tickled the back of his nape where his father had almost done the same as Saber prior. A thought that bore into his mind and drew his focus squarely to Saber. 

<em>Let her kill him.</em>

It was vile. Sickening. But he didn&#39;t have the strength to push it away, and in his mind it sat as he cast a quick glance to Locleon. The thought persisted and again it sat on his shoulders, perched as a demon as he saw Caster. It was quite clear that despite their prowess, Saber was a true danger. How could they all stay so calm?

The thought dissipated. Faded like the light of the summoning circle. If a lone Saber was all it took, Simon could have done something a long time ago. But it wasn&#39;t. Even with her strength, she could not change anything. They were human. And he was not. 

&quot;...S-Saber...please, release him. Release him, please, just...just stop, please.&quot; Pitiful pleading. It was all he could manage, but he had to manage it. Surely they would all remember if he just stood idly by...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If that isn&#39;t something he&#39;s heard Ad Nauseum already...

&quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got your work cut out for you, boy. Though, I have to say...there are worse Servants to be at the mercy of, hehehehhe.&quot; Lecherous comment aside, his grandfather had a point. At the very least, Simon had gotten his wish. She was strong, at least when it came to dealing with Mages, evidenced by his slumped over father whom was slowly regaining himself. He looked towards his father, their eyes meeting, ruby and steel staring deep into each other. His hair was mussied, eyes even more sunken. There was nothing but a hard glint that greeted his son, and he could almost see the furling of a scowl before he composed himself. Grendel&#39;s Mother might be the better parent to stay on the side of. 

&quot;Very...ngh...very well,&quot; Faustus responds, tugging at his collar, subtly taking a moment to massage his neck before throwing a glare at Caster. &quot;It seems despite my objections, you are not one to simply bow out. That is unfortunate for my son, but not necessarily for house Despierro. So be it.&quot; 

There was almost a pause of jubilation as Simon recognized what this truly meant, before that fell as he dug deeper. It was to be him and her...alone. 

&quot;Simon,&quot; He started again, taking in the boy and giving a curt nod before turning away, giving a small wave for Caster to follow him. &quot;I will inform Republic that you will be representing me in this war. Do not disappoint me. The House of Despierro&#39;s reputation falls on your shoulders. If that burden ever proves too much, do all parties a favor: do not return.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grendel&#39;s Mother had made it a habit of asserting her independence, something Simon had been fine with. After all, being stuck on a boat could only provide so much entertainment. Unfortunately, when it did come time to rest in their quarters, there was the painful realization that they would be stuck in a stalemate of who would broach the silence first. And she was NOT going to. Staring contests eventually became late night walks for Simon on the deck of the ship, all in the hope that when he returned, she would be off somewhere else and give him the relief of solitude. It was something he had never truly known, and every moment of it was cherishable. No man could be an island, but for him, he could get used to it...

Their arrival at Alexandria saw the end of that. He gathered his things, all the while bracing against the long stare of Saber, who nearly took up the entire room. It would be difficult bringing her through the city, as her stature was assuredly going to attract attention. They&#39;d need to find a suitable place for a workshop, away from civilization...and also because his father did not make the connections to establish one for Simon. 

<strong>&quot;All passengers for Alexandria, we have finished docking procedure and are ready for disembarking. Please be sure to form an orderly line whenever your cabin row is called.

He sets his luggage down, noting the ripple in the bed sheet and taking great care to smooth it out, painstakingly going over the whole bedspread once more. Of course, he didn&#39;t truly care about the sheets. But it did give him the courage to broach the subject of Saber&#39;s...Appearance. 

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to find a suitable place for a workshop,&quot; he starts, taking a deep breath as he pretends to fuss over the balls of fuzz populating his sheets. &quot;We&#39;ll need to find one isolated from the city...we can&#39;t risk other Master&#39;s finding us, and it&#39;ll be easy because-&quot; He caught himself, not really sure how to break the subject to her. Every avenue seemed to end with her hand around his throat, just like his father&#39;s, only there wouldn&#39;t be a Caster to protect him this time. Nothing to prevent her from simply snapping his neck like a twig. 

&quot;...because we...stand out. Both of us, I mean!&quot; He adds hurriedly, inadvertently tirning on his feet and bringing him to a face to face conversation with her. He reaches into his coat pocket, decked out in the suits of the Despierro household and clashing garrishly with the modern steel and pale cream of the cabin interior. The note folds itself out against his lap, as if he was inviting Saber to read it as well. &quot;I don&#39;t know much about the Alexandrian Masters, but I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;ll take the initiative to try and find Republic&#39;s Masters before the tournament. And being...well, what I am, and you looking...a-anyway, we&#39;ll have to hide more than our teammates. Which reminds me, we&#39;ll have to establish contact with our team after we build a workshop. Let&#39;s take today to search and buy supplies. Does...does that sound reasonable?&quot; He asked, though it sounded more like pleading, as he was desperate to stand by her words. To earn her respect...as long as he was out here, he&#39;d at least try for that. A fresh start with someone that didn&#39;t truly know him, or what he was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Humanity seemed to be almost comparable to roaches. Able to survive even the worst of disasters. Overcome the most dire of odds. It was almost endearing, yet not enough to warm her apathy. 

As for the boy. She still held malice. The Father, that Faustus. Threw them both into the wild. Expecting them both to act as the proxies for he and his servant.  She loathed the man, and that loathing transferred to his pitiable child. 

On the final day of their voyage, Saber was requested to remain in the room. Cramped into a closet. Grendel’s Mother very reluctantly fulfilled this meek request from her master. The very master who reeked of fear.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“My appearance.” The first words she spoke to him in their few days of travel. “I would rather to not hide away.” The Matriarch leaned forwards. An unimpressed look upon her face. “But the plan doesn’t sound too bad. Find a place. Establish a den.” Grendel’s mother took notice of the note, giving a quick gaze to it. 

“If our supposed opponents wish us dead, then let them find us. I’ll meet them with equally deadly force. Stay out of my way.” She spoke in that same cold tone. “Purchasing supplies will always be a good option.” 

It was obvious. He was scared of his servant. Every action had to be agreed to by her. Actions she is partial to following and others she is not.  Grasping for her respect.

That&#39;s what he wanted to say, but Saber was adept at imposing her will and cutting off dissent. It came off as mere chastising, but even he could still tell she was making it abundantly clear that she did not care for him. And just in case that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> clear, she even said as much. 

&quot;R-right...&quot; It had already felt like ages since Cabin A was even called, there must have been quite a few visitors on board. He leaned back to look through the port hole, noting the throng of civilians streaming into the city gates. He also couldn&#39;t help but notice that not many were as decked out as he was. Clothes hung loosely, flowing freely in the ocean breeze. He made a mental note that he would need to blend in, and shed these clothes. The thought alone brought him back to his father&#39;s robes, and the first time he saw them stained. It was his own blood...the first time he saw him cornered was with Saber. The clothes that gave him the impression of humanity had been just as stained as anyone else&#39;s. 

&quot;<strong>Cabin B, you may begin to disembark.</strong>&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry about my father, Saber.&quot; Simon said. It had started as a voice in his head, but it poured out from his lips before he had a chance to stop it. Already she must be tired of hearing sorries, but he realized now that he never did truly apologize for the incursion against her character. He stayed at the window, tracing a finger along the glass as he, too, longed for the air outside. Whatever else he wanted to say slowly died on his tongue. It&#39;s not like she truly cared to hear it. That would have to be enough for now. 

&quot;There&#39;s a bazaar not too far from the city&#39;s entrance. I hear it has a lot of different foods from different cultures...&quot; 

He took a deep breath, finding exactly how one goes about proposing something so casual. Is it expected? Is there an etiquette? Perhaps he was overthinking all of this. 

&quot;We can get something to eat before finding a den. How does that sound?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Feelings from servant to master were made abundantly clear. 

While he was watching out the Porthole for how to dress. Her gaze also drifted over. Looking for the open ocean. That thing which occupied the entirety of the world now. Those deep waters, hiding away a corruption. Deep deep beneath their sacred waves. 

Simon again broke their silence. Issuing a timid apology for his father. “Do not apologize for his behavior.” 

Her gaze drifted away from the window again. Towards that door to their room. Then again the child broached the subject of exploring. Perhaps this could be of some use. Allow her to stretch her legs. 

“Food, and exploring this ‘bazar’ does sound rather nice to do.” She spoke in agreement with Simon. A first for their short time of acquaintance. Standing up and nearly striking her head upon the cramped ceiling. “We should be prepared to depart.” In a strange twist there was almost a childlike sense of wonder in her eyes, ready to explore this Bazaar. Perhaps she wasn’t all that intimidating?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He caught the light that had gathered in her eyes as she saw the bazaar in the distance, and he couldn&#39;t help but draw a faint smile himself. He quickly wiped it away as the speaker called for their cabin C. He gathered his luggage, notably hefting it and letting his arm hang slightly behind as he threw himself against their quarters door. Both entered the throng of tourists, returning civilians and scholars, Simon himself doing his best to try and stay within the flow of the stream without getting jostled by the current of people. Normally he&#39;d be a bit worried about losing his escort or father in a crowd, but Grendel&#39;s Mother towered above all in her presence, with not even the most well built of sailors able to regard her without craning their necks. If he did get lost, he could spot her rather easily. 

His mental map of the path to the bazaar wasn&#39;t perfect, but he had charted a route that would allow them to swing by the Republic Embassy. Maybe there he could get some more information about his teammates, and potentially reach out to form a plan for the tournament. 

He nearly tripped at the entrance through to the city itself, propping himself against his luggage as people pushed past him. The tournament...he had kept pushing it away, but it always reared itself back. His grandfather had always told him that Grail Wars were sights of both spectacle and disaster as Mages battled it out for the chance at an unfettered wish. Bloodshed was always something to expect. So why did his father send <em>him</em>? Surely he would have made a better contestant, but no. He had sent Simon to face all kinds of monsters, all for some data? What could be so important that his very life could be at risk? How much value did his father put on Alexandria&#39;s knowledge in comparison to Simon?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1019126151089770598 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1019126151089770598><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Sep-22 04:03 PM">16:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Simon had frozen in the middle of the docks, locked in place and thought wrought with doom, giving him a rather odd appearance.

He stuck out quiet a bit, and it was possible that Saber was not who he needed to worry about being conspicuous. After all, what was stranger than a visitor that wasn&#39;t struck in awe by the vast landscape that stretched out across the ship.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was a shining beacon of twilight, amidst a sea of multitudinous colors. Her pace gave off hints of excitement. Clearing a path through the crowds. It wasn’t until she reached near the end of the boarding dock that Simon was no where to be found. 

Staring back up to the vessel her master was spotted. Frozen to his spot. The man passengers disembarking leaving a pocket of space, which he was left in solitude. 

“Child. I will not say this again. Come now, or I will leave you here.” The Saber called out raising her voice to break through the mindless droning of the crowds surrounding them. Her intentions were clear again. She was going to the bazaar with or without her master, and he had only a few moments to move.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
