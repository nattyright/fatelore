As the sunlight, ever so slowly emerging out of a yellow chrysalis, shined against Lea’s eyes, she came to be on the hard wood floor.

Ignoring the pool of saliva that had gathered onto the ground overnight, before her was a half-completed summoning circle with a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame in the middle. Due to many complications, the least of which were her parent’s adamant efforts to have her application into the Holy Grail War rejected, Lea had only managed to arrive into her new temporary residence the day before the deadline of the Summoning.

Although that ended up mattering little. The anticipation towards participating in a Holy Grail War pumped Lea with enough adrenaline to completely forego her fatigue. Of course, she would more than certainly end up suffering the consequences of such blind, childish excitement once the fatigue caught up, but it didn’t matter to today’s Lea.

It was difficult to find participants willing to risk throwing away their lives for the Holy Grail War. It was even more difficult to find someone <em>eager</em> to do so, especially to the degree Lea had shown. She wasn’t driven by some pride to protect Alexandria’s integrity, nor did she have some kind of a wish to prove herself in the battlefield.

Lea was drawn to this dangerous battlefield through nothing but pure curiosity. The deep interest she expressed towards warfare ever since she was a little girl only now had the chance to fully bloom.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018495704785760376 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018495704785760376><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:18 PM">22:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her determination was fuelled by naivety. Anyone who heard her careless excitement would be able to figure that out. She leapt into the arms of a war, an event she managed to glorify to herself through books, without fully understanding the risks.

But that didn’t matter to today’s Lea.

“What time is it? Six AM…?”

Waking up was, contrary to many’s belief, more often than not a slow process. Especially in Lea’s case, where she still had tiredness she <em>should</em> shake off, her body would initially attempt to remain idle in order to make up for that lost energy, even as Lea grew lucid as the second ticked by.

But her body’s natural recourse couldn’t suppress her enthusiasm forever.

“… Alright!”

Blinking twice and pulling her body upright, Lea grabbed the chalk she had dropped onto the floor in her collapse last night. It was already halfway finished. Another halfway, and she would get to see the spectacle she came here for.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018495826143744051 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018495826143744051><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:18 PM">22:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/bzlHPlq8hIs">https://youtu.be/bzlHPlq8hIs</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH-6nujw1qBPOvqzFSKSMug><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Yuki Kajiura - Topic</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzlHPlq8hIs"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Sis Puella Magica!</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzlHPlq8hIs width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018495880787140610 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018495880787140610><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:19 PM">22:19</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>What was the greatest tactic ever to be utilized in warfare?

The scope of what could be classified as ‘warfare’ was far too broad to decisively answer this question. Still, the purposes of such open-ended questions were not to find an objectively correct solution. Instead— the first instinctive answer given by people would serve to reveal their personalities.

Perhaps those who valued coordination in battles would cite the Ancient Greek’s phalanx as deserving of that mantle. As powerful and reliable as the formation was, without strict training that every soldier could abide by in unity, it could not be deployed.

For those interested in naval warfare, perhaps they would bring up the tale of the Battle of Myeongnyang, where the undefeated Admiral Yi managed to grasp victory against a fleet that numbered three hundreds, with only thirteen ship of his own. With clever usage of the straits’ currents, he accomplished a miracle without losing a single ship.

There were far too many important battles to consider every single one. The quantity of strategies mankind came up with was as vast as human creativity. Every tactic used by the mongols that allowed their conquests to function like a well-oiled machine were notable enough to be considered. The whole of the Art of War could not be so easily dismissed, either.

But amidst all of these options, as the summoning circle began to take in mana from Lea, <em>her</em> answer to the question was firmly set.

<strong>To annihilate with absolute power.</strong> The Atomic Bomb acted as her role model.

While there were many avenues of human expression within war, weaponry interested Lea the most. And— there was nothing better than a weapon so devastating that it would automatically achieve victory by its mere existence.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018495898952683523 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018495898952683523><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:19 PM">22:19</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Of course, the Servant she would be summoning would not come close to the destructiveness the atomic bomb supposedly once showed to the world. <em>Everybody</em> held a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. Lea would hardly be special in that regard.

That was why she needed the most power she could get from her Servant.

“Come forth from beyond time and answer my call!”

Her Artificial Circuits began to heat up. The cost of her parents deciding to install a high-ranking set of Artificial Circuits meant that her heart would heat up, pumping blood throughout her body. It always felt uncomfortable, although she was fortunate the effects ended at simple discomfort for now.

“You will act as my weapon, our fates linked together. In exchange, I shall do your bidding, leading you to your wish!”

The Summoning Ritual was a simplistic Formalcraft ritual. Even the most amateur of Mages could succeed in the ritual, in some odd cases, even without reciting a spell.

But still, an incantation would stabilize the process, no matter how rudimentary it was. Only skimming through the books left behind by her ancestors, Lea opted to recite a more modern, easier-to-speak spell.

“Even if your mind is blinded by madness, your might will be enough to grant our hopes.”

The additional Madness Enhancement would make her Servant difficult to control, even with her Command Seals. A tradeoff well-considered— at least within Lea’s head.

“So come from the beyond— Heroics of Old!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

</div></div>
The light was now dieing down to reveal the servant. A man of tall stature and impressive frame. His skin was dark and his hair flowed in long locks. His attire was fit for combat and he carried a magnificent sword in one hand. His eyes pierced straight through the girl. In them was both cruelty and arrogance but also a type of understanding that was rarely seen in other people. As he properly took in the features of his summoner his initial angered frown became more a look of curiosity.

If the crown that adorned his head hadn’t already made it clear. The man before her was a King. No. Even if he had lacked his crown. Her first impression of him would have been ‘he’s a King’. His very nature as a Human was that of being who brought together and ruled over humanity. Perhaps in that sense he was superior to other humans but at the same time it’s because he has that type of nature that he is so incredibly human</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018549670416494733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018549670416494733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Sep-22 01:52 AM">01:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong> </strong>

Being born in the Age of Gods during an era where he was readily expected to battle, his might was also made very clear. His attire and weapon were nothing to write off, of course, but his body was the biggest proof of the Berserker’s strength.

Of course, it wasn’t as though Lea had the keen eye to be able to distinguish a trained body apart. To her eyes, all she could see was the durability of her new familiar with no reference point. But still, Nimrod’s confidence coupled with his status was enough to convince her of his competence.

But…

“It worked, wahoo!!! Its here! My very own S.E.R.V.A.N.T.!”

Before she could express her fear, or even think about sating her lesser questions, that was the first and only reaction that could leave Lea’s mouth. Childish excitement over having access to her own weapon of destruction.

She had no idea how powerful the weapon would be in comparison to the other Servants.

But who cared? This guy was hers to use!

“Heeeh… I was told you wouldn’t be able to speak. Clearly that intel was wrong. Well, doesn’t really matter either way, though!”

A talking weapon seemed interesting in its own right.

The young girl’s unflinching attitude stood out to the hubric King. Either she had failed to grasp her own position, or she had something prepared that gave her the confidence to act so carelessly in front of a Heroic Spirit of his stature.

Or both.

Most likely both.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018837781444837427 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018837781444837427><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Sep-22 08:57 PM">20:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Hey, what’s wrong with the eyepatch? It looks cool!”

It wasn’t as though Lea had any particular reason to put on an eyepatch. Her reason, much like her attitude towards most things, was a simple ‘because its cool’. That was the only reason Lea needed— the only reason needed for curiosity to form.

“I’ll gladly take both the compliment and guarantee over victory, though. I’d expect nothing less! Do you have any idea how difficult it is for a country to win when there’s a technological gap?”

… The more she spoke, the clearer it became. She… treated Nimrod as though a human, but—

She clearly thought of him as a weapon.

“To formally introduce myself too, my name is Lea Krause! I’m just a humble historian who happens to like warfare. Now, my dear Nimrod, how much of the situation are you caught up on?”

The summoning system supposedly filled in a Servant’s knowledge gap… but Lea didn’t want to make assumptions behind <em>how</em> much it would fill. Gaps in communication could lead to misfiring the weapon, after all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The grin that had begun to form on his lips quickly disappeared. His face moved into a state devoid of emotion as he simply watched the girl as she celebrated her achievement. He was observing Something about the girl that had  given him pause. What was it exactly? Further observation was needed to understand. So he remained silent as she went on the prior hubris gone if only for a moment. As he attempted to understand the person in front of him. She was a fellow human after it wasn&#39;t like he could just forsake her. Understanding. Nimrod understood those around him more than any other and so of course he would come to understand this girl he had just met as well. So with that in mind he observed her silently stoic and unmoving as she droned on. Taking in every word with the utmost care, his eyes taking note of her body language, gestures and expressions. By the time she finally stopped to ask him a question he had formed a rough idea of the sort of person she was. He took a step forward outside of the summoning circle.

Several more steps forward and he arrived directly in front of his master towering over her. Coldly and without hesitation he grabbed a hold of her face forcing her to look directly at him without turning using his second hand to raise the eyepatch so he could see both eyes. They remained like that for a moment, the Berserker not uttering another word. His eyes were locked with hers possessing an intensity that could pierce through the girl.

The servant returned to his original more stand-offish demeanour. While he did not directly comment on the manner in which he was being treated. It did seem like he had already gained some type of dislike for the girl who had summoned him here.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She felt less comfortable when he began to speak with all his stuffy confidence once again.

Nimrod’s absolute confidence in himself was a cause for joy, of course. For a Servant to have so much confidence in themselves must mean they were quite powerful! But… still, the concept of a speaking weapon was one Lea would have to grow used to over time. To that end, she would have very much preferred he just stayed silent.

The Command Seals were a source of absolute dominance. She considered sealing his mouth shut with them for a moment, but… that sounded like a terrible idea. She would rather use a command on a more fruitful restriction. Plus, even if she sealed his mouth, she couldn’t seal his arms from choking her out. Even if it was irrational to abandon a source of mana like that, Lea was at least a <em>little</em> bit aware of the erratic nature of Berserkers.

“Oh, the mud disaster, you mean?”  

To Lea, as unfortunate as the historical event was, it was something the world had just… gotten used to by this point. She didn’t consider that to the perspective of a Servant being filled in with modern knowledge, this world that’s been corrupted and made difficult to inhabit would look… well, disgusting.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1019342642544386079 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1019342642544386079><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Sep-22 06:23 AM">06:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Even as Nimrod approached close to her, Lea showed no signs of fear. At this point, it seemed less like she was fearless, and more like she was incapable of it. Nimrod would glare into both of Lea’s eyes with a glance that was one step short of hostility, and yet she didn’t understand that her life <em>could</em> be in danger at this moment.

Just the same way Nimrod didn’t realize that building the tower might incite God’s wrath.

In that sense, they weren’t too unlike each other.

“I grew up to be perfect and pristine, thank you very much!”

Even mirroring that unparalleled confidence.

“However my parents may have raised me, who’s to say its the ‘correct’ way or not? I didn’t think the Creator of Babel would be so small-minded!”

Lea’s parents held high hopes for her, all of which she ended up abandoning.  It wasn’t as though they didn’t do the best they could. They were strict at first, and when that didn’t work, they tried to be understanding. Twenty six years was a long time— Lea’s parents made use of every trick they could think up of during that time frame.

Lea just ended up proving to be inconvincible.

“Surely <em>some</em> of your subjects complained about the tower being a bad idea. Look where you are now.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her following comment caused him to turn fully and face the girl. The mention of his tower had managed to get a proper reaction out of him as his face filled with annoyance&#160;

At some point during his rebuttal he had ended up on a bit of a tangent and eventually it seemed like he was talking more to himself. Catching himself though he lashed out once more. It seemed he had already had enough of his master. This was a matter that he held close to his heart.

<strong>The Berserker’s individual thoughts would be irrelevant.</strong> He was a weapon, and Lea planned on treating him like one. At least, that was the immature librarian’s conclusion. But still, knowing how your weapon worked was obviously necessary.

Of course, with her Master’s Perspective, she could derive a good amount of Nimrod’s strengths and weaknesses alike. But with such limited information, there was a limit behind how much of his <em>character</em> she could derive.

She hoped that just mindlessly talking to the Berserker would eventually reveal more and more information. And, truth be told, it did. Just… not in the manner she was looking for.

His annoyance and hubris both was very explicit. He was also quick to threaten her, to the degree that her initial carelessness had started to melt away and got her to start questioning if she should use her Command Seal or not. Lea learned a great deal about Nimrod, but not the core, important question she couldn’t shake off.

“Ehh… okay, let me see if I understand this correctly. You think the tower was a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of mankind, and don’t really regret building it. I get that part. I really do. It also explains just why you’re so confident, but…”

For the first time since their encounter— despite her greatly curious and inquisitive nature— Nimrod made Lea reflect confusion.

“<u>In that case, what’s your wish?</u>”  “You have one, right? Its not like you have any reason to protect Alexandria like I do… so you have to have <em>some</em> kind of a reason to regret something, right?”

So far… the King had shown nothing but unwavering will.

But to Lea, it seemed like a given that if you were summoned as a Heroic Spirit, you regretted something— no matter how bizarre of a connection it may have been.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was the wish of the King. For the sake of his people. The individual conflicts between nations that took place here were irrelevant to him. He would not allow Humanity’s current situation to continue. What sets humans apart from the common animal is their ability to grow. So many heights were still left unachieved.

Lea could only think in the present. Whatever made her happy in the moment, she immediately grabbed out for. A result of her restrictive lifestyle that attempted to keep her away from her own passion.

And, being a relic of the past, she expected Nimrod to be a being that could only think in the past.

It was clear that she could not have been further from the mark. This man always has thought of nothing but humanity’s future.

The tower was a large-scale gamble that ended up failing, but acted as a necessary step for humanity. <em>That</em> seemed to be Nimrod’s outlook of his own legend. Completely contrast to Lea, who read his legend and could only think of him as nothing other than a greedy king that failed.

That was the first time Nimrod acted contrary to Lea’s projection of him.

The first time she managed to see the Berserker as a <strong>human</strong>, not as a weapon. An individual with his own thoughts.

Even such an obvious thing didn’t make itself clear to the young girl at first.

“Then— its still early morning. Let’s go out there!”

Upon hearing the Berserker’s response, Lea eagerly motioned him over.
