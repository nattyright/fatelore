Nikolai had heard the person approach long before they knocked, but it confirmed that they knew he was there. He took one last long look at the pages in front of him. Silver and steel, archduke and contracts…

He donned a black helmet, grabbed a strip of leathered meat, and went to answer.

Each footstep echoed throughout the husk of a barn. Rusted hinges squealed in protest. The man growled right back, and tore off half the jerky with his jagged teeth. He chewed on the shoe-like meat while he pushed open the barn door, ready for whoever was out there.

Thankfully, it was not the farmer that owned the land that the barn sat on. Instead was a short well built woman, dressed in dark clothes and with a sack slung over her shoulder. “<strong>Saria.</strong>”

She mock-saluted Nikolai, “Hello, sir. I hope I didn’t come at a bad time.”

He did not respond, but pushed the door further open and stepped aside. His eyes looked at her, then further inside the barn, then back to her.

Saria released her rigid form and took the invitation, “No need to be so formal, Nikolai. Friends can hang out in creepy barns doing weird Magecraft, right? In near pitch black, may I add.”

“<strong>Apologies.</strong>”

A tug brought the door back in, and it crashed against the wooden frame. Saria glanced towards the frame of the building, which groaned with reverberations. “I still have no idea why you chose this run-down pigsty. One wrong move and you’ll have the place crash down on your skull.”

“<strong>Won’t. Happen.</strong>”

“Uh huh. Sure.”

The pair approached the center of the barn. There was one object that stood tall and proud: a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. Lifeless and cold, propped up on a hook that was wrapped around a beam high above their heads. Saria whistled and tossed the sack onto the ground.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018319209190654033 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018319209190654033><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:36 AM">10:36</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

She inspected the frame thoroughly, every inch prodded and poked to make sure something didn’t fall or budge. In the meantime, Nikolai shuffled over to a crummy spotlight and flipped a switch. Weak yellow light spilled onto Saria and the frame.

“These Republic guys don’t fuck around,” she said. “I’ve seen a few Servant frames before, but never this close and personal. I’d love to break this baby down and see how she works in detail.”

“Maybe another time,” she stepped back from the frame and clapped her hands together. “Now, you got everything I told you to get, right? Blood, chalk. Frame. Three got you that Summoning Incantation, right?”

Nikolai nodded, and pointed at the table next to him. “<strong>Ready.</strong>”

“Well, let’s get this show on the road.”

<em><u><em><u><em><u><em><u><em><u><em><u><em><u><u>__</u></u></em></u></em></u></em></u></em></u></em></u></em></u></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018319634807672852 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018319634807672852><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:38 AM">10:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Nikolai kept a watchful eye as Saria wrote the chalk lines into the wooden floorboards. Despite the only light sources being the moon and a shoddy lamp perched on a few pallets, he could clearly see her work and its progress.

The way she moved her hand in swift, precise movements was a marvel, but perhaps that was better attributed to the inability for him to do the same. At one point, he stared down at his hand and felt the muscles move laboriously. To fully flex his fingers closed took a relative forever, and to relax them was equally as long.

Oh well. To think it over would get him nowhere. He returned his attention to the Summoning Circle. “<strong>Thanks.</strong>”

She gave a thumbs up and wiped the trickle of sweat off her brow. “It’s what work buddies are for, but next time I’d appreciate some air conditioning. I have no idea how you’re still in that suit; it’s got to be atrocious. Why don’t you—“

“<strong>No.</strong>”

“Damn. Thought that would be the time for sure,” she sighed. With a few more lines drawn onto the floor, she leaned back on her haunches. 

“<strong>Ready?</strong>”

“Ready as she’ll ever be,” she said. The stub of chalk was tossed over her shoulder and she reached for her sack. From it, she procured a lunch bag and another smaller bag. That one held the glow of numerous blue lights, magical fireflies that lit up the palm of her hand. 

“Here,” she tossed the second back to Nikolai, who barely caught it with the tips of his fingers. He stared down at the bag, but the gears struggled to churn up the word for the light blue pills. 

Mana… something.

“Mana batteries.”

Nikolai grunted. Of course. They were deposited on the table, right next to the written Summoning incantation. With the Summoning Circle in place, there was only one thing left to do.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018319857877516348 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018319857877516348><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 10:39 AM">10:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Saria took both bags in her hands and got up off the ground, careful not to not even graze the delicate lines. “Well, I’ll be outside devouring dinner while you… do whatever the hell you got planned. I believe in you, but if your Servant decides you aren’t fit then let them know I’m out there.”

Nikolai nodded and turned his attention to the silver frame. A knife was pulled from a holster on his side. With a few violent shakes, his other hand slung the glove off into a random direction. 

A sideways glance confirmed that Saria had left. Blood, was it? Cool steel bit into his dark skin as the sharp edge was pulled along the palm. Crimson gushed out from the wound, but he felt not a scratch on his skin. 

He stepped forward, tilted his hand to let the blood flow onto the floor, and began:

“<strong>Metal. Essence.</strong>”
“<strong>Contractual. Foundation.</strong>”
“<strong>Rise. Wall. Against. Wind.</strong>”
“<strong>Four. Gates. Close.</strong>”
“<strong>Roads. Rotate.</strong>”

The knife was dropped onto the ground. He scratched at his throat. It felt like a dozen glass shards had dug themselves into his flesh. What was the next part again?

“<strong>Declare. Service.</strong>”
“<strong>I Swear. Oath.</strong>”
“<strong>To. Submit. Means. Answering.</strong>”
“<strong>Virtuous. Heaven. Dominate. Hell.</strong>”

When was the last time he had spoken this long? Did it always hurt like this? The end was near, but it felt a million years away. The frame had an aura now, a sign that even with his fucked up Circuits there was a ritual. Strength was sapped from his limbs, yet he pushed on.

“<strong>Seventh. Heaven. Attended. By. Power.</strong>”
“<strong>Come. Forth.</strong>”

For the first time in forever, tears pooled at the corners of his eyes. To stop would be to admit defeat. To give up meant he would throw away all his hard work. Nikolai <em>needed</em> this opportunity. All his willpower focused on one name, one cause. The entire reason he stood here.

“<em><strong>Protector. Of. Holy. Balance!</strong></em>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With every piece of fuel fed to it, the flames grew hotter, brighter, more intense. Like a wicker man amidst a bonfire, the silhouette of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame stood stalwart, cloaked in the searing glow of mana, the centrepiece of this ceremony. 

But unlike such metaphors implied, this was no simple rite, no primitive act of blind faith. Nay, this was a declaration of war, an announcement that one was willing to fight to the death. To summon a Servant was akin to crossing the point of no return. Though the original ritual had long since been lost, the soul of it remained - To enter a Holy Grail War was to offer up one&#39;s life. To gamble with forces beyond your control. Live or die, win or lose, none escape unscathed.

But Nikolai had long since accepted any and all consequences. After all, that was why he stood here, amid this rotting husk of a barn, watching the shining glow grow brighter, brighter, brighter still, until--

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

--it exploded outwards in a brilliant flash, an explosion of sheer light. The natural instinct of the body, faced with such a phenomena, would be to recoil, to wince in pain and cover their eyes. Yet magecraft often defied expectation, and once the initial shock wore off, one would find that the light had stopped.

It was not gone. It had not dimmed. It had simply stopped, as though trapped by an unseen, immovable force, held in the form of a sphere. The orb stayed there for a moment, entirely still, locked in a single instant that stretched for seconds at a time. In this state, it almost appeared akin to an egg, laid in this most sordid nest.

Then, the &quot;egg&quot; began to hatch.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018346220869144577 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018346220869144577><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 12:24 PM">12:24</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Cracks appeared upon the outmost layers, allowing a pitch-black filth to ooze through the gaps, spilling out and dripping onto the splintered floorboards. Fractures spread and spread, infesting the light, leaving no inch undamaged, allowing the dross to stain every last mote of light. Where there was once a perfect orb of pure white light, now there was a seeping cyst of darkness.

For a moment, the deluge of sludge continued unabated. Had the ritual failed? Was the frame faulty? Had Nikolai lacked conviction?

After an agonising pause, the stygian pustule would suddenly burst, freed from whatever force held it in place, allowing the inky liquid to flood the ground and spatter the walls. Yet any concern for that discharge would be short-lived, for it was not the only thing that had emerged from the abscess.

Standing where the orb once was, still dripping with the foul sludge, was a servant. They were a towering beast, a creature with piercing eyes and razor-sharp fangs, jagged horns and rigid scales. There could be no doubt, this was no common monster, no insignificant ogre or lesser fiend - this was a <strong>dragon</strong>.

And as it came to terms with its newfound existence, it twisted its elongated neck, and its grotesque visage came face to face with Nikolai.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The light bore an egg, and the egg bore a monster. A messy monster at that. He looked around at the mess it left with it’s burst from the orb. 

That would take forever to clean up.

After it was all said and done, with the Summoning complete and the… <em>thing</em>, in front of his face, there were a few key thoughts in his head.

First, fate had a twisted sense of humor. Among men, a freak. Among Servants, a monster. The immediate parallel was too great to ignore. Its shadowy, monstrous body took up a large portion of the barn. Even his enhanced eyes struggled to make out much of anything with the darkness it conjured. 

Secondly, it would be very difficult to explain his… abnormalities. Especially when his throat was ablaze. Even now, he rubbed it gently in the faint hope it would magically push the thousands of knives lodged inside it. 

Third, and maybe most importantly: the bloody thing could talk leagues better than he could. 

These thoughts passed through his mind in seconds, yet it felt like an eternity. How many did that make in the last five minutes?

Nikolai stared back at the Servant. Could it see his eyes through the pitch black visor? Probably. This seemed like the sort of creature capable of such feats. All the better to be an ally with. 

And there was no need to fear an ally. Already did he feel somewhat comfortable in the presence of such a creature. If it wanted him dead, it had both the time and opportunity to do so. The fact he was still alive spoke more than any other words could.

After a minute, he found his harsh, rocky voice. “<strong>Hello.</strong>”

Glowing green eyes looked Nikolai up and down, examining him like a butcher would examine a carcass. Physically, they were the bulky sort, as though he were nothing but muscles, moulded into the shape of a human like one would make a clay doll. Still, one could not grasp the full extent of their physique - After all, his face was covered by that helmet. Still, he supposed he could not complain.

But more important than the physicality of his Master was their mentality. In that regard, it was immediately apparent that Nikolai was lacking. The way he spoke, the brief growls that possessed only the loosest grasp on the language, it all pointed towards the signs of a simpleton, a commoner, a fool. 

In other words, he was <strong>perfect</strong>.

<strong>&quot;My name? Kuhuhuhu! But of course! You were so kind as to offer me yours, it is only fair that I offer you mine!&quot;</strong> The dragon declared, taking a few steps closer towards his Master, his jaw presenting something akin to a grin. <strong>&quot;Dearest advisor, you may refer to me as...&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yes, yes, this was the most ideal of circumstances! The veil of secrecy had to be maintained as long as possible, until the bitter edge of reality&#39;s draught had faded...

An arm stretched forth, stopping just short of Nikolai, each of the clawed fingers outstretched. A handshake.

Nikolai was sure that it was one of the seven classes. One of the most classes of all time, if his research meant anything. Perhaps it was not the class that made the Servant, but the identity of who they were in the first place. 

And the name did not ring a single bell. He had never cared for historical figures in the past, let alone the many gods in the numerous pantheons that invaded the minds of the ancestors. This one certainly looked the part of a Sea God, body and ugly smile alike, but beyond that the title meant little. 

Other than he should not be taken– or trusted– lightly. Those divine beings were fickle ones. He did not know the name of every high power, but it was hard to not know the uncountable tales of them and their tricks. The whims and whatever they lead to had caused many a mortal to perish well before their time.

Which is why just before his hand connected with the clawed one of Ryujin, his hand closed into a ball. A fist bumped into Lancer’s index finger, and he pulled his hand away. “<strong>No.</strong>”

No?

“<strong>Gods. Tricky. No. Handshake.</strong>”

Nikolai crossed his arms, “<strong>Yet.</strong>”

Lancer’s lie about his true name had passed without even a second thought, but his prospective Master still had reservations. Was this a smart insight, or yet another silly thought that bounced inside that less-than-full skull?

“<strong>Know. Reason. Summoned? War. Horizon. Many. Others.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rows of teeth grit against one another, scraping together like sharpening knives. To be insulted, by a mere commoner? To refuse the kindness of a god? Nnnnnnnn! Such an affront could not go unpunished...

<strong>&quot;...Ah! Yes, yes, but of course! It is only sensible that you would show such discretion!

Each crooked fang that ground against one another gave enough insight to the frustration. There was no correct decision, but there was little to reconsider. All he could do was see what lay in store.

Which was a round of applause and congratulations for his ‘wisdom’. These ancient beings sure were strange. He cocked his head sideways, and gave a discontent <em>hmph</em>.

 A wise man wouldn’t summon a God for a Servant in the first place, anyhow.

Nikolai nodded along with Ryujin’s words, “<strong>Yes. Two. Teams. One. Winner. Us.</strong>”

Before the Servant could try to comprehend what that meant, Nikolai reached behind him and brought out a picture. A diagram of the situation he had just described, but… the artist did not match the art. At <strong>all</strong>

Numerous doodles and scribbles covered the page. Anything from poorly drawn dogs to an attempted recreation of a murder, all colored in with various colors. They distracted from the main intention of it:

Two circles. A stick figure in one, with numerous question marks around said figure. They two important objects were labeled ‘Nikky-G’ and ‘Republic’, respectively.

In the other was only question marks, but with brown splots and numerous curse words scattered in the small space. This one was ‘Alexandria’. 

Finally, there was a Holy Grail drawn in between the two, held by numerous stick figures with big, red X’s over their heads. The only one not crossed out was named ‘Nikolai (winner winner chicken dinner)’. 

If Lancer’s ears worked right, he would hear a few muffled cackles from beyond the walls of the barn

The mere thought of it was enough to cause bile to rise up in his throat. 

There was only room for one king in his kingdom, one throne for one ruler, and not a single person more. To have to share his utter victory with even a single soul more than necessary... Sickening! SICKENING! The mere idea of it caused the bile in his throat to sour like milk!

Fortunately, it appeared that his Master had reached the same conclusion, though perhaps not with quite so much bitterness. After all, the diagram he revealed was quite telling of...

...What...?

...Okay, so they were...

...Republic, Alexandria...

...Who was Nikky-G...?

...Wait, this made no sense...

...Who was laughing? What was so funny about this...?

...Why would one wish for a chicken dinner...?

...Hang on, hang on...

...Aha! AHA! Yes, yes, he had gleaned everything of worth from this mess of hieroglyphs! So, they were to fight under the &quot;Republic&quot;, while his opponents were to be the &quot;Alexandrians&quot;, were they?

Masters. Last. Resort.</strong>”

He returned the page to its proper spot and grabbed yet another strip of beef jerky. The helmet was not removed; instead, he jammed the meat into a small gap between the helmet and armor. 

“<strong>Lastly,</strong>” he held up a single finger, “<strong>Condition.</strong>”

<strong>Never. EVER. Steal. Look,</strong>” the finger jerked back towards himself. Echoes rang out from the strong declaration. Outside, the flurry of wings and scurry of paws sounded in response. While the sentence could be interpreted a few different ways, Nikolai did not elaborate on the exact intention behind it. 

Instead, he extended his hand, as Ryujin had done before. “<strong>Deal?</strong>”

They were both on the same page, and the most important ground rule had been laid out. So long as Lancer was capable of <em>any</em> self-restraint when it came time to knock out an ally or foe from the tournament, Nikolai would accept whatever ‘offer’ Lancer had tried to make before.

If the Servant had even attempted to make an offer before. Maybe the one who needed self-restraint was himself– further than already employed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

...But really, what a truly miserable little scribble. The nonsensical nomenclature and crude sketches, the creator of this scrawl dared to waste the time of a king with their silliness? Nnnnnnn! Merely looking at it stoked the flames of his ire. It made him want to snatch that paper and rip it to the shreds.

But! That was not necessary! Their alliance was all but confirmed! After all, &quot;Ryujin&quot; had no reason to mimic the burnt toast apparel of his little peon. All that was left to do was to seal the deal with a handshake.

Rider looked down at Nikolai&#39;s outstretched hand, staring at it. Whole seconds went by like the sludge flowing down the barn walls. Rider, on the other hand, was wholly still.

...

After that agonising pause, the dragon straightened up, and proceeded to walk directly past his Master, pacing past him as he examined the run-down barn.

Figured. All Nikolai could do was hope he would as all gods do and seek any revenge at a convenient time.

His hand dropped back to his side as he turned to face Lancer. With the declaration to go to his actual workshop, he did not utter a word. A silence sprung up. It stretched on for an uncomfortable amount of time, long enough for some birds perched back up on the rafters above. Tiny heads bobbed all around, curious about the scene below.

“<strong>Yes. Do. Much</strong>”

Nikolai stepped away, to a broken stall stuffed in the corner. There wasn’t a door, which let Lancer see him rummage through a pile of tools and handles. Once he found what he desired, a broom and mop, he returned to his Servant.

He held out both. “<strong>Which?</strong>”

The broom head waved to all the mess, the puddles of black goo on the floor, and the smears on the wall. Finally, it ended its destination on Nikolai himself, “<strong>Prefer. Broom.</strong>”

It seemed that his Master was worse off than initially thought…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ryujin&quot; stared at the mop and broom with such blisteringly contempt that Nikolai could feel it radiating onto his hands. Him, a shah, nay, a GOD, cleaning up as though he were nothing but a servant? What an utterly laughable idea!

Except nobody was laughing, least of all the dragon. In fact, he was most tempted to grab his &quot;master&quot; by his arms and snap them like they were twigs, but he was capable of restraining that desire. No, as much as he might deserve it, this pauper was his anchor, the only source of magical energy keeping him chained to this world. He would have to remain intact, at least for now.

But that did not mean he would stoop below his station. The throne was the top of the hierarchy, and the king would not step a single rung lower, not even for a second.

<strong>&quot;But of course! I much prefer the mop! After all, it is the much more absorbent of the two implements!&quot;</strong>

Taking the mop from Nikolai, Rider would immediately begin to vandalise the tool, ripping most of the strands from the head until only a few remained. Then, he would go to where the sludge stains were densest and soak up some of the filth, before heading to the opposite wall. There, he would begin to spread it about again, drawing thin lines of black across the splintered wood.

<strong>&quot;Dearest advisor, tell me more of this &#39;Alexandria&#39;. Tell me</strong> <em><strong>every last thing</strong></em> <strong>you know about the land on which we wage war.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His Servant was very upset with his proposition. His Servant was a memorable <em>prick</em>. Each blue, dusty noodle that fell to the ground all but increased his urge to maim <em>and kill and tear–</em>

He breathed in deeply, as deep as he could. A solid seven seconds were spent on inhalation. Another seven were spent letting all the air slowly leave his lungs. By the time he finished, Ryujin had moved onto the mess he had created.

And started to spread the black gunk further.

This would be a very <strong>difficult</strong> month. 

“<strong>Alexandria. Big. Libraries,</strong>” he growled. The broom handle was aimed towards a nearby pile of hay, and chucked with too much strength. It flew right into the yellow mass, through it, and smashed into the wall right behind it. With any luck, the splinters were self-contained.

<strong>Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.</strong>

Ryujin would watch his Master slowly approach him. “<strong>Water. Roads. Peaceful.</strong>”

“<strong>Fight. Coliseum. Crowd. Pair-Pair.</strong>”

Once he reached Lancer, he would reach for the bottom end of the now ruined mop, “<strong>Clean.</strong>” 

If he was going to be difficult about this, then no matter. A tidy home that would take <em>hours</em> to clean was much better than one that wasn’t. Ryujin won this round, but this fight was far from over. All he would need was <s>a new Servant</s> something to wash this honestly not worth it barn.

“<strong>Water. Please,</strong>” he pointed to a metal tub next to the large barn door, empty and upside-down. A water god could handle such a menial task without too much difficulty, right? Or at least not cause a problem with it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was this the true depths of the pettiness of the Gods? That they could get what they wanted, yet still continue to act as spiteful and as petulant as ever?

<strong>&quot;A library, you say? Mhm, mhm, MHM, then that truly is the namesake of this place...&quot;</strong>

Actually, on closer inspection, there appeared to be some method to this madness. There was purpose behind the spreading of filth, intention as it went along. It was like the world&#39;s most disgusting painting - the sludge as paint, the mutilated mop as a paintbrush, and the wall as a canvas. 

<strong>&quot;I never visited myself. In truth, I cannot recall if it even existed during my sprawling lifetime, kuhuhuhuhu!&quot;</strong> Lancer laughed to himself, continuing to sketch all the while. But for a moment, he would pause, twisting his neck to look down at Nikolai. <strong>&quot;Yet despite this, I am keenly aware of what it is. Curious, is that not? That one can know everything about something, even when they should know nothing? It truly does make one ponder...&quot;</strong>

&quot;Ryujin&quot; would take a step backward, dropping the mop-turned-paintbrush to the ground as he gazed upon his work. It clearly depicted a building of some sort, tall towers and spire-like roofing, grand windows and stalwart doors. An indecipherable noise escaped the dragon&#39;s maw. Then, he turned towards his &quot;master&quot; once again.

<strong>&quot;Tell me,</strong> <em><strong>Nikolai,</strong></em> <strong>do you know what happened to the Library of Alexandria?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It looked ugly, ugly as sin itself. It took longer than it should have for the picture to hold any weight, but as soon as Nikolai saw it he stepped back.

It looked grand. A lovely place, one more suited for the kingly figure that drew it. Was this how the Library of Alexandria looked in its prime, all that time ago? This City-State had tried but failed miserably if this was the real deal.

It didn’t matter, anyway. The original was long gone and buried underneath a planet&#39;s worth of mud and water. Nikolai’s Servant even claimed that he’d never been. Odds are the thing that gave Ryujin information about the world filled in the idea of what the first Great Library had looked like. 

Before he could add to it, he grabbed the remnants of the mop off the floor. “<strong>No,</strong>” he answered. 

“<strong>Why?</strong>”

The history lesson would not win this tournament, nor would it slay their foes. Maybe bore them to… no, they’d probably try to correct the God. Damn librarians. But the image of a shrewd old geezer in conflict with Lancer, only to get eviscerated for their attempt at being a teacher…

Ryujin inhaled deeply, air rushing through rows of teeth to fill his lungs. Then, there was some manner of movement deep within the dragon, a process that caused some amount of discomfort, though it was hard to gauge exactly how much. Then, as though an imaginary trigger had just been pulled, Lancer spat out his metaphorical bullet - a solitary ember, flickering in the stale air.

It floated there for a moment, a soft glow in the gloom of the barn, before it began to meander away...

...Drifting, drifting towards the mural of ancient Alexandria...

...And making contact with the sludge--

<strong>FWOOSH!</strong>

In an instant, the filth caught alight, and the fire spread all across the lines of the piece. A monument to ruin, a great historical tragedy recreated on the most meagre scale. The flames were not even hot enough to burn the barn&#39;s walls, and just barely hot enough to ignite the sludge, yet their heat did not truly matter. The message was made clear.

<strong>&quot;<u>It burned</u>. Everything inside it burned. Be it book or scroll, man or woman, ancient or new, important or pointless. Nothing was spared! Before the unscrupulous judgement of catastrophe, there was no mercy! And all who came after it? They bowed their heads toward the Burning of Alexandria, subjugated by pure, raw fear...&quot;</strong>

There was a long, uncomfortable pause as the painting burned, a silence only broken by the crackle of flame and the dripping of burnt sludge. But much like Alexandria, all things ended, and as the fires began to die down and the grime crumbled away, Lancer&#39;s eyes flicked over to Nikolai.

<strong>&quot;You understand, don&#39;t you?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even better, the black tar-like substance cracked away from the wall. Looked like Ryujin had a few tricks up his… nevermind.

But the message was clear. One he was sure would spell disaster. 

One he wasn’t sure he wouldn’t be around to see. Whether that was because of the Lancer himself or his own curse was up in the air for now. 

“<strong>Question.</strong>” he stared back at Lancer. It was easy to keep locked on, despite the massive power and size difference.

“<strong>No. Drowning?</strong>”

Unless this was a god of temperature too, the initial facts started to diverge for him. What kind of Oceanic being could conjure fire? Maybe it came from the draconic side of his existence. Maybe.

He crossed his arms and shrugged, “<strong>Tourney. First.</strong>”

At the end of the day, this tournament mattered more than any power or subjugation of the enemy. Damn the politics, damn the people, and damn his Servant. All he needed was a lead, a crumb, a trail to her. 

Not some pipe dream from a long-dead entity. 

Nikolai tossed the broken mop to the side and watched it clatter away. “<strong>Actions. Speak. Loudest.</strong>”

With that eerie warning, the Master turned away and headed for the large pile of hay. It was late if the bright moon above said anything. Based on its position, it was about past one. A good night&#39;s rest was in order, so they could get a head start of their application for the first tournament fight.

He pointed towards the right side of the gigantic yellow heap, “<strong>Yours. Sorry. Small.</strong>”

What a considerate Master, to give Ryujin such a large portion of the ‘bed’. Lancer just happened to be a lot bigger than he had planned for. Nikolai could probably be persuaded to fork over a little extra, if he asked nicely.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I am simply stating the facts!&quot;</strong> &quot;Ryujin&quot; asserted, leaning closer to Nikolai with that exaggerated grin on his face. Evidently, he had picked up on his advisor&#39;s hesitation. <strong>&quot;History need not repeat itself! After all, it is not the place of us bygone Servants to meddle in mankind&#39;s future! Believe me, I shall content myself with a hard won wish upon the Holy Grail, and nothing more.&quot;</strong>

But at the question of drowning, his expression seemed to sour. However, what replaced it was not anger, but instead, disappointment.

<em><strong>&quot;Dragons can breathe fire, you cretin.&quot;</strong></em>

Every word was like a lash to the back, like having hot tar poured down your ears. It was astounding how much contempt could be mustered for such a minor mistake, how much hate could be unleashed over such a minor question. But of course, it didn&#39;t linger long, and soon, that damnable grin was back on Lancer&#39;s face.

<strong>&quot;Kuhuhuhu! I jest, of course! I cannot expect you to know everything about dragons, can I? After all, my kind graciously gave up our right to reign centuries ago! We are like the dodo bird of your time, are we not? Kuhuhuhuhu! KUHUHUHUHUHU!&quot;</strong>

To assert that actions spoke loudest was smart of Nikolai. After all, the words of &quot;Ryujin&quot; were about as clear as mud, layered with so much confusion and nonsense that one would think they had summoned a Berserker with Madness Enhancement EXXX. 

<strong>&quot;Now, get a good night&#39;s rest, dearest advisor. I shall join you shortly, once I have finished channelling the will of the kami!&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That… made sense? Lacked the wings but made up for it with arrogance and the ability to conjure flame. Nikolai did not want to be on the wrong end of that toothy maw when he decided to unleash hellfire, that was certain.

“<strong>Dodo… bird?</strong>” he asked. At this point, he had settled down into the makeshift bed. Stuffed into the far side and nearly emerged in the pointy stems, he looked more like an object than a person. Much like the egg Ryujin hatched from, another black and grey cacoon was eager to hatch.

“<strong>Kami?</strong>

Was that a word he knew before, but had forgotten? Surely not, right? Who the hell used a word like ‘Kami’ in a sentence nowadays? Whatever, as long as it didn’t translate to ‘burn down the barn with you as the kindling’. 

And if it was, he hoped Lancer would at least have the decency to slit his throat beforehand. 

Within a minute, the Servant would see the gentle rise and fall of his armor. Assuredly asleep, the only hope now was that he did not wake easy.

And he did not.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then again, would an answer that came from the dragon&#39;s maw be worth anything more than dirt? Either way, it was a problem for tomorrow. There was nothing else that could be done today. 

So, &quot;Ryujin&quot; turned away from Nikolai, assuming a crouched posture and clasping his hands into something resembling a prayer. Truly, it was a most noble pursuit, to worship a power higher than oneself! Even a god could acknowledge that! It was an absolute necessity to acknowledge--

Slowly but surely, Lancer would turn his head, checking on Nikolai as he lay in his bed, the little metal lump all snug in his hay.

Finally, he was asleep.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>&quot;Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn... To feign loyalty to a dullard... It is agony.&quot;</strong>

His voice was dry, devoid of shrill tones and high-pitched mania, leaving only a husk of hatred and disdain behind. Teeth grit against one another, but they did not gnash. Talons tapped against the gambrel, but they did not scratch.

<strong>&quot;Such, such, such agony. There is only one lord that I shall ever serve...&quot;</strong>

The scowl on his face deepened, and Zahhak turned his visage skyward, towards the moon hanging in the sky.

<strong>&quot;But! I shall bear it.</strong> <em><strong>So long as I acquire the Holy Grail,</strong></em> <strong>I will do anything. They will pay any price, no matter how steep. I</strong> <em><strong>will</strong></em> <strong>have my wish.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>
