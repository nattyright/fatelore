The freshly sprayed crimson material filling his nostrils, stinking up the place. Luckily he had done it on a tarp so as to not ruin the wood flooring, but that couldn&#39;t mask the fumes, no doubt his neighbors by now could smell it. His landlord was going to kill him.

The photographer&#39;s apartment, for what it was, wasn&#39;t half bad. He managed to get the somewhat small space at a bargain, and on a reporter&#39;s salary that was all the better. It was a relatively small space but had a decent sized sitting and living room, where he was currently working. The window facing out towards the city had a decent view, but there wasn&#39;t as much light coming through as the sun was beginning to set in the orange sky, most of the current light in the room coming from street lights outside and the lone light over the stove. Some furniture here and there scattered around the room, and some pictures of him with family members on the wall, along with his diploma.

Ray himself was rather plain appearing, green eyes and brown hair. His jacket, a gift from his Grandfather, was draped over the couch so as to not get any paint on it. He wore a white t-shirt and jeans with some old shoes to wear so as to not ruin anything with paint. On the back of his paints, tucked into a leather slide, appeared to be the handle of something small and silver colored.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018357666826948721 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018357666826948721><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 01:09 PM">13:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He wiped a bit of sweat from his brow as he stood back up with his arm, inspecting his work. He placed the nearly empty can on the floor, placing his hands on his hips. Around the room, were red candles on coasters and in holders in preparation for the ceremony. In the center of the tarp, around the intricate emblems and circle on the floor, was probably the most expensive thing he&#39;d ever laid eyes on. A genuine S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. He knew about these sorts of things from his Aunt, Grail Wars, he just didn&#39;t think he&#39;d ever be a part of one. Hell, he wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to even be in this one. But, when work calls with an opportunity of a lifetime it&#39;d be stupid to say anything but &#39;no&#39;. His boss had given him the day off to prepare for this ceremony, and he needed it. Something like this would take a lot of Mana and needed his whole attention. Apart from quick breaks for lunch and food, that is.

After looking over everything, it appeared everything seemed in order, and he could begin. But first, he walked across the floor to the window to let out the fumes of the paint to not stink up the place so much, and closed the blinds so as to not cause a ruckus on the street below. He left the bottom section exposed however, as to let the airflow in and some light, besides the light over the stove illuminating some of the room and casting shadows.

He reached behind him, and pulled out what was in that leather slide. A paint brush, with a handle made of silver. An heirloom of the family line, back to when they were still known as Coopers. He held it up at eye length and out towards the room. The bristles on the brush glowed like a dim flashlight, and the light split apart, shooting out across the room towards the candles, and causing the tips to ignite and creating more light in the room.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018357744996188200 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018357744996188200><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 01:10 PM">13:10</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He walked forward, to the circle surrounding the upright frame and exhaled deeply. Now comes the actual hard part. Concentrating on the strength he had been accumulating for this moment, he closed his eyes and tried to work up the courage to follow through on what was about to happen. Once he started, there would be absolutely no turning back until the task was totally done. He reflected on what he was about to do, summon a genuine spirit from a time long gone, meant to fight others like them. Powers, fights, and also danger. He had no idea who he could possibly bring forth, but whoever they were, he only hoped they could at least try to get along.

He reached down to the floor at the spot he was at and grabbed a hold of a box cutter he kept in the apartment, putting in a fresh blade beforehand for the occasion. He gritted his teeth, and made a slash along his left palm, causing blood to seep from the self inflicted wound. He gripped the hand tight, and held it over the drawn circle before the frame, starting the ceremony with blood dripping onto the dried paint. Then, he began to make the oath.

<strong>”From my mind, I give you my thoughts. From my body, I give you my strength. From my heart and soul, I offer up my courage and faith.</strong>

<strong>”Hear me, the Spirits of those from time immemorial, those who transcend the moral realm and become History itself. Heroes, Scourges, and the Monsters in between. I call upon one of you for service in the name of my forefathers.</strong>

<strong>”I stand at the gate, and my enemies are vast. I ask thee to come forth, and once more venture into the breach, with our destinies intertwined. Our Fate.</strong>

<strong>”Form the contract, and may our wishes come to fruition. Come forth Spirit of Legend, be you from the Heavens above, from the Inferno below, and the nameless realm in between. I ask thee, reveal thyself. In the name of your Master, reveal!”</strong>

A matchless flame ignites the circle below, the husk&#39;s mechanical limbs turning from a hunched gait to what seems more like a pained hovel as its frame is given form.

    In a bright flash of light, a gust of wind rattles the blinds and washes over Raymond, muscle forming on the frame before him, then skin, then hair. The blinding light leaves the Servant&#39;s summoning difficult to view as their clothing follows suit, a more modern looking piece of snow white threads composed of a suit top, skirt, and boots. Matching this are long, thin locks of colorless hair, with the pale figure&#39;s bright blue eyes finally fixating onto he who called her forth.

    The once fiercely burning flame stoked below the Servant fades and dissipates, leaving a dry corpse of Raymond&#39;s carefully inscribed sigil. A deep breath from the woman echoes throughout the apartment, the skewed curtains leaving the sun to brightly shine down upon the colorless simulacrum. Was she a deity, perhaps a then-modern servant of justice or righteous figure? The tommy gun firmly grasped in her left hand suggested her to be anything but.

    Ray&#39;s contractee stares upon him for what seems like hours, before a scowl forms on her face. Before he can act, he can feel his jacket&#39;s shoulder gripped firmly onto as he is pulled towards her, the only thing stopping an impact being the barrel of her gun firmly pressed against his abdomen. This immediate act of hostility is soon followed with words, uttered in a prominently Italian accent from the girl&#39;s foul-mouthed lips.

    &quot;The name&#39;s <strong>Al Capone...</strong>&quot; she begins, &quot;<strong>The Archer of Chicago. Don&#39;t tell me <em>you&#39;re</em> the sorry sonofabitch who summoned me!</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His heart was racing, it had finally begun.

He raised an arm and closed his eyes, trying to shield himself from the blinding light and gust of wind. And when the light faded, he opened them back up and watched as the being started to take shape, and form clothing. Without turning, he tried grabbing his own jacket from the couch behind him and missed, but grabbed it on the third attempt. He quickly threw it on himself, eyes never drifting from the figure in his living room.

The spirit whom he’d brought forth started making an appearance. He didn’t know what to expect, but somehow, this defied anything he had pictured. It was a woman, in a suit top and skirt. When he thought of the grail war he thought of things his Aunt told him, knights, Greek and Roman warriors, heroes from lands long gone. A suit . . . not what he was expecting.

When she took that first breath, Ray was absolutely frozen, only the sound of his own heartbeat in his eardrums. As the woman inspected him, Ray was still wondering who he could’ve possibly brought into this world. It had to be someone ‘recent’ in a sense . . . who packed a typewriter submachine-gun. He’d never heard of a Servant using a firearm before. He felt he should say something.

But before he could get a single word out, the woman jerked him forward and pressed him right up against the barrel of the gun. This surprised him, he starred her right down in her eyes as she did his. Then, she proclaimed her name.

Capone. <em>The</em> Al Capone, one of the biggest names in organized crime in American history. A crime boss for a Servant and a photojournalist for a Master, total opposites. It was funny, in a cosmic sort of way. But Ray really couldn’t process that with a gun shoved right at him.

He gave a heavy swallow, and tried to speak. “Y-yeah, I am.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018518911840436345 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018518911840436345><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 11:50 PM">23:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His eyes darted to the barrel of the gun and then looked right back at her. He put a hand on the barrel and tried to slowly lower it, blood still dripping from his free hand by his side.  “So . . . you said you’re the ‘Archer’, right? That’s your class in this?”

He seemed actually quite put together in all this. In his time covering dangerous places and people, the threat of guns wasn’t something he’d come across often, but nonetheless, has happened on one or two occasions. His journalistic instincts in this case were stronger than his fear, the curiosity of it all.

Her eyes feel as if they stare into Ray&#39;s very soul, her observation of him being uncomfortably lengthy as if, like a fellow journalist, she were piecing the man together. In organized crime, snitches and finks were a dime a dozen when you reach the heights she had, and while no word of objection could unbind her from his service, she would at least afford herself a proper read on her contractor before speaking any further.

His aura was gentle and assuming, or rather weak in the mob boss&#39;s mind. Would he have lasted even a day in her now defunct underworld without losing his life or valuables? Probably not. And the tension laid bare on his body language made it clear that he means no harm, by way of either subterfuge or brute force. As such, she slowly backs her gun from his chest, leaving it to her side before tilting his head at Ray with an amused grin.

&quot;Yeah, well unless you&#39;d rather I bludgeon someone wit&#39; this thing, yer just gonna have to settle for what it is,&quot; she snidely comments, showing the archaic weapon off in a series of self-indulgent poses before ceasing in a hunched stance, glancing over the comparatively average young man&#39;s unarmed appearance. &quot;And what&#39;re you supposed to be? A cashier? I ain&#39;t sure what you think summonin&#39; a head honcho is gonna do to pay yer rent, youse gonna need something more enticing than that to keep me squattin&#39; in this dump,&quot; she sternly asserts, though given that she would likely last an instigated shootout or two on her own mana reserves before her frame would cease function, she remains willfully ignorant in just how compromised of a bargaining position she truly is.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not exactly how he pictured this whole thing was gonna go, but hey, this would go well in the Exclusive he’d write at the end of all this.

And she was a bit snide too, going for poses. He just gave her a bit of a quizzical look. Was she trying to impress or intimidate him? That gun in her arms did make him nervous though. He crossed his arms when she asked her question, and made her remark about his apartment. He couldn’t help but take a look around. Sure his apartment was in a rundown area of the city, and was a bit . . . dingy, but it wasn’t a pig stye by any means. Still, it kinda hurt him in his pride to hear that from someone he just met.

“No. I’m a photographer, for one of the city’s newspapers. And I honestly didn’t really have a choice in all this. Just got sprung on me is all.”

He walked over to the blinds and raised them to let in more light and a view of the neighborhood. He turned on the lamp nearby and decided to clear a bit of the air. At least start with an introduction. He spoke and tried to be his best self. He was always a bit of an honest guy and a bit clumsy with words, but he always meant well.

“So. My names Ray. And . . . I guess I’m more or less your own personal ball and chain. Or, we are for each other, in a sense. With how the mana exchange works and all that.”

He realized one of the things she said and and that made him do a double take. He walked back over to the tarp she was summoned. “Wait, you’re thinking of leaving? I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”

He bent down and grabbed the edge of the dried painted tarp. “Would you mind stepping off? I gotta clean all this up.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Your boss must have some real nads on him,&quot; she quips with a snicker. As Ray moves about his apartment, her eyes follow him before reducing to a squint once the bright light of the blinds hit her eyes, an irritated groan escaping her mouth. As such, she steps back to plop herself down on the couch, sitting in an ill-mannered pose with her legs spread wide and her back sunken in as if she were about to be devoured by the furnishing. At Ray&#39;s question, she simply shrugs her shoulders and gives a yawn while he works to tidy up his summoning circle.

&quot;I dunno, Paparrazi. So long as you ain&#39;t shovin&#39; a camera in <em>my</em> face I suppose I could tolerate you, but that all depends on what kinda piece youse doin&#39;. I ain&#39;t inclined to stick around for some piece on politics, I&#39;d rather go pick a fight I can&#39;t win and wrap up my poker game down in Hell.&quot; Smirking, she shifts her legs around a good few times, putting one over the other, then flipping their stance, her skirt fwishing around all the while. Given how short it is, her lack of decency towards her clothing is yet another damning factor separate from what one would expect from a time honored historical figure, with her eventually huffing and kicking the ground as she settles for the slouched pose she started in.

&quot;Speaking of, you still ain&#39;t told me what youse gunnin&#39; for with me and my and expertise. If you wanna run a smear campaign or somethin&#39;, work out some half-truth stories and slim out some competition... well, that&#39;s more in line with somethin&#39; I&#39;d give a rat&#39;s ass about,&quot; she seems to suggest rather than aimlessly comment, staring down at Ray as he cleans up his tarp, not bothering to lift a finger herself. &quot;Just to throw some ideas out there. If youse really gonna be as hefty a ball and chain as youse claimin&#39; to be.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At her comment on his boss, he made no argument with her and even agreed to an extent. He really did have balls, getting one of his reporters in on a Grail War just for coverage and an exclusive. But maybe Ray was crazier for even saying yes.

At her little nickname for him, there was a piece of him that was really irked by the name, but ultimately said nothing. He had his job, he knew what it was. He was more than some fluff piece photographer. And he didn’t really wanna pick a fight with someone who could kill him almost in an instant.

He shoved the tarp in a trash bag and tied it up, tossing it over by a wall. He turned around to face her, but his face got a little flustered and red when he saw her making those leg movements, and with such a short skirt on to boot. He tried not to look and get distracted. “I-I uh, I’m, I’m not running a piece on politics if that’s a concern.”

He went to walk over to the fridge and opened it up. Mostly because he didn’t want her to see how flustered and how red his face really was. 

She threw out her ideas, and Ray listened. He wasn’t the kind of person to publish half true stories or anything. “I’m . . . I’m gonna write a piece on the Grail War itself. My boss wanted a piece on it from the perspective of someone who’s been in one. I . . . guess I drew the short straw I suppose. Got picked, and here we . . . here we are.”

He pulled out a bottle of water and closed back up the fridge, and faced her. “And . . . I was planning on top of that, writing on whoever I got paired with. And in this case, that’d be you.”

His eyebrows furrowed and walked back over, leaning against one of the counters and looking at her. “I mean, with how the summoning works, I’m whats keeping you anchored to reality. If I go, well . . . you get the idea. So yeah, I’m a ball and chain that’s locked pretty tight on your ankle.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Grail War surprisingly seemed to evade her attention compared to the fact that her summoner intended to write on the woman herself, a notion which would pique her curiosity above all else. A city-wide published biography on a prolific mafioso who had been dead for centuries, with her legacy currently being worth nothing more than the occasional aside or source of imitation? That kind of exposure, when mixed with the promise of a wish should one succeed in the Holy Grail War provides the but recently reborn mafioso with an interesting set of steps towards success, barred only by the cooperation and compromise of the man before her. 

These thoughts very clearly churn in the lady&#39;s mind, the girl rubbing her chin with a sneer before giving a sigh of relief at the reveal of such an early and plausible solution to her wants. &quot;Well, youse is only as heavy a chain as youse allow yourself to be, my friend,&quot; she comments in a more honeyed tone of voice. Even in their brief introduction, it would never have been expected for the word <em>friend</em> to come out of <em>her</em> mouth of all people&#39;s, as she suddenly jumps to attention from her couch to follow Ray into his kitchen.

&quot;Yeah... I sure am in quite the pickle, ain&#39;t I, Paparazzi?&quot; she admits as she stands across from him, mimicking his pose as she too leans on the counter, grabbing the bottle of water in his hand to carelessly steal a swig. Handing it back, she then grips onto his shoulder, pulling him close to her as if the two needed any secrecy in the comfort of his own home. &quot;But, now that the gears are a-turnin&#39;, I think the two of us can work somethin&#39; out. Hows about we discuss this more over some lunch? This dingy pad of yours ain&#39;t doin&#39; much for my morale.&quot; 

She acts as if she herself will be paying the bill with how generous an offer she proposes, but in reality she hasn&#39;t a penny to her name in this new world</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1019204224820727828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1019204224820727828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Sep-22 09:13 PM">21:13</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>. But, with her hostility now only thinly veiled in what is clearly a conniving personage, it would seem that indulging her would be a better step in the right direction compared to their reductive back-and-forth. Not to mention that it would keep her focus off of just finding different ways to insult Ray if other people are around to distract her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Oh... right, I ain&#39;t know shit about what&#39;s in this town,&quot; she confesses as she slinks back towards Ray, patting him on the back.
