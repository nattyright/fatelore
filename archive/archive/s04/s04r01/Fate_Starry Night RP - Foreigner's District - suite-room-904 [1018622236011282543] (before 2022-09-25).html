A satisfying jingle would ring out as each rock hit the bag. Behind the King was an open space, a servant frame sitting in the middle. The furniture that was once there had been pushed into the corners of the room; the rug rolled up against the window curtains. A sigh left Alexander’s mouth as he pulled on the pouch&#39;s drawstring. There was no putting this off. It was for Macedon, for his children, and for himself. Scooting back in his chair, Alexander would pull open a desk drawer, retrieving a rusty piece of pointed metal. The object had been entrusted to him by an ally of Macedon. Whoever this piece of metal was tied to, he was unsure. However, Alexander did well to trust his comrades; certainly, this would give birth to a servant worthy of his command.

Standing from his chair, Alexander would approach the summoning circle, laying the catalyst just below the servant frame. His eyes darted across the room, making a mental checklist of everything he needed. The preparations were ready. The King took one final breath to ready his lungs. <em>“Macedon’s future is only moments away!”</em>

“Let silver and steel be the essence.

Let stone and the archduke of contracts be the foundation..

Let rise a wall against the wind that shall fall.

Let the four cardinal gates close.

Let it be declared now; your flesh shall serve under me, and my fate shall be with your sword.

Submit to the beckoning of the Holy Grail.

Answer, if you would submit to this will and this truth.

An oath shall be sworn here.

I shall attain all virtues of all of Heaven;

I shall have dominion over all evils of all of Hell.

From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by three great words of power,

come forth from the ring of restraint, protector of the holy balance”

It was formless and wild, energy in its purest form, though it would not be long before it was made to follow the summoner’s command. The Core buried within the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame’s chest stirred. A connection had been made; a path formed.
At once the thaumaturgy inscribed within the Frame took effect, aided by the mage’s own direction, and like a frothing river coursing down a barren mountainside the magical energy dampening the room rushed towards the metallic skeleton.

Suddenly the room was bathed in light.
The inevitable friction caused by the compression of magical energy as it enveloped the Frame gave off an abrupt brilliance that even the suite&#39;s lavish curtains could not fully contain, the accompanying heat enough to mildly scorch the floor usually hidden beneath an expensive recreation of an Anatolian rug. For a moment that was all there was. An explosion of heat and light, but what followed this powerful invocation was not the smell of singed wood or smoke… but the refreshing fragrance of nature, of wet morning dew as it clung to treetop leaves and the sweet scent of a freshly grazed meadow.

But that could have been no more than a mere trick of the senses, a harmless hallucination caused by one’s overexposure to another’s magical energy when one’s own was vastly depleted; proof that there was now a second entity present within the room to whom this verdant aura belonged to. The lingering glow of the successful summoning yet remained, catching itself on the kicked up dust and smoke to obscure the figure now occupying the space once belonging to the previously life-less S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame, although soon a shadow could be discerned as the cloud gradually dissipated.

Pale green and empty, one would wonder whether she was blind were it not for the fact that they were strictly locked on the man before her. Her hair was of a dark brown, nigh indistinguishable from black, and reached well below her shoulders. While it did seem well cared after, it was only to a rudimentary degree, the softly falling waves showing signs of fraying here and there from being denied treatment that was reserved for nobles in her time. As such she was most likely a commoner, as even her clothes were simple and cheap, yet evidently functional and spotless. She wore a loosely cut robe of lightish green under an olive shaded coat, and similarly sized trousers with flat shoes made of cloth and leather.
Though her clothes were no doubt foreign, their distinct style marked her as one of the lower class. Not a warrior or soldier, but a farmer or rearer of livestock.

What supported this notion was the very way she carried herself.
Her eyes had not once left the one who had called her into this world, and it almost seemed like she was regarding him with something akin to slight apprehension? She carried no weapon in her hands. It was quite apparent that her only belongings were the clothes on her person, and so she slowly raised her hands before her chest to perhaps create a subconscious barrier between herself and the stranger with whom she shared the room. Their almost comical height imbalance only added to the pervasive silence currently suffocating the room, seeing as the girl was almost a full 40cm shorter than her opposite, on top of being much more slender and frail in contrast to her Master’s broad muscular physique.

Why would it call forth this eastern village girl when Alexander had sought a warrior, one with the might and strength to prove themselves worthy to serve under his command?

For once she broke her wary stare and allowed herself a quick survey of the room, her eyes darting quickly from one periphery to the next, barely long enough to take in anything of value, though that appeared to be enough to cause a slight change in her expression. Her eyebrows curled ever-so-slightly as a shadow befell her features, though it was impossible to tell why. Did the luxurious decor not agree with her, or was she perhaps afraid of heights?

Before her body could give away any further clues however, her eyes returned to those of her summoner as she spoke for the first time, “Are you…”

The Servant addressed their Master. It was a formality at this point, a common procedure to affirm the obvious, yet something that needed to be confirmed regardless to establish a proper relationship between both parties. One was the Servant. One was the Master. All she had to do was ask to complete their pact, and yet the words that left her lips sought to discern something else entirely.

She took half a step forward, her shoulders rocking from the movement. Whatever she meant to ask, it was clearly important to her as her fingers clenched around the seam of her robe for assurance.

“Are you a kind person?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As the frame shook and gave off a brilliant light, Alexander’s mind couldn&#39;t help but wander. His head had been so empty just moments ago, but now there was so much. Would he ever see his children again? Would he return home? Is this what Helen would have wanted? Why did these questions have to torment him now, after his decision was already made? His bottom lip curled inward, his teeth biting down. Alexander could not afford such thoughts; this wasn&#39;t for him; it was for his people. His eyes focused intently on the light. There was no going back. He would move forward for Macedon.

As Alexander calmed his mind, the light would cease; the violent outburst of energy fluffed his hair and shifted his glasses downward. Alexander pushed up his glasses, catching the fresh scent in the air. His eyes were stuck in the center of the circle. In the middle was his destiny. Surely greatness awaited him.

Alexander winced as the figure slowly revealed itself. His hazel eyes shifted downward to meet those of his servant. He carefully took in every detail, trying to read the servant before they were afforded a chance to speak. Their clothing and demeanor indicated a lifestyle of anything but a warrior. The servant seemed like a simple village girl; even judging what class they were seemed impossible. Most bewildering of all was their apparent age. “A child?” Alexander whispered to himself. 

Alexander would not speak. This situation was anything but expected… He would give the servants time to adjust and wait to talk to them before making any harsh judgments. After all, she was just a child who appeared scared. 

Hearing the servant utter her first word Alexander would lean in with anticipation. It seemed her demeanor had shifted, if only slightly. He readied his lips, prepared to say ‘yes’ and give a grand speech about Macedon and their goals. However, what Alexander heard was most unexpected.

“Am I a kind person?” he</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018975212353638461 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018975212353638461><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="13-Sep-22 06:03 AM">06:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>repeated. Alexander pushed his hands through his ginger beard. Should he approach the situation as if he were dealing with a child? He considered himself good with children, but this wasn&#39;t just a normal kid. They were a servant. This person had to do something exceptional to now be standing in front of him. After some time for quick thought, he decided to play along.

“Well, that depends on your definition of a kind person. I am a ruler, and I do what I can for my people. I take care of my children, and I love my wife, so id say yes, i am a kind person.” Alexander spoke, trying to find a middle ground between a kid and an adult. Hopefully, he had said what the servant wanted to hear.

For one her posture had loosened, no longer wary, and the hand she had kept in front of her chest now extended its index finger to rest on her chin. Rather than cautious or confused by his words, it appeared that she now regarded him with curiosity. While she wasn’t exactly the best judge, he seemed to have spoken truthfully, though even if what he said had been a blatant lie it wasn’t as if she would have been able to spot it to begin with, let alone expected or even looked out for one. But that should only be expected of someone who had never been lied to in their life.

His words instead caused her to ponder.

<em>“He has a big house. He wants to help his people. He has a wife. They are similar…”</em> though she had only just been summoned, it was like she had never died at all, the pieces that marked the beginning of her tale assembling before her once more, and yet, <em>“...similar, but different.”</em>

Though the circumstances paralleled each other almost too perfectly, there were still distinct differences that separated them. To list them would be to list the differences between a goat and an ape, but what was more important in this case were not the traits they shared but the distinctions that set them apart. For one, his stature alone dwarfed that of F&#224;n L&#237;’s and reminded her more of Grandpa White-

“-pff.”

Though she made no attempt to close the physical distance between them, her eyes now shone with a warmer light.

“If you have children then that makes things easy Papa White,” her smile was filled with pride, perhaps for her ill-fitting nickname to the man who, while a father, barely wore anything white.

Her reasoning was simplistic, perhaps overly so, but it was obvious that there was no ill-intent behind her actions. Having denied him the chance to give his own name by her bizarre entrance, the girl now simply advanced at her own pace and decided on one for him herself. Though at least she was not so rude as to withhold her own.

“My name is Ā-Q&#236;ng! And I… ah…”

Her words halted partway through her introduction as the knowledge imparted with her Frame’s Core caught up to her.

War. Fighting. A Tourney was being held, one that pitted Servant against Servant.
Though she was fed mechanical facts about the current state of the world, she was unable to make sense of most of it as her attachment to the world had never exceeded the level of objective awareness. Places like her mountain home, her goat’s herding routes, and the nearby villages’ market places were memorized for their importance, but it was always the people which inhabited them which she held in higher regard. After all, even the most breath-taking of sceneries would lose its luster in the absence of the one that gave its beauty meaning.

Her words were unwavering and clear, not a trace of fear to be found in them. She posed the question with the same ease as someone offering their friend a snack, only that the current topic of discussion could not be further removed from anything remotely so light-hearted. Neither did she seem opposed to the implication, merely confirming the intention of her Master with oblivious lack of self-awareness.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alexander fumbled with his glasses as the girl took on a joyous tone. Despite her apprehensive arrival, she was quick to accept Alexander. It seemed he really was dealing with a child. To the average person a child is easily underestimated. However, from Alexander&#39;s own upbringing and experience he recognized that children were a source of pure unfiltered talent. Alexander would have to bet on this idea, but, until then he would have to play the game of &#39;formalities&#39; and introductions a little longer... He&#39;d also have to address the title of &#39;Papa white&#39;...

&quot;Yes Ā-Q&#236;ng, that&#39;s exactly why I summoned you today.&quot; As Alexander spoke he knelt down to Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s eye level. &quot;My names is Alexander Vladisnov. I am the leader of a place called Macedon. This war is a great opportunity to bring a prosperous age to my kingdom, and to aid my people. Your job will be to work with me as a team, and to help me realize that dream. But to do that we should get to know each other first.&quot;

The players gathered for this conflict were too ideal after all.

Glossing over his title and goal for this War, Ā-Q&#236;ng waited until Alexander had finished explaining his circumstances before spiritedly nodding at his explanation of her duties with bright eagerness, “I have never played together as a team before, but it sounds like fun!”

She did not appear opposed to the idea in the slightest, although a crease formed on her forehead nonetheless.

“I have never played with other Servants before, but from what I have been told they are just like me, so I cannot wait to see what it is like to not have to hold back with them! But on a team…”  Ā-Q&#236;ng regarded her Master with a concerned look, “You look strong, but it would be sad if you would break so soon. I do not think you can recover as fast as Grandpa White after all.”

What was this girl saying? She of all people was concerned over someone many times her size and weight when it was still doubtful whether or not her arms possessed enough strength to swing a proper weapon?

“But that is alright,” she continued with a reassuring smile, folding her arms behind her back and leaning forward to meet Alexander’s eye-line, “I can protect you so that you will not break if you do not want to. There are still many things you want to do after this, and for that you need to be healthy.”

Hopping gleefully onto the cushioned fabric, Ā-Q&#236;ng let her feet dangle off the edge as they were not long enough to reach the ground as she continued, “You want to know more about me?”

Her heels softly knocked thrice against the sofa while she took a few seconds to ponder.

“Everybody always wants to know about Grandpa White after watching me fight, but they always get scared once they find out he is a big ape for some reason. Even though he can be a bit scary sometimes, he has always played with me ever since I was young so I think he just does not want to be lonely, but he also doesn’t like making new friends so he can be a little difficult to deal with at times?” Ā-Q&#236;ng rambled on without much thought.

“I also don’t live in a big house like yours, but I like the space. I think my mother would too. I am usually busy herding my goats, but now that I am a Servant I am not really sure what to do anymore, so I am happy that you want me to help you. This also means that I can play with other Servants of course!”

Now regarding Alexander with an expectant gaze, Ā-Q&#236;ng was waiting for his turn to talk about himself. While she wasn’t exactly wrong that this was one way of ‘getting to know one another’, it seemed she was still missing the point of what it was that was expected of her as a Servant. For once she had yet to mention her Class, let alone her abilities and what she was ultimately capable of, though seeing how fatherly her Master had been treating her, it appeared she was simply enjoying their conversation without much thought.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ā-Q&#236;ng spoke with the innocence of a child, yet at the same time grew excited over battle. She was an enigma, a sheltered child prodigy perhaps. That was something Alexander could relate to. 

Alexander stood up from his crouched position, stretching out his back, cracks crawling up his spine. Old age had made such movements less desirable. He grabbed the leather chair from under the wooden desk, scooting it towards Ā-Q&#236;ng and taking a seat. It seemed that it would take a while to get what he wanted out of the girl. The servant had spoken about everying except what he wanted to hear. She was extremely excitable and seemed happy to have someone to chat with. Perhaps this kind of conversation would do well to build trust between the two. As a ruler, Alexander understood there was more to working with people then formalities. 

&quot;Well Ā-Q&#236;ng this isn&#39;t my home. It&#39;s just a place I&#39;m renting for a while. My real home is back in Macedon. There I have my wife, Anita. I have four sons: Alexander II, Jason, Peri, and Perse, and six daughters: Helen II, Belle, Cleo, Atalanta, Hera, and Camilla. I suppose my family is a lot bigger then yours, but your Grandpa sounds like he cared about you a lot.&quot; As Alexander mentioned each of his children he took a short break to reminisce on each one. He clearly cared about his family and wanted the best for them. 

&quot;I was raised as a warrior in addition to being a ruler, so I&#39;m quite proficient at playing myself. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about me breaking.&quot; Alexander could only assume that playing was Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s way of saying &#39;fight&#39;. Hopefully he could bolster her confidence in his fighting capabilities.

&quot;Now what Id really like to know about is how you&#39;d go about playing with the other servants. What kind of weapon do you use, and what skills are you capable of?&quot;

Then there was the sheer size of his family. While it wasn’t unheard of for up to three generations of the same family to live in the same household in her time, to have grown to such size in a single one was a rare occurrence indeed, especially so for a daughter who had been raised alone by her mother for her entire life.

However.
When Alexander mentioned that he too was a warrior, Ā-Q&#236;ng’s eyes gained a dangerous glint, one that only sharpened after taking note of the confidence with which he spoke. In her time she had met many men whose boasts were many times more exaggerated than his honest claim, but things were different now. Times had changed, the world had changed, and so it wasn’t impossible that mankind’s capabilities had grown. He assured her that she need not worry about him breaking, and what reason did she have to doubt him?

“You want to know how I play… People always want to know where or how I learned what I do, but all I really do is swing my bamboo stick, so in the end I just had to show them.”

Her legs stopped swinging, becoming deathly still, though her jovial attitude remained unchanged.

“I like using bamboo sticks when playing because they are flexible and fun to use, but they also hurt a lot when you get hit by them, so just using my arms and legs is usually fine when I lose my pole. And Skills… you mean like tricks? I can balance very well! And also, as a Servant I think I do not have to look for a nice stick myself since I can grow them myself now~”

Even in life she found it difficult to put the nature of her martial arts into words and resorted to bringing others to her teacher Grandpa White, or simply showcasing her skills in live-combat. Setting aside her Primary Noble Phantasm which she deliberately withheld, her remaining abilities were either completely unknown to her, or so naturally incorporated in her lifestyle that she wouldn’t even believe them to be worth mentioning.

Alexander still had one potential avenue left to pursue however, that being to rely on the Clairvoyance unique to all Masters which allowed them to gauge the general capabilities of the Servants around them in a manner most suited to them. While enemy Servants would naturally only betray the smallest of hints, in regards to Ā-Q&#236;ng, his very own Servant who had quickly opened up to him, he mayhap be able to fill in the remaining blanks left unsaid by her.
Alternatively he could answer the competitive air she had started to exude ever since his earlier assurance of his own strength.

“But if you just want to play a little right now, just my hands should be enough,” words that almost sounded like a threat were uttered with an excited smile.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ā-Q&#236;ng had a rather excited reaction at his mention of being a warrior. Perhaps he had spoken too much in an attempt to gain her trust. Non the less it was still an effective method to get her talking. Despite his efforts being successful it seemed that the servant had little to explain. In her innocence she was unaware of what she was truly capable of, at least that&#39;s how it looked. 

Alexander took note of Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s weapon of choice. &#39;A bamboo stick&quot; it wasn&#39;t a blade but still a melee weapon. A knight class servant wielding an unconventional weapon wasn&#39;t unheard of. Alexander had no doubt that Ā-Q&#236;ng had a strong fighting prowess. This much he could tell from her composure and thirst for battle. 

There were still a few blanks to be filled in, however, it seemed that Ā-Q&#236;ng was willing to show the King first hand what she was capable of. Alexander knew he was no match for a Servant, and there was a chance that Ā-Q&#236;ng would hurt Alexander in the name of fun. However, he just couldn&#39;t turn down this opportunity.

&quot;Well Ā-Q&#236;ng I&#39;d love to play with you if you&#39;ll give me the chance.&quot; Alexander stood from his chair with a warm smile. He too was excited. Excited to see just exactly what his servant could do. He would make his way over to the wooden desk, grabbing stones from his leather pouches, placing the colorful rocks into his coat pockets.

&quot;Although you should know that as a normal human I cannot endure nearly as much as you. This is just fun so don&#39;t go breaking me now. Alright?&quot; As Alexander spoke he made his way to the door gesturing for Ā-Q&#236;ng to follow. It wouldn&#39;t be smart to spar up in the room. They&#39;d need to go somewhere less populated and restrained.

Bouncing off the sofa and hurrying to follow her Master’s pace, her eyes were glued to the pretty stones that he retrieved from his desk and stored in his pockets. Did he mean to throw them at her, or did he perhaps mean to hurl them at her using a sling? Taking a better look at him, his clothes seemed rather tight and restrictive, not exactly meant for unrestrained movement when compared to her loose robes, so she couldn’t help but wonder.

“Are you going to change first?”

She did not know where he was leading her as she was a stranger to this land, and so she dutifully followed his lead, keeping the short trip lively with conversation.

“Ah, or perhaps you fight from the back after all. With those stones of yours?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
