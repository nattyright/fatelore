Seeing as it also served as a living library for a select number of flora and fauna, the sheer variety of brushes and trees did not allow for the scenery to grow stale, making a return journey well worth the effort. 

The park was also quite large, so despite its popularity, it wasn’t particularly difficult to find a quiet corner tucked away behind a few odd turns of dense foliage, ensuring that Ā-Q&#236;ng and her Master would not be prematurely interrupted by a curious onlooker, though perhaps this was also done in consideration for their safety.

Ā-Q&#236;ng liked this place. Here she could feel the breath of nature, silent yet strong, and allow herself to drink deep of the fresh scents of the earth. Their ceiling was the sky and trees marked their walls. Though fundamentally artificial, the presence of nature would never fail to bring her peace, though her brief reverie was eventually cut short once her mind was reminded of why they sought out this place to begin with.

Frame that did not quite have the hardware necessary to fully replicate her physical prowess. Nevertheless, even should a mountain lack its share of boulders and rocks, at the end of the day it remained a mountain. Even when called forth via imperfect means, a Servant’s strength was not to be underestimated.

Once they were ready, Ā-Q&#236;ng raised her left arm and opened her palm towards her Master, though it wasn’t as if she had taken up a stance. Her posture remained casual and relaxed, so perhaps she simply wanted to give her opponent an obvious target to aim for?

“Hit me as hard as you can,” she suddenly suggested with a smile, “Do not worry about me, this is just to see how rough I can play with you.”

The implications of her strange offer were left unsaid, such as the fact that she could seemingly tailor herself to her opponent or that she appeared confident to be able to take a punch from a full-grown man. This much was only to be expected from Servants of course, but it was still rather odd coming from someone so deceptively unassuming like herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Walking around the city had been quite tough on his aging body. However, this soreness would be nothing compared to his body in a few days when combat would become the norm. 

Stepping back Alexander would deeply inhale the fresh air. Just like the shopping mall, the king would take great inspiration from this area. Macedon certainly had it&#39;s greener areas, however, the city was still cooling down from a large and ongoing industrial age. The greenery of this park was something Alexander could see replicating back at home. Although, aside from the fact that they were lavish, greenery and shopping malls were still on the bottom of Alexander&#39;s to do list. He did have a war to win afterall, and now was his chance to feel out the strength of his newly acquired weapon; Ā-Q&#236;ng

&quot;As hard as I can?&quot; Alexander repeated a small laugh escaping from between his lips. &quot;Well alright I&#39;ll give you a solid punch. Although Ā-Q&#236;ng, you should know that I don&#39;t fight with my hands, so this isn&#39;t very indicative of my true strength.&quot; 

Alexander would then space himself a few feet from Ā-Q&#236;ng. He took up a boxing stance, his right foot back and left foot forward. Stepping once he would swing his hips forward along with his right hand, connecting with Ā-Q&#236;ngs palm. Alexander&#39;s punch was that of an amateur boxers. From the force of his punch he was definitely trained in combat. Fist fighting however was not his strong suit. 

&quot;Underwhelmed?&quot; Alexander asked jokingly

With utter lack of resistance. Suspiciously so?

His hit had definitely landed, his knuckles now clearly making contact with the tender skin of her palm, her fingers even slightly curled around his solid fist from the force of his impact, or rather, perhaps it was more so to catch his blow and guide it? This still did not serve to explain the strange sensation that Alexander would no doubt be made victim to, that being the lack of tangible feedback from his attack. Upon closer inspection, all would become clear.
Ā-Q&#236;ng’s forearm and elbow moved backwards in a weird motion motion, like a piston whose movement was decided by a foreign joint.
Her knees were slightly bent, her body leaning to her left to open up the side of her body receiving her Master’s punch, and for a lack of a better word, faultlessly absorbing it to the point that not a single iota of resistance or friction was perceived by him, let alone registered by his senses.

Naturally he could still feel the modest warmth of her palm as it was wrapped around his fist, but that was all he could feel, creating a unique alien sensation of punching thin air despite knowing that your attack had landed.

Once Alexander’s body had come to a halt, so did Ā-Q&#236;ng’s, pebbles crunching under her feet as she anchored her body to the ground with what little weight her body commanded. It was only now that Ā-Q&#236;ng responded to her Master’s earlier admission that unarmed combat was not his forte.

It is my first time fighting as a Servant too, so I just wanted to make sure to get used to my body and yours,” Ā-Q&#236;ng cheerfully assured as she let go of her Master’s hand, curiously peeking at her left palm as she stretched and flexed it once or twice in an attempt to get used to the sensation.

“All done!” she enthusiastically exclaimed once finishing her odd exercise and moved on to answer her Master’s last question, “And not at all! I cannot cut as well with bamboo as I can with my sword, and using a bow to shoot lets me hit targets that my hands cannot reach.”

Ā-Q&#236;ng was… stating the obvious?
Perhaps she was trying to assuage the concerns of her practice opponent in regards to his lacking expertise in fighting bare-handed, but it was not done so out of pity, guilt, nor pride. It was a factual understanding of the fact that each approach possessed inherent strengths and weaknesses, and that rather than be ashamed of the shortcomings of one’s preferred style, it was more productive to focus on the advantages unique to it.

Ā-Q&#236;ng’s demeanor changed, the warm air around her growing sharper as the atmosphere of sweet mountain air gave way to the metallic stench of steel. All imagined of course, though as Alexander himself was a trained warrior, his instincts should have sharpened enough to pick up on the subtle change of his Servant’s mannerisms. Whereas she had been just a child before, now one could glimpse the warrior contained within.

For the briefest of instants, like thick autumn clouds obscuring the midnight moon from sight, Ā-Q&#236;ng features were awash with an unmistakable melancholy. In the nation of her birth it was said that a woman’s beauty was enhanced when in a state of distress or agony, and though this proverb was originally intended to refer to a another woman whose birthplace Ā-Q&#236;ng shared, it was now apparent that it was meant as a universal truth after all.

Regardless.
As soon as this uncharacteristic change came over her, so did it disappear, or rather, was deliberately pushed to the wayside.

“If you do not fight with your hands, show me what your rocks can do!” Ā-Q&#236;ng’s voice rang out in encouragement, but the source was no longer to be found.

Not unlike being blinked out of existence or being momentarily forgotten by the world itself, every trace of her being vanished from one moment to the next, no hints or signs present to announce the sudden disappearance.
Wind and air struggled to keep up with her, a soft gust appearing where she had just stood to rush back into the vacuum she had left and fill it with Alexandria’s comforting spring breeze, and though one step delayed, the currents now traced a direct path, aftershocks of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s unexpected movement. Within a blink, not unlike chasing away the morning blurriness of one’s eyes after having just woken from a restful sleep, the Servant now re-appeared directly on top of her Master’s still outstretched fist that had remained up from his previous punch, though now perhaps slightly lowered.

At once the flow of time resumed as normal, as if the previous few fractions of a second had been caused by the stuttering of the world that had only now managed to catch up, now affording Alexander a clear view of his Servant’s body.

Her left foot curled, toes weakly prodding at Alexander’s skin as her body bent to keep it from pushing against her Master any further, and using that movement to empower her coming strike. Like a figure-skater, she kept her limbs close to her body to aid in acceleration, her left leg serving as a pivot as her right spun around it, gathering more and more speed before unfurling just before making contact with her Master’s chest.

It was an acrobatic maneuver straight out of a low-budget kung fu movie, only that this was indeed the real thing, but one thing felt very off.

Not to say that it wasn’t expertly performed, but from its speed, its weight, and down to the very motions of her body that gave away exactly where she aimed her attack and when it would hit, any warrior that had gathered enough battle-experience would be able to ‘understand’ it, at least instinctually. It should be noted that this was not an effect of her uncanny ability to pass on her skills to others through combat, but a very deliberate choice on her part. This attack was measured and calculated, trimmed and tailored down to the very fluttering of her robes to Alexander’s exact skill-level, making it perfectly possible for him to dodge or block it under great duress.

Not that it would be easy.

He would have to give his all and react instantly to come out of it unscathed, though even should it hit, it was mostly an attack meant to blow him away several paces to create distance rather than an attack to inflict any lasting harm.
It was a challenge.
A bar.
A clearly defined limit set out by his Servant.

With not a single word spoken, her Wisdom of the Bamboo Grove spoke not to his mind, but his very soul, imparting him with a message clearer than a spring-water stream.

Like a fruit dangling just out of arm’s reach, the martial art displayed by Ā-Q&#236;ng did not belittle her Master, it commanded him to reach out. As he was now he could not reach the fruit…
…but only as he was now.

<em>“Reach for it. Take it. How much farther can you grow?”</em>

Ā-Q&#236;ng was not the only name by which she was known.
In the official records of history she was known as Yuen&#252;, the Yue Maiden, a moniker as fleeting as the Maiden of the Southern Forest. In myth it was believed that she was the reincarnation of Jiutian Xuann&#252;, a Chinese Deity of War, and whether real or not, her current manifestation was much more ephemeral than that. Hers was a story born from folktales and hearsay, the tale of the Sword of the Yue Maiden that served as the earliest known exposition on the art of the sword, influencing Chinese martial arts for generations, but hers was an art easily adapted into other styles as well. From fists, to spears, and bows, the fundamentals taught by her martial art were but potent soil for the individual to grow their own seeds, allowing those learning her art to interpret her skills in their own way. For their own style.

He observed his knuckles, rolling them gently. The punch felt solid upon impact; however, there was visibly little effect. There’s no doubt that punch would have taken out an average child of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s size, but Ā-Q&#236;ng wasn&#39;t a normal child. She was a servant, most likely much stronger than an average human. Even if that wasn&#39;t the case, Alexander had no doubts that her physical capabilities far outclassed his.

A smirk crawled across the king&#39;s face as if he had just been told a humorous joke. Ā-Q&#236;ng was humble. She chose her words carefully to avoid insulting her master’s strength. Alexander pondered how genuine the fighter&#39;s words were. To be humble is to earn respect; this was something he knew well through his many negotiations with rival cities. Perhaps Ā-Q&#236;ng spoke only to appease her opponent. In the same way, Alexander acted to gain her respect. Of course, it’s also possible that Ā-Q&#236;ng truly didn&#39;t want to belittle her master; maybe her words were genuine and not spoken just to maintain his respect. Though Alexander could not decipher the meaning behind his servant’s words, one thing was clear. She wanted to see what he was capable of. This fight was a mutual exchange of interest.

“Alri-” before Alexander could reciprocate his excitement Ā-Q&#236;ng had already disappeared. Her speed was unmatched; Alexander’s eyes failed to trace her movement. Before he could register that she was moving, Ā-Q&#236;ng was already hovering over his fist. Her stance and movements were reminiscent of action movies; she was the real deal.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022566064426594354 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022566064426594354><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Sep-22 03:52 AM">03:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A gust of wind brushed against Alexander’s face, his coat flickered behind him, his glasses turning crooked. Alexander’s senses had gone dull in the presence of Ā-Q&#236;ng’s incoming kick. As she moved forward, Alexander’s soul would resonate with her movement. The image in his head became clearer, a diamond shining with brilliance, light cutting through the thick center of the jewel, refracting into a fluttering light. Every edge was pristinely cut, allowing the light to shine through perfectly on each side. The diamond was that of meticulous hands. Such a gem could not be cut by a machine, a true work of art.

The kick landed against Alexander’s chest, pushing him back several feet, his mind broken from the jewels image. As he looked up at his servant, her intentions became clear. The jewel in his head said everything he needed to know. Ā-Q&#236;ng was operating at Alexander’s level. He moved as far back as she wanted; she hit him as hard as he could endure. Ā-Q&#236;ng had true mastery over her art. At this moment, Alexander came to realize everything he had wanted. Ā-Q&#236;ng was strong. Her power was raw, a talent that could push him to grow stronger. With his knowledge of strategic warfare, he had no doubts that their strengths combined would make for a terrifying duo.

A deep laugh forced its way from Alexander’s lungs; his eyes quivered with joy. He had the sound and look of a mad man, Alexander’s true nature showed itself for only a moment. He gripped his glasses, tossing them to the floor. They were only for show, and he didn&#39;t want them getting in his way. 

“In the modern age, Ā-Q&#236;ng distance is a fighter&#39;s best weapon” whether it was knowingly or not, Ā-Q&#236;ng’s kick put Alexander in a more favorable position. His left hand reached behind his coat, pulling a gold-clad shotgun to his front. The left barrel had been preloaded with a jasper and the right barrel a quartz jewel. A quartz stone would fall from Alexander’s right-hand, landing just underneath his feat.

He moved at a speed far beyond what his physical body would normally allow. As he moved a greater distance away from Ā-Q&#236;ng, Alexander’s shotgun would rise. A loud bang would ring out as a white stone flew towards Ā-Q&#236;ng at the speed of a bullet. Should it hit her or she try to block it, a mana barrier would expand to fit a five-foot radius, applying a force twice as strong as his punch from before.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As her Master bellowed a deep and manic cackle it would not be difficult to mistake him for a beast, one finally granted the opportunity to be let loose.

Both body and mind fully immersed in the battle, Alexander yet retained the presence of mind to chide his Servant for her oversight in regards to her previous kick, though whether that was a reflex of his parental instinct or simply the mannerisms of a trained combatant meaning to inform his opponent was unclear. Either way, he chided her for her mistake and pulled out a masterfully forged… pipe? Or perhaps it would be more accurate to call it an oddly welded together bundle of bent pipes?
They were richly accented with copious amounts of gold, meant not only to fortify and balance the weight of the weapon, but also to elevate the armament to the status as befit a King. Accordingly, the handle of his weapon was expertly adorned with the likeness of a roaring lion, superficially serving no other purpose than decoration and intimidation, though upon further inspection it would become clear that the intricately constructed head cleverly disguised the weapon’s reload mechanism while also serving as the wielder’s handguard, the spiky mane even allowing for it to be used as an impromptu bludgeoning weapon should an enemy press too closely into one’s territory and deny its function as a mid to long-ranged firearm.

However, Ā-Q&#236;ng had no idea what a firearm was, let alone what they were used for.

Once more, she moved swiftly and without pause, her flowing motions accented by her long hair and robes acting like a blurred streak tracing the path she traveled, yet still, her steps were measured and easy to follow, her trajectory not impossible to predict and her speed easy to follow. It seemed like her earlier kick was not a one-time fluke, as her proficiency really had been calibrated to perfectly accommodate Alexander’s own.
He could see her, and consequently, he could take aim.

Using one of the rocks he had brought from his apartment, he used some manner of spell to maintain the distance kept between, propelling himself away from the approaching girl, while simultaneously firing another gem directly at her.
It was a crystal of purest white. Its chalky hue blurred from the sheer velocity it was fired at, but still, it remained beautiful even as it closed in on Ā-Q&#236;ng to cause her harm. Briefly deliberating whether to dodge the projectile or strike at it, Ā-Q&#236;ng ultimately decided to indulge her interest and snatch the rock out of the air to take a closer look, but unbeknownst to her, her attempt was fated to fail.

As soon as her fingers made contact with the rock, with a sudden explosive burst, the quartz would crack and crumble, made to shatter by an unknown force and violently erupt into a barrier hitting Ā-Q&#236;ng with concussive force instantly expanding at point-blank range.

“!?”

Not that she had the luxury of digesting her observations mid-assault.

Her fingers tensed and hardened into a claw, no longer meaning to catch the projectile now that it was no more, and struck at the invisible barrier with the intention to shatter it before it could expand any further and hit her body. Immediately she felt the pain of the harsh feedback as her nails made contact, too weak to puncture it completely. It was clear she was losing this contest of strength, and though she had slowed the barrier’s expansion by the smallest fraction of a second, her body would be the first to give out and break should she continue her thoughtless approach.

As if in response to her plight, magical energy flared and stirred the air around her.

Ā-Q&#236;ng lacked the raw strength to overpower Alexander’s magecraft, and innately, her Lancer Vessel’s Magic Resistance would not be enough to fully cancel the spell’s effects, but fortunately she yet possessed the means to bridge the gap. While lacking the technical understanding possessed by mages of the modern area, Ā-Q&#236;ng was nevertheless intimately familiar with the power contained within one’s body, one’s personal stores of magical energy that served as essential fuel for all manner of magecraft. Completely oblivious to the finer details, she nevertheless knew how to make use of the full extent of her body’s strength, and as such, her fingers were spared a grizzly fate as they were enveloped by an ephemeral edge, her outstretched palm now a blade that resisted the magical barrier called forth by the quartz. Her brief surge of Qi suffused her entire body, shielding her from the harmful effects of the barrier, but that did not mean that she was immune to it.

Though her Qi moderately empowered the reach and lethality of her strikes, it lacked the raw strength to completely overpower her Master’s magecraft, and so she would labor to deflect it instead.

It happened in an instant.

Like a rolling wave crashing upon the rocky shore or a forceful gust sweeping over the forest canopy, Ā-Q&#236;ng’s body now internally mimicked the uniform invocation of a chain sequence. It was a controlled yet powerful ripple that surged from her very toes to the uttermost reach of her left fist. Though she barely moved a step, the consecutive tightening of her various muscle groups generated instantaneous explosive force from minimal movement, a technique popularly known as the ‘One-Inch Punch’ in modern times, only now empowered with a final burst of Qi that collectively smashed into the wall called forth by her Master’s quartz crystal, still not powerful enough to annihilate it, but possessing just enough force divert it and push it to the wayside, sparing her body from the worst of its effects.

Her Magic Resistance was only reactively empowered by her Qi after she had already been hit by the attack, which had caused her left sleeve to be shredded halfway up towards her shoulder and the nails of her left hand be chipped, her knuckles bruised from the impact with lacerations bad enough to have drawn small amounts of blood.

Alexander had no doubt emerged the victor of this exchange, but this did not mean that Ā-Q&#236;ng’s spirit had dampened in the slightest.

Her Master was clearly enjoying himself too, and already he had shown her a sight she had not once witnessed in life.
Crystals that combusted into pure force, used for both movement and attack, perhaps even defense, all the while not lifting a single finger due to the strange device held in his hands.
Both were of the same hue, but Ā-Q&#236;ng remembered a larger variety in the pouches that remained in the place of her summoning.

There was still more he could show her.

Her exposed nape shivered with excitement, the pain in her hand forgotten, and Ā-Q&#236;ng answered her body’s excitement by once more resuming her advance. The speed of her dash remained the same as it had before, the route she had chosen the shortest and most direct. It was clear that she was baiting her Master to use more of his rocks on her, delighted by the prospect even, her instincts clearly primed to enjoy the fight to its utmost rather than aiming for victory… most likely to her detriment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had not attempted to dodge nor parry it. Instead her childish curiosity got the better of her. Alexander knew his servant was strong, but anyone&#39;s fingers coming into direct contact with that force was sure to be broken. It seemed however that Alexander&#39;s worries were for nothing. Ā-Q&#236;ng using her mastery over her own body had successfully deflected the shot, her fist only bearing minor wounds. 

Given lancers curiosity it was obvious that she was unfamiliar with Alexander&#39;s weaponry. Despite this Ā-Q&#236;ng was still strong enough to recover from her mishap. Alexander would have to school her in modern fighting to avoid a more grave situation when the steaks are higher. 

Alexander looked up at his opponent. Their excitement was palatable and he returned the same feeling. Ā-Q&#236;ng was a fiend for battle and Alexander a man willing to go to any means for his goal. The exchange with his servant only fortified his belief that the two of them would win in the name of Macedon.

&quot;Curiosity is a weapon best wielded by your opponent, do well to hide yours&quot; Alexander offered a second tidbit of advice. He would use this moment to teach Lancer the dangers of their modern day opponents. 

Watching as Ā-Q&#236;ng dashed in his direction, Alexander&#39;s gun pointed at the floor between them. From the barrel came a red stone crashing into the floor. The shattering of the jasper was followed by an explosion of flames lining the floor effectively cutting off Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s direct path. Alexander was excited to see how she would deal with this obstacle. 

This type of testing would go back and forth. Ā-Q&#236;ng&#39;s physical abilities against Alexander&#39;s mind. His zoning capabilities keeping his out of harms way and throwing one problem after another to his servant. This exchange would go on for some time with themvnot showing any sign of slowing down till nighttime.
