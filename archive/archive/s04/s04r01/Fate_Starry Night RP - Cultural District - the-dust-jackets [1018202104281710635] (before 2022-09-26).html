<em>Of course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass, one of those round spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundred times bigger than it is. When any one takes one of these and holds it to their eye and looks at a drop of water from the pond, they see above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never discerned in the water. But there they are, and it is no delusion. It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in a crowd. And how fierce they are! They tear off each other&#39;s legs and arms and bodies, and yet they are merry and joyful in their way.</em>

&#39;Yes, auntie.&#39;

&#39;I understand, auntie.&#39;

&#39;With all due respect, auntie, I am an adult. I am capable of making my own decisions. I can accomplish feats beyond your wildest dreams. This is my decision and my wish to fight. For us. For all of us. You have no right to stop me. Now, if you will excuse me for a moment...&#39;

Aida swiftly scanned her scribbled notes, flipping page after page with deliberate fervor, as if trying to drown out the sound of her guardian&#39;s voice with the crinkling of the paper between her fingers.

&#39;...I have a summoning chant to complete.&#39; 

She said it with an air of finality, her tone carrying the authoritative lilt of someone well used to imparting information to the less informed. There was no room for debate, as her mind had been made up long ago. 

Two weeks, to be exact.

&#39;I will fight for what is just,&#39; she said out loud, the old-fashioned phone no longer pressed against her ear. For a moment, it hovered dangerously close to the receiver. Then she dropped it back onto its cradle, idly watching the cord coil and knot as she tried to decide what to do next.

She really did just hang up on her dear auntie, didn&#39;t she?

&#39;Is everything alright?&#39;

You know how she can be sometimes.&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s the fifth time she&#39;s called this week. Aren&#39;t you ever going to give her a proper explanation?&#39;

&#39;I did,&#39; Aida said simply.

&#39;And that has gotten you...&#39;

&#39;Progress,&#39; Aida closed the book she had been writing in with a resounding <em>thud</em>. &#39;Please, Cathy, I am having an <em>extremely</em>&#39;-she placed much emphasize on the word-&#39;important conversation with my potential sponsor. A few more calls, and she might just...&#39; She eyed the letter opened on her desk, &#39;give in.&#39;

It sounded less glorious than she had intended. It sounded as if she was doing something unsavory, like sneaking out of her bed in the dead of night to capture fairies by the Canopus shore. Except this time, there was no one who was capable of dragging her back by force.

Had she any idea of the danger she had courted by her decision? Had she any idea what would happen to her should anything go wrong? Of course she had. After all, she hadn&#39;t spent half her life holing up in a library for nothing. The nature of a Holy Grail War, an ancient ritual that summoned Heroic Spirits of the old to contest in a blood bath for a wish, it was no different than rubbing on a genie&#39;s lamp and hoping that one wouldn&#39;t perish at the hand of karmic retribution.

The secret was to keep it on the straight and narrow.

Luckily, that was all Aida had ever known.

&#39;What I am doing is just,&#39; she repeated, her voice echoing throughout the workshop&#39;s expanse.

You know, mercenaries,&#39; she elaborated as she began to sew the pages together, &#39;they&#39;ll stop at nothing to get what they want.&#39;

&#39;Justice always prevails.&#39; Aida answered airily as she, too, picked up a book from her work desk. &#39;Evildoers get their comeuppance. Everyone lives happily ever after.&#39;

&#39;Aida...&#39;

&#39;Cathy.&#39; Aida turned to face her colleague, a flash of impatience in her voice. &#39;If I were you, I would undo the Stab Binding on the poor book you are handling and switch to a Coptic Binding instead. Just because the tome is of oriental origins does not mean that you have to stick to traditions. Visitors will want to read that book. They will hold it in their hands, flick the pages, bend its spine. A Stab Binding eats into the pages. The book will be torn again and find its way back here before long.&#39;

She looked bitingly into her colleague named Cathy. The latter returned her gaze, the wrinkles on her face etched with concern.

&#39;We are librarians,&#39; her colleague said after a while. &#39;I have no right to meddle in your family affairs, but I can at least speak on behalf of the Guild. You were hired for your expertise. You are an invaluable asset to the Guild. Your aunt entrusted you to us. Yet here you are, trying to throw away everything you&#39;ve worked for, all for this Holy Grail War. Have you ever stopped to consider what would happen should you be accosted by one of those mercenaries-&#39;

&#39;I know full well the danger I have courted.&#39;

To lock prized librarians behind closed doors?</strong>&quot;

The bell by the door gave a ring as a Servant stepped into the sector. He blew the hair out of his face, before taking several steps into the sector. He looked around at the familiar sights, before continuing to Aida and Cathy&#39;s desks with a bag in one hand and a briefcase in another.

Shoot, was it an appointment day with  Niccol&#242; Paganini already?

&quot;What good would it do to leave your best instruments behind on your way to the greatest performance of a generation? What piece ends right before its crescendo? I always brought my <em>Stradivari</em> when I performed before the crown. But I digress...&quot;

Paganini continued to monologue as he set the bag on Aida&#39;s desk. &quot;You both are as lovely as ever. It breaks my heart each time I have to send an instrument your way, knowing you must waste your time on my little outbursts...&quot;

As if on cue, the bag spilled open slightly, showing a mountain of destroyed instruments, from flutes to violins to electric triangles. By this point, the two had learned that in Paganinese, &#39;outbursts&#39; meant that another musician from Alexandria&#39;s Culture District was playing recently. 

If there were an excess of broken violins, that meant that Arcangelo Corelli was currently passed out in alley somewhere, being recovered by Alexandrian technicians and medical staff for recovery. Several dented brass instruments meant that Wagner and Paganini had scuffled. The list went on.

Whenever music was around, Paganini tended to break whatever he was holding. Typically the faces of his fellow &#39;musicians&#39;, as if they could even compare to him. More like &#39;underlings&#39;.

&quot;The briefcase has my quarterly contributions to Alexandria&#39;s archives. Be a dear and archive them?&quot; Last time Niccolo had visited the Great Library himself, it had caused a massive stampede due to his popularity.

Luckily that had never happened here. Luckily.

&quot;Where was I? Ah, the tournament. Yes, yes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020748222697848912 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020748222697848912><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 03:29 AM">03:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>There is no greater honor than protecting Alexandria.

Eventually, her expression found equilibrium in a mixture of mild approval, bemusement, and weariness.

&#39;Already, Paganini?&#39; She answered the slightly disheveled virtuoso with a question of her own. &#39;Which poor souls did you harass this time? I wasn&#39;t aware of any concerts being held today.&#39;

She peered into the bag. Of course there would be violins. Three of them, in fact. Woodwinds, strings, brass. A mini orchestra in a bag! She briefly wondered whether Paganini had gone to the Republic embassy lately. She&#39;d heard that the protestants had begun to purchase vuvuzelas in bulk, much to the dismay of the residents in the Foreigner&#39;s District.

&#39;The last batch of instruments you left with us are still being repaired,&#39; she attempted to push the bag off her desk, but to no avail. It might as well be bricks in there.

So, she turned her attention to the briefcase, testing her strength on its handle. She <em>could</em> lift this one, she realized. Then, drawing herself up to her fullest height and standing a full head shorter than the man with the dramatically large hat, she rounded on Paganini and thrust the briefcase back into his now empty arms.

&#39;Didn&#39;t you just agree with me that there would be no more sitting behind desks?&#39; She huffed. &#39;We are <em>very</em> understaffed this week.&#39;

Excuse or not, she certainly sounded very believable. After all, she and Catherine were the only librarians holding down the fort, in a workshop that seemed all too large for two.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 04:23 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020760096474673183 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020760096474673183><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 04:16 AM">04:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Schubert was doing an unscheduled performance over by Rialto Bridge yesterday. I couldn&#39;t hear the music, but judging from his fingerwork, he was off by about three quarters of a second during his final cadences. Unacceptable!&quot; Paganini looked at Aida, as if expecting the librarian to agree with this totally reasonable reason to bash the musician&#39;s head in.

To Paganini, there was nothing more unacceptable than shoddy music. To him, <em>all</em> music not played by him was shoddy. All the other musicians summoned by Alexandria were just too slow. He was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best musician in all of Alexandria. And yet people still thought Schubert was a better musician than him? Bah!

&quot;He&#39;s got a few good shots in, but I tossed him into the river. He&#39;ll be fussing over his hair for days. Ha!&quot; Paganini chortled, before going into a monologue of all the people that made Ada&#39;s eyes glaze over. The musician was typically polite to her, but when he got going, he never knew when to shut up.

After stopping to catch a breath, he leveled his hat, bemused. &quot;Apologies. I&#39;m rambling about all these fraudulent musicians when I should be rambling about the work you do. Take as much time as you need. It is no problem. I believe a tournament would be good for a shut-in like you, Aida.&quot;

Paganini casually skirted over the fact that he was part of the reason Aida was behind a desk 24/7. He was aware—and embarrassed—that he often dumped so many instruments on the Bookbinding Guild. When he wasn&#39;t dealing with that loudmouthed twat Wagner or Beethoven, he almost felt normal.

&quot;<strong>Why, we might even fight on the same team! Assuming my request is approved.</strong>&quot; Paganini said offhandedly, shrugging. &quot;Luckily it isn&#39;t being hosted in the Foreigner&#39;s District. I recently received a notice that I am no longer allowed in the area.&quot;

Paganini was an infectious performer, but a wordsmith he was not. He was much more persuasive with his violin - in more ways than one - than he was with his tongue. 

&#39;You are still dodging my question.&#39; The librarian hammered the figurative nail on the violinist&#39;s head. &#39;I <em>will</em> take as much time as my need, then,&#39; she added, as if daring Paganini to retract his offer. Should the violinist grow impatient in a few weeks&#39; time and trash the workshop in one of his infamous rampages... she recited the emergency procedures in her head. Code Paganini, the librarians called it. Keep calm, keep out of harm&#39;s way, keep tabs on all property damage on site, and file for claims at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#republic-embassy</span> after the dust has settled.

She returned to her previously fruitless task of removing the bag of instruments from her desk. If she couldn&#39;t make the bag move, she would just declutter everything else around it. Her books, notes, ink bottles, pen nibs... she was halfway through building a new pagoda of books on the other corner of her desk when Paganini dropped a small bombshell. 

&#39;You? In the tournament?&#39; Why, she&#39;d never heard anything about a Servant - or anyone for that matter - being able to apply for admissions alone. Even she had to spend a few nights toiling over a dozen-page long proposal, down to the finer details of how and who she was planning to summon as her Servant in order to be granted approval. 

&#39;Have you found a Master already?&#39; She asked, though the skepticism was evident in her voice. &#39;You weren&#39;t banned from the Foreigner&#39;s District for harassing someone to be your Master, were you?&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 08:57 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020786221309493399 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020786221309493399><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 06:00 AM">06:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even as a performer must bring out their most prized instrument for their performance, Alexandria must bring out their most prized Servants to protect their sovereignty. Our beloved library would gladly send their strongest Servants to defend the city.&quot; Paganini said, his smile displaying a beacon of pride that threatened to give Aida a sunburn.

Yet, was that bitterness in his voice? Even as he displayed pride at marching in the name of Alexandria, there was a hint of something else in his gaze. It vanished quickly.

&quot;As for a Master, ah, do not worry. Do I look like the kind of person to beg people on the docks to become MY Master?&quot; He raised his eyebrows expectantly. Paganini rarely groveled. If he went to the Foreigner&#39;s District, he probably had threatened people at flutepoint or something like that.

&quot;No, the Cultural Council is worried that I might end up tearing <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#republic-embassy</span> apart. Those protestors are apparently getting rowdy with their noisemaking.&quot; Paganini shuddered, moving the bag of instruments deftly off Aida&#39;s desk for her own sanity. For a musician, Paganini was scarily strong.

&quot;So, as I was—&quot;

Suddenly, Aida heard an extremely familiar noise: the sound of special shoes grinding on Mana Rails. Shoot! Was it delivery day already? A delivery boy shot through the mana rail that was suspended through the Bookbinding Guild.

&quot;<strong>Package for Moretti!</strong>&quot; The delivery boy yelled, using the force of the mana rail to fling a head-sized package towards the desk. Aida&#39;s heart stopped for a moment. Her perfectly <s>crowded</s> organized desk!

Before she could even blink, Paganini grabbed it from in front of her head. The delivery boy skated off, sparks from the Mana Rail flying off like fireflies.

&quot;—those don&#39;t need to be finished for about a month or later. I have a stockpile of instruments in reserve, but I was thinking about using my Noble Phantasm a bit more to hype up the populace. Boost their mood, you know? What do you think?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1020968389881122826 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1020968389881122826><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Sep-22 06:03 PM">18:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Paganini continued to monologue aimlessly as he held the package.

She lowered her voice in a conspiratorial tone. 

&#39;Are you actually going to tear up the embassy, then?&#39; She inquired with more enthusiasm than one would expect, almost as if she had been anticipating something dramatic for a while. Paganini wasn&#39;t exactly known for being discreet. His name preceded him and his actions were well-known throughout the city. His scuffles with the multitude of musical Servants in Alexandria had even earned him a dedicated column in the local newspaper, which was saying something, considering he had to contend with some equally rowdy personalities in the same field. 

&#39;I think you should do it at their front door, anyway.&#39; She kept nudging the musician towards <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#republic-embassy</span>, which might as well have become synonymous with <em>public enemy #1</em> in her eyes. &#39;Why don&#39;t you rent one of those open-air floating theatre-&#39;

She instinctively drew herself up to her full height as the telltale noise of shoes grinding on Mana Rails reverberated overhead. Like a mother hen trying to protect her chicks, she moved in front of her <s>haphazardly</s> carefully stacked books as a package was sent flying in their direction. It was a disaster in the making, a bookalanche that was about to set her back <em>hours</em>-

With speed rivaling that of his finger work on strings, the famed musician intercepted the package and waved it in the frazzled librarian&#39;s face.

I have the books divided subject, weight, and color. My ink bottles are positioned within arm&#39;s reach no matter where I am sitting. Pouches for tokens in the center, sealing wax arranged by days of the week. Tools...&#39;

It was Paganini&#39;s turn to feel his eyes glaze over. He hadn&#39;t signed up for a house tour, but it was starting to feel like one. The proud librarian introduced him to her genius method of organization that summarized into &#39;I place everything exactly where I <em>alone</em> remember&#39;. It was a miracle that the desk underneath the mountains of paraphernalia hadn&#39;t yet collapsed.

&#39;...and you can leave package on top.&#39; She concluded, pointing to a waterfall of parchment full of notes and diagrams.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021150157426917446 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021150157426917446><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 06:06 AM">06:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Librarians were a lot like Servants. They came in all shapes and sizes, and specialized in many different fields. Aida was a klutz, having dropped Paganini&#39;s instruments multiple times after they were repaired, but a workspace was like a little window into someone&#39;s mind—and workload. It was commendable, even if Aida was infamous for her airheaded tendencies.

As Aida&#39;s monologue finished, the orchestra in Paganini&#39;s brain started up again. He blinked once, twice, thrice, before coming back to his senses.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll leave it right here.&quot; Paganini replied, placing the box in the designated place as deftly as a Berserker could. Even if he was rational compared to most Berserkers, Paganini still struggled with basic tasks. Even holding a pen was difficult for him.

Hence why he made sure not to mention that he organized his ink wells in the exact same method as the librarian.

&quot;Hmmm... That&#39;s quite the idea, Aida!&quot; Paganini said, eyes gazing off into the distance, and the potential headlines attached to tearing down the Republic Embassy. Maybe he would get Hero of the Year, or something like that. The fans would adore him! <strong>Alexandria</strong> would adore him!

&quot;<strong>Once I find my fated Master, I will show those Republic interlopers what for right in their own embassy!</strong>&quot; Paganini said, pumping a fist. &quot;In fact, I shall go looking for them right now. As always, feel free to stop by any of my concerts without a ticket. I&#39;ll be sure to drop an endorsement for the Bookbinder&#39;s Guild.

A vision of Aida&#39;s desk being flooded with even more requests flashed in her mind&#39;s eye.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 02:14 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021251823752982609 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021251823752982609><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 12:50 PM">12:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Goodbye, ladies!&quot; Paganini cried to Cathy and Aida as he turned away and began running off, hat fluttering behind him.

What a scoundrel.

Aida could almost see the machinations of Paganini&#39;s mind whirling behind his eyes as the musician and the artisan bonded over the prophetic demise of an innocent building sitting at the edge of the Foreigner&#39;s district. Surely, no one would mind the totaling a single building when Republic had an entire nomadic city parked dozens of miles away from Alexandria!

&#39;I&#39;ll catch you at your next concert!&#39; Aida waved Paganini goodbye, feeling rather accomplished with herself.

&#39;We&#39;ll be sure to charge the Cultural Department handsomely,&#39; Catherine added from behind her much tidier desk. &#39;If you do end up razing the embassy to the ground, the Bookbinder&#39;s Guild had nothing to do with it whatsoever.&#39; 

Paganini was gone long before his bombastic voice stopped echoing in the antiquated workshop. When the building finally stopped shaking from all that excitement, Aida pulled her chair close and sank into the plump cushions. 

A direct attack on Republic&#39;s home base, huh. Aida mulled the idea over in her head. She could picture her auntie&#39;s face perfectly in her head. 

<em>What&#39;s gotten into that head of yours?</em> She&#39;d bonk Aida with the end of her letter opener. <em>What you are suggesting is criminal offense!</em>

But Aida liked to think of it as a heroic act rather than a heinous one. After all, the bad guys had to be punished. Serves them right for breaching the contract they&#39;d made with Alexandria! 

Feeling more elated than usual, Aida pulled the parchments towards her and doublechecked the words she&#39;d scribbled down earlier. It was a draft of her summoning chant, the fourth draft to be exact, as she couldn&#39;t settle on which side of her family to use as her ancestral cornerstone. She also wanted to get the words right so she could be guaranteed her Servant of choice...

She admired the packaging for a bit, a bright green crinkly paper with last year&#39;s Christmas pattern on it. It looked like a care package sent by someone&#39;s doting grandma who loved reusing all the wrapping papers left from the holidays.

But Aida did not have a doting grandma living on the island of Alexandria. Her auntie barely qualified as doting, more like plain overprotective, and the only things she&#39;d sent Aida lately were letters trying to dissuade her from joining the City Grail War.

Aida quickly tore apart the wrapping paper, producing an inconspicuous looking box from within. Her heart leapt at the Library&#39;s insignia stamped at the corner of the box. 

It was a symbol of triumph. The final ingredient she needed for the War had arrived.

The tale was as old as time. She already knew it by heart. It used to be one of Tomoko&#39;s favorite bedtime stories to tell. Not because it&#39;d put Aida to sleep, but because it would leave her bawling so hard that she&#39;d forget to ask her mommy for more. 

She&#39;d eventually outgrow the crying, and her longing for a happy ending for the brave heroine of the Omishima Island had turned into admiration. If idols still existed in this age, then she would be the first and the only one Aida had ever known. The tale spoke of a shrine maiden who took up arms after her brothers were murdered in battle, after her father had passed away from illness. A girl at the tender age of 16 who led an entire naval fleet to defend her island from the turmoil of war.

And she succeeded spectacularly. Her wits were unmatched and her martial prowess conquered the best of men. No one could touch her, not until she took her own life in grievance to her lover.

All that was left of her was an armor plate and a poem that doubled as a suicide note. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021292589099536424 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021292589099536424><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 03:32 PM">15:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;You didn&#39;t have to go that far,&#39; Aida muttered absentmindedly, tearing the newly delivered package apart as she withdrew a drawstring pouch. The pouch smelled faintly of menthol, which only grew stronger as she turned it over and a bundle of dried twigs fell into her hand. 

It was the first time she&#39;d held a specimen in person, but she recognized the distinct texture of the wood and the smell as it was described in the <em>Ebers Papyrus</em>: camphor trees, the bark of which made for an excellent remedy for fever and pain. 

Of course, the small sample Aida held in her hand didn&#39;t just come from <em>any</em> camphor tree. She had specifically requested it from the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#route-934-head-office</span> that it be the very tree that had thrived in the grove behind the Oyamazumi Shrine, all the way from the days before the shrine maiden had left to take her brothers&#39; place in the war.

Aida knew the ritual by heart: a summoning circle, a catalyst, and a body for her spiritual ancestor to inhabit. Her catalyst was not perfect, but it was the closest thing Alexandria had stocked that brought her to her childhood hero. In a perfect world, she would have loved to recover <strong>Tsuruhime&#39;s</strong> armor plate or her suicide note, but the most ancient tree in the shrine she had once worked at would have to do. 

All that was left was the toll, which she would pay with her mana reserves. Aida glanced at the clock. The hands moved to half an hour before noon, when her mana would reach its peak.

&#39;Cathy,&#39; she started grabbing random articles from her desk. &#39;My catalyst is ready. I&#39;m going to perform my summoning ritual.&#39;

&#39;Your aunt couldn&#39;t stop you.&#39; Catherine rolled her eyes, perfectly conveying the words she had left out: <em>What on earth makes you think I could?</em> 

&#39;Well, I was thinking-&#39;

She even swiveled her chair around to face away from Aida, as if willing her junior to ignore her. Summoning rituals weren&#39;t exactly the novelty it had used to be. Catherine had already witnessed her fair share of summons during her time at Alexandria. There were even an abundance of them online, from blurry phone recordings to professionally curated playlists. 

She heard footsteps across the floor. Her chair was being pulled next, as it was turned back to the way it was before.

Catherine let a sigh escape her lips. &#39;Aida,&#39; she wasn&#39;t about to let the girl off the hook for the cold shoulder she had given her earlier. &#39;If you are looking for some kind of lecture, you will not receive it from me. Call your aunt again if you are feeling unnecessarily provocative.&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m not being difficult. I just wanted to warn you...&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m not going to do anything. Promise.&#39;

&#39;...about the ink.&#39;

&#39;Ah.&#39;

&#39;I need a place to draw my summoning circle.&#39;

&#39;And you can&#39;t do it in your room because it&#39;s chock full of books. Aida,&#39; Catherine set down the book she&#39;d been stitching. &#39;The collection service came by only last week. How many books do you have that are overdue?&#39;

Aida felt her cheeks grow warm. She cast another glance at the clock. &#39;I&#39;ve got 25 minutes to work on my summoning circle...&#39; She said slowly.

&#39;You will not sully the floor of our workshop.&#39; 

&#39;But there&#39;s nowhere else that&#39;s big enough!&#39; Aida contested hotly.

Aida narrowed her eyes.

Or you can always do it tomorrow, and put the remainder of today to good use.&#39; She let her voice drag on. &#39;Clean. Up.&#39;

<em><strong>SLAM!</strong></em>

&#39;I&#39;ll show her,&#39; Aida huffed indignantly as she started sweeping heaps of books out of her room with a technique she called &quot;shove everything out onto the hallway and shut the door so she could pretend they do not exist&quot;. A few books squeezed through the railings and rained onto the main workshop down below, eliciting no reactions at all from the senior librarian who had gotten long used to her antics. Best to leave her be until she&#39;s calmed down, Aida&#39;s colleagues had come to a collective agreement.

It was a wise decision. Few things held Aida&#39;s bristling rage longer than being confronted on it directly. Left to her own devices, it would soon peter out as she easily distracted herself with something else.

Like this broomstick she was currently holding in her hand, which she grabbed onto at the base and poised in front of her like a sword.

What was Tsuruhime like as a warrior? Aida wondered as she imagined herself in the shrine maiden&#39;s armor. From what she remembered from her tale, they were fashioned out of layers of metal and leather. Lacquered in gold and red and white paints, they shone under the moonlight like the plumage of a graceful crane.

Layers of ink streaked around her, falling into place in a perfect circle on the (temporarily) clean floor. Wielding the broomstick, Aida used its bushy tail as a makeshift brush as she slapped and smeared stroke after stroke inside the circle. The patterns were rough and wild, but the proportions held perfectly, each line and curve beautifully held together by their own tension and seemingly seamless internal structure.

In its lifeless fingers clutched the bundle of camphor twigs. Aida pushed her hair behind her ears, slightly out of breath from her handiwork. She could feel her own heartbeat. The clock by her bed struck noon.

She was ready.

The departure from the mundane happened in the blink of an eye. Aida&#39;s acute senses captured the shift in the atmosphere. The ink on the ground seemed to twist and bloom as she recited her freshly penned summoning chant. She knew what a summoning ritual entailed. Should it succeed, somewhere on her body would bore three strokes of bright red marks that sealed her contract to her Servant. Where would those Command Seals appear? She hoped it would be somewhere conspicuous, so that her auntie could no longer refute her right to join the War.

<em>Lend me your strength, protector of Omishima Island. Lend me your sight, holy maiden of the Oyamazumi Shrine.</em>

The summoning circle burst into radiance. Mana was being drained out of her every pore. Aida steadied her breathing and felt her artificial circuits kick into full gear. A little mana deficiency would not be the cause of her suffering. She was made of much tougher stuff. 

<em>Through me, our fates are intertwined.</em> 

A sudden gale kicked up in her room, even though she had left no window open. The summoning circle was almost blinding, forcing her to close her eyes to mere slits. An image briefly flashed in her mind, that of her and Tsuruhime fending off Republic&#39;s fleets over a stormy sea. What an inspiring image it was!

&#39;We&#39;ve been acquainted for a lifetime.&#39; She fought to keep herself standing as the wind threatened to knock her off her feet. &#39;It&#39;s time for us to finally meet in person.&#39;

She felt a burning sensation across her back.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021292784247910471 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021292784247910471><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 03:32 PM">15:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#0462">@Mag of Greed</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The materials procured were fitting as well. By all means, Aida&#39;s summon was perfect: It was exactly the type of Servant summon that she had meticulously researched about in books, and fantasized about ten times as much. The connection to Tsuruhime was a strong one, be it through catalyst, Aida&#39;s own proficiency in summoning and her own blood lineage. She was fully committed to the act of summoning a strong warrior, one that had defended an island in the past. Just the savior Alexandria needed now.

One could have not asked for a better Master. Regardless, her mind faltered.

She had already started dreaming. A hopeful future, where she and Tsuruhime were victorious. Where she saw her aunt again, this time with a confident smirk on her face. Tsuruhime backing her up with words of encouragement, just like she had read in various tales about her...

It all started with thoughts. Then, those thoughts turned to words. Eventually, those words become their own world: A world of dreams and possibilities. A world too distant and inaccessible for Tsuruhime to reach. The tale of the Jeanne D&#39;Arc of Japan was far too...<em>real</em> for someone like Aida to latch on to. Her mind thought otherwise, but her soul blatantly spoke over her. They sook something far more primordial.

Loud grumbling could be heard. Tremors echoed across the room. Someone, or <em>something</em>, that did not want to disturbed, was now forcibly being dragged into the room. A rough, gamey stench filled the room, similar to stale manure coupled with dry phosphorous. It was enough to make Aida cry, tears welling up as she was forced to wipe her eyes clean while mysterious, yellow fog filled the room.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021396865993953383 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021396865993953383><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 10:26 PM">22:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
By the time she had recovered, the smell had all but vanished. Instead, she caught glimpses of red strings littered across her room. The shape and length reminded her of hairs, albeit far too straight and narrow to be her own. They didn&#39;t even seem to belong to a woman, and she wasn&#39;t the type to keep men around. No, this reminded her of Cathy&#39;s pet. That obnoxious little pup that wouldn&#39;t stop tearing at books while people weren&#39;t looking.

Of course, her mind did not rest on such trivial thoughts for too long. Instead, she focused back to the summoning circle, realizing that the catalyst was gone. It had been replaced by something else: A book, with a spine that reminded her of wood. The same type of wood that she had used as a catalyst earlier...

An ominous cover was printed on the front, giving off an old vibe. Based on experience and her own keen eyesight, the style and decoration reminded her of early Medieval period books.

An urge to read it promptly manifested itself in her heart. What librarian wouldn&#39;t jump at the chance to immerse themselves in a new book?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021396962588758107 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021396962588758107><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 10:26 PM">22:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=discord_assets/unknown-8EE3C.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=discord_assets/unknown-8EE3C.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: unknown.png (1.02 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021396992011813015 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021396992011813015><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="19-Sep-22 10:26 PM">22:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Aida&#39;s limbs felt as if they were filled with lead. Her mana reserve was dangerously low, but for summoning a legendary figure from ancient times, it was a worthy price to pay.

Except that her mind seemed to be filled with the most anxious thoughts. Was it from the mana deficiency? Aida shook her head, her nose wrinkling as a most abhorrent odor permeated the room. It was so strong that her eyes began to water. Unfortunately, this was not the sulfuric scent of the ocean that she was so used to. It was a rather earthy smell, but not one that would put her at ease. Quite on the contrary, it reminded her of...of...

Her mind regretfully wandered to the barns and stables at the Farming District.

But Tsuruhime wasn&#39;t known for being a farmer, was she?

As the stench dispersed into the open breeze, Aida was finally able to take a good look at her room. The Servant frame she had prepared was gone. So was her catalyst, but there was no one else in the room besides herself. She took a step towards the summoning circle, and her feet stepped onto a cloud.

She looked down. The floor was covered in tufts of red fur. A book she had never seen before made its presence known, laying innocently at the center of the summoning circle.

&#39;Hime...?&#39;

Hesitantly, Aida picked the book up, dusting hairs off the cover. She recognized the wooden boards that sandwiched the book&#39;s contents, both in texture and smell. It was camphor wood, the very same material she had used for her summoning ritual.

But why had she summoned a book?

She studied the cover, upon which a puzzling image was painted with fading ink. Was that a fox dressed in some kind of tunic?

Aida turned the mystery book over. She traced her fingers along the cover, unbuckling the leather straps that held the wooden boards together one by one. The book was of a medieval origin, there was little doubt about that: if the leather straps hadn&#39;t given it away, then its Carolingian bindings most certainly did. 

An authentic artifact from the medieval era had somehow found its way into her lap.

On any other day, such stroke of fortune was due for a celebration among the librarians at the Bookbinder&#39;s Guild. After all, who in their right minds <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be thrilled to have landed such a precious artifact in their inventory? But on this particular day, the advent of the book would spell nothing but disaster for our dear Master-to-be.

&#39;Wrong era.&#39; Aida furrowed her brows behind her gold-rimmed glasses. &#39;Wrong continent!&#39; She said decisively, then pried the book over with much less care than one would normally exercise over such an ancient relic.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021545289531793459 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021545289531793459><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 08:16 AM">08:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=discord_assets/summon-C38C0.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=discord_assets/summon-C38C0.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: summon.png (1.23 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021545303792431145 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021545303792431145><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 08:16 AM">08:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s one thing to feel tired after a day&#39;s work, but this was different. A complete loss of mana, something that hadn&#39;t happened to her since she was a child. A familiar, yet uneasy feeling. 

That, coupled with the realization that she had failed in her summoning, didn&#39;t exactly lend to the most ideal of mental states. Her frustration was apparent as she pried open the mysterious book with the delicateness of a spoiled child, which is to say, none at all!

Sensing her roughness, the book obliged, the pages almost moving on their own to skip any appendix or introduction, delving right into the meat of the contents. The writing was ancient, the characters being in a language that Aida could not discern, yet clearly an European one. The pages felt coarse to the touch, a trait shared by many books from the same era. The engravings were faded, yet beautiful all the same.

It would have normally taken her a few minutes of preparation to dissect the book. A removal of glasses, some cryptography spells to translate any lines of text that belonged to ancient languages. Yet she felt like she could read the book by heart, any unrecognizable word translating perfectly in her head. She learned a few things in just a minute of reading: The book was from the end of the Dark Ages, where writing and knowledge started flowing anew. The format was that of a fairy tale. The characters were animals.

It was all so familiar to her. She had read dozens, no, hundreds of these stories as a child. Possibly thousands as an adult. Of course, she rarely gushed about it in public, for others didn&#39;t seem to share her same passion for it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021551514969440329 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021551514969440329><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 08:41 AM">08:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Aida kept reading, her curiosity wondering as to why a book of fairy tales had just landed in her lap. As if to reciprocate, the next page offered a detailed explanation regarding the tales themselves. They were about a kingdom of animals, all of them being a stereotypical representation of a human being. The king was a lion, for he represented nobility. The messengers were hares, thanks to their speed and alacrity. The brutes were bears and wolves, for they were enemies of local farmers and produce.

Her finger stopped once she reached the description of the fox. The one who received the most attention on the book cover, along with having bright, red fur that reminded her of the state of her room right now. But what hit her the most was the name.

<em>Reynard.</em>

There was no apt description for Reynard, as familiar as that name sounded. It felt like the book could drone on and on about that particular figure. He was a trickster. He was vile. He was courageous. He was foul. He killed children and ate their fathers. He protected badgers from the king&#39;s slaughters. He was a schemer that would lie and deceive. He killed a wolf to be offered reprieve.

It was confusing, to see such polarizing descriptions of the same character. Aida was no stranger to varied viewpoints, but frankly, she didn&#39;t care at this moment. She was still frustrated at the lack of mana, at the fact that Tsuruhime was not coming and at the poisonous words that Cathy and her auntie had left impressed in her mind. This book&#39;s innate noisiness didn&#39;t contribute to either.

<em><strong>grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</strong></em>

Snarling emitted from the pages, as if to reciprocate Aida&#39;s anger. She was surprised, watching the pages keep flipping as more images filled her head. The tale of Reynard being called to court. The tale of Reynard tricking the brutish bear and the clever cat. The tale of Reynard devouring the hare and feeding him to his lovely wife. The tale of Reynard overcoming the big bad wolf.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021551559550701660 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021551559550701660><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 08:41 AM">08:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
She was being fed all of this information without her consent, the book gradually getting closer as shivers ran down her spine. The moment she attempted to avert her gaze, a paw suddenly emerged from the pages and lunged at her neck.

<em><strong>grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrAAAAAAAAAAAO</strong></em>

The bestial howl echoed in the room, loud enough for her to hear, but muted so that others would be unaware of what was transpiring in that closed workshop. The elongated paw wrapped itself around Aida&#39;s neck, dragging her closer and using her body as an anchor. Something on the other end wanted to emerge, even if it meant using force to get what they wanted.

Aida struggled, of course, but her body was still suffering from the excess use of mana. She blinked, and when she opened her eyes, a millisecond of time was enough for her to be thoroughly blasted by the book&#39;s contents. She overloaded on information, now knowing everything there was to know about Reynard. His story, his history, and his importance to writing as a whole.

It was enough knowledge to make her blackout. It could have been a minute, or it could have been seconds. Fact stands that her body fell limp, and by the time she got up, the book was gone.

Instead, a trail of fur and soot led to a lone corner in her room. Her eyes followed the trail, while her ears were assaulted by the noise of sloppy chewing and hurried gulps. One of her blankets was sprawled over the corner, covering what seemed to be a tiny figure.

...A large, bushy tail emerged from the end of the blanket. Red, with a little black and white on the tip.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021551616626790442 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021551616626790442><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="20-Sep-22 08:41 AM">08:41</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
As if sensing the snooping eyes, the blanket moved. The figure turned around and slowly removed that blue layer. Two perky, triangular ears emerged, followed by red hair and bright, pear colored eyes. Eventually, the entire blanket fell off, revealing a child in an odd outfit and a fluffy looking coat. They were currently eating an apple. Aida&#39;s apple, to be precise, that she had left in her room as a potential late night snack.

They remained silent, focused more on the apple than on Aida. This gave the librarian ample time to inspect the boy more: Those ears were fox-like, remaining straight yet expressive. She could see them curve anytime the boy took a bite. The tail was also similar, and the fact that it remained still could mean that the boy was on their guard. The cloak, however, left her at a loss. The cloud and lightning pattern had no connection to what she had seen earlier, besides representing how furious she felt just a few minutes ago.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They sounded mature. Too mature, in fact, as their voice reminded Aida of a grumpy adult. &quot;What is your name, and where am I? <em>In fact,</em> where is my Master? Are they too good to greet me properly? Hope they don&#39;t mind the apple then.&quot; He said before delivering another <em>crunch</em> on the supple fruit.

&quot;I&#39;ll ask again, who are you? You don&#39;t seem to be a Master. Your mana reserves look to be empty. Not to mention, you remind me more of an owl than a talented magus.&quot; He spoke in an articulate manner, yet his tone was bored and his content vile.

&quot;Hmmmmmmmm.&quot; The boy&#39;s ears perked up as he started scanning the room around him, before his eyes returned to Aida. &quot;This room is a mess, yet there are a lot of tomes. You have no mana, yet I sense some Magecraft around you. This is clearly a mage&#39;s workshop, yet I sense no Master, therefore,&quot; He leaned his head forward.

<strong>&quot;Are you his woman?&quot;</strong> He asked without a hint of embarrassment. &quot;If so, do you mind calling him over? I am a very, <em>very</em> busy person. As you can tell.&quot; He proceeded to bite down on his apple again after saying that.

...Just what had Aida brought unto this world?

Aida sat up in a daze. The sound of animalistic growls and screeches filled her ears as she struggled to reclaim her awareness. Fantastical images floated through her memory, mingling with them as her own vivid imagination made them take on a life of their own. 

Her eyes wandered aimlessly for a moment. As they gradually came into focus, so did a tuft of bright red fur twitching in an unassuming corner of the room. As if sensing the intensity of the attention projected by the other occupant, the bundle of blankets around the tail unraveled to reveal a small human child...with the addition of a pair of fox ears and a red, bushy tail that idly swept the floor. In his hands clutched a half-eaten apple, while he stared at Aida with mistrustful eyes. 

Then the fox child spoke, and all illusions of his childlike demeanor was broken. The words that came out of those cherub features sounded more like a cranky old man than a child. The Bookbinder&#39;s Guild received these types of clients in abundance, always picky about the quality of their service while trying to haggle for every penny.

She seemed to be half conscious, barely keeping herself together after the information overload that had occurred just moments ago. Of course he was aware of that, but he felt no pity: He was far too preoccupied with himself, thinking about the strange world that he had been transported to, along with the delectable flavor of the apple resting in his maw.

To tell the truth, he was in a similar spot, his brain feeling full of knowledge that he would normally not bat an eye to. So, this was the human world. A world that had barely survived destruction, yet continued to press forward out of sheer spite. Smaller details and events that need not be named swirled around his head, giving him quite the migraine. Eventually, after a minute or so, he managed to digest all of that information.

To a Servant, the data from the Holy Grail processor would usually be instant. In Reynard&#39;s case, however, his nature as a character from fairy tales might have affected the transferal rate. After all, it was hard for a character only described in words to fully enjoy the vastness of a 3D space. 

<em>&quot;So, this is reality? Quite shabby, if I say so myself.&quot;</em> He thought, before noticing that the glint in Aida&#39;s eyes changed. Instead of staring at him, she was now actively looking at him. Trying to discern the fox&#39;s nature.

&quot;Well, pardon me.&quot; Reynard responded to her annoyance with a shrug, as if determined to swat that steely resolve of hers. &quot;My head image of a Master is clearly different from what passes for a Master in <em>your</em> world.&quot; His voice was childish, hence why it irritated Aida even more, to be talked down by someone half her size.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021922960233218079 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021922960233218079><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 09:17 AM">09:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;But I apologize, Master. As a recently summoned Servant, I felt quite peckish. Is it not customary for Masters to prepare a meal for their new familiars, be it food or mana? Your reserves are practically already empty, so I wouldn&#39;t dare to eat my Master&#39;s share when they are already so frail.&quot; He replied, taking another bite while doing so. In just a moment, he had spun Aida&#39;s accusations back to her, much like people who complained about the library&#39;s customer support. He was her least favorite type of customer, it seemed.

Regardless, he could not escape the mention of his name, narrowing his eyes at the sound. Even Aida could notice, since the fox&#39;s ears twitched a bit the moment her lips stopped speaking.

&quot;Indeed. That would be me. <strong>Reynard, the fox.&quot;</strong> Reynard stood up, devouring the last bits of the apple. &quot;My Class is-&quot; He paused for a second, as if a realization dawned upon him.

&quot;Hmmm. <strong>Saber.</strong> Yes, that&#39;s the hand that I have been dealt.&quot; He could barely hide his annoyance. Something about that container filled him with unease. It was akin to wearing a tight coat and sweater in summer, or summer shorts in winter. It simply felt wrong and contradictory to him.

&quot;...Could you not have picked a more fitting Class? My dear,&quot; He stopped, realizing that only one of them had introduced themselves.

&quot;...however shall I call you, dear Master?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well! That suited her just fine. It wasn&#39;t as if she had hoped for anything short of an emotional bonding between her and her newly summoned Servant, who should neither sport fox-like features nor talk like an old man stuck in a little kid&#39;s body. In fact, Reynard had nailed the problem himself: why on earth had he been the one to answer her call?

&#39;You&#39;ve placed me in quite a predicament, little fox.&#39; Aida said with a frown. &#39;Your name is Reynard. You are known as a trickster. From the moment you&#39;ve been summoned, you have been trying to swindle me with your words! Unfortunately,&#39; she raise a finger and wagged it in front of her lupine companion, &#39;I have read all about you. I will never fall for your words, not until you decided to come clean and tell me the truth.&#39;

She strode across the room, her shoes clacking loudly on the timber floor. With an authoritative tug, she stripped Reynard of the blankets he had so cozily wrapped around himself, forcing him to come to terms with the reality he had been so carefully trying to shield himself from.

&#39;How did you manage to swap places with the Saber I wanted to summon?&#39; She mimicked the tone Catherine would use when dealing with pesky clients who wanted to get out of paying for their repair fees. &#39;If you tricked the honorable Tsuruhime into swapping places with you like how you did with the wolf in the well, then I must politely ask you to go back and bring her back to me.&#39;

She had just issued her first order as a Master of the holy grail war!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021937969831100527 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021937969831100527><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 10:16 AM">10:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever you prefer, Master.&quot; Reynard replied with a slight smile, finding some humor in his Master&#39;s bluntness. Aida didn&#39;t even need to speak to convey her intent, since it was apparent that the fox&#39;s behavior had already got on her nerves. Good. She wasn&#39;t the first, and she wouldn&#39;t be the last either. It was always entertaining to see how easily a person crumbled by expectations unmet.

Aida continued, giving the fox an authoritative frown, the kind that clearly tried its hardest to establish itself as the dominant party. That attitude was common, but those words certainly were not. It was uncommon for Reynard to see people be fully aware of his true nature. None of those boorish animals over the lion&#39;s court could know of the full extent of his tricks and schemes, but Aida seemed to have that knowledge down pat. Such was the fate of being a children&#39;s story book character.

She certainly made sure to flaunt that knowledge as well, inching closer in loud <em>clacks</em> as she wagged her finger right in front of his face. His instincts kicked in, giving him a loud temptation to bit and chew on her nimble bone, but he relented.

<em>&quot;Let the fool keep playing the part.&quot;</em> He thought to himself, grinning inside. <em>&quot;Empty vessels make lots of noise. I have no idea what sort of dull, boorish Master I got contracted to, but I might as well milk her for all her worth. Like a ragged dust cloth.&quot;</em> 

He was practically snickering inside, thinking about the inevitable trickery and betrayal he would pull on his ignorant Master. So distracted he was that he didn&#39;t notice Aida gradually get closer and yoink his blanket away from him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021947892489015346 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021947892489015346><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 10:56 AM">10:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Hey-&quot; He protested, raising his arm in an attempt to catch the tail end of the blanket and tug at it. Unfortunately, his short stature was his weakness, Aida triumphantly raising the blanket above him so that he couldn&#39;t reach. Instead, all she got was a petulant glare from below, that looked both fierce and pitiful at the same time. A child they were not, but part of them certainly behaved like one.

But Aida didn&#39;t care, for she immediately went back to discussing Tsuruhime. It was still infuriating, to be separated from your childhood idol and be given this rejected mascot in exchange. If it was within Reynard&#39;s power to fix things, then he shall. That was her supreme order!

...

The fox tilted his head. He looked dumbfounded.

&quot;...And how exactly do you think I can do that?&quot; He asked, both aiming to question and ridicule her. &quot;First of all, I do not trick honorable women. Who do you take me for? Second of all, I had no intention of being summoned. Ever. Let alone here.&quot; He crossed his arms in disapproval, tail swinging side by side.

&quot;Perhaps if my Master had conducted her summoning properly, then Tsuruhime would be here, and I would be resting back in the Throne of Heroes, completely ignorant of what was going on outside of it. And everybody would live happily ever after.&quot; He said that with a smile, before reverting to a frown and giving Aida a judgmental glare.

<strong>&quot;Unfortunately, my Master was found lacking.&quot;</strong> He grumbled. This went beyond a dislike for Aida. No, it sounded more like Reynard disliked the fact that he had been put into this situation in the first place. Somehow, Aida could relate to this: It reminded her of how she felt when she didn&#39;t want to go to work and would rather cozy up in her bed. She had summoned a total slacker of a Servant.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1021947945282703391 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1021947945282703391><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 10:56 AM">10:56</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;But eh, it cannot be helped.&quot; Reynard shrugged, walking past Aida as he continued scanning the room around him instead. &quot;The least you could do for this inconvenience is keep me comfortable. May I have another of your wonderful apples? They taste far better than any written description of them could.&quot; He asked, slowly dragging a stool over to where Aida stood. He then got on top of it, carefully, with the gracefulness of a fox. He took the blanket back from Aida&#39;s palms.

&quot;I certainly miss my fur. How can you tolerate having such...hairless skin?&quot; He pinched himself, almost disgusted by his current appearance. &quot;Could you not have summoned me in a better form? Hmph. Never mind. I shouldn&#39;t be too harsh, for your apples are delicious.&quot; He nodded. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rather than sympathizing with her, Reynard didn’t feel a shred of remorse at having hijacked the summoning. Even now, his mind was preoccupied with creature comforts like…like…apples and fur!

Aida ignored his demands. She began to recount her steps, as if doing so would somehow lead to an epiphany that could shed light on her predicament. Her artifact was the genuine article. The summoning array she had practiced so many times until she could draw it with her eyes closed. She even performed the ritual at noon, when her mana would reach its peak! 

Then why…

‘…why didn’t it work?’

Aida went over the summoning array. She kneeled at the edge and glared at it with such fervor, like she was trying to visually dissect it. 

‘It can’t be the ink, can it?’ She muttered, trying to recall from the various literature she’d read whether drawing the array with a different medium mattered in the selection of the Heroic Spirit. 

‘…the room, then?’ She cast a hesitant glance around her room, vaguely recalling the spat she had had with Catherine regarding the usage of the workshop below. Ooh, she was going to be <em>so</em> mad with Cathy if that was the reason!

But deep in her heart, she knew that the location of the summoning hardly mattered - not when she was already using a proper catalyst, at any rate.

Was it the weather, then? Her choice of dress? The tone of her speech, anything-

Was the problem really, as Reynard had said, <em>her</em>?

‘I’m not incompetent!’ Aida felt a lump form at the back of her throat as the thought of her efforts going up in smoke haunted her mind. ‘I did everything right! Followed all the steps! How could I have summoned…summoned…’

Hot tears welled up in her eyes. She wiped at them angrily, but that just made her feel sorry for what she had done, which in turn made her even more angry with herself. The tears were pouring freely now, droplets rolling down her face and leaving patches of dark stains on her clothes.

‘I don’t want a little fox as a Servant!’ She burst into sobs, her disappointment and frustration sweeping through her like a tempest and shaking Reynard like a sapling in a storm. Broken words and phrases got out of her between hiccups - ‘chew toy’ - ‘tourney’ - strewn like the red fur scattered across the floor.

He was used to people finding him irritating, but to feel dejected after just a few, toasty words? It was almost endearing to see how naive and frail this Aida woman was. Certainly far easier to manage than Bruin the bear.

So happy he was in his assumptions that he neglected to notice the shift in Aida&#39;s mood. From the proposal of various theories regarding as to why she had failed in her summon, to the slow realization that the only volatile ingredient here was-

Her.

&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. Really, you shouldn&#39;t blame yourself for your lack of-&quot; Reynard sighed, attempting to silence her loud theories, before being bombarded by a loud scream.

<em>&quot;I&#39;m not incompetent!&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;...Are you sure about that?&quot;</em> Was Reynard&#39;s instinctive thought to reply, but he was wise enough to know when not to poke the sleeping bear. He was shook, watching as Aida cried her lungs out and stammered out few, incoherent sentences. She was a mixture of rage and embarassment, venting all of her frustrations onto him as she shook him like a tree and even called him <em>little</em> of all things!

&quot;Hey, hey! C-Calm down now!&quot; Reynard shouted, but it was muffled by Aida&#39;s tantrum. For once, the fox was now at a loss. He was so used to others wanting to hurt him, mock him or even kill him. Those people made him laugh, for it was ridiculously easy to run circles around them and dodge their attempts to sully his name.

...But he had never dealt with a crybaby before. Let alone one so eager to hold him tight and shake him like he owed her money. How was one supposed to defuse such an hysterical woman?! What would Reynard, the fox, have done in this situation?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022074308794785835 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022074308794785835><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 07:18 PM">19:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He peered deep into his mind, looking for any sort of solution that he could draw from his legend. Good food? Warm clothes? Certainly things that would calm <em>him</em> down. What did women like anyway? He hadn&#39;t really given it much thought, besides his wife wishing he kept the bed warm more often-

<em>&quot;I swear, you are terrible at this, Reynard.&quot;</em>

A voice emerged from his mind, chastizing him quite a bit.

<em>&quot;And to whom do I owe the displeasure...?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;You may know me as Gon, the fox. Also known as yourself, albeit a different face.&quot;</em> A far more childish voice emerged from his mind. <em>&quot;Can&#39;t you see that she is in pain? Apologise, and all her worries will melt away.&quot;</em>

Reynard laughed. <em>&quot;A fox apologising? Why don&#39;t I wag my tail and ask her to pat my head while I&#39;m at it? You embarass me if we are related, dear Gon.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;...There was a human I knew once. There is never a moment where I don&#39;t wish that I had apologised to them before I died. Do not make my same mistake.&quot;</em> His voice was benign and pure. Reynard knew of his legend, for it was part of his Saint Graph too. He sighed, unable to prove Gon wrong based on his fellow fox&#39;s experiences.

<em>&quot;Hmph. And how do you suggest I apologise to this petulant child, smartass?&quot;</em> Reynard replied, already growing tired of Aida&#39;s repeated ramblings about how much of a pest he was (She wasn&#39;t wrong).

<em>&quot;I can sense that she respects Lady Tsuruhime quite a bit. This room echoes with love for her. Perhaps seeing her would alleviate her worries, at least enough to stop her crying.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;...And I&#39;m supposed to find a warrior like that, how?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Like I said, this room has more than enough &#39;love&#39; for her. You know what I mean?&quot;</em> Gon giggled, the implication being clear in his mind. Reynard frowned, realizing what he meant.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022074384883658752 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022074384883658752><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 07:18 PM">19:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Bah. Reduced to a circus act.&quot; He groaned, returning to his grumpy demeanor as Gon retreated to the deepest recesses of his mind, growing silent once again. Showing love for that warrior princess? Sure, he could do that.

He sighed, closing his eyes and trying to tune out Aida&#39;s incessant rambling. Her room was filled with books, but one of them stuck out compared to the rest.

<em>Sea, Woman &amp; Armor - Jeanne d&#39;Arc of Setouchi.</em>

&quot;Found you.&quot; He exclaimed, a flash of light occurring as Aida would be temporarily blinded, stopping her rambling. When she reopened them, she was ready to ramble some more, until she saw a figure in the distance...

A proud warrior, donning two katanas and a smug, confident grin on her face. Yet one that expressed a desire to protect, considering how much attention they paid to the crying Aida.

<em>&quot;Hyaah!&quot;</em> The woman shouted, releasing her <em>kiai</em> through one, swift sword slash. It was aimed towards Aida, but in a manner so delicate and precise that she cut through the stream of tears that was raining down Aida&#39;s cheeks. The message was clear: Stop crying!

<em>&quot;This sadness doesn&#39;t befit you, Aida. Have you not learned from my story that women should never cry?&quot;</em> She pumped her chest out, sounding like a tomboy as she walked towards Aida and wrapped her arm around her neck, butting heads with her. This attitude, this demeanor...<strong>It was like the Tsuruhime in her dreams.</strong>

Reynard stood just a few feet apart, having abandoned his stool to observe the scene from a safe distance. A giant crayon was now in his arms, albeit he stared at it with the same wonder that Aida would once she realized that Reynard was still around. Both of them were puzzled by that object, albeit Reynard less so.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022074440466575411 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022074440466575411><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 07:18 PM">19:18</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;Ya feeling better now? Good! There&#39;s no point in crying, Aida. If I did that, then you may not have known me as the Joan D&#39;Arc of Japan.&quot;</em> Tsuruhime giggled. <em>&quot;Here&#39;s my advice to you: If anything ever bothers you, or ticks you right off-&quot;</em>

&quot;Phew.&quot; Reynard sighed with relief. It seemed like Gon had the right idea. Tsuruhime&#39;s presence had calm down his Master&#39;s petulant display.

<strong>&quot;You should beat the crap out of it.&quot;</strong> Tsuruhime declared, much to Reynard&#39;s horror as his ears shivered in fear. <em>&quot;C&#39;mon, you remember that one general who thought I&#39;d be more at ease at a brothel? Ooooh, that drove me so mad, it feels like yesterday! You know what happened after?&quot;</em> She grinned. It felt pointless for her to finish her sentence.

Reynard trembled, now cursing himself for going along with Gon&#39;s plan. No wonder Aida admired that person so much: They were both brutes!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022074494392746004 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022074494392746004><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Sep-22 07:19 PM">19:19</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As quick as lightning, a katana cut through the doom and gloom, blasting away Aida&#39;s tears and stopping just a hair&#39;s breadth away from her delicate skin. Was it an act of aggression? A declaration of war? To think that she would be threatened at sword point-

But, that was not the case. Aida stood rooted to the spot, her eyes fixated on the new guest that had just made their presence known. She forgot to wipe her tears, but that didn&#39;t matter, for she was no longer crying.

Because Tsuruhime had commanded her so. 

Elegant yet fierce, the warrior was everything she had imagined. In fact, she looked every bit like the illustrations Aida loved so much from her treasured copy of <em>Sea, Woman &amp; Armor</em>. If this was a dream, then she didn&#39;t want to wake up!

&#39;Ow!&#39; She gasped as Tsuruhime butted heads with her, causing a red patch to form on her forehead. But the pain was the most comforting thing to have happened to her: it proved that everything she was experiencing right now was real. After all, you can&#39;t feel pain in a dream!

She returned a snotty smile in spite of the stars swirling around her head. &#39;I&#39;m not crying,&#39; she said in between hiccups, &#39;I won&#39;t!&#39; As if eager to prove herself a worthy ally of the Crane Princess, she subconsciously mimicked her stance, tucking her chin in and relaxing her shoulders, before following the woman&#39;s knife-sharp gaze and twisted to see a crayon-hugging Reynard with his tail between his legs.

The fox child looked thoroughly disturbed at the scene in front of him. 

Aida also looked thoroughly nonplussed. She flitted her gaze between Reynard and Tsuruhime, as one question after another popped up in her mind. How did Tsuruhime summon herself without a Servant frame, a new ritual, and a new catalyst? What was Reynard doing there with that gigantic crayon? Had there been any precedents where a single Servant frame was able to house two saint graphs?

Unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately, in this particular case - Tsuruhime&#39;s overwhelming presence swept her away. She found it hard to think of anything besides ogling at her childhood idol and eagerly agreeing with every nugget of wisdom the woman was spouting.

&#39;You are absolutely right.&#39; Her eyes were almost sparkling as she held the warrior princess in the highest regard. &#39;This is no time for tears.&#39; Her unruly hair bounced against her flushed face as she pumped her fists. &#39;We are at war!&#39;

She was ticked!

<strong>&#39;Hi-yah!&#39;</strong>

With a ferocious roar(?), she closed her eyes and threw the most amateurish punch right in Reynard&#39;s face!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022283904561975357 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022283904561975357><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Sep-22 09:11 AM">09:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

When he saw Tsuruhime and Aida start plotting their revenge on whatever was causing those frustrated feelings in Aida&#39;s heart, was the moment that he realized that it was pointless to reason with these two individuals. They might as well have peanuts for brains.

<em>&quot;Get him, Aida! Show them that you mean business.&quot;</em> Tsuruhime supported her new ally from the back, cheering her on as Aida stepped forward with snot on her face and stammering lips. She ranted about war and fighting as she attempted to sock Reynard in the face.

Reynard&#39;s instincts kicked in, warning him to run away. To dodge that blow. However...

<em>&quot;...Wait a second.&quot;</em> His tail raised. His ears perked up in confusion. The world around him felt like it was in slow motion. <em>&quot;Why am I scared of my own Master hitting me? She barely has any mana left to cast spells with, not to mention, I&#39;m a Saber. I&#39;m more than capable of taking a few hits. Look, she&#39;s even stumbling around! Were I to give her a light shove, she would collapse on herself!&quot;</em>

Those worries from before started to morph into cockiness and pity. The fox was now snickering, both at Aida and at himself. How could he be so blind to his own strength? Perhaps running away from foes inside his books had conditioned him to underestimate his own physical prowess. Well, no more! Reynard was a <em>proud</em> and <em>strong</em> warrior. Capable of going toe-to-toe with the vicious wolf, Iselgrim. A bookworm with twigs for arms was nothing in comparison.

&quot;Oh dear. Please hear me, my Master.&quot; Reynard spoke, paying no mind to Aida&#39;s incoming advance. &quot;Calm yourself and avoid listening to Tsuruhime&#39;s suggestions. She is nothing but an apparition designed to cater to your mind. Besides, what do you hope to achieve? You cannot possibly harm me, you know? Not with your shoddy physique and unsteady footing...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022292417396875415 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022292417396875415><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Sep-22 09:45 AM">09:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He warned her, but Aida didn&#39;t listen, continuing to march forward in some sort of stupor.

&quot;Please. I&#39;d rather not defend myself against my own Master. I will have no choice if you keep moving forward.&quot; The fox smiled, trying to appear benign, but it was obvious that he was getting some enjoyment out of Aida&#39;s foolishness. Hell, he wouldn&#39;t mind flicking her away into a corner, so that he could finally relax for on-

<em>He slipped.</em>

The chance was one in a million. Yet it still happened. He paid attention to Aida so much that he completely ignored the fresh traces of drool and apple bits resting on the floor. Courtesy of himself.

Normally, he wouldn&#39;t slip on such a surface. It was an incredibly unlikely event, something that he kept repeating himself as he witnessed it happen. He regained his composure just fast enough to stop himself from falling, but by the time he looked back up, Aida&#39;s fist was within touching distance.

He laughed. &quot;You&#39;re only going to hurt yo-&quot;

<em><strong>SMACK!</strong></em>

Her knuckles collided with his nose. They pierced into his forehead. He bit his tongue due to her punching him mid conversation. All of this, in the span of a millisecond.

Then, a moment later, he started flying, propelled towards the very end of the room as he crashed on one of Aida&#39;s bookshelves.

<em>&quot;..........Huh?&quot;</em> He thought to himself, dumbfounded as he felt a warm liquid seep from his nose and mouth. His coat got stuck on one of the shelves, causing him to remain hanged like a coat on a rack. Several books from the above shelf proceeded to fall on his head, bonking him repeatedly as punishment. Various <em>&#39;Owowowowow!&#39;</em> could be heard.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1022292482723168348 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1022292482723168348><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Sep-22 09:45 AM">09:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The good news would be that Aida managed to quell her rage. Traces of the fox&#39;s blood remained on her fist, causing her to snap back to reality. She could barely process what she had just done, knocking out a Servant in a single hit. She had never thought she could physically harm someone with her own body, let alone a figure of legend. Could it be that Reynard was weak...or was this simply the result of Tsuruhime&#39;s support?

<em>&quot;Are you satisfied now, Aida?&quot;</em> Tsuruhime laughed from behind, flashing a thumbs up at the librarian and nodding in approval. <em>&quot;You&#39;ve seized your own path. The path that every woman seeks. One that unleashes the fury of your wild soul!&quot;</em> She rambled and clapped her hands.

<em>&quot;And with that, I have nothing more to teach you. Remember this moment well.&quot;</em> Tsuruhime sheathed her blade, turning around as she walked away, disappearing in a remote sunset. <em>&quot;...And remember, my book goes on sale on Sunday and they will be restocking the shelves too! Be sure to buy an extra copy to take full advantage of our multi-buy opti-&quot;</em>

Before she could finish, she vanished. Aida was confused. Those last words didn&#39;t sound like something her idol would say. If anything, it sounded like the advertisements she saw at her local libraries when browsing around. Quite odd.

...But wait, had Tsuruhime just unsummoned herself?! How was she supposed to participate in the Holy Grail War now?!? Just when her headache had passed, another one so easily returned. All because of that damn fox-

Wait, what was it about their crayon again? If Aida were to scan the room, she would notice that the oversized crayon was resting right next to the hanging Reynard. Seems like he had dragged it alongside him. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even an amateur could come to appreciate it, as Aida had only just begun to discover. She felt the crunching of bones, the snapping of cartilage and sinew, the pleasure reverberating from the knuckles of her fists to her arms, shoulders, then heart. The feedback was like nothing she had experienced before. 

It felt good. Amazing, even. The physical act of throwing something felt ten times as rewarding as crying! The visceral pleasure of having <em>crushed</em> something with her own hands only amplified further with Tsuruhime&#39;s words of encouragement. 

Aida opened her eyes. &#39;I think I-&#39;

-<em>hit him?</em>

No. She had done more than just <em>hit</em> Reynard. The librarian blinked slowly as she took in the scene of carnage unfolding before her very eyes. Reynard had been repelled, which was already putting it lightly. Rather than being knocked off his feet, the fox child had been punted all the way across the room. He was now hanging on her bookshelf by the end of his cloak, with blood pouring out of his nose while his head was continuously assaulted by books that had been knocked off the shelves.

Aida looked at her fist in utter disbelief. Since when had she gotten that strong? Had she always had this power, which had been lying dormant all this time and waiting to be harnessed in the right moment? Had Tsuruhime awakened something <s>terrible</s> extraordinary in her?

She looked to her childhood idol for an answer...

Tsuruhime took off towards the sunset with her katanas in tow. She struck a posture that could be described as nothing besides &#39;cool&#39;, like what one would witness from a famous boyband singer on a TV commercial. More words of wisdom spewed out of her mouth in an enticing manner that made it extremely difficult to resist, like what one would hear from a famous boyband singer on a TV commercial. Sparkles, glitters, and bling effects followed her receding footsteps, like what one would expect from a high-budget TV commercial...

&#39;Eh?&#39;

Aida stared blankly at the spot where Tsuruhime made her surprisingly...compelling...departure. It was all too much to take in. Just what was going on? Had Tsuruhime been a figment of her imagination after all? But she felt so real. The <em>punch</em> felt real. Her hand still bore smears of Reynard&#39;s blood, warm and slick to the touch. And there was still that comically large crayon lying on the floor.

She must be going crazy. 

Funnily enough, that thought calmed her down more than anything else. Perhaps it was just what she needed right now. A little craziness felt rather tame compared to what she had just experienced earlier.

Aida made her way to the bookshelf. She tried to pick up the crayon at first, but its unwieldy size and weight proved to be quite the challenge. She only succeeded in getting wax under her nails after a few decent attempts, unable to display any of the amazing strength she had use when punting Reynard across the room. 

So she decided to investigate Reynard himself next. Perhaps it had been a fluke. Or perhaps it was Reynard who was the fluke. After all, he would need to be light as a feather in order for her to manhandle him so. She closed her hands on the scruff of Reynard&#39;s neck and began to free him from his plight.

Blood trickled down from his nose, albeit he was slowly starting to feel his face again. <em>&quot;Despite my appearance, I should still be a Saber. Are we not supposed to be the strongest Class? No, even then, even if I were an Assassin-&quot;</em>

He swung his tail side by side in frustration. He couldn&#39;t understand, how Aida was able to harm him so easily. Then again, this punch was the fly that made him question the ointment: Everything revolving Aida had been strange. The closer she got, the heavier the air felt. He noticed it when she first grabbed the blanket from him: No matter how swift she was, there was no outcome where she could outspeed him or catch him off guard. Yet she did.

He let it go at first, but things kept adding up, like when she shook him around. He was too focused on her petulant crying at that time, but he should have noticed it even back then: She was shaking him with almost no effort. The final nail in the coffin was the punch, or to be more precise, what happened before then: His body shivered at the prospect of being punched by Aida, to the point that he had to convince himself that it wouldn&#39;t hurt.

...Why did he need convincing in the first place?

Reynard was confused. Utterly so. He had been summoned in the strongest Class, yet a corner in his mind was screaming at him to stay on Aida&#39;s good side. What was it, hypnotism? A Command Seal? No, he would have noticed if that were the case.

Before he could come to a conclusion, Aida approached him, dragging him by the scruff of his neck as he yelped in pain.

&quot;Ow! Do you have no concept of delicateness, you bumbling oaf?!&quot; The fox spat out, sneering at his Master. He would look intimidating, if Aida weren&#39;t holding him up like a cat that pooped outside of their litterbox.

Fulfilling my wish?&#39; Aida was taken aback. &#39;But you are <em>Reynard</em>.&#39;

She had just summed up - as far as she was concerned - all there was to Reynard with his name alone. A single word was all that she needed to encapsulate her feelings about the matter. A conniving character that Reynard was, his endeavors had become so famous, his depiction so iconic that his very name had become synonymous with the word &#39;fox&#39; in the French language. That was simply the kind of character he was. What else needed to be said?

Of course, it was true that the Reynard in the storybooks never carried a crayon. It remained a nagging suspicion in her mind, that maybe the book she had been forced to consume wasn&#39;t all there was to the titular character. But, ah, therein lies the issue about fairytales, doesn&#39;t it? You can&#39;t change what has already been written. You could create a sequel. You could create a spin-off. But there was no changing the canonical renditions. What had once been written would forever remain a part of those characters, irrespective of their will.

Thanks to that book, Aida&#39;s head was now filled with the adventures of Reynard as retold through time. She <em>knew</em> who he was. She vowed to herself that she would not be fooled.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023412905363914772 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023412905363914772><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 11:57 AM">11:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was no one that <em>didn&#39;t</em> know about him in his tales, to the point that his reputation preceding him messed with his own plans. This might be one of those times.

If she knew, then it didn&#39;t matter what he said. Convincing her would take too much time and being at his Master&#39;s mercy didn&#39;t appeal to him. Instead, he might as well play the part while gathering as much information about his current environment. For now, he was still focused on why Aida was so strong.

&quot;Indeed. At least you are cultured enough to know of me.&quot; He said with a harrumph. &quot;Then, you should know how rare it is for a fox to aid others. Yet here you are, abusing someone as innocent as me. Have you no shame?&quot; He twisted and turned his words while scanning her body, thinking about where would be a good spot for the next step.

&quot;Why, I ought to-&quot; Reynard raised his hand menacingly, clenching it into a fist before slamming it down!

<em>&quot;Time to test my theory.&quot;</em> He remained calculating, feigning an outburst in order to gauge the extent of Aida&#39;s &quot;strength&quot;.

<em>pomf</em>

Aida felt something tap her stomach. Lightly. Like a book that fell on her while she was asleep. An all too common occurrence.

From Reynard&#39;s perspective, however, he had just delivered a punch with all of his might put into it. Right at Aida&#39;s stomach. It had no effect. Even worse, it didn&#39;t even register as a normal fist. If an average human were to slap Aida, for example, she would definitely feel it. But from Reynard?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023412998221598771 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023412998221598771><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 11:57 AM">11:57</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He doubted it. It was as if his attacks could not be perceived by Aida&#39;s body. They were being reduced to a state below that of an average human. He was like a puppy.

&quot;What the-&quot; The fox looked befuddled. His eyes widened in confusion. Throughout all of his tales, he had never encountered such a puzzling scenario. To think that he had zero power over this woman drove holes in his mind.

&quot;Hyaaah!&quot; He shouted, delivering another punch to Aida&#39;s stomach. Same result. Another one. Zero damage.

He kept it going, punching with both of his hands at once. Eventually, the punching devolved into slapping, as if the fox realized that it didn&#39;t matter how he shaped his hand. All Aida could feel was repeated taps to the stomach, causing her to feel rather ticklish, much to her annoyance.

He&#39;d been dragged out of the Throne with zero consent, then be imposed upon by the densest Master in existence, who not only read him like a book (literally), but was also impervious to his temper tantrums. Forget being a Servant, he felt like a meek rabbit at the butcher&#39;s shop, ready to be devoured at a moment&#39;s notice.

But even a rabbit will bite when it has been cornered by a hunter. Not to mention, Reynard was a bona fide <em>fox</em>. He was the devourer of rabbits and the tipper of scales in the game of deceit. There was no obstacle he couldn&#39;t conquer with his sharp wits...and claws!

<em>&#39;Hyaaah!&#39;</em>

Aida dropped Reynard in shock. While she had been too slow to register the fox child&#39;s lightning speed beatdown, she would have more than enough time to savor its impact. 

Which was to say, none at all.

Reynard had put everything into his punches, but all he had managed to deliver was a flurry of light prods to his Master&#39;s stomach. Granted, it did make his captor <em>release</em> him, but realization soon dawned on the librarian&#39;s face at what her Servant had done.

Reynard would dare attack his own Master? What a scumbag!

<strong>&#39;You&#39;re not going anywhere! Oh no you won&#39;t!&#39;</strong>

She stared determinedly at where the fox child was scampering off to and brought her foot down, hard-heeled shoe and all, onto Reynard&#39;s fluffy cloak.

&quot;You will never catch me. I&#39;m a free spir-&quot; He thought, flaunting his freedom. He was one of the fastest animals in the forest after all. There was zero chance of a human Master rivalling his speed.

And yet, Aida did exactly that, crashing her heel on his cloak and stopping him in place. He felt it tug at his neck, forcing him to pause.

&quot;Grrrr!&quot; He snarled in frustration. His anger was real, but even in that state, his mind was deep in thought.

<em>&quot;Once again, she catches up to me with barely any effort. Is she hiding her strength, or is she clumsy at using it? I need more proof...&quot;</em> Being immobile, there was little he could do to further test Aida&#39;s capabilities. At most, he could try attacking another area to elicit a reaction.

&quot;If the stomach won&#39;t work, then-&quot; The situation was already hopeless, but foxes rarely gave up. He tried targeting another area of Aida&#39;s body, just in case it was her tummy that was specifically protected.

He proceeded to slap at her chest, a resounding <em>POMF</em> being heard anytime his hand collided with part of her bosom. And with how often he was doing it, it started to sound like an harmonious melody.

Aida felt no pain of course. But to be hit around that area, of all things, was enough to elicit a reaction. Reynard didn&#39;t know what he had gotten himself into. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;...&#39;

A shadow loomed over the fine features of Aida&#39;s face. The entire room darkened as though a nimbostratus cloud had passed over the roof. A feeling of doom lingered in the atmosphere, which had become so dense that Reynard could almost feel moisture condensing on the tip of his nose. In fact, his furry tail <em>did</em> feel a little slicker than usual-

<em>drip</em>

Dark stains blossomed on Reynard&#39;s coat. A thick, black tendril, dripping with ink, whipped out of nowhere and started wrapping itself around the fox child. A second tendril emerged from the inky depths as well, this one reeling itself back in a gesture that could only be interpreted in a single, violent way. So he <em>wasn&#39;t</em> just imagining it. It seemed as if the entire room had been engulfed in darkness as the tendrils dragged themselves about.

&#39;Don&#39;t toy with the feelings of a maiden, or I will send you back from whence you came.&#39;

Aida spoke lightly. However, the image of himself, reduced to nothing but colored ink blots on a sheet of paper briefly crossed Reynard&#39;s mind. So this was the power...of a maiden whose feelings had been trampled by his thoughtless actions.

There was no doubt about it. He was about to be whipped!

And he watched, in slow motion, as the tendril lashed out towards his face.

If he wanted to apologize, it was either now or never.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413135287271515 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413135287271515><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 11:58 AM">11:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Take this, and this!&quot; Reynard shouted with each slap. He knew that it was most likely futile, but he couldn&#39;t refrain from screaming his lungs out with each attack. It felt therapeutic, plus foxes had plenty of vices. However, he did find it odd that Aida went completely silent, but paid her about as much attention as he did before. Complete nonchalance.

He was unaware of the true terror that lurked within.

It started with a wet smell in the air, followed by his tail feeling particularly humid. Then, he felt something crawl around him, sticky and liquid. He froze in shock, watching a black tendril protrude from his cloak and stare at him straight in the eyes.

&quot;Gyaaah!&quot; He screamed in a mixture of terror and disgust. His cloak was ruined and he could feel the ink wrap itself around him with its damp texture. Once again, something had snuck up on him.

Which could only mean that it belonged to Aida. His theory would be proven correct as he looked ahead, seeing his Master&#39;s face morph into a demonic scowl, yet remain light spoken all the same.

For some reason, attacking Aida in that particular spot had elicited a very violent reaction. While this was very good for research purposes, it seemed to have the high risk of reducing his life expectancy by around 90%.

The threat that followed suit confirmed it, as Reynard imagined a life back into the pages of a book. He gulped down at the thought.

&quot;...Let&#39;s calm down now, shall we? Did I hurt you earlier? If so, I apologize. You just seemed so strong and-&quot; He was half telling the truth, but more than half was just trying to save his own skin. He received Aida&#39;s piercing glare in exchange, followed by his Master sending another tendril, this time aimed straight for his face!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413237426962562 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413237426962562><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 11:58 AM">11:58</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

After all, this was always how it played out in the stories: the cunning fox, with all of his honeyed words and shameless flattery, would never truly make peace with their adversaries. What they aimed to do was to lower the other&#39;s guard, so they can sneak away and retaliate when opportunities strike again. Truly, a dangerous individual.

Aida, of course, was no fool. Armed with more knowledge than she could ever need, she was ready to put an end to Reynard&#39;s short-lived saga in the human realm. How shameless he was! How rude! And he didn&#39;t even say &#39;excuse me&#39;! Who was he to tell <em>her</em> to calm down?

Fueled perhaps by more irrational anger at Reynard&#39;s actions than the calm vigilance she should be displaying against his character, Aida&#39;s face contorted even more as Reynard started spewing apologies like he was giving out free candy. His words bounced off her like light on a mirror. Except that there was no light and no mirror. Just the infinite darkness that seemed to stretch on and on around him, until the greenhorn Master reached her snapping point.

<strong>&#39;Enough!&#39;</strong> 

<em><strong>S☆M☆A☆C☆K!</strong></em>

An arm-sized hole appeared next to Reynard&#39;s head, the slapping tendril having dug itself well under the floorboard and causing splinters to fly in every direction. Aida huffed, crossing her arms over her chest, not quite convinced, and not quite appeased. Anger still bubbled just beneath the surface. She stamped her foot, and the slapping tendril made one scary, lurching motion, as if it was going to readjust its aim-

<em>splash</em>

The tendrils dissolved into formless liquid, pooling under Reynard and Aida as the latter slid into a kneeling position. With a soft <em>hmph!</em>, she reached down and held Reynard&#39;s face between her hands. Then she pinched down, <em>hard</em>, at his cherub cheeks.

She was completely exhausted. The little bit of mana she had managed to scrounge together was all but gone. She was at the bottom of the well, without an ounce of mana to even clean up her own mess. 

So she just sat there and continued to pinch Reynard&#39;s cheeks until it was red and swollen like an apple. He&#39;d wanted apples, right? Well, there he go...

&#39;What do you mean, a test?&#39; Though her mana had dried up, Aida still had plenty of strength to spare. Plenty for Reynard, at any rate, as she had come to learn.

&#39;You better not try to wriggle your way out of this one,&#39; she said sternly. &#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with you, but if you don&#39;t tell me the truth, I&#39;ll...&#39;

She looked down at her blood and ink-smeared hands. How bold she&#39;d become in such a short amount of time! Was this what it felt like to be a hero?

Somehow, that didn&#39;t feel quite right.

&#39;...well, my mind is made up! You better start talking now.

The times he did it, it was usually too late, since people would have wisened up to his tricks by then. He remembered the times he implored the king&#39;s pity in court, only to be met with scorn. Aida was no different, having memorized his tales by heart. She knew for a fact that tricksters could not be trusted. Their promises were worth nothing and they had no concept of honor.

Therefore, the fox was unsurprised when he felt the wood creak as the tendril whizzed past him, crashing into the floorboard and causing splinters to fall all over his hair. He was shivering, knowing that he could have been pierced himself. 

&quot;You summoned a Servant for a reason, did you not?! Look at me, I&#39;m completely harmless! How could I ever hurt my Master?!?&quot;

His pleas went unheard. Aida crossed her arms, snarling like a wild wolf and preparing another attack. The stamp on the ground was the signal for the tendril to reform itself and-

Everything went black. It was a sea of ink, reaching Reynard&#39;s knees as he instinctively stood up, grossed out by the amount of black liquid that was seeping down below. It was rich in mana, but he could feel that energy gradually wane.

<em>squeeze</em>

&quot;Ah!&quot; He yelped in pain, feeling something squeeze and tear at his cheeks, pulling them wide apart. His eyes refocused, then widened, realizing that Aida was staring him down and tugging at his face. As embarrassing as she looked, pinching her own Servant, she never lost that scary glint in her eyes.

Yes, the kind that was willing to slap Reynard around if it meant that he would talk.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413518722154608 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413518722154608><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 11:59 AM">11:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Ow! Ouch ouch owww!&quot; The fox yelped a bit more, feeling his Master treat his face like a freshly baked bun. As painful as it was, this was the extent of Aida&#39;s strength: Any trace of mana left in her body was gone. Reynard knew it, for they were now connected.

&quot;Do I <em>look</em> like I&#39;d be able to free myself?&quot; Reynard asked the moment Aida squeezed his cheeks up to the maximum possible distance. &quot;You&#39;re already behaving like a tyrant. I&#39;m nothing more than a poor Servant at your whims.&quot; He whimpered, his ears drooping and feigning submission.

<em>&quot;This has grown tiring. Far too tiring. Ah, so frustrating to be governed by such a haughty Master.&quot;</em> He thought in secret, doing a poor job at hiding his bias. <em>&quot;But it seems that brute strength won&#39;t get me anywhere. Nor will speed. And this woman had the gall to memorize my stories. Tch, what a pain.&quot;</em>

It didn&#39;t make him happy to be wrapped under Aida&#39;s finger, but it was a necessary sacrifice to remain manifested in this new world. For now, compliance would be the best solution.

He relaxed his body, removing any form of tension from his mind. He took a deep breath, almost capable of ignoring the pain Aida was inflicting on his cheeks. His ears twitched slowly, his tail perked up, swinging side by side like a pendulum. He gently lowered his head until his chin was resting underneath her palms.

He pouted a bit, then proceeded to give her a teary stare.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413541388173314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413541388173314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:00 PM">12:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;I was just testing you.&quot;</strong> Reynard exclaimed without a hint of irony. &quot;I was merely observing how you would react to someone&#39;s rude and demeaning behavior. The fact that I am still alive shows that you have forgiven me and that you have a heart of gold. Truly, you are a Master worthy of me!&quot; He said with a bright smile, his tail rising the happier he sounded.

&quot;But, pray tell, how is it that you are able to harm me so easily? Are you perhaps trained in a branch of Magecraft that is capable of harming Heroic Spirits?&quot; He asked, legitimately curious. While the motives behind asking such a question were nebulous at best, he was being a hundred percent honest in that moment.  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was a lot more docile now that he&#39;d realized there was no escape. His ears drooped. His tails started wagging like a pup, and his eyes filled with tears, as if he sincerely regretted his actions.

<em>It&#39;s an act. It&#39;s all an act! He&#39;s doing what he&#39;s best at, playing a sycophant with a flair!</em>

Aida shook her head. She would not be fooled!

<em>But,</em> a tiny tiny voice whispered in the back of her head. <em>Hasn&#39;t it been enough? Look how sorry he is. Look how sad he is! What else can he possibly do to earn our trust?</em>

The question caught Aida off-guard. <em>Well,</em> she thought to herself, <em>according to the storybooks...</em>

According to the storybooks, the fox either triumphed or failed. There wasn&#39;t a single tale she could recall where the fox had made peace with its adversaries. Was she the adversary of this freshly spun tale?

No, no, no. She was a <em>Master</em>, and Reynard was a <em>Servant</em>! They were supposed to work together, not against one another! Even though she&#39;d never heard of Reynard ever working <em>with</em> anyone until the very end in his stories...Foxes were prone to deceive, after all. It was in their nature to do so, because, because...

Because the storybooks said so!

&#39;Well! I&#39;m...testing you too!&#39; Aida blurted out, sounding far less convincing than the master performer himself. &#39;I don&#39;t know how I managed to catch you. Aren&#39;t you supposed to be a Saber class Servant? Aren&#39;t you supposed to have the strength to move mountains and run faster than the eye can see?&#39; She questioned the fox child, the confusion clear in her voice. &#39;I just read all day.&#39; She declared, almost accusatorily so, as if asking, <em>&#39;How can you be even slower than someone like me?&#39;</em>

Reynard never broke eye contact of course, which fared poorly for Aida, whose will was faltering by the second. The fox picked up on it, noticing the subtle tells in her expression, blushes and body language. It was a lot easier to read Aida when she wasn&#39;t brutalizing him. Funny that.

&quot;Oh, so I was the one being tested all along? So wise!&quot; He exclaimed with a gasp, just to sell the surprise further and sink the fangs of doubt in Aida&#39;s mind.

<em>&quot;Who are you trying to fool, imbecile? At least lie like your life depends on it.&quot;</em>

&quot;As for my Class, I could not say! A Servant responds to a summon. Nothing more, nothing less. The fact that I have shown up as a Saber is perhaps due to your own desire.&quot; He hinted, proposing his own theories on the matter. He wasn&#39;t lying either, for lying too much made you a poor trickster. It was always best to mix some truths to make people trust you.

<em>&quot;Though, if that is actually the case, I will be furious. To be summoned in such an ill-fitting container makes me want to-&quot;</em>

His stream of thought was interrupted by Aida&#39;s words afterwards, as she flashed a smile at him and explained her reasoning for the test: She simply wanted to see if he was as despicable as he was in the books.

Those words frustrated him greatly for some reason. To be read from a mere book cover. It felt unpleasant. He felt tempted to speak his mind and end the facade even, until she kept speaking. His ears perked up.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413674045620315 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413674045620315><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:00 PM">12:00</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;That is what I asked you, dear Master.&quot; Reynard leaned upward, reaching for Aida&#39;s face. A curious gleam was in his eyes. &quot;How exactly did you keep up with my speed and my strength? If you have read my books, then you should know about my abilities. Can you even name a single character that managed to defeat me there?&quot;

He said with a giggle, his smile morphing into a grin. The telltale sign of a fox&#39;s cockiness. All Reynard could remember were his successes. He rarely dwelled on his defeats, mostly because they would irritate him at the mere mention. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>If that were the case, then I wouldn&#39;t have summoned-</em>

But hold on. She <em>did</em> want to summon a Saber class Servant. She wanted to summon one so badly that she even started dreaming about it. All those samurai dramas she&#39;d binged with her auntie helped to enrich her dreams as well. In her dreams, she could wield a katana as well as the <em>hitokiri</em>, and her swordplay was as exquisite as a dance of death.

She wouldn&#39;t have settled for <em>any</em> class other than a Saber. Had she summoned an Archer or a Caster...

It came as a shock to herself, but Aida found herself briefly wondering whether it&#39;d be within a Caster&#39;s capabilities to wield their staff like a sword.

What a fascinating revelation!

&#39;Well, I did want to summon a Saber...&#39; Aida admitted reluctantly. &#39;But I&#39;ve never read anything about a Master&#39;s intentions interfering with the summoning ritual. You must have been good with a sword in one of your stories...or a stick...&#39;

She spoke of innocent conjectures. However, if one were to approach it from a different perspective, didn&#39;t she just admit that her will was so extraordinarily strong that she was able to force a Servant into the Saber class container regardless of their compatibility?

What an absolute <em>menace</em>.

&#39;Oh, but I&#39;m sure I can figure out why!&#39; She said reassuringly, even though Reynard didn&#39;t feel so reassured. &#39;That strange book told me every story that has ever been written about you. I&#39;m sure we can figure something out if I can just remember...&#39;

She closed her eyes and scrunched her face in concentration. &#39;You are cunning...you are fast...you played dead to full the fishermen so you can steal their fish.&#39; She crossed her arms in disapproval, even though the tales she recounted were music to Reynard&#39;s ears. &#39;You always land yourself in trouble, but you can always bail out in the last minute...&#39;

Now <em>that</em> was a gigantic badge of honor!

&#39;...but why did you put your paw in Isengrim&#39;s mouth?&#39;

And it happened?&quot; Even he could not hide his own surprise. The S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame came with processing data that detailed the essentials of Magecraft involving Servant Summoning, but this? This was barely touched upon, most likely because no magus worth their salt would give it any serious consideration.

Either Aida was incredibly (un)lucky, or she had the terrifying ability to make even the Throne of Heroes cater to her whims. Such a spoiled woman...

Reynard saw it as nothing more than an unfortunate coincidence. The alternative was far more unrealistic, after all. Plus, he would rather focus on exactly how much Aida knew about <em>him</em>. Despite having summoned him by accident, she seemed to be quite knowledgable, recounting his various tales and-

&quot;...Eh?&quot; The fox&#39;s mouth was wide agape. His mind paused once Aida mentioned the dreadful name of Isengrim, along with that incident where he accidentally put his paws in their mouth. He still remembered the pain of that event.

&quot;Now now, that was just a-&quot; The ham incident came next, reminding him of how he was almost skinned alive by a farmer, while that bastard of a wolf ate the entire ham. But that was nowhere near as bad as Aida&#39;s judgmental stare once she mentioned the last incident...

<strong>&quot;...That is all hearsay! Hearsay, I TELL YOU!&quot;</strong> Reynard erupted, a large blush on his face as he ditched his angelic demeanor. He rose up and grabbed Aida by the shoulders, shaking her wildly in an effort to protect his dignity.

&quot;No idiotic wolf could ever best me, let alone an ignorant buffoon such as Isengrim! As for my manhood, I <strong>still</strong> have it! Witness it, if you&#39;re so curious!&quot; He said, putting his hands inside his shorts as he threatened to lower them and-

<em>slip</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023413898369577060 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023413898369577060><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:01 PM">12:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Before he could, he slipped again, this time on the puddle of ink that had been formed by Aida&#39;s previous spell. Ink washed down on his shorts and hands, covering him in blackness. Even if he had managed to pull them down, Aida would have seen nothing but the abyss.

Reynard was furious, of course, but the ink spillage just reminded him of the time he slipped on apple juice. Another unfortunate event designed to stop him from harming Aida, be it physically or mentally.

The fact that it occurred just moments after he boasted of never being defeated, followed by Aida&#39;s revelation that no, he had been bested...

...was oddly coincidental.

As he lied in that puddle of ink, all he could do was stare at Aida from below. The way she towered above him, domineered him in strength and speed, along with demanding him to do as she pleased...

He could almost imagine a wolf&#39;s ears around that innocent looking face.

<em>&quot;Don&#39;t tell me.&quot;</em> Reynard thought to himself, reminding himself that a Servant&#39;s abilities were a crystallization of their accomplishments. This meant the same for defeats as well, which would translate to curses and conceptual weaknesses. Isengrim was the only thorn on his side, being an opponent he could not beat head on. He was the only person had ever been subservient to.

Now, he was subservient to a Master. Therefore...

<strong>Aida was his new wolf.</strong>

&quot;You...You&#39;re the wolf?&quot; The fox blurted out, sounding delirious. He raised his arm and pointed to Aida with an accusatory tone. &quot;No wonder you can keep up with me. You&#39;ve overthrown Isengrim&#39;s role as a character...&quot; His soul washed away from his body. He couldn&#39;t tell if he preferred to be bullied by Isengrim or Aida. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In a fantastic display of agility (or the lack thereof) and nimbleness (or the lack thereof), Aida watched Reynard&#39;s face under go several shades of red, purple, and green, before the boy landed himself in her puddle of ink. The ink dyed his hair, fur, and cloak. He was beginning to resemble a raccoon more than a fox.

All that, at the mention of Isengrim&#39;s name. It seemed that Aida had roused some terrible memories from her Servant.

Aida was no Reynard. She felt bad, worse than when she had punted Reynard across the room. That was pure self-defense (from her point of view). This was more akin to bullying. Everyone had scars.

&#39;I, um. I believe you.&#39; Aida averted her gaze, so that she wouldn&#39;t need to stare at the abyss by chance. But that didn&#39;t seem to lift Reynard&#39;s spirits, as the fox remained almost motionless in the ink puddle, his face a mixture of horror and dread. He reminded Aida of the stray cats mewling on a rainy day at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#ghetto-on-the-brink</span>. She almost felt sorry for him, until...

<em>&#39;You...You&#39;re the wolf?&#39;</em>

&#39;...I&#39;m the <em><strong>what</strong></em>?!&#39;

Aida snapped back at Reynard, her eyes opened wide and her mouth agape. Where did that come from? Just because she showed him up for a fraud for once, didn&#39;t mean that he got to call <em>her</em> names! Where were his manners?!

&#39;Last I checked in a mirror, I don&#39;t have a wolf&#39;s tail, and my nails are trimmed and filed.&#39; She crouched down to bring herself near Reynard&#39;s eye level, so he could see the incredibly serene expression she was now wearing on her face (read: it meant <em>run</em>). &#39;Just because we got off on the wrong foot...&#39;

Aida frowned, then heaved a sigh of defeat.

She looked a little frustrated, as if she wasn&#39;t sure how things had deteriorated to this game of name-calling. &#39;If you behave, then I don&#39;t mind starting over again.

Albeit Aida was taking it a bit too heavily, going as far to wear the most threatening smile Reynard had witnessed in a while.

<em>&quot;Keep looking at me like that and I&#39;ll start thinking you&#39;re a witch instead.&quot;</em> Is what Reynard wished he could have said, but to avoid more humiliation for the day, he acquiesced and simply nodded to all of Aida&#39;s statements. It turned out to be the right move, since once Aida calmed down, she started apologizing for her earlier behavior and proposed a truce of some sort.

&quot;So long as you don&#39;t act like one, I doubt I&#39;ll call you that again.&quot; Reynard replied grumpily, spitting ink out of his mouth as he felt filthy all around. His first objective of the day, besides handling Aida&#39;s needless questions, would be to have a full shower.

&quot;I am more than happy for us to be civilized, however. At this point, it seems like we are stuck with each other.&quot; The fox sighed, clearly not satisfied with the outcome, but having made peace with it upon seeing the alternative. &quot;There is no point in me fleeing, so I&#39;m all yours. Cherish me well. You know, there are people who would kill for my service!&quot; He gloated. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though both her and Reynard&#39;s outfits were ruined, her spirit felt lifted by the unexpected truce she had struck with her Servant.

She wasn&#39;t completely satisfied with this turnout, of course. Memories of Tsuruhime&#39;s charismatic grin still lived on in a corner of her mind, but as much as she refused to accept it, it seemed that the heroine she had witnessed was only a figment of her imagination. Reynard was the card she had been dealt, and Reynard, his soot-black fur and waxy crayon combined, was what she had to live with for the rest of this War.

&#39;Oh, yeah?&#39; She asked with a semi-interested smile at the fox child&#39;s self-proclaimed usefulness. &#39;Well, if you really are as good as you claim, then there <em>is</em> something you can do.

He tried to calm himself down, standing up and hobbling back to where his crayon was. Not even the ink could silence its bright, golden glow. He dragged it around, walking back to Aida who was now looking at him with a smile.

&quot;I don&#39;t need to claim it, for I simply <em>am</em> good. Have you forgotten how much you owe me?&quot; He puffed out his chest in pride. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have summoned that brute if you weren&#39;t acting like such a crybaby. Consider it my piety.&quot;

Those words caused Aida to think a bit. By brute, did he mean Tsuruhime?

However...

&#39;...She did mention the book fair...&#39; An event that only she, and other fans of the book would know.

Aida stared hard, really hard, at the giant crayon. As unlikely as it was, an old folk story popped into her head.

&#39;Is that supposed to be a magic paintbrush?&#39; She asked slowly, dragging out the words one after another, as if she was just now starting to piece things together. Just now seeing the picture for what it was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023414193518547044 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023414193518547044><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:02 PM">12:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Reynard cursed the cruel god that had decided this woman was worthy of being his Master.

&quot;Of course she did. That is because she <em>was</em> real.&quot; The fox stated, sounding as if he had said a concept as simple as basic summation. &quot;You don&#39;t think you would be capable of summoning two Servants at once now, would you? Not with your meager circuits.&quot; He teased her while still sounding polite.

Then Aida moved on to question him about the crayon. He smiled, eager to show it off. &quot;This right here is the <strong>Crayon of Malpertuis</strong>, one of the treasures I stole from the lion king during my various escapades.&quot; He explained, twirling his crayon around with barely any effort.

&quot;It seems to react well to your so-called fairy tales. I just had it eat your book about that Saber you desperately wanted. Though, if I had known that they were an ogre, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have summoned them.&quot; He explained, still reminiscing the punch from earlier. Damn that Tsuruhime.

Though, the most surprising discovery to Aida&#39;s ears was the fact that Reynard chose to purposefully summon Tsuruhime. But why? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She inched closer to Reynard like a fan who was eager to meet their idol, one who had singlehandedly made their wish come true. What a glorious moment! No doubt she had fallen for his - or rather, his crayon&#39;s - charm. At this rate, it wouldn&#39;t take long for her to be completely enamored by him and listen to his every whim. 

Aida&#39;s face came even closer, so that it was only a few inches apart from Reynard&#39;s own. He could see every eyelash. He could also see the faint lines of veins popping under her skin. 

&#39;You ate my book, huh?&#39; She continued to question the fox child. &#39;My limited edition of <em>Jeanne d&#39;Arc of Setouchi</em>, released in 2066 during its 100 year anniversary?&#39; A chill began to creep into her voice. &#39;I wonder what made you do it, my talented little fox.

He couldn&#39;t care less for his Master, but her brightness was contagious. She basked in joy, most likely thinking about how fortunate she was to witness her idol in the flesh. So happy she was that she inched closer to Reynard, starstruck by his capabilities.

Sure, she was just a pawn, but Reynard didn&#39;t mind the attention at all! After all, it simply made it easier for them to get along. It took her a while to understand his worth, but perhaps his Master was far less foolish than he had given them credit for!

&quot;Exactly. You are indeed correct.&quot; He nodded his head. &quot;Of course, I am but a humble fox, so I could not keep them around forever, but all things are transient and temporal. You should treasure them while you still have them.&quot; He brushed off his limitations through some spiritual nonsense.

&quot;Now, be a dear and let me-&quot; Before he could start commanding Aida, the librarian got close to him. Dangerously close, even. The height difference between the two became rather apparent, as they were now neck to neck. Except Aida&#39;s smile felt a lot darker, and a throbbing vein could be found around her cheeks and forehead.

Even when she spoke, Reynard could not pinpoint the issue. All he knew was that his fur felt cold and his tail was shivering.

&quot;Hmmm? Did you not want to see your precious Saber? I simply used the book to fulfill your needs. Are you not happy?&quot; He asked, having not realized the severity of the situation. &quot;You can always buy another one. Why does the age matter? The younger it is, the better, after all.&quot; He giggled. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Who cares that the book is one of the only things I have left of her? Who cares about feelings and memories? Like you said, the new is always better than the old.&#39;

She glared at Reynard as if he was nothing but soot beneath her foot. Her heart felt hollow, as if she had just lost a treasure even more precious than the lion king&#39;s treasury.

&#39;How wise your words are, Reynard,&#39; she spoke with utter disdain at his complete lack of awareness. &#39;I wonder how much you must be worth then, seeing that you have just celebrated your thousand-year birthday some time last century,&#39; she paused for a bit, then added, &#39;<em>old fossil</em>.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023414373240295506 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023414373240295506><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:03 PM">12:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His expression was muted, but gradually became worried as he felt Aida&#39;s nails sink into his shoulders, pinning him in place as she lectured him on the true nature of the book and why it was so important. The fox soon realized why she was so irate, followed by Aida using his own words against him.

<em>&quot;I never met my parents and you don&#39;t see me whining.&quot;</em> Yet the fox was heartless. He knew that displaying his honest thoughts would end poorly for him, so he stored it in his mind. But it annoyed him, for Aida to immediately assume that his intent was vile. Why, was he supposed to read her mind and automatically assume that book was a keepsake of hers?!

&quot;Then unsummon me, <em>you whiny brat.&quot;</em> He spat out, unable to hold it in any longer. Despite Aida holding him firm with her arms, he didn&#39;t care. He stood tall and proud, far shorter than her, but demanding attention nonetheless.

&quot;I&#39;m just a useless, old codger, so you might as well go summon another Servant. Maybe your next Servant will be able to tell that the oddly placed book in your library is actually an important keepsake that should not be touched. Just maybe!&quot; He spat, letting out his inner child as he stuck his tongue out at Aida. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

How dare he! She lifted her chin in defiance. How dare he threaten her with his own life?! He was just a fox, words on a page, an unapologetic ink stain before she&#39;d tapped into the Throne and pulled him out of the vortex. If she had managed to bring him into the real world, then she can punt him back!

&#39;Luckily for you, an unsummoning ritual doesn&#39;t exist.&#39; She huffed and glared daggers at her Servant. Was Reynard aware of that fact as well? Was that what had given him the confidence to mock and ridicule as he pleased? Unfortunately for him...

&#39;...there is another way.&#39; 

Aida&#39;s glasses glinted dangerously in the midday light. She opened her mouth, and time seemed to have slowed down in anticipation of what she was about to say. Her back felt warm. Hot, even. It prickled like sore flesh after receiving a freshly done tattoo.

<strong>&#39;By the order of my Command Seal-&#39;</strong>

A surge of mana clashed behind her words, dangerously close to piercing through. Aida&#39;s own words chilled her. She had been caught in a tide. She <em>was</em> the tide, and she wanted so badly to crash down, to flood the room and to devour everything in sight. 

She held the power. She wanted to unleash that power. And why shouldn&#39;t she? She was tired, and hungry, and emotionally battered, and she wanted nothing but to return everything to the way it was. Reynard&#39;s words played on her mind like roaches crawling in the shadows, like mice scratching inside the walls. Like water dripping beyond her reach.

She looked within herself and saw nothing but anger and hurt. And the dark swirls of temptation to give the fox what he deserved. 

<em>He asked for it, didn&#39;t he?</em>

<em>Do it! Give him what he wanted! Show him who&#39;s boss!</em>

<em>And that&#39;s precisely what he did, wasn&#39;t it? He has wanted to go back ever since you summoned him, ordering him to kill himself is only allowing yourself to play into his own hands.</em>

<em>He&#39;s rude and pervy and uncaring and selfish!</em>

<em>He&#39;s a</em> <em><strong>fox!</strong></em>

Such a wicked fox.

But, a fox nonetheless.

The winds subsided. 

&#39;You are only a fox. Chaos is in your nature.&#39; Aida muttered. Her words rang hollow.

&#39;Sending you away would leave me with nothing. No Servant frame. No catalyst. Nothing to show for my efforts. No way to fight against Republic.&#39; She turned away from Reynard. She went to the door, leaned her head against it for a long moment before she turned the knob.

Don&#39;t make me waste more of my time toiling around inside this squallid room!&quot; Reynard snarled, two canines emerging from his mouth as he bore his fangs. Aida wasn&#39;t happy and neither was he. He would rather disappear in the formless Throne than entertain this four-eyed librarian any longer.

When Aida revealed that an unsummoning ritual didn&#39;t exist, he wondered if the woman still tolerated him. Of course, that wasn&#39;t the case, as his Master was quick to mention words that could only be used by <em>her</em> authority. Something reserved to Masters only.

<em>&quot;An order that is impossible for me to go against.&quot;</em> Reynard felt disgusted. There was nothing he hated more than being told what to do. But he knew for a fact that it was incredibly hard to resist a Command Seal. If Aida wanted him to perish, then it would happen, no matter his feelings on the matter.

He almost smiled at the thought. Who cared if he died? At least he would be freed from this farce. From being forced to interact with someone who didn&#39;t understand him. No one did, after all. Not a single character from the books.

He awaited death, yet it did not come.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; He could not help but elicit a small mew as he blinked and realized that Aida had remained immobile for a while. Her lips were whispering something, but he could not make any sense of it, nor grasp whether she was committing to those words or not. 

Eventually, the storm that threatened to engulf them both grew quiet. Aida spoke, her words devoid of both anger and joy as she turned around and lamented on how much of a waste it would be to get rid of Reynard. Not because she cared, of course, but because dying would be too good for him. She needed to get at least <em>some</em> value out of it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023414623073992704 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023414623073992704><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:04 PM">12:04</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Something so pragmatic would usually elicit Reynard&#39;s praise, but all he felt was disgust. Disgust not at him being spared, but Aida&#39;s view of him.

&quot;Indeed. What can I do? Certainly not calm that tempestous tantrum of yours.&quot; Reynard spat back, tired of his Master&#39;s ramblings. &quot;Was that my purpose? To be summoned to knock some sense into that cranium of yours?&quot; He continued, before hearing her mention something about a Republic.

&quot;Of course I wouldn&#39;t fight a Republic. I am not into politics.&quot; The fox sneered. &quot;What, you wanted a Saber to murder some citizens? Didn&#39;t expect you to have the guts to do that.&quot; He taunted. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I won&#39;t let you do that.&#39;

A small <em>hmph!</em> escaped her as Reynard started lecturing her on politics. She cast him am appraising sort of look, but the flames of hope was no longer kindling in her eyes. As brilliant as they are in color, they were dull and full of gloom.

&#39;Republic is an organization. It&#39;s trying to take over my city unless we fight back.

One that could be judged from its cover. Really, she was no different than the average member of the lion king&#39;s court back in his stories.

&quot;How sad for you.&quot; The fox replied upon hearing about Republic&#39;s exploits. So, his Master lived on a city that was currently under siege. He had zero experience with that scenario obviously, since his tales described only peaceful times. However, he could somewhat resonate with Aida&#39;s desire, since it felt more like a personal obligation than something designed to assist the many. That, or she was fooling herself in believing that she was doing it for others.

&quot;Indeed. I am nothing but foolish and unwise compared to you, oh great Master. Please, enlighten me on how you intended to use me against this Republic. A direct attack on their base? Did you want me to talk them to death?

As Reynard twisted and turned her words, she accepted and denied his words at face value, without delving beneath the surface. 

&#39;You make me sad.&#39; She continued. &#39;Republic makes me sad. Cathy made me sad, but I love Cathy more than you. If you can do me a favor and talk Republic to death, then please! I&#39;m dying to see your results.&#39; She said without much enthusiasm.

&#39;But you can&#39;t even trick me into unsummoning you. What else can you do, then? Can you fight? Because we are going to war. There&#39;s going to be a tourney between Republic and us. I am representing.&#39;

Reynard was confused. When was the last time someone had been so blunt with him? No pretense of trickery. No greed or ulterior motives. Just pure, unflinching honesty. It wasn&#39;t the kind that made him roll his eyes either, the one from knights in shining armor that could only do good. No, Aida simply sounded as devastated as a normal human.

But of course, Reynard could never admit that he was wrong. Not ever since Aida saw him as a &#39;fox&#39;. It didn&#39;t matter whether he was one or not. What mattered was that there was never a case of mutual respect between the two. To Reynard, Aida was a fool. To Aida, he was but a fox. There was no attempt at communication, only angry, frustrated growls.

&quot;You expect me to care? To give a damn about your sadness? Oh, woe is me for being forced into this war! I might as well drag a Servant or two down with me!&quot; He spat venom at her, frothing with rage. 

&quot;That&#39;s how you sound right now. I couldn&#39;t care less of your problems. After all, I am nothing more than a little fox. I live, I sleep and I eat. That is all I need to survive. Hearing someone&#39;s ramblings was never my role, especially when that someone is treating me as nothing more than a corner piece to their story.&quot;

He glared back at Aida&#39;s dull eyes, facing them with a fiery passion that the librarian hadn&#39;t seen ever since his summon. &quot;You think that I&#39;m just a fox? Just a dull, little critter designed to cause mischief? If that&#39;s what you expect from us, <strong>then that&#39;s what you shall get from us.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023414909993746512 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023414909993746512><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:05 PM">12:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Reynard growled, his ears tense and his tail spiked. Aida felt threatened almost, feeling like the child in front of her was ready to pounce at her and devour her whole.

That murderous intent started to wane, as Reynard calmed down and instead turned around. &quot;I&#39;m nothing but a fox, so I&#39;ll disappear in my little corner in the world. Good luck with your tourney or whatever. Try to last a while: I would rather spend an ample amount of time in your world before you kick the bucket.&quot; He said with the usual cheekiness, but this time far more cold and detached. He was quite good at picking up from his Master. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But his words cut deep. They shone with intellect, but of the kind that were designed to hurt. Designed to elicit some sort of reaction that could turn the tide in his favor. It was his defensive mechanism. When strength failed him, he had nothing to rely on but his brains. They had served him well.

Aida, as expected, bought into his act.

&#39;Of course, why would you care?&#39; She said it with disappointment and resentment. Had they not been at odds with each other, it almost sounded as if she were agreeing with Reynard...

&#39;I may be slow, but you have made it plenty clear that you. Do not. Care.&#39;

And there went the final nail in the coffin. She <em>did</em> end up agreeing with him after all. This wasn&#39;t the prelude to another outburst, but only a simple statement. There wasn&#39;t a bit of fight left in her. 

Aida twisted the door knob and pulled. The door made a cracking sound as it opened onto the ink-smeared floor. Finally, she was going to leave Reynard alone, and Reynard would have achieved world peace.

&#39;But <em>I</em> care.&#39;

The clacking of her heels stopped at the door. 

&#39;I won&#39;t allow you to get the both of us disqualified in the tourney. Laze about all you want, but on the day of my match, you <em>will</em> be there.&#39;

And how was she going to guarantee that, pray tell?

Aida turned around. 

&#39;By the order of my Command Seal-&#39; 

She cast Reynard one final look that he couldn&#39;t quite comprehend.

&#39;<strong>-I order you to never back down from a fight.</strong> Goodbye, Reynard. I will see you in fifteen days.&#39;

And with that, she was gone. The frills of her dress disappeared from sight, leaving behind nothing but traces of residue mana, suggesting that an incredibly powerful binding spell had been cast.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1023414933171478619 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1023414933171478619><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Sep-22 12:05 PM">12:05</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps, she was a Master through and through, or perhaps Reynard just did a good job at bringing out her leadership skills. Regardless, the fox wouldn&#39;t appreciate it, since they were practically mailing daggers at each others&#39; eyes. A wolf and a fox, locked in a cycle of hurt.

At least, it looked like Aida was about to end it all, the door creaking open...

Until Reynard heard her heels stop, followed by her proclamation of war. She would participate in the Holy Grail War, regardless of what Reynard thought or not. A true tyrant.

She stared at him back, her seal flashing red as the fox cowered in fear, waiting for something terrible to happen.

But it never came. Instead, he just felt a seal disappear from his Master&#39;s hold. It wasn&#39;t an immediate order, but a long term one. Whenever it would become relevant, he would certainly feel it.

And judging by the seriousness of her last response before her departure, he might be feeling that very soon.

The librarian vanished, leaving just a single, lonely fox in a room befitting of an abyss. He had returned to his natural habitat: One where he was left alone in his thoughts.

&quot;Tch. I miss the much simpler times. Whatever happened to greedy kings and corrupt nobles?

&quot;What a fool that woman is. She stands no chance in an actual war, especially with me around. Hmph, serves her right!&quot; He nodded, talking to himself about how Aida <em>deserved</em> to lose with how she had treated him. Of course, this was nothing but spoiled grapes from Reynard&#39;s part. After all, he felt beaten. Aida had him in checkmate, and he was forced to abide by his Master&#39;s annoying Command Seal.

But he wouldn&#39;t give up. Foxes rarely did. Fifteen days was enough time to come up with something. Something to ruin Aida&#39;s chance at fighting in the first place. He felt no shame in working against her. After all, he was nothing more than a little fox!
