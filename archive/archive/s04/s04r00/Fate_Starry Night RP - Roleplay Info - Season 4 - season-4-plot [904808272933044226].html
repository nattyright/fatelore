All kinds of worries and fears seemed to melt away in front of the vastness of the ocean. It was scary, to see such an empty stretch of sea beyond. But at the same time, it was also peaceful. That knowledge that nothing else lurked past the sea.

...

Alexandria was as lively as ever, enjoying a relatively hot winter. February was almost over, and spring was raising its head. Farmers had already begun to monitor the crops, thinking on what to best plant for the next harvest season. Likewise, the more carefree citizens were impatiently fidgeting with dates and plans, thinking about the various winter and spring festivals that were soon to take place. A multicultural city had its fair share of celebrations, and of course, everyone wanted to be included.

Which is why the mail delivery service was working non stop. Amazones™️ had received a wide variety of parcels, requests and orders, including from outside of Alexandria. Importing and exporting was a courier&#39;s trade, but it was a different thing entirely to see it from the perspective of a Stella Maris: The meticulous craft and tidy organization required for parcels to be delivered smoothly. For mailmen to be punctual. For destinations to be reached, and for customers to be pleased.

<em>&quot;Hello. Your order. Please sign here. Thanks.&quot;</em>

A weathered tome landed in a young man&#39;s hands. They sifted the pages, adjusting their glasses as they did so before coming across the information they needed. With minimal noise, they shuffled back to the hallway, coming across various other men and women in similar outfits and demeanor. The silence was golden.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003093765893935135 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1003093765893935135><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:16 AM">10:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
After all, they were inside the <strong>world&#39;s biggest library.</strong> The Great Library of Alexandria, named after the eponymous legend. All kinds of data, from physical to digital, was stored there for preservation, research and collection purposes. The library was maintained by a coven of librarians, expert archivers that would monitor any additions or removals from the library&#39;s archives. 

To the librarian carrying the book, this tome was yet another cog in the well-greased machine that was Alexandria. Another set of data to be inserted, logged and recorded.

This was what it meant to be a Stella Maris. A city with a productivity output that was far bigger than the same of its parts. It wasn&#39;t just land: Its strength, knowledge and culture was entirely in the hands of the people.

Yet, it meant so little all the same.

Tremors started to surround the library, the kind that felt like minor earthquakes from hilly terrain. Something uncommon for a nomadic city, especially one with a robust aqueduct system like Alexandria. The librarians were more worried about possible damage to the books than their own safety, but one of them charged ahead and climbed to the top, researching the library&#39;s observatory.

They peered through the telescope, trying to locate the source of the disturbance. It was impossible to miss.

Another, smaller city, had made a direct collision with them. Not enough to deal any significant damage, but enough to sink their claws and force themselves inside their harbor. This wasn&#39;t an accidental collision. It had been clearly planned.

Soon, a monotone voice resounded across the island, as if projected via a massive megaphone.

<strong>&quot;Good morning, Alexandrians. We are Republic. Our arrival here is not an accident.&quot;</strong> Those words were uttered in rapid fire.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003093836131729459 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1003093836131729459><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:16 AM">10:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;We ask that you relinquish all of your data to us. Physical. Digital. Any file format will do. We will occupy your library for around three days to complete the data transfer. We require nothing else and will depart once the transfer is completed. We do not intend to harm you, for it is pointless. We, however, cannot guarantee your safety if we are met with opposition. Please, keep our relationship civil.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;You may now attempt to appeal.&quot;</strong>

And that is how, for the first time since its conception, Alexandria felt <em>powerless.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003093892800970752 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1003093892800970752><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:17 AM">10:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

<strong>- Season 4 -</strong>

Spring was coming, yet the people could barely feel it. The shadow of Republic&#39;s mobile city lingered in the distance, surrounding Alexandria like a shark circling prey. Trading had stopped as other cities refused to approach with Republic around. Every day, Alexandria&#39;s vaults got a little less richer. Waiting was costly, but it was the only strategy that the librarians could employ.

After all, it was what the Neo Holy Empire had recommended. The Church had promised salvation, in the form of ambassadors and negotiators. Their arrival was supposed to promise great news, but in the new world, it took time to go from point A to B. Alexandria was on its own.

&quot;We are not interested in anything else. We do not seek to barter, nor do we want any NATs as compensation. We simply want the library&#39;s data.&quot;

&quot;The library is our lifeblood. It is what keeps our city afloat. We cannot simply hand it over.&quot; 

Two negotiators were in conflict. One wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible, while the other wanted to buy large amounts of time. Republic had been offered various amounts of compensation. They had ignored all of them.

&quot;That is unrelated to what we want. Your problems are none of our concern. The data is of utmost importance to us. We have given freely,&quot; 

They eyed a Servant in the room, who had been monitoring the conversation to avoid any outbursts from either party.

&quot;therefore, it is only fair for us to take as well.&quot;

&quot;...Even at the cost of our relationship?&quot; The librarian asked, still befuddled at how insistent Republic was.

&quot;Yes. You cannot hope to understand our dilemmas, so I see no point in explaining myself to you. Deliver the data. Or we shall simply pry it open.&quot;

&quot;...Ridiculous. I had never expected Republic to be so barbaric.&quot; The librarian sighed, before looking back to the Servant. &quot;But you are correct, we did have a mutually beneficial relationship. In that case,&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003093962954903692 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1003093962954903692><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:17 AM">10:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
They adjusted their shoulders, crossed their legs and assumed a more confident pose.

&quot;we shall let your gifts do the talking. <strong>A Holy Grail War.</strong> How about it? If we are defeated, the data is yours. If not, then I kindly ask you to leave.&quot;

&quot;Why should we accept? We know that you host no real combat strength. Paving the way to the library with force would be child&#39;s play for us.&quot;

&quot;Allow me to rephrase then: Which would you rather shed first, blood or honor?&quot; The librarian adjusted their glasses. &quot;You were the first one to give us Servant frames, yet will not accept the chance to display your superiority on your home turf?&quot;

The Republic ambassador remained silent.

&quot;No wonder we replaced your frames. The Church ones were made of sterner stuff.&quot; The librarian joked.

&quot;...Understood. We find this to be a reasonable compromise. A Holy Grail War would benefit both parties, since it would resolve this with minimal damage.&quot;

&quot;Glad to see you still listen to reason.&quot; The librarian smiled, being unable to hide their satisfaction. It was a habit they had picked up from work, to prod and poke at people&#39;s insecurities. They didn&#39;t realize that it could carry them so far.

&quot;Of course, a Grail War requires proper setup, management and precautions to avoid needless damage and causalities. We, of course, expect Alexandria to manage that, while also paying for all forms of expenses.&quot;

&quot;...Indeed.&quot; A single sweat drop shed from the librarian&#39;s head. Their victory was short lived, as they could already tell that Republic would take this challenge with utmost seriousness.

However, they were relieved: They had succeeded in giving Alexandria a chance. A chance to achieve victory. No matter how small that chance was, it was worth taking. Not only that, but they had bought enough time for the Church&#39;s missionaries to arrive on time.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003094036455903382 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1003094036455903382><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:17 AM">10:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...Unfortunately, most of our staff is not willing to participate in a Holy Grail War.&quot; The Republic ambassador broke the silence. Their words worried the librarian, making them wonder if the man was going back on their word, until-

&quot;Would you mind waiting a few weeks for us to gather a large enough team for this little game? A Grail War needs not amateurs.&quot;

The librarian nodded in agreement. &quot;Likewise, we could use additional time to organize the war and warn the local populace.&quot; They were telling the truth, but omitted the fact that they had no warriors of their own. Alexandria hadn&#39;t been involved in a Holy Grail War for the entirety of its life. One wouldn&#39;t know where to find a competent Master amongst its people.

&quot;Plus, we would need to find something to encourage participants to apply. Something that would attract a magus to risk their life in a Holy Grail War.&quot; The librarian commented.

&quot;It is simple, really.&quot; The ambassador shrugged. &quot;There have been many wars, but all of them share a common reward.&quot;

<strong>&quot;A wish.&quot;</strong>

And with that, the pact was made. The two cities had officially decided to settle their differences via Grail combat. Weeks would be spent preparing the arena for the tournament, along with gathering magi brave enough to participate for the sake of factions beyond their scope.

It was for fame and it was for glory. It was for riches and it was for honor. Both sides put lives on their line. One to take and one to preserve.

It was the true essence of a Holy Grail War.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1003094112670580807 class="chatlog__message-container chatlog__message-container--pinned" data-message-id=1003094112670580807><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Jul-22 10:17 AM">10:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"></div><div class=chatlog__embed><a href=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20Roleplay%20Info%20-%20Season%204%20-%20season-4-plot%20%5B904808272933044226%5D.html_Files/unknown-9EF69.png> <img class=chatlog__embed-plainimage src=Fate_Starry%20Night%20RP%20-%20Roleplay%20Info%20-%20Season%204%20-%20season-4-plot%20%5B904808272933044226%5D.html_Files/unknown-9EF69.png alt="Embedded image" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite Alexandria&#39;s best attempts at buying time, the Church was unable to show up on time. Information travelled slowly across the vast, uncaring ocean. By the time the Church caught wind of Republic&#39;s intrusion, they were almost days behind. Of course, they acted swiftly, but gave Alexandria almost no warning in that regard.  Messages in a bottle would have a bigger chance of crossing the oceanic distance between the two cities than any modern radio wave. 

Which is why the Church immediately got to action, sending messengers and negotiators on a trip to the library city. All they could do was pray to be expedient.

This meant that Alexandria was left to fend for itself, and fend for itself it did. It defended itself with words, striking at Republic&#39;s heart. Some sort of nobility still resided in their enemy&#39;s heart, resulting in Republic allowing a Holy Grail War to dictate the outcome of their decision. Victory would mean Alexandria&#39;s freedom and Republic&#39;s retreat. Defeat would mean Republic having full access to Alexandria&#39;s data storage.

Both sides had much to earn. They spared no quarter in hiring as many hands on board, hoping to overwhelm their opponent with sheer numbers. Talented magus were rare, but even rarer were those willing to give away their skills to fight for somebody else&#39;s sake. Those who remained out of that small selection were the best that the two cities could afford.

Some had already summoned their Servants. Some were in the process of summoning them. They had been given ample time to make preparations, mostly due to Alexandria wanting to waste as much of Republic&#39;s time as possible. Various excuses worked, such as explaining that mages needed time to catch wind of the Holy Grail War, along with explaining that it was best to setup a televised stream of the Grail War, since it benefitted both parties in terms of publicity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1018298928552235028 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1018298928552235028><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Sep-22 09:16 AM">09:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

The advertising team was clearly biased, but a bit of outrage did wonders for ratings. Even better was the fact that a <strong>wish</strong> had been given out as a reward for the Holy Grail War&#39;s victor. It meant a lot, especially when the proposal came from Republic themselves. Those who weren&#39;t living other rocks knew that it could only mean one thing.

<strong>A wish granted by Republic themselves.</strong>

Not from a Holy Grail, yet the second best thing. Many would strive to obtain that wish, or if not, at least see the outcome of it. That is how, in the span of a few days, the channel showing the upcoming Grail War suddenly received a large boost in ratings.

But for now, let us focus back to the contestants, who have yet to take the stage...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Up, and down. Up… and then, of course, down.

Such was the motion of the ocean. A ship that focused more on the passenger experience might have taken measures to counteract this, but the <em>Logrborg</em> took no such precautions, for it had no need of them. No crew manned this ship, and the sole passenger paid no heed to the heave and ho of the waves. 

Said passenger was currently located in the sole cabin within the vessel, a cramped and spartan affair. A single threadbare bed, a splintering wooden armchair, and a square desk, all of it lit by a single window. If one were given a glimpse into this room, without any context, they might assume it was some manner of prison cell. However, the inhabitant was not kept here by force, but rather, by obligation. A purpose that they must fulfil. A task that must be done.

One might think it undignified that an arm of the Holy Roman Empire, a trusted confidant of the Holy Neo Emperor, would have to work under such conditions. If it was up to them, ❚❚❚❚❚❚❚ would have been perfectly content with an empty room, but alas, no such luck. They needed a table to write, which meant a chair to sit in. And the bed… Wherever had that bed come from? They did not know, but they knew they had not asked for it.

No matter. They were not here to relax, nor did they come to critique the furniture. They had come here to pen a letter. It had not been the first, and it would not be the last. As they leaned upon the table, they dipped their quill in a pot of ink, and began to write.

<strong><u>ALEXANDRIA v. REPUBLIC</u></strong>
<em><strong>Report No. 003</strong></em>
<em>Day eight of travel. Estimated time until arrival to Alexandria: thirty minutes. Estimated time until arrival of this message: five days. Early scouting reports show conflict is still in preliminary phases. “Tournament” has not officially begun. Bureaucratic stalling tactics appeared effective. Should arrive in time for first round, though ability to affect outcome uncertain.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1026255252065886238 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1026255252065886238><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Oct-22 08:11 AM">08:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A pause. ❚❚❚❚❚❚❚ idly held the quill for a moment, staring down at the paper, a frown upon their face. After a second of thought, they continued.

<em>Please send updates on factory efficiency data in my absence. I will not allow production rates to falter in my absence.</em>

After the last pen stroke had been made, it took ten minutes for the ink to dry. Then, the message was gently folded up, before being slid into a small capsule. The Heavenly General stood from their chair, pacing over to their open window. A whistle escaped from pursed lips, a dull, joyless sound devoid of melody or emotion. 

<strong>”CAW! CAW!”</strong>

Right on cue, a raven swooped down, fluttering to the stop and perching upon the window. It waited quietly as arms reached out, attaching the capsule to a steel anklet around the bird’s leg. Then, when everything was in place, the raven flew off, out in the opposite distance to the ship, through the skies and beyond the horizon. It was a wordless exchange, like a hammer striking hot iron, quick and efficient. Just the way they liked it.

It would take some time for that matter to resolve itself. In all likelihood, another three or so ravens would come and go with more reports before they heard so much as a word back. But one could not plan for the future until they had taken care of the present.

So, it was time to do just that. <strong>The first round of the Holy Grail War was about to begin</strong>, and ❚❚❚❚❚❚❚ intended to be ready for it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ever since the day that golems flooded the city streets and marched upon The Great Sword Museum, things had been… surprisingly calm. The army of familiars had holed themselves up inside the building, and from the outside, one could easily see the renovations being done, the scaffolding and supports stretching out beyond the roof and reaching towards the sky. For some, that was enough to assuage their concerns. It was just a new building project being done, no different than the dozens of other ongoing projects. Others tried to dig deeper, but most investigation into the building met only with dead ends. All the plans were strictly classified. The authorities lacked the permission to intervene. Nobody was allowed in or out.

Saber preferred it this way. They hated dealing with the politics of it all, being harassed by middle men and bureaucrats, having their precious time wasted. Deep within their forge, protected by walls made of steel and guarded by a hundred golems, they were as far from the red tape of the world as they could be. 

Of course, that did not mean that they were ignoring the goings-on of the outside, and that did not mean they had nothing to concern themselves with. After all…

<strong>Alexandria had lost the first round.</strong>

The possibility of defeat had always been on the line. There was every chance that, even with the full support of the Neo Holy Empire, they would nevertheless lose this tournament. They had always been the underdogs, the buckler shield defending against the cleaving claymore. However, to suffer such a convincing defeat so early on.

<strong>”Sigh.”</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033234760929116254 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033234760929116254><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Oct-22 02:26 PM">14:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>They spoke the words aloud, for they could not even muster the appropriate disappointment to sigh normally. However, it was not a problem yet. After all, if he had sent a Heavenly General to assist in the tournament, then the Holy Neo Emperor no doubt expected it would be a difficult fight. One loss was an expected casualty. Two would be an unwelcome headache. Three…

Alexandria would not lose. The Holy Neo Empire would not lose. And they <em>especially</em> would not lose to the Republic

Saber had hoped it would not be necessary to intervene so early on, but any notion that this would be an easy war had just proven to be hollow. If Alexandria was to prove victorious, they would need every advantage that they could get. The hero, on their quest to slay a monster, required a fitting weapon to perform such a deed.

With that in mind, Saber cleared their throat, and spoke once more.

<strong>”Ready the forge!”</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1033234816545587241 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1033234816545587241><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Oct-22 02:26 PM">14:26</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="color: rgb(32, 218, 241); background-color: rgba(32, 218, 241, 0.1);">@S4</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Automaton had worked ceaselessly for days on end to transform it, turning it into something that better fit the needs of ███████, a territory that truly suited their needs.

The bottom layer was the foundation, wrought of concrete and steel. Not only was it a solid base to build upon, but it also served as fortification, a sturdy wall to keep out any curious onlookers, an imposing barrier that stopped any potential trespassers in their tracks. Even a servant would have trouble breaking through the metres of reinforced iron and concrete. In fact, it was doubtful anything short of a Noble Phantasm could break it open.

The middle layer was the forge, a beating heart of fire and iron. This is where Saber spent most of their time, hard at work on a half-dozen different plots and plans. After all, the forge was not solely for smithing - rather, it served all purposes that ███████ needed it to. It was their paradise, a blessed place of solitude, where they could be at peace as they worked unimpeded. 

And then, there was the top layer, the tower reaching up to pierce the sky. On the outside, it was an impressive sight, a great spire emerging from the ground, stretching high to the heavens. On the inside, it was a minimalistic affair, a staircase that spiralled around and around until one finally reached the top. It provided an unparalleled view of Alexandria. Looking out from such height, one could see the entire city, were it not for the natural limitation of the human eye.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041373823615897600 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041373823615897600><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Nov-22 01:27 AM">01:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For their part, the citizens of Alexandria seemed to have adjusted to the change well.

Well, at least, that was the explanation that was going around Citynet. Nobody really knew where the name had originated from, but there had been plenty of heated discussions on Fatechan over the topic.

If one bought into said explanation, then right now, Saber was standing upon the pommel of the greatsword, the pinnacle of their fortress. The wind rushed against their back, their dirty red hair flowing freely upon the breeze. Slowly, they outstretched an arm, holding it out over the tower’s edge.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two flaps, interspersed with a singular, united one. A peregrine falcon landed on their arm before they could even take notice of their speed. Were they an enemy, they would have been cut down on the spot, but the leader always knew how to make their presence known.

A letter was in its beak, and now in their palms.

Even at such great height, even with the falcon still perched upon their arm, they stood there perfectly still, simply reading. Once they finished, they neatly folded the letter back up, reaching up to feed the bird of prey a cube of meat. At that, the falcon let loose a caw, before flying off, soaring through the air as it prepared for the long journey home.

That bastard hadn’t included the factory efficient data they’d asked for. What a shame.

Still, he had raised a good point. Saber had done much in the way of preparation, establishing their territory, setting up supply lines throughout the city, ensuring that the local government was aware of their full authority to act. There was little else to be done in terms of set-up. All that was left was to pay it all off.

The question was, how to do that?

Turning around, Saber began to descend the long spiralling staircase, leaving the apex of the tower and descending back to the forge. It was a long walk, which gave them plenty of time to think, to forge new strategies, mull them over, identify weaknesses, break them down, and forge them anew. By the time they reached the bottom, they needed a perfect plan, one that they could act upon immediately.

<strong>Alexandria had won the second round</strong>. That meant that, at the very least, there would be two more rounds. If they were to act, they’d need to do it before the fourth round, lest the tournament end with a 1-3 defeat. So, treat that as the deadline. Nine days to put these plans into motion. But what to do? What to do…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041374104701382738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041374104701382738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Nov-22 01:28 AM">01:28</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Idea one, simply destroy what presence the Republic had here. It would be effortlessly to scourge every last member of the enemy, to utterly and absolutely annihilate them. Pros: Quick, easy, and effective. Cons: Undesirable. An all-out war between the Holy Neo Empire and the Republic would certainly follow. No, to entertain the thought even a second longer would be foolish. If the Emperor had wanted a warmonger, they would have sent that <em>loud-mouthed preacher</em> to spearhead the invasion, not his blacksmith.

Idea two, use their position of power to disrupt the Republic. Interfere with their communication, sabotage their supplies, even assassinate their masters if the opportunity arose. Pros: Subtle. Hard to trace directly back to the Holy Neo Empire. Even if they could, it likely wouldn’t be enough to spark major retaliation. Cons: Republic was resourceful, resilient. They’d adapt to the circumstances, come up with more secure communication methods, source new supplies, and find new masters to fill slots in the tournament. It would slow them down, but it wouldn’t assure their defeat.

Idea three, support their allies to the best of their ability. Supply them with the finest tools in their armoury, furnish them with all the information they could ever need, enable them to fight in the limelight while remaining in the shadows. Pros: It risked no rebuttal from the Republic, for it was entirely beyond their hands. They could not fight back when Saber was not fighting them at all. So long as they had the means to reach the end, Alexandria had every chance of overcoming the odds. Cons: It meant putting the fate of Alexandria in the hands of its participants, the fallible humans and their egotist servants. Could they truly be trusted with such an important task?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1041374129103851580 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1041374129103851580><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Nov-22 01:29 AM">01:29</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Clank. Saber’s foot left the last of the spiral steps and hit the floor of their forge, the sound echoing throughout the chamber. Three plans, one unworkable, one too blunt to cut even the grass, and one that was sharp yet double-edged.

So be it. They would assist where they could, but ultimately, this was not their war to fight - it was up to the warriors of Alexandria and Republic alike to decide the victor. All they could try to do was tip the scales.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This? This was a mess.

The Heavenly General sat within their forge, holding their head in their hands, trying their very best to fight their oncoming headache. But despite their best efforts, it was a losing battle. Trying to predict and strategise had proven to be folly. Any effort to coordinate was akin to herding cats, a source of endless frustration and little progress. 

No. It was not all bad. It was simply mostly bad. Three pieces of news had reached their ears today, and each could be separated into a distinct category:

First, the good news - <strong>Alexandria had won the third round, bringing them to 2 wins, while the Republic lingered on 1</strong>. One step closer to victory, one step closer to repelling the invaders from their city, and ensuring their archives remained their own. But, this was not the end. They still needed to secure one more win before their triumph was official. There remained a distinct possibility that the Republic could claw back what they had lost, especially given the Bonding functionality of their frames. Here, in the last stretch, fuelled by the pride of two consecutive wins, was where Alexandria was at its most vulnerable. Still, they could not complain. 

Second, the bad news - The efforts to better arm the Alexandrian faction had gone worse than they had hoped. They proved dismissive, ungrateful, arrogant to the point of farce. To borrow a metaphor, it very much seemed that the city had lost control of its defenders. Honestly, it was doubtful it ever had control of them to begin with. Personal agendas had all but superseded any loyalty to their employer, a problem that the opposing Republic with their ruthless pragmatism had no issue with. What was the point of supplying them with arms with the minds holding them did not even understand the magnitude of this war?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048982933765103658 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048982933765103658><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:23 AM">01:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Last, the worse news. Perhaps it would even be fair to call it the worst news…

The Republic Embassy had been attacked by a Servant belonging to Alexandria. There were no deaths, but there were plentiful injuries, and the damage to the city was massive. It was a horrible situation that gave the Republic plenty of sway, while Alexandria was forced to kneel and apologise for the actions of a single rogue servant. But what else could they do? Even a single error here could jeopardise the entire tournament and lead to all out warfare.

Simply put, Saber’s hands were tied. They could do nothing right now, lest they risk escalating matters further. They just had to sit here, waiting and watching from the solitude of their tower.

Alexandria… Could you do it? Could you defeat the Republic, here and now? Or would this grudge carry to the bitter end?

Only time could tell.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seemed like yesterday when the tournament had started. When Republic first encroached into Alexandria&#39;s waters, many felt like it foretold the dawn of a new era. Sentiments were a lot different now, with many of Alexandria&#39;s citizens viewing the neighboring Republic boat as a piece of decorum. Time always healed all wounds.

But that same stress would return as the tournament started to reach its natural end. Much like the tail end of an election or the final round of any competition, the engagement was reaching its peak. Alexandrians were currently in high spirits because of their current win record, but the last round had muddied the waters a bit. Despair filled their heart once the most recent article of the news had been posted on the citynet.

<strong>BREAKING: FIGHT VIEWED IN FAVOR OF REPUBLIC!</strong>

<em>&quot;Contestant Nikolai representing Republic was, according to updated security footage, only 28 seconds away from the arena when Alexandria&#39;s Saber invaded the announcer room. According to the tournament rules section H.8, a contestant entering a staff only area without proper authority or permission results in an immediate disqualification. Therefore-&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;This round has been declared a Republic win.&quot;</strong>

Such a decision sparked unanimous outrage. Alexandrians could not believe how low Republic would stoop to obtain a win, along with losing faith in their own organizers for letting such a rule be put into place. One could find sympathy in both sides, but of course the citizens that were the most affected would not care about fairness.

The score was now tied, with Republic and Alexandria having an equal amount of wins. However, the fact that it was Republic catching up was throwing off Alexandrians from their rhythm. It had the telltale signs of a comeback into victory, which would have been the worst possible outcome.

How exactly would the last round end?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056723999968735323 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056723999968735323><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Dec-22 10:03 AM">10:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="color: rgb(32, 218, 241); background-color: rgba(32, 218, 241, 0.1);">@S4</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
