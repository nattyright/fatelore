Kun Wu tossed his laptop aside and rushed into the kitchen, where he found solace in a glass of cold water right from the tap. A couple of ice cubes followed, making their way from the fridge into the glass, then into his mouth. The youth crunched them with much satisfaction, feeling the cold making its way down to the pit of his stomach.

<em>What is wrong with Olympia and who&#39;s in charge of their weather dome?!</em> He complained vehemently in his head, throwing more ice cubes into his mouth. All it took was one glance at their weather forecast for the upcoming week, and Kun Wu already felt a sweat building up underneath his clothes. He was still in his inner garments, for Heaven&#39;s sake! They were supposed to be robes made with fabric that was both <em>light and breathable</em>! If even the mere thought of Olympia&#39;s blaring sun was giving him heatstroke, then how was he to march into that blasted city wearing his full ensemble?!

Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope. A hundred times nope and then some. The youth shook his head, half out of disdain and half out of brain freeze, then made his way back to the breakfast table, where the rest of his sumptuous feast of pork buns, fried dumplings and soy milk were waiting. 

&#39;<strong>Rider!</strong>&#39; Kun Wu called on his dear Servant while slamming a hand onto the table authoritatively...to grab a freshly steamed pork bun. &#39;I know this is the third time we&#39;ve changed plans since last night, but get ready for plan change number four. Olympia is once again a no-go, and this has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with how I couldn&#39;t pack my luggage in time, okay? For the time being, we are going to set up camp here in Delphi, and that is final.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The past week had been utterly dreadful for Ching Shih.

She was no stranger to taking care of babies. It was quite common actually. Taking care of the numerous employees at the flower boat she worked at was quite tiresome. She had to cater to people from all age groups, and she had even cared for children of her own.

Then why. Why was this spoiled brat so troublesome to manage?!

Despite her best attempts to cordially avoid it, Kun Wu forced her to watch his entire playlist of stage plays that he had done in the entirety of 2104. It was mindnumbing, to the point that she didn&#39;t even remember what had happened in those videos. All she remembered was flames, fireworks and strange looking creatures. Servants didn&#39;t need to sleep, but she still felt like a wreck after that prolonged torture.

Sometimes, she wishes she had been summoned as a Berserker.

But her tragedy didn&#39;t end there, because her Master was not only pushy and spoiled, but also fickle and impulsive. The past week she had been trying to discuss plans with him. After all, she had learned that he summoned her for a <strong>Holy Grail War!</strong> Truly, that was an incredibly high honor, and something that suited Ching&#39;s goals perfectly. All she needed to do was win the war...

...Which was easier said than done, considering that her Master refused to strategize with her and instead focused more on their upcoming performances. How infuriating!

This treatment was slowly taking its toll. Ching felt like she could snap Kun Wu like a twig at any point now...

That day was closer than it seemed.

Before she could relax and indulge in some traditional Chinese cuisine, Kun Wu descended to change plans for the sixty ninth time this week. She immediately employed her safety tactic to overcome the urge to choke her Master to death.</span>

&quot;Oh my, daring today, are we? There is such a thing as being <em>too</em> impulsive, milord.&quot; Ching said with a soft smile, closing her eyes and letting the pulsating vein next to her forehead speak for itself. Kun Wu knew that he was treading on ice.

&quot;But what could you possibly mean by setting camp in Delphi? If my understanding of the local geography is correct, we are already in Delphi, are we not? Were you perhaps thinking of moving apartments? I am not against the idea, mind you.&quot; Ching replied, sipping tea from a porcelain cup to ease her nerves.

No &quot;milord&quot; or any lord today.&#39; Kun Wu raised a finger and tut-tutted at his Servant, before lowering himself into a seat by the table. &#39;Did you not take a look at the list of titles I prepared for you? They are all taken from my past performances, here, I&#39;ll name a few of my favorites, and you can take your pick.&#39;

Kun Wu immediately assumed his favorite sitting position, pulling both legs up to his chest so that his knees were well visible above the table. It was one thing to relax oneself at home, but wasn&#39;t this a bit too much? Though Kun Wu himself was wholly unaware of his terrible table manners. It wasn&#39;t as if he had to share a dining table with anyone other than himself up till now! How could he possibly know?

Instead, the young Master took Rider&#39;s intense gaze as intrigue and started yet another bout of shameless, mind-numbing account of his list of amazing self-proclaimed titles. From the painfully obvious titles that immediately gave away his skills such as <em>The Fiery Star</em> or <em>General of the Holy Flames</em>, to presumptuous nicknames that didn&#39;t have anything to do with him at first glance such as <em>The Winged Tiger</em> or <em>The Cloud-soaring Dragon</em>, had Rider not known better, she might have started wondering whether she had been summoned by a playwright!

But, alas, she had already gotten a full tour of the whole apartment and saw the stacks upon stacks of books, scrolls, and boxed sets of fantasy series that Kun Wu made no effort to hide from her view. A playwright? She was dealing with someone much more unsophisticated than that!

&#39;-and that about sums up my top ten <strong>Are you even listening?</strong>&#39; Kun Wu snapped his finger to seize Rider&#39;s attention once more. &#39;Did you get enough sleep? I thought Servants don&#39;t need to sleep...don&#39;t tell me you are running low on mana again?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Yet again her Master was complaining about her choice of words, causing her to roll her eyes and attempt to ignore his antics. This tactic had so far led to mixed results: Sometimes Kun Wu would catch the hint and focus on his future stage plays instead of annoying her further, other times he&#39;d take insult to her shunning and double down on his rants.

This was a clear case of the latter, with Kun Wu focusing for an obsessive amount of time on the various titles he had been given (usually self proclaimed ones) throughout his long and expansive career. Each one sounded stupider than the last, with Ching unable to even concentrate on the sweet fragrance of the morning tea.

She reached her breaking point once Kun Wu realized that she had put her ears on mute. Instead, he attempted visual noise, snapping his fingers in front of her and dangling closer to her face. His face was now just inches away from hers as he simply begged for her attention.

And attention he would get.

With speed that surpassed that of a swallow, Ching&#39;s arm sped towards Kun Wu like a dagger shrouded in darkness. Were this blow meant to kill, Kun Wu&#39;s life would have ended in that instant.

Instead, the hand stopped right short of Kun Wu&#39;s mouth. Her fingers then delicately placed themselves on his lips, before pinching them and closing them shut.

&quot;On the contrary, milord: My beauty sleep was wonderful. For you see, <strong>it is the only time when those lips of yours take a rest.</strong>&quot; Rider said with a benign smile, while exerting even more pressure on her fingertips. Ouch!

&quot;I truly cherish those eight hours or so of peace and quiet. I only wish you could appreciate that as well...&quot; She said with a sigh before releasing her grip, hoping that her message was loud and clear.</span>

&quot;And do not worry about my mana reserves. As long as you yourself are well-fed, clean and swimming in wealth, I could ask for nothing more.&quot; Ching smiled, sounding genuine. Did she really care for the boy or was she just putting up an act? Kun Wu himself found it a mystery, but he knew for a fact that his Servant had no plans on betraying him...yet.

&quot;Now, let us return to the matters at hand.&quot; Ching took a sip from her cup. &quot;What was it about camping in Delphi?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Mm! Mmm mhmmm! Ow! Easy on the face, Rider! I can&#39;t go out wearing anything less than a 10 out of 10 today, and that includes my face!&#39; Kun Wu broke away from Rider as soon as he felt her grip loosen. He massaged his lips, which were, thankfully, only slightly tingly where her nails had begun to dig in. Perhaps if he left it along, it wouldn&#39;t be leaving a bruise like the other day...

&#39;Well, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. My audience loves my voice. Are you sure it&#39;s not just you who is picky?&#39; He heaved a dramatic sigh and retracted himself from Rider&#39;s immediate vicinity, retreating back into his seat while snatching two more pork buns from the steamer on the way. He started nibbling on the buns in silent protest, cushioning Rider&#39;s complaints with the fluffy texture of the buns and their juicy filling.

At least breakfast was delicious as always.

A sip of soy milk later and Kun Wu found himself working up an appetite. He went for some dumplings next, using his chopsticks in the rudest way known to man and <em>stabbing</em> into two dumplings simultaneously, as if he were wielding two spears of doom...

Then he froze. 

No, not because of how Rider&#39;s refined tea-drinking posture enlightened him on his own lack of elegance, but because his sensitive ears picked up on some interesting words. 

&#39;...Sounds like something my grandmama would say. I thought you quit being my maid 5 days ago.&#39; Kun Wu teased Rider from across the table. He raised his chopsticks - dumplings and all - and pointed it in her direction. 

&#39;As you can see, I feed myself very well! And rest-assured that I will feed you well too. I&#39;ve done my homework. I know you Riders tend to be the mana-hungry type, so I always keep some spare mana batteries on me just in case.&#39; He patted his waist, where his waist sash and an assortment of pouches would be tied to after he put on the rest of his outfit.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Though it seemed that Rider really could care less for mana for the time being. Not that he could complain, because a fully replenished Servant could only mean a job well-done for the Master. Kun Wu quickly gulped down the dumplings so he could get to answering Rider&#39;s real questions.

&#39;Well, Rider. I hate to break it to you, but after some last-minute research, it turns out that Olympia&#39;s weather conditions might be worse than I anticipated.&#39; The youth said with a serious tone. &#39;I don&#39;t know what the high seas was like for you back in your day, but here, in <em>our</em> time, the weather in every city is completely fake. It doesn&#39;t matter what season the world is going through - if there even is a season to speak of - but the temperature and humidity you are experiencing right now are all results of the corporate decisions made at the <span class="mention">#admin-building</span>.&#39; 

The youth pointed out the window and towards the mountainous skyline in the distance, where the CBD had taken root. A lone tower stood out in the very center; it was the tallest building in the CBD by far, overlooking every other skyscraper in the vicinity with its sheer height. It was hard to make out the details from the distance, but such an ostentatiously tall building must have served an equally pretentious crowd as well. 

&#39;See. I have no qualms with the way Delphi handles things. But Olympia&#39;s governor is taking it five notches too far. Their weather is going be above 30 degrees consistently over the next week!&#39;

Just talking about Olympia made him hot again. Kun Wu grabbed the takeout menu from the edge of the table, now using it to fan himself instead of ordering his breakfast.

So, rather than going to Olympia regardless and perish in their mucky summer heat,&#39; He brandished the takeout menu like his trusty iron fan, &#39;<strong>We will simply bring the fight here, to Delphi!</strong>&#39;

Kun Wu jumped up from his seat. He was getting way too worked up over this, but could Rider blame him? This was supposed to be his first battle as a Master, after all! He&#39;d been looking forward to this day all week!

&#39;All that preparation won&#39;t be for naught. We&#39;ll use every single piece of fireworks in our arsenal like the ultimate smoke signal and attract the Olympian Servants...or Masters, who knows! I bet some of them haven&#39;t ever seen a proper show of fire before, with all that smog hanging over their heads!&#39;

I&#39;d say I&#39;m far too lenient, if anything.&quot; Ching smiled back while eyeing Kun Wu suggestively, as if implying that he was lucky to not face her wrath. Complaints aside, however, she seemed to be satisfied with her Master&#39;s diet. It was healthy and balanced, exactly how she wanted it to be. Plus, it meant that she could feast on some scraps as well. Food wasn&#39;t necessary to a Servant, but the fact that she still had taste buds was amazing. She nibbled on a pork bun while Kun Wu lectured her, despite the significant gap in experience between the two.

&quot;I don&#39;t need to be a maid to pay attention to your health, milord. After all, were you to perish for no reason at all, I would be lacking a business partner.&quot; She stated matter-of-factly. 

&quot;I do appreciate your concern towards my well-being, but please do not think of it. Just mana batteries shall suffice.&quot; She said while glancing away, as if something else had caught her mind at the time. She stared at the apartment windows for a minute before Kun Wu finished his lecture on why summer was his most hated season of all time.

&quot;Oh, you were saying?&quot; Ching blurted out, showing that she had only half listened to Kun Wu&#39;s ramblings. The boy would most likely be irate at her lack of attention, but Rider replied with a giggle.</span>

&quot;I merely jest. I have to say, I dread a present where even the weather itself has been tamed by humanity. It is incredible, yet also incredibly scary. Back in my time, storms were often compared to Gods.&quot; Ching narrated, glancing back to the suspiciously large fish tank that was resting a few meters away in another room. Despite how tacky that item was, it did remind her of her current situation: She was a fish out of water, being dropped in an entirely new world that she had yet to experience. The Holy Grail&#39;s data chip had fed her information, sure, but it definitely wasn&#39;t enough to give her a clear picture of the modern world. She needed more research if she wanted to win the Holy Grail War.

<em>Along with several other resources.</em>

&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t mind a hot summer day. It was common during my voyages as well.&quot; Ching replied, having no qualms with Olympia&#39;s way of handling things. Her Master would most likely disapprove of her viewpoint, but before he could reply, Ching suddenly revealed a tablet from under the breakfast table. 

&quot;Plus, I just saw a peculiar outfit on sale on one of your mythical &#39;screens&#39;. I was about to purchase it for an occasion such as this...Or would you rather I wear a more traditional getup?&quot; She asked with a suggestive tone, shoving the tablet towards Kun Wu. The boy was completely taken aback: It was a swimsuit! A gold and white one! He could already envision his Servant in it...

Once again, Rider was mocking him at his expense. Kun Wu didn&#39;t know what to think about this...

Perhaps this was a way to get Kun Wu to shut up, since Rider&#39;s next words would be far less playful. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Hahah, the gods, huh?&#39; Kun Wu wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised to hear it coming from Rider. &#39;If they could knock some sense into Olympia, then I wouldn&#39;t mind giving them a serious prayer on New Year&#39;s day. But,&#39; He wagged a finger, &#39;As it stands, AC is infinitely superior. You&#39;ll grow to like them, I assure you.&#39;

Though ACs couldn&#39;t do anything to help with their journey into Olympia. It wasn&#39;t as if they just happened to have a dozen or so portable AC units lying around. The sheer stupidity of that idea aside, would a few machines really do much against a sauna on a citywide scale? 

What they needed wasn&#39;t a band-aid, but a solution on a more fundamental level...

Kun Wu studied the CBD&#39;s impressive skyline. An idea started to take shape.

&#39;Speaking of which, I haven&#39;t really shown you around the CBD yet, have I?&#39; He started making small talk, all the while pulling up a list of Delphi&#39;s most well-known banks in his head. &#39;There might be a way for us to fix Olympia&#39;s weather, all without needing to get involved personally. The price may not be pretty, but if I can use our status as leverage-?&#39; 

All manners of words died on his lips when a tablet - <em>his</em> tablet, to be precise - slid across the table and landed perfectly in his lap. The gadget was still warm and smelled faintly of sweet perfumes, while Rider smiled suggestively from across the table.

In a matter of seconds, Kun Wu came to all sorts of outrageous conclusions as to where the tablet had been before it was revealed. But even that couldn&#39;t compare to what happened after he took a look at its screen, which was brightly lit and centered deliberately on a piece of white and gold swimsuit cut perfectly to accentuate all the places that mattered...

Good thing his nasal blood vessels were healthy and strong, and thank the Heavens for his cool, air-conditioned suite. The inexperienced Master dropped the tablet and proceeded to grab his chilled water again, downing it in a few big gulps.

&#39;Now you&#39;re just having fun at my expense.&#39; He grimaced painfully, flipping the tablet over onto its back so that he didn&#39;t have to deal with the torment any longer. &#39;You turned down all my costume proposals, but you&#39;re willing to settle for a swimsuit? That&#39;s just cheating.&#39; He complained, now using the empty glass to cool his cheeks. &#39;At least get something that&#39;s not on sale. That&#39;s a clear sign they&#39;re just trying to get rid of dead stock...Ah.&#39;

His personal discomfort aside, was the swimsuit really such a bad idea? The issue of sunburn aside, wouldn&#39;t summer wear - or beach wear - be the most cost-effective solution to battling Olympia&#39;s weather?

Plus, they would be <em>oh so eye-catching.</em> It was practically free exposure, and who was Kun Wu to reject that? The abacus inside his head started clicking as the young Master carefully weighed both the drawbacks and benefits to Rider&#39;s suggestion...

&#39;<strong>Approved!</strong>&#39; After chuckling to himself for a good minute, Kun Wu finally gathered enough of his thoughts to deliver his final verdict. &#39;While unconventional, a swimsuit could be our secret weapon to battling Olympia&#39;s heat. You could have told me sooner, but no matter! Ditch the tablet - we&#39;ll head into the CBD later and look for something that complements us both.&#39;

&quot;Fun? Oh my, what could you ever possibly mean? I am merely offering business counseling.&quot; Rider said with a smug grin, trying to appear innocent and polite.

&quot;Plus, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a lot more tasteful than your other suggestions. Forgive my insolence, but I simply do not get the appeal of some of your costume choices. Like, an outfit with rabbit ears? <em>Really?</em>&quot; She teased him even more, before Kun Wu caught her off guard.

He accepted.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Ching looked flabbergasted. He wondered if her Master had gone mad from lust, but no. Once again, he was singlemindedly headed towards his objective. In other words, it was all related to his trivial issues with Olympia&#39;s weather.

<em>&quot;You are unbelievable.&quot;</em> Ching groaned inside of her head. It was true that young men had huge hopes and dreams, but Kun Wu went far beyond that. If he found anything worth milking or taking advantage of, he would do it. In a sense, they were very much alike.

Which is why seeing a reflection of yourself was haunting.

&quot;Hmph. Milord, sometimes I wish you could catch a hint.&quot; Ching said with a sigh. &quot;But I guess this is what I deserve. Feel free to buy some swimwear for us two.&quot; She shrugged, before hearing his suggestion about the CBD.

&quot;The CBD? Hmm. That <em>does</em> seem like an interesting place.&quot; A sparkle of curiosity appeared in her eyes. Ching was clearly very intrigued by Kun Wu&#39;s description of Delphi&#39;s shopping malls that she had heard several days ago.

&quot;Very well then. Shall we set sail?&quot; Rider asked, standing up from the table. It was clear that breakfast was over and that the day was about to begin for the two.

&quot;After you, milord.&quot; She persuaded him to lead the way. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He started wolfing down his breakfast in earnest. The CBD was full of venues to explore, but they didn&#39;t exactly have unlimited free time to spare, especially considering the fact that they still had to go around looking for enemy Masters. Would the shops even stay open long enough afterwards? 

Better stop thinking and start doing!

&#39;One minute!&#39; The youth shouted, then rushed to gather the rest of his belongings in record speed. It was amazing how he was able to discern fresh laundry from the rest, considering how haphazardly he dumped everything into messy piles. But perhaps Rider had already gotten used to that. After all, she was known for her adaptability...

&#39;Aaand done! How do I look?&#39; It took a bit longer than a minute, but Kun Wu finally appeared in front of Rider again in a more presentable manner, complete with his signature blue overcoat, silver gauntlets and leather gloves. And don&#39;t forget the iron fan, which he had folded with more care than the rest of his possessions and tucked away into his waist sash. It was the first time Rider had seen him in his stage outfit since her summoning. Did it spark memories of joy, or otherwise?

Her Master seemed to be chipper, at least.

&#39;I haven&#39;t done a lot of gigs in the CBD.&#39; He said with an air of excitement. &#39;It&#39;s too orderly for my tastes, but that&#39;s exactly why we&#39;ll be able to attract a huge crowd. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we run into an Olympia Master or two there.&#39; He grabbed the two boxes by the door and handed one over to Rider. &#39;Guard this with your life...until we make it to the <span class="mention">#shopping-center</span>. Since we&#39;ll be staying there anyway, might as well set up shop there first.&#39;
