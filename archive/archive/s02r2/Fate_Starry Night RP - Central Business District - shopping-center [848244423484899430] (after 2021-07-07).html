Dock worker or not, Ching Shih had already boarded Kun Wu&#39;s &#39;pirate ship&#39; by answering his summon in the first place. Though the summoning didn&#39;t come with an official contract, for one reason or another, she still found herself obliging her Master&#39;s whims on a daily basis. 

Today was no exception.

&#39;<strong>...Hrmmmmmmm.</strong>&#39;

This was the third time Rider had heard the youth sigh since they had gotten off the subway. The Master and Servant had been standing in front of a mall directory for the past five minutes, with the former taking his sweet sweet time agonizing over every inch of public space available around the shopping center.

&#39;The front plaza, or the food court? Maybe in front of the subway? Though that&#39;ll most likely cost me a ticket.&#39; Kun Wu pondered out loud, balancing his box on top of his head to shield himself from the morning sun. Even without a stage play, his outlandish outfit and Rider&#39;s otherworldly appearance were already starting to turn heads. 

It was the <em>wrong</em> type of attention, mind you, but at least Kun Wu wasn&#39;t wrong in his choice of locations. If their mere existence was enough to get people&#39;s attention, then just wait till they unloaded those boxes of fireworks...

<em>If</em> they even had the chance to unload the boxes, that is.

The clock kept ticking, yet Kun Wu was still analyzing the shopping center to hell and back. It seemed that he wasn&#39;t lying about not performing here often. Compared to the carefree way he roused the crowd and turned the whole market into his own stage, the level of caution he was displaying right now almost made Rider do a doubletake. Was she still dealing with the same brat that had been boasting about attracting crowds earlier?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Although they had only known each other for a week, Ching considered herself a good judge of character. To see Kun Wu act in a way that wasn&#39;t boisterous or irritating was a surprise, to say the least. He was preoccupied with inspecting every nook and cranny of the shopping center, thinking about where to place his stage, what types of plays to perform and much more.

All Rider could do was pray for him to come to a decision. Carrying a box around in her refined attire felt humiliating. Not to mention the distant gazes of the nearby passerby who had noticed the couple on their trek. It seemed like their outfits had attracted attention, albeit Ching was used to it at this point. She had experienced it in the past, so why change now?

Seeing Kun Wu scramble around was getting tiring, however. For a bold Master, he seemed to have issues actually going along with his plans.

&quot;Ahem, milord. I&#39;m not sure if it was apparent already, but I am getting quite tired of carrying a box around.&quot; Ching complained as she overheard his ramblings. &quot;You&#39;ve got an idea down? Then just <em>do it.</em> Simply do it, and the rest will come.&quot; She said, towering next to him as her Master was swiftly reminded of the difference in height and status between the two.

&quot;If you won&#39;t, then give me a tour of this so-called <em>shopping center.</em> It is not exactly a relic of my time.&quot; She suddenly changed the subject and focused on her own pursuits. What a selfish woman! Was Rider really so heartless to completely ignore his plight?

&quot;Perhaps, this tour might offer you ideas on your performances. Does anything catch your eye?&quot; She suggested out of the blue, much to Kun Wu&#39;s surprise. Leave it to Rider to find a compromise that left both parties satisfied. She was clearly interested in the shopping center, but spared no expense in finding a way to help her Master out.

Was this a pirate&#39;s generosity? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Wait, hold on, that wasn&#39;t it. She was a <em>Servant</em>. How was she tired already?

&#39;-On second thought, consider that offer rescinded.&#39; He quickly corrected himself lest his Servant actually dump the other box on him in favor of a bench somewhere else. Last he&#39;d checked, Rider&#39;s arms were as un-noodly as they could get! She couldn&#39;t possibly think that he wouldn&#39;t catch on to such an obvious excuse!

Kun Wu eyed his Servant suspiciously, wondering what devious plans she had been cooking up. However, Rider remained surprisingly candid this time round, wasting no time to lecture him on his indecisiveness while simultaneously offering an alternate plan of her own...

&#39;Come on, no need to throw me a bone here. You just want to shop-&#39; Kun Wu ribbed his Servant. 

<em>Crap. Did negotiations break down?</em>

&#39;-But so do I!&#39; The young Master continued unabashedly, grinning from ear to ear. He seemed to have perked up quite a bit after Rider&#39;s small pep-talk-slash-coercion. &#39;Were you worried about me? I thought you only liked to tease.&#39;

It was unfortunate that Kun Wu had remembered that his Servant had no issues with stamina, since Ching was looking forward to dumping all menial work on him. The box was now her eternal companion.

Not that it mattered, since Kun Wu&#39;s cheery reaction caught her attention more. &quot;Shop? I prefer calling it sightseeing, if you really intend on demeaning my intentions. But I&#39;m glad that you approve.&quot; She teased Kun Wu back, his accusations simply rubbing off her skin.

&quot;Plus, you are still my contractor, are you not? I&#39;ll let you know that no man has ever accompanied me on business trips without a huge smile on their faces. To end this habit just because you&#39;re feeling a bit mopey would be tarnishing my name, you know?&quot; Ching responded, elegantly maintaining her dignity without revealing that she simply wanted to cheer the boy up.

&quot;So, do not disappoint me, milord.&quot; Rider said with much assertiveness, before her eyes immediately glanced elsewhere. 

&quot;Can we start the tour now? It&#39;s important to be efficient with our time.&quot; She said, already sizing up the various shops, restaurants, stores and businesses that surrounded the shopping district. The glint in her eyes felt familiar to Kun Wu, reminding him of that of a child experiencing something new. It seemed like the tigress was a fan of observing new places, <em>especially</em> if they leaned towards the commercial side... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;I wasn&#39;t mopey!&#39; Kun Wu hastily corrected Rider, &#39;I was just, er, weighing my options. Unlike the markets, I don&#39;t exactly know the city center like the back of my hand. So it&#39;s even more crucial that we know our surroundings!&#39; He defended himself, but it was evident from his expressions that he had been made painfully aware of his unnecessary dawdling. The CBD may be huge, but the shopping center was only a single landmark. What was he so nervous about?

&#39;Well, I suppose we&#39;ll be fine, especially when I have you.&#39; The youth said cryptically, but elaborated no more. &#39;You suggestion is sound. The inside is one of my top picks as well. It&#39;s well air-conditioned, the ceiling&#39;s high, and I just finished memorizing the map.&#39; 

As he said so, Kun Wu leaned into the shopping directory to take one last, hard look. Oho. Was he studying up on the various shops already? Since when had he become so attentive to Rider&#39;s needs?

&#39;...We&#39;ll take the elevator to the fifth floor and work our way down from there.&#39; Kun Wu pointed upwards, where a massive sky bridge sat overlooking the shopping center, all the while connecting the few main buildings from opposite sides of the street. A few glass tubes protruded from the walls at all sides...

Upon closer inspection, each tube seemed to house a moving vehicle that rose and fell at a constant speed. It wouldn&#39;t take Rider long to figure out what they were despite their unusual appearance, however. After all, she had already been exposed to similar mechanisms since day 1.

Elevators. 

To be more precise, <em>scenic</em> elevators built into the side of the building, with glass for walls, allowing for an unobstructed view of the city streets below. Some would call it romantic. Others would call it a test of courage, seeing how well the glass had been maintained so as not to show a speck of dust and turning the rides almost fully transparent.

He thumbed towards the glass tubes, hardly suppressing a smile.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Ohohoho.&quot; Rider chuckled at Kun Wu&#39;s expense. For all of his airs and confidence, he was still a boy. A cute one at that, especially when it came to looking embarrassed.

&quot;I see, I see. You are very astute indeed. It is flattering to see you entrust such confidence in me.&quot; She said in an attempt to reassure him, but it was painfully obvious that she was faking it from her muffled giggles. While this would normally cause more embarrassed reactions, Kun Wu had now switched gears and was inspecting the shopping mall from top to bottom. Perhaps Rider&#39;s incitement had gotten him excited, or maybe he just wanted to pander after her friendly gesture.

Either way, his attitude kept Ching warm. After a long and trouble history filled with blades and deceit, it was refreshing to be paired with such a simpleminded Master.

Perhaps not <em>everything</em> about Kun Wu was bad. Hopefully.

&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s how it looks like from the outside?&quot; Ching said with a hint of curiosity in her eyes, observing the carefully crafted glass tubes that held the ascending and descending elevators. Humanity had progressed a lot in the past years, even when faced with the brink of destruction.

&quot;Something like this would have definitely been useful in my time! Perhaps, ship masts would have become obsolete...&quot; She thought in her head, thinking about how to apply this modern day invention to her distant past. Her thoughts were interrupted once her tour guide told her of their plan.

She nodded in approval.

&quot;Please, who do you take me for? The skies are nothing compared to the seas.&quot; She boasted, before placing an arm around his shoulder, catching him off-guard as his Servant now inched closer to him.

&quot;Take me wherever you please, milord. I am completely in your hands...so long as you make it interesting, of course.&quot; She said rather suggestively, fully placing her trust into Kun Wu, at least when it came to sightseeing. What better way to experience Delphi than to ask a local, after all?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu tensed up as Rider snaked her arm around him. From experience, such intimate gestures had never boded well for him. The vast majority of the time, it meant that he had somehow gotten on Rider&#39;s nerves, and a hard pinch on the face was on the horizon.

Well, it was either that, or an endless bout of teasing.

Today seemed to be the latter.

But that didn&#39;t make it any better. By the time Rider finished her sweet talks, Kun Wu&#39;s face ended up red as a tomato all the same. It must have felt like a walk in the park, dealing with a simpleton Master like him. Chin Shih didn&#39;t even need to employ half her tricks while working at the flower boat to wrap her Master around her little finger...

&#39;Ahem. Rider...I am aware that you are a head taller, but that is <em>not</em> an invitation to lean on me so much.&#39; Kun Wu retorted quietly, then started shrugging himself out of Rider&#39;s grasp. &#39;You have appointed me as your tour guide. Not your personal walking stick.&#39;

He started for the elevator, then stopped and fidgeted some more.

&#39;If you really must...we can hold hands.&#39;

I am merely making myself comfortable. Or do you find my presence unpleasant?&quot; She teased him further, letting him slowly escape from her grasp with a face redder than a beet. He anxiously pressed for the elevator button, shaking and fidgeting like a pile of jello.

Rider would have left things there, had her Master not blurted out something else by pure impulse. His embarrassed face and shaky hand was all she needed to know. Such an innocuous request, to hold hands. His attempt to appear confident despite his current state was too sweet to ignore. Adorable, even.

&quot;Mmmmm.&quot; Ching chirped, gazing at Kun Wu with a teasing smirk as if taunting him further. &quot;Is that what you would prefer, milord?&quot; She asked with a giggle. This boy&#39;s sincerity just made her want to mess with him further. Alas, all things were best in moderation.

&quot;If you insist.&quot; She took initiative, swiftly wrapping her fingers around his hand and dragging him closer to her.

<em>DING!</em>

Their ride had arrived.

&quot;You ought to be a bit more confident though. Surely you don&#39;t expect me to drag you around by the hand?&quot; She laughed while gently moving Kun Wu&#39;s hand around. &quot;I&#39;m waiting.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;<em>Grrrrr,</em>&#39; Kun Wu ground his teeth as Rider swung his hand this way and that. What was he, a kid, or a pet dog? He twisted his hand out of her grasp, then wrapped it around her wrist as if to one-up her on her antics. &#39;No. <em>This</em> is what I prefer,&#39; He reasserted himself, though the effect was lost on his flustered face. &#39;I was just being polite!&#39;

The youth took great strides and pulled them both into the elevator, elbowing the fifth floor&#39;s button on the way. It was hard to balance his box on one hand, but he couldn&#39;t possibly ask Rider for help now! The youth looked around the inside of the elevator, then spotted handrails installed on the sides.

Perfect.

Without further ado, he stacked his box on top of the handrail, using the beam for support all while having his other hand clamped tightly around Rider&#39;s. There was no way he was going to let go this early. After all, a victory was meant to be savored no matter how small it was. <em>Even if</em> if was one that had been handed to him like a present. 

And so Kun Wu held onto Rider out of pure stubbornness, doing his best with one free hand as he started rummaging through the box&#39;s contents. 

Fortunately for Rider, the transparent elevator wall allowed her to enjoy the street view in all directions despite having her movements restricted. Though for some reason, despite only heading up a few floors, it felt as if her vantage point was a lot higher than that. Olympia was known for its multitude of factories, but from a distance, even its tallest smokestacks looked dwarfed in comparison...

&#39;Are you still opposed to wearing rabbit ears?&#39; Kun Wu suddenly asked. It seemed that he had finished perusing the box&#39;s contents and was now holding a suspicious looking package with a rabbit icon on it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The awkward flick of the hand followed by a longing grab towards her wrist caused Ching to twitch a bit. She sighed and relaxed once she realized that Kun Wu was just falling for her teasing.

&quot;Hehe. How bold. Well, I have no qualms with that.&quot; Rider snorted, unable to contain her laughter when Kun Wu was doing a great job at embarrassing himself. She was unsure on whether she would ever get tired of teasing him.

With no more witty retorts, Kun Wu dragged Rider inside the elevator and the latter happily followed suit. The doors closed as the two were transported above, observing the gigantic skyline and neighboring buildings from their vantage point. It was a breathtaking view, far beyond anything Ching Shih had seen in her life as a pirate. To think that humans had went from traveling by sea to conquering the skies...It was truly mesmerizing.

She remained silent for a bit, as if taking in the view and fully absorbing it. Her feet tensed up a bit, part of her wishing that she were navigating those layers of streets and alleys. She snapped back to the present once Kun Wu asked her another innocuous question.

&quot;...This again?&quot; She sounded disgruntled. &quot;Forgive me, milord, but I simply do not get the appeal of that outfit. I can understand the leggings and the top...but the ears? What type of self-respecting individual would wear that sort of headpiece?&quot; She asked in disbelief, unsure on whether modern fashion trends her evolved or degenerated.

&quot;...Does it appeal to <em>you</em>, however?&quot; She said while narrowing her eyes, as if judging Kun Wu&#39;s intentions. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

She <em>had</em> just ridiculed him on the outfit over breakfast, which wasn&#39;t all that long ago. Though he thought he&#39;d try again now that Rider seemed to be in a better mood...

Clearly that plan had fallen through.

But he&#39;d come far. Far enough to even bring the outfit with him. It would be a waste to not keep trying until the very end.

&#39;That&#39;s why it&#39;s called a <em>costume</em>,&#39; He insisted, &#39;You&#39;re not supposed to wear it all the time, obviously.&#39; He gave his box a light rap. &#39;It&#39;s all part of work! Did you even read the script I prepared for you? I thought a rabbit costume would only be fitting, considering today&#39;s theme-&#39;

<em>DING!</em>

The elevator chimed for a second time, signaling their arrival to the fifth floor at this very inopportune time. However, Kun Wu was far from done. With the sky bridge only meters away, he decided that now was the time for a last-ditch attempt at persuading Rider to do his bidding. 

&#39;Maybe you don&#39;t like it because you&#39;ve never seen it during your time. People&#39;s tastes change, Rider. Are you one hundred percent sure that you don&#39;t find it cute <em>at all</em>? Not even a little bit? Hmm?&#39; As if to further entice Rider, Kun Wu pulled the rabbit ears out of the package and stuck it on his own head to demonstrate. &#39;Is it really so bad? Or are you simply not used to-come on, let&#39;s get out and talk outside.&#39;

He dragged them both out before the elevator doors could close on them and started down the path to look for a bench. The fake rabbit ears bobbed up and down on his head along with his ponytail...what a sight to behold.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While Ching hoped that her assertiveness would stop Kun Wu from suggesting further idiocies, it could not be further away from the truth. It was common for youngsters to be immature, and immature people would usually double down on their demands. Kun Wu took a page from Rider&#39;s book and attempt to persuade her further with small talk.

&quot;Oh please. I think my current outfit suits me perfectly, milord. Plus, I fail to see what sort of theme or celebration this so-called <em>costume</em> could contribute to. Certainly nothing elegant.&quot; She roasted him to bits, just in time for the elevator to open and for the two of them to leave.

But Kun Wu went even further beyond, taking the ultimate gambit and sacrificing his dignity. Without further ado, he opened the package and...put the bun ears on.

....

Ching stared at him in disbelief, wondering if she had been summoned by a jester. Indeed, it looked like Kun Wu was already performing a play of his own, the mere act of walking around causing his ears to bob left and right. A hypnotic dance that would enchant most, yet Rider was unfazed. This wouldn&#39;t convince her. Not one bit!

<em>boing boing</em>

&quot;....&quot; She just glared at him, causing Kun Wu&#39;s blood to run cold. He wondered if it was disgust or contempt, or a combination of both. Did he perhaps go too far? The two were still tied together by hands, so he managed to get a closer view of her face.

Wait, she wasn&#39;t glaring. She was...blushing?

&quot;...Of all the stupid things I&#39;ve seen recently.&quot; She started blabbering to herself, before nervously coughing and regaining her composure.

&quot;<em>Ahem</em>, I see a glimpse of the appeal now, but I&#39;m still not fully sold on it. If you intend to show the full worth of this costume, then <strong>why not fully wear it?</strong> Go on, I&#39;m patient.&quot; She said out of the blue. Kun Wu was now her test subject? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the group reached the shopping center, Nietzsche couldn’t help but feel a little giddy at the sight of the structure. He was amused by the technological advancements humanity had made in such a short time relative to his death. It seemed sometime after his passing, a golden age of technology had been ushered in. Surely the surplus of products and brands in a place like this was due to the marvels of modern-day transportation and the ability to both import and export goods at speeds never before seen. He wanted nothing more than to walk around the shopping center and study how the modern-day person interacted with their environment. However, he and Rinne were here on business. The nosey philosopher let out a sigh clenching the pen and notepad Rinne had given him earlier. His studies would have to wait for now; It was more important that team Caster located Kun Wu as fast as possible.

One thing Nietzsche did have time to observe, however, was his Master. He turned his attention towards Rinne, trying to get a grasp of how she went about a routine investigation. Surely someone like a charismatic street performer would be no trouble for a trained professional to track down. 

“Master I have a request, id appreciate if we could track down our target as fast as possible. I’d like to take the day to interact with the common person. I may have been imparted with basic knowledge of this world, but I’d love to speak to people around this mall if possible.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The lack of response was disconcerting. 

Kun Wu would never do anything without good reason. He was fully convinced that Rider just needed a little nudging in the right direction. Namely, to actually see someone wear the rabbit ears and realize how harmless and adorable it could be. 

What he hadn&#39;t expected was utter silence.

The last time he got the silent treatment, his left cheek ended up swollen and bruised for days. Had he managed to incur her wrath again? So soon? Would now be a good time to plan his own funeral?

&#39;We can always talk this out,&#39; He started going for a more diplomatic approach, but then Rider did the unthinkable.

She blushed. 

And coughed.

And avoided his gaze as she started <em>bargaining</em>, turning the tables on him by demanding a <em>full</em> demonstration of the new costume. Her words were shrewd and her reasoning was flawless, but even as she delivered her ultimatum, Kun Wu couldn&#39;t stop himself from grinning.

&#39;Wait a second. Don&#39;t tell me...you&#39;ve come around?&#39; Without waiting for an invitation, Kun Wu shoved his face, fake ears and all, right in front of her. The fluffy ears were coming in dangerously close to her face now...

&#39;Is that a proper challenge?&#39; He asked, a bit more seriously now. &#39;You know, you should never say things you don&#39;t mean, especially around me. I take business proposals very seriously. If showing a bit of skin is all I have to do to get you on board, then you&#39;ve got a deal. So now the question becomes, can you uphold your end of the bargain?&#39;

Initially, she had held her ground, but with Kun Wu trying his best to convince her to give in, she wasn&#39;t exactly sure on what to say.

It got even worse as he approached dangerously close to her, just a head away from her face as he gave her the puppy eyes treatment. You would think he was a dog more than a rabbit.

&quot;Look. I only said that if you plan on marketing something, then you should do it correctly. I never said whether I would oblige or not.&quot; Ching scoffed, puffing out air and glancing away from Kun Wu. She appeared to seem insulted, but in reality she just wanted to avoid staring at Kun Wu&#39;s eyes. It reminded her of her children, especially when they were asking to be spoiled with sweets or treats. Kids could be vicious and tenacious at times and Kun Wu was on par with them in terms of wit.

He backed that wit with his business knowledge, which he had accumulated through his experiences hosting performances through his showman persona. Rider could easily see through his schemes. She wouldn&#39;t go down without fighting back, at the very least.

&quot;Hmph. Why would I ever settle for a bargain that does not benefit me in the slightest? If anything, you are the only one gaining something out of this, milord.&quot; Ching pointed out. &quot;That does not seem to be a fair business transaction. Therefore, if you really intend to have me perform in such a ridiculous getup, then it is only fair for you to do the same. Are you truly willing to perform in...that?&quot;</span>

She started poking at his bunny ears. They bounced so responsively at the slightest touch.

&quot;....&quot; She kept staring at them for a while before shaking her head. &quot;Well? Surely you don&#39;t expect me to wear an outfit that my own Master wouldn&#39;t wear?&quot;

While this very intellectual talk occurred in the distance, Rider and her Master would be unaware to the presence of Caster in the same building. They were most likely on different floors and had yet to detect each other, but it was very plausible for them to meet one another at any time... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

Now... Where to start?

This place was huge! Looking for a certain pair of people, as much as they might stand out, would be no easy task. Rinne came to a halt in front of a map, a large diagram that offered directions to your destination... If you could decipher it.

&quot;Mm. There.&quot; Rinne put a finger to a seemingly random place on the map. &quot;If I were a street hustler looking to attract a crowd, that&#39;s where I&#39;d go. See, based on the floor plans here, it seems that just following the flow will have you end up here at some point, no matter what entrance you come through. It&#39;s a good place to start, at least. Bunch of popular stores, too.&quot; The investigator made the astute observation after mere seconds of looking at the convoluted mall map. 

Rinne snuck a glance at Nietzche. To be honest, she hadn&#39;t actually calculated any of that stuff. The name of a store had been visible in the photo she&#39;d saved to memory. She just wanted to impress her servant with what seemed to be some Sherlock Holmes-esque deductive ability. Since Caster would be able to sense a rival servant if they got close, the exact location didn&#39;t matter... A genius scheme to make herself look good in front of a real genius, if she did say so herself.

And she was gone. Rinne disappeared into the crowd of shoppers, heading towards her destination at a quick pace. Waiting for others didn&#39;t seem to be a habit of hers. Was it that she was just used to working alone, or did she not want to be around her Servant? Whatever it was, Nietzche would have to hurry if he didn&#39;t want to lose his Master in this giant, crowded facility.

Are you my Servant, or not? Everything that I stand to gain, you are welcome to partake as well. Unless you&#39;re insinuating that I can&#39;t wear the costume as well as you can...&#39;

&#39;Well, that&#39;s just speculation. Baseless speculation, if I may add.&#39; He lectured Rider with a pout, as if she had just hurt his feelings. &#39;It may be a bit unconventional, but do not underestimate the skills of a performer. I take pride in that.&#39;

So far, his last stand approach had failed spectacularly. Although the puppy dog eyes and the fluffy ears had swayed Ching to some degree, she was still far too experienced to let it cloud her judgement. The stalemate continued; it seemed that Kun Wu still had a long way to go in the art of persuasion...

But that wasn&#39;t to say all hope had been lost. 

&#39;So long as we both wear the same thing, is it?&#39;

Kun Wu started chuckling. Ominously. He dropped everything he&#39;d been holding aside from the suspicious package, then reached in...

...And pulled out a <em>second</em> pair of rabbit ears.

&#39;I heard your conditions loud and clear, Madame.&#39; Using Ching&#39;s momentary distraction from the presence of not just one, but <em>two</em> pairs of ineffably cute and fluffy objects, Kun Wu easily invaded her personal space and proceeded to stick the second pair of fake rabbit ears on her head. 

He stepped back to admire his handiwork. Who&#39;d have thought that a change as simple as a new piece of headgear worked wonders to engage the imagination? While the bun ears simply looked like comical stage prop on Kun Wu&#39;s head, it managed to blend seamlessly with Rider&#39;s hair, making it look as if she&#39;d always had them.

&#39;Even without the full costume, you&#39;re already looking the part. Was that so hard?&#39; Kun Wu reveled in his tiny accomplishment. &#39;Now we&#39;re even. Any complaints?&#39;

A distraction was enough for the shrewd performer to immediately hop, skip and jump like an agile rabbit. He placed his second headpiece on Ching and retreated back to avoid any sudden slaps. By the time Ching had realized what was going on, it was too late. She touched around her hair and felt something soft and bouncy flap left and right.

&quot;You...You...!&quot; Ching growled, her bunny ears looking more like horns as she glared at Kun Wu with contempt. The boy graciously lectured her about her choice of words and how she should have perhaps been less specific. They also seemed to be rather impressed by her look, going as far to compliment her and attempt to persuade her yet again.

Ching seemed ready to spank Kun Wu at any moment, but then she remembered that she was in a public place, plus people were already staring at the two due to their bunny ears and Ching&#39;s out of place outfit. If a fight broke out between the two, the authorities might get involved...

She snarled, then gulped and swallowed her rage, albeit temporarily. &quot;When we get home, you&#39;re going to pay me back in <strong>full.</strong>&quot; Rider declared with murderous intent while her bunny ears perked up. Despite how serious she sounded, Kun Wu could not help but stare at her ears. Their movement seemed to match Rider&#39;s emotions, which was something he had never seen before. She was truly a natural! If only she realized her true potential...

&quot;And stop staring!&quot; She caught on to his gaze and waved her arms around, as if trying to block his view. Despite her attempt, Kun Wu could clearly see her face covered in red. Seemed like the fluffy ears had gotten her embarrassed. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If looks could kill, Kun Wu would&#39;ve died a hundred times over in the span of a few seconds. A murderous aura emanated from Rider&#39;s body, and Kun Wu wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted to test it. 

Though, despite everything, the bun ears bobbed and swayed above Rider&#39;s head as if they had already become a part of her. Kun Wu&#39;s eyes couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to them. How was she doing it? Magecraft? An innate skill? He&#39;ll have to ask her about that later. When she wasn&#39;t so keen to strangle him, that is.

Regardless, it seemed that being out in public had ultimately saved his bacon. As much as she had wanted to admonish him to her heart&#39;s content, Rider was forced to keep her seething fury at bay to keep up a modicum of appearance in front of the other shoppers. 

Or perhaps it wasn&#39;t all fury. Was she trying to hide her face? Was that a...blush?

No way. NO. WAY. He couldn&#39;t believe it. Rider actually <em>liked</em> those ears?

An unexpected development for sure, but Kun Wu wasn&#39;t about to look the gift horse in the mouth.

&#39;I like you better when you are earnest. Death threats or otherwise. You should be more honest!&#39; He said cheekily, then grabbed Rider&#39;s hand and led her towards the sky bridge. What is this? Were he and Rider seriously going to tour the shopping center while wearing matching headpieces?

People were already staring at them.

Yet Kun Wu soaked up the attention like a sponge, responding to their stares with a smug grin. It seemed that he was much more used to dealing with people as opposed to Rider&#39;s teasing. Or maybe he had already slid into his performer persona and was playing it up for drama...

He stopped at the foot of the bridge. Rider felt his grip slacken, then the youth turned and pressed a stack of posters into her hands.

Come back up here after you&#39;re done. After all, you are supposed to be the star of today&#39;s show: a retelling of the legend of the moon rabbit!&#39;

He grabbed a poster from the top of the stack and brought it up for Rider to see: a giant moon in the center, a horde of bunnies dancing around it, complete with tacky gold lettering indicating the show&#39;s runtime (3 times over the course of a week) and a photo of him in the lower right corner, raising both hands up in a double thumbs up posture. Where did he find inspiration for such an insipid poster and when did he find the time to print it? Had he always had a stack of them in storage?

&#39;Well? Do you see my genius plan now?&#39; Kun Wu&#39;s eyes sparkled.

He made sure to savor this moment, teasing Rider before dragging her around like they were partners in crime. Ching&#39;s ramblings, combined with the dance of bunny ears, were enough to attract the attention of the nearby crowds. This only served to embarrass Rider further.

It was a delight, to see the normally composed Ching Shih be reduced to a bumbling mess as she pondered on how to escape the public eye. To be seen in this state was utterly humiliating, yet her Master didn&#39;t seem to care. Why, they were enjoying the attention even!

Before Ching could regain her composure and attempt to fight back against Kun Wu&#39;s ploys, the latter immediately proceeded with the next stage of his master plan. A gigantic stack of advertisement papers landed in Rider&#39;s arms, feeling heavier than the box somehow. The purpose of these posters was obvious.

&quot;...Work?&quot; Rider repeated in disbelief, before taking a good look at the ads and understanding what Kun Wu was scheming. &quot;You...You want me to go around wearing <em>these</em> and asking them to come to your show?!&quot; She snarled as her ears perked up in rage.</span>

&quot;Chang&#39;e is rolling in her grave!&quot; She spat back, showing her disapproval. Of course, she couldn&#39;t take things further, since the crowd from earlier had now gotten even closer, almost as if they already thought a play had started.

&quot;<em>Grrrrr</em>&quot; Ching growled in a manner reminiscent of Kun Wu from just a few moments ago. She so dearly wanted to &#39;discipline&#39; her Master, but doing it in public would just attract unwarranted attention.

She sighed and shook her head as her bunny ears drooped down. She divided the posters into two halves and forcibly shoved one half towards Kun Wu.

&quot;I&#39;m not doing all of them. Do the rest yourself. Now get out of my sight, <em>milord.</em>&quot; She said that last bit with a scoff, before starting to walk away in a hurry.

Rider split the posters and slapped him with half of it, demanding that he share the workload too. She then escaped in a hurry, as if she couldn&#39;t bear to deal with her Master&#39;s idiocy any longer. 

Just who was getting out of whose sight?

Kun Wu scratched his head.

&#39;Okay then. I&#39;ll try not to get in your way, I suppose!&#39; He called out after Rider or, more specifically, the pair of rabbit ears that was clearly visible above the crowd. At least he would be able to easily keep track of Rider this way. If she was starting from this side of the bridge, then he would just cover the other.

Though he doubted he&#39;d be able to attract as many people as Rider could. The only reason he had put on the rabbit ears in the first place was to rope Rider into doing the same. He simply wasn&#39;t cut out to play a convincing moon bunny, let alone using it as bait to draw people to his show...

Which meant that it was fine for him to take some shortcuts, right?

Kun Wu hurried to the center of the sky bridge and looked over the railing on to the lower levels. It was still morning time, yet the shoppers and tourists were starting to show up to begin their day of fun. A few eateries had even started to gather small crowds waiting in line for their grand opening of the day. 

He surveyed the ground floor next. There was no annoying water fountain in sight, and no food stalls yet to introduce unwanted fire hazards. In other words, none of his precious posters would get soaked, burnt, or used as emergency napkins by the local hotdog stand. 

Everything had lined up <em>perfectly</em>.

A giant ball of fire shot up into the ceiling, blocking out the florescent light and drenching the rest of the shopping center in a shade of orange, then exploded. A brilliant burst of flame followed, resembling a flower opening rapidly into bloom, before showering the rest of the building in its huge flaming petals. 

The shoppers on the topmost floors had it worst, having to witness the fireball explode directly overhead. But before any of them could even remember to panic, the petals had already landed on their faces and left them with...nothing but a tacky poster that was lukewarm at best and slightly damp to the touch. It <em>was</em> still on fire, mind you, but rather than the poster itself, it seemed to be using whatever the paper had been drenched in as fuel. Once that fuel had burned up, the flame died as well.

<em>COME TO THE SHOW</em> The poster said. <em>IT&#39;LL BE THE MOST AMAZING THING YOU&#39;VE EVER SEEN</em> It promised. With the moon and bunnies and the tiny guy doing his double thumbs up in the corner, who could possible doubt these words?

Up above, Kun Wu busied himself with running all over the sky bridge, lining up his fireworks and tying them to the bridge&#39;s railings. He was going to kick off the show as soon as Rider finished distributing her posters!

She didn&#39;t want to stare at Kun Wu ever again for the rest of the day, so the best way of guaranteeing that was to head to a different floor. She entered and left for the fourth floor, using the quiet time inside of the glass tube to regain her composure.

&quot;Keep calm, keep calm. It&#39;s just a dumb, little kid. Don&#39;t let him get to you.&quot; She repeated to herself, squishing her face and cheeks in order to snap herself back to reality. It seemed to work...until she saw her rabbit ears bounce left and right from her mood swings. That frustrated her further, to the point that she was tempted to rip off the headpiece and toss it out. She wrapped her fingers around the ears and...

And...

&quot;Ungh.&quot; She groaned, relenting at the last second. She stared at her own reflection on the glass tube, specifically at the ears. She felt disgruntled, defeated even. She couldn&#39;t admit it, but...

Those ears, did look somewhat <em>cute</em> on her. Perhaps she had misjudged Kun Wu&#39;s intentions?

No! Admitting that now would be utterly shameful, especially when it came to a relationship of mutual trust and respect. Being a laughingstock was the exact opposite of having a respectful relationship.

Instead, she should simply work hard like her Master had ordered her to. Advertise his foolish performance, ignore the stares of the crowds and maintain her dignity. If she acted as professional and eloquent as always, then Kun Wu would have no chance to fault her.</span>

With this newfound confidence, Ching pumped herself up and left the elevator with her usual, scheming look. She completely ignored the gazes of the passerby near her, hypnotized by her figure and ears. Instead, she focused on the task at hand. She wasn&#39;t going to let a brat beat her!

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; She whispered gently as she entered a rather busy store. More people meant more spectators at the show, after all. &quot;do you mind if I set a few posters outside of your store? I promise that they will not intrude on your business~&quot;

The store clerk would initially tell her to buzz off, but one look at her was enough to completely wrap him around her finger. He was flabbergasted, not only by the woman&#39;s radiant beauty, but the icing on top that were those glorious bunny ears. Ching didn&#39;t realize it, of course, merely finding them cute. But she didn&#39;t know the dark desires of men, who would give anything to see women in suggestive headgear such as that...

&quot;B-But of course, miss! Feel free to place as many posters as you want. Also, do you mind exchanging numb-&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Ching said with a bright smile before immediately plastering a few posters on the store front and immediately leaving. Time for the next target!

She kept doing this for numerous stores, attracting more and more attention with each successful shill. This, of course, had its drawbacks. Eventually, she might bite off more than she could chew... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche nodded along as Rinne gave a deep analysis of Kun Wu’s most likely location. It seemed her attempt to impress her servant had worked. Nietzsche considered himself to be rather adept at deciphering the human mind, but Rinne was something else! Could she tell so much about a person just from a file that she read on her computer? If only Nietzsche knew that his Master was bluffing to garner his praise.

“That is quite perceptive Master! I am most impressed by your detective&#39;s intuition.” As Nietzsche finished giving out his praise, he would look down only to see his Master missing. She had gone on without him! Nietzsche took a moment to shuffle through the crowd. Nietzsche let out a sigh; finding his master in this deep sea of people was proving to be a bother. Why were these people even crowded up in one area, to begin with? Caster scratched at his large mustache, thinking he should do some investigative work of his own… although he was going slightly off the task at hand.

Caster pushed his way through the large crowd moving to the front to see what people were looking at. Once he reached the front of the group, he saw a poster advertising some type of show. Unmistakable was the face on the front giving a thumbs up. It was their guy! Nietzsche almost hopped with excitement. His little investigation didn’t seem so selfish after all.

Nietzsche would then walk along the mall following the trail of advertisements and the crowd who seemed to be swooning over something just ahead. Not only that, but he could feel the presence of a nearby servant. He was definitely getting close, and maybe he would even beat his Master to the chase. He was so focused on his manhunt that Nietzsche didn’t even notice the orange tint in the shopping center being created by Kun Wu. Hopefully, his Master would be as perceptive as she pretended to be.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Continuing to push through the group of men, Caster found himself facing a rather enchanting woman placing posters on the wall, the same posters that featured Kun Wu. However, he did not see Kun Wu. Was it possible this was just one of Kun Wu’s work friends? Or was his servant really alone just like Caster was? Nietzsche walked up to the bunny-eared woman giving her a gentle tap on the shoulder, “Excuse me ma’am, I’m here on official business with the Delphi integrity bureau. I’m looking for a boy named Kun Wu. I see you placing these advertisements, and I couldn’t help but wonder if you were associated with him.” As Nietzsche spoke boldly to Rider, he stood up tall, fixing his collar. Something about playing detective was rather satisfying to him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider was nothing but expedient, having already enthralled several store owners and filled the entirety of the fourth floor in posters. At this pace, she only had a dozen or so pages left. Her job was almost done.

&quot;Phew. Just three more stores should suffice, I think.&quot; She rambled to herself, having used the current task as a stress relief method. Perfect, since she intended on giving Kun Wu his just desserts.

Before she could finish, however, she felt someone sneak up behind her and tap her shoulder. She instinctively turned around, glancing at whoever was behind. A passerby that bumped into her by accident, maybe?

No, it was a sharply dressed man. Yet one that also stuck out like a sore thumb. Their outfit had a fairly old aesthetic to it, and while Ching was unable to pinpoint the exact time period, it looked incredibly similar to the outfits of European gentlemen that visited the flower boat during periods of heat.

But those outfits were from a time long gone, and the civilians in the shopping center seemed to have switched to more modern attire. This instantly made her suspicious, but her theory was confirmed once Nietzsche spoke.

They were looking for Kun Wu and said that they were part of a Delphi organisation. The tone of their voice made it pretty apparent that they weren&#39;t looking for spectacles.

Rider immediately put two and two together. A Holy Grail War meant that there were other Masters and Servants roaming around Olympia and Delphi. Could this be one of them?

Well, if that was the case...</span>

&quot;Oh, me?&quot; Rider replied with a warm smile. &quot;I&#39;m merely an, uhm, <em>assistant</em> of him. You are correct in assuming that I know him, and if you want to meet him, I suggest looking at the posters.&quot; She handed out an advertisement to Nietzsche. Apparently, Kun Wu was about to perform inside the shopping center. Bingo! All he needed to do now was tell his Master about it.

<em>But what could Rider possibly be scheming to rat out her own Master like this?</em>

Speaking of, Kun Wu would soon realize that a large crowd had started to gather at the location of his upcoming performance. It seemed like Ching was quite good at her job, since it had been barely half an hour, yet the floor he was on was packed with people waiting to see his show. He could already see the excitement in their eyes.

Though, there was a small problem: Where was Rider? He couldn&#39;t really start without his assistant now, could he? Did she just bail after doing her job? Maybe he teased her a bit too much... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When Kun Wu looked down the sky bridge again, Rider was nowhere to be seen.

The last he&#39;d checked on her, Rider was hanging around the top floor, but a long time had passed since then. The fireworks took a while to set up, not to mention that he kept getting interrupted by little kids who were getting unnecessarily handsy with his tools. As it turned out, the actual prep work was only half of the battle; the other half was spent on defending his props from little kid theft, as well as explaining to the occasional curious shopper that no, his show did not involve live rabbits zipping around on jetpacks.

Maaaaybe he had overdone it with the rabbit motifs on his posters. Just a tad bit. But all this attention was still good. If anything, it meant that his and Rider&#39;s blatant advertising was working. 

So where was she?

Was she already on her way back? Or did he miss her going inside a store somewhere? She couldn&#39;t possibly have decided that now would be a good time to start her shopping venture, right? 

Kun Wu curled his hands and placed them in front of his eyes like a telescope and started scouring the lower floors more carefully. &#39;Bunny ears.&#39; He reminded himself. &#39;<em>Bunny...ears...</em>&#39; He kept mumbling, now looking not <em>at</em> the crowd, but the space <em>above</em> them in search of those quirky ears. For some reason, he had a feeling that Rider would&#39;ve worn them till the ends of the earth...

<em><strong>There it is.</strong></em>

In the middle of a crowd, right outside of some repair shop, a pair of rabbit ears perked up on full alert mode. Kun Wu&#39;s gaze followed the ears down and immediately recognized Rider&#39;s silky white hair. There was no mistake about it. Rider hadn&#39;t deserted him after all!

Though she certainly seemed to be in no hurry to get back, instead choosing to entertain a small crowd of her own. Kun Wu waited, <em>patiently</em>, for a whole minute, but Rider&#39;s bun ears hadn&#39;t moved an inch.

Kun Wu felt disgruntled. If only he had taught Rider how to use a phone...

But all hope was not lost. Reminders came in all shapes and forms; if telecommunication was out of the question, then he&#39;ll just have to settle for something more archaic, but just as effective.

Kun Wu unsheathed the iron fan from his waist sash, then blew into his hand.

A fluffy blue rabbit blossomed from his open palm and immediately took the air. <em>Hop!</em> It closed the gap between itself and the fourth floor in but a few jumps, then used the heads of the nearby shoppers as jumping platforms and quickly raced towards its white-haired kin.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With all of the clues at hand, it was pretty obvious that this European gentleman was from beyond this world. Most likely, they were a Servant just like Ching. At this point, the woman was fully sold on this theory.

<em>However,</em> this didn&#39;t mean that she had to immediately fight them. From what she had gathered, Servants were far more common in this new world, so not every Servant was a possible opponent. The fact that they were searching for Kun Wu narrowed down the list a fair bit though.

Which is why she would <strong>let them find him.</strong> Not only would this confirm whether Nietzsche was a threat, but it would give Kun Wu a good scare if they were. A perfect comeback...

<em>hop</em>

While she concocted her schemes, Kun Wu&#39;s own rabbit managed to finally reach her. Unfortunately, Ching was relatively tall compared to the rest of the civilians inside of the mall, even taller than Nietzsche. Therefore, the bun failed to land on Ching&#39;s head, instead deciding to rest upon her bountiful bosom.

&quot;What the-&quot; Ching blurted, feeling a warmth on her chest as she instinctively reached for the rabbit and gripped it. It looked like a flickering flame, yet she was still able to grab it. This type of familiar felt similar to-

&quot;<em>Master.</em>&quot; She whispered to herself, taking a good look around her before finally noticing her Master on the fifth floor. Seemed like he had gotten impatient and was trying to lead her back to him.

&quot;Hmph.&quot; Ching sighed, hating this type of catcalling. However, this would prove to be advantageous to her. &quot;You were looking for Kun Wu? He&#39;s right there.&quot; She turned to Nietzsche with a smile, before pointing at the boy in the distance.

&quot;Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me...&quot; She started walking towards an elevator, about to leave for the fifth floor. <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span></span>

She was quite beautiful and Nietzsche was known to have his head in the gutter rather frequently during his lifetime. While watching Ching it would be hard to miss the rabbit making a nest out of her chest. The servant tilted his body observing the strange phenomenon. Not only that, the Rabbit was clearly a familiar of some sort and Ching&#39;s ability to handle it was less than natural. 

Nietzsche felt his mustache as he usually did when deep in thought. This &#39;assistant&#39; seemed more interesting than Kun Wu himself. Afterall Kun Wu was just an immature child. Nietzsche would much rather fill his time with someone who could hold a decent conversation. Above all else there was also a chance that this woman was Kun Wu&#39;s servant. 

&quot;Well since you&#39;re Kun Wu&#39;s assistant you must be heading there anyway.&quot; Nietzsche called out following behind Ching. &quot;Since we&#39;re both going to the same place, why not travel together and entertain one another?&quot;

&quot;You must be quite interested in Kun Wu. Are you a friend of his, perchance?&quot; She asked with a bait question. She definitely couldn&#39;t see Kun Wu as the type to hang out with sharply dressed gentlemen, but it was good to prod for info regardless. While she wait, the elevator expediently reached its destination as a resounding <em>ding</em> could be heard.

The two arrived at the fifth floor, which Ching leaving the glass tube first as she waited for Nietzsche to follow her.

The women easily overpowered it, dragging it by the ears as she ascended the floors with her newest guest. They would soon arrive at the foot of the sky bridge, where the crowd&#39;s size had increased tenfold compared to the lower floor. The advertisement had been a huge success. Rider really should give herself a pat on the back for a job well done.

As the two Servants waddled through the crowd, they couldn&#39;t help but notice all the fireworks that had been tied to the railings, leading from the promenade all the way up to the sky bridge, where Rider knew her Master would be waiting. If she wanted to prank Kun Wu, now would be a good time start her act-

Her hand suddenly felt empty.

The rabbit familiar morphed right in front of her eyes, its ears shrinking and the rest of its body puffing up like a balloon. It kept growing, and growing...

...Until it expanded right into Ching&#39;s sharp nails then perished with a <em>pop!</em>, spewing wisps of blue flames everywhere. 

&#39;Hehe. How&#39;s that for a surprise?&#39; A second pair of rabbit ears joined the two Servants, its wearer no other than Kun Wu himself. The youth drove away the lingering blue flames with his fan, then snapped it closed and bonked Rider lightly on the forehead.

&#39;You are <em>late</em>.&#39; He chided her, then pointed to the bridge. &#39;I could see you all the way from over there. You really didn&#39;t have to go out of your way to get everyone to come. The bridge can only fit so many people at once.&#39; 

He then noticed the sharply dressed man trailing behind. 

&#39;Are you here to see my show?&#39; He asked, sizing the man up. &#39;You should hurry up and find a spot up front, then. It&#39;ll be quite, ah, challenging for you to see anything if you stand all the way back here.&#39; He said solemnly, as if telling Nietzsche that he completely understood what it felt like to have below average height.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche followed closely behind the other servant giving off a cheeky smile as she accepted his offer to travel together. If Kun Wu’s assistant did turn out to be his Servant, Caster would be ecstatic. He had no intent to fight despite whatever his Master’s orders were. Nietzsche was more excited at the idea of discussing philosophy with someone from both a different time period and a different region of the world.

“Hmm? Oh no, you misunderstand. I’m not so much interested in Kun Wu as I am with an acquaintance of his.” Nietzsche played at his suit, trying to make himself presentable for the Servant he would inevitably encounter. He could only hope that they were willing to be as civil as he was. 

“You see, I’m both a writer and a thinker, and Kun Wu has a friend with who I presume I could hold a very good conversation. Nothing would make me happier than to peek into this person’s mind… assuming they are willing to sit down and talk.” Nietzsche tried to speak as passively as possible. If Ching was a servant, he was hoping that she would take his offer for a chat and reveal herself.

As they reached, the top Nietzsche would be slightly spooked as the rabbit inflated before its demise. However, the rabbit’s untimely fate seemed to be Kun Wu’s way of greeting Ching. 

“Ah well, I came here to talk to you on official business with a partner of mine, but I don’t see where they are” Nietzsche stood up on his tippy-toes for a moment, trying to surf the crowd for his Master. Perhaps she was still making her way up to the event. “In any case, I’d happily watch your performance, but ill need to see you and your girlfriend afterward if that’s alright.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching was caught off guard, watching the flaming rabbit dissolve into nothing more than leftover cinders as Kun Wu began to greet his Servant again. A light bonk followed suit.

&quot;Tch.&quot; Ching blurted, annoyed at the boy&#39;s impish act. &quot;Well, excuse me, milord.&quot; She said rather sarcastically. &quot;I thought you were the one who asked for an extravagant and wasteful spectacle, so I thought to deliver exactly what you deserved.&quot;

There was venom in her words, yet Kun Wu barely noticed it due to being attracted by Nietzsche&#39;s presence. A prospective customer had a higher priority than his Servant, after all!

&quot;Don&#39;t just ignore me...&quot; Ching whispered to herself, tempted to take the spotlight again to give her Master a piece of her mind. At least, that was until Nietzsche started rambling out loud.

&quot;<em>Ahem,</em>&quot; She swiftly intervened and put herself between the two. &quot;we are <em>not</em> a couple. Please leave those assumptions to yourself. I am merely an assistant of this boy.&quot; She defended herself, trying to avoid any romantic connections between her and her Master. The thought alone drove her mad, to be seen as Kun Wu&#39;s bride. It was embarrassing!

&quot;Milord, I&#39;m sure you can support this as well. Right? <em>Right?</em>&quot; She gave him an irritated side glance. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span></span>

Wasteful? <strong>Hahahah!</strong>&#39; Kun Wu laughed as if Rider had just said the funniest thing in the world. &#39;I prefer to call it an <em>investment</em>.&#39; He gestured towards the crowd with a spread of his arm. &#39;Do you know how many people here are from Olympia? Well, I don&#39;t! But I know they&#39;re here. Show them a good time, and they&#39;ll be spreading my name for me once they&#39;re back in Olympia. <em>For free.</em>&#39;

He punctuated the last word with a flick of the wrist, unfolding his iron fan and revealing the famous phrase that read &#39;<em>The one and only, throughout heaven and earth</em>&#39; on its front side. It was written beautifully in calligraphy, even though any artistic value was lost in the sheer arrogance exuding from the words alone. 

But, well, it seemed oddly fitting for him. Which made it all the more infuriating.

Alas, if only looks could kill. Despite Rider&#39;s best efforts to do so, what ended up catching Kun Wu&#39;s attention were none other than the gentleman&#39;s curious words. His ears perked up at the mention of &#39;business&#39;. <em>Official</em> business. 

And &#39;girlfriend&#39;.

&#39;Whoa whoa, slow down, Mister! One thing at a time.&#39; He fanned himself absentmindedly as he processed Nietzsche&#39;s words. &#39;For the record, she is <em>not</em> my girlfriend. Though I do pay for her breakfast, lunch and dinner, I prefer to call that business expenses. For you see, we-&#39; He slipped his other arm around Rider and reeled her in like a fish, &#39;-are <em>partners</em>.&#39;

He announced happily, completely unaware that the term &#39;partner&#39; carried a similar undertone to &#39;girlfriend&#39; under certain circumstances. Rider felt like snapping right then and there...

Right now, it was 2 against 1. Kun Wu had every confidence in the world that he and Ching Shih could double-team the poor guy into coughing up twice the amount of money to whatever business proposal he had drafted beforehand.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">You didn&#39;t have to be Sherlock Holmes to notice the whole mall momentarily changed color. Just as Rinne located the source, a giant ball of flame, it exploded. It didn&#39;t seem to be any kind of danger, though... No, as soon as Rinne saw the papers drifting through the air, she was certain that Kun Wu must be the one responsible for such a flashy piece of handiwork.

That suspicion was confirmed when Rinne snatched a poster from its flight. This was exactly the kind of childish thing he would make. Crumpling the poster and stuffing it in her coat pocket, Rinne&#39;s amber gaze wandered back to the skybridge where the fireball had originated. So, that&#39;s where he was... With a sigh, Rinne turned to her Servant. Thing is, he wasn&#39;t actually there. When had she lost him? She&#39;d have to go it alone for now. 

It was looking like Rinne couldn&#39;t catch a break. By the time the investigator managed to reach the skybridge, Kun Wu was already gone. Well, it wasn&#39;t like could have gone far. Looking down on the rest of the mall, she scoured the area for the oddest characters she could find. It wasn&#39;t long before she spotted them. Two pairs of bunny ears caught her eye as they poked prominently above the crowd. Following them down revealed Kun Wu and a companion of his. More surprising than that, though, was the fact that Rinne recognized Nietzche standing alongside them. 

Unlike Kun Wu, Rinne didn&#39;t have an efficient way of getting over there. Peering down, she sized up the viability of an &#39;accelerated route.&#39; The drop wasn&#39;t that big... She decided against it. She retraced her steps back down to the lower floor, and headed to where she&#39;d spotted Caster and Kun Wu. They were still there, but Rinne figured she would stay a small distance away and eavesdrop on their conversation for a moment first.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Rider spoke harshly to her Master Nietzsche couldn’t help but feel a bit awkward. Apparently, they weren’t a couple but Ching acted as if Kun Wu had been on her nerves for ages. This certainly made them seem like partners

Nietzsche also observed the child-like arrogance of Kun Wu. What would lead him to believe that people shopping here would be from Olympia? On top of that, he was so confident that they would share his name, surely a street performer wouldn’t be that spectacular... Caster couldn’t help but feel that Rinne’s initial observation of the boy was holding to be true.

Caster raised an eyebrow as Kun WU slowly reeled in his Servant. He claimed they weren’t in a relationship but he called Ching his partner, he even clung to her like a boyfriend. “Right…..” Nietzsche said shaking his head in confusion. A small detail like this wasn’t worth getting confused over, he had better things to talk about.

Nietzsche cleared his throat pounding his chest lightly as Kun Wu asked him to elaborate on his ‘business’. “Well you see me and my partner have discovered that you are a participant in the Holy Grail war. We don’t wish to harm you… well at least I don’t” Caster said with a slight chuckle. His master’s intentions were a bit vague to him, however, he was more focused on his own goals.

“You see I am a thinker and a scholar and I wish to speak to both you and your Servant to learn about the modern-day, and the era from which your Servant comes. I think it would be wise for our teams to become well acquainted and work together. We are both from Delphi after all”

Nietzsche knew that both he and Rinne were physically on the weaker side for this competition. He felt the smartest move was to procure allies and work from behind them.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu stopped fanning abruptly upon hearing Nietzsche mention the Holy Grail War.

If those words had surprised him, he didn&#39;t show it any further. Instead he remained still as stone, shoulders relaxed and breathing even as he listened to the rest of Nietzsche&#39;s &#39;business proposal&#39;. A smile even lingered on his lips.

Unfortunately, for a Servant as observant as Nietzsche, this change - or should we say, lack of change - in body language was already telling enough. The philosopher hadn&#39;t been observing the youth for nothing; all the behaviors he had displayed prior to this brief meeting had suggested him to be anything but calm.

In other words, Kun Wu&#39;s strength as an actor and an entertainer, which enabled him to respond to Nietzsche&#39;s bombshell with not even a twitch of the eye, had completely sold him out.

Nietzsche&#39;s words had placed the young Master on high alert.

Kun Wu watched the philosopher with renewed interest.

The articulate gestures of Nietzsche&#39;s hands, the rise and fall of his suit lapels, the slight twitch of his perfectly groomed mustache with each word he had uttered...the youth took it all in. It was amazing how a few words could change someone&#39;s perspective completely. From Mr. Moneybags to Mr. I&#39;ve-come-here-with-a-proposal-that-sounded-like-half-a-threat, Kun Wu almost wanted to break his act and laugh at the absurdity of it all.

And so he did.

&#39;<em>Hmhmhmhm...<strong>hahahahahahahah!!!*</strong>&#39; What had started out as a chuckle quickly expanded into a full-blown, shoulder-shaking laugh, only to devolve into stomach-clutching spasms as it overstayed its welcome. &#39;</em>Oh man, oh geez, ow,*&#39; Kun Wu wheezed like an old man almost, desperately clutching onto Rider for support. He wiped tears from his eyes.

Not to mention - just one of you? Man, you&#39;ve got guts to show your face here again.&#39; 

Again? Nietzsche was certain he had never even heard of the boy before today. Had there been a mix-up of some kind?

&#39;The answer is still no.&#39; Kun Wu said adamantly. &#39;I don&#39;t care if your boss sent you in black suits, striped suits, or rainbow-colored suits, and I don&#39;t care if you actually came prepared with a script this time. I&#39;m a one-man team. Well, two-man now,&#39; He gripped Rider a bit harder, &#39;But I&#39;m still my own representative, not the government&#39;s...&#39;

&#39;...Unless you&#39;re willing to <em>sponsor</em> me instead of recruiting me.&#39; He licked his lips, hunger in his eyes. &#39;Or better yet, why not ditch your boss and come work for me instead, hm?&#39; He not-so-subtly threw Nietzsche a bone, fully within earshot of his real Master. The nerves of him! &#39;How good are your magic circuits? What is your forte? Do you have experience handling large crowds?&#39; He barraged the philosopher with questions as if they were already in the middle of an interview.

It seemed that he hadn&#39;t realized Nietzsche&#39;s true nature yet.

Ching seemed ecstatic. The possibility of an alliance was a sign of good fortune and something worth considering. After all, her empire started off through an alliance with one of China&#39;s greatest pirate fleets. Using Caster as a pawn to fight future battles was Ching&#39;s first thought. Of course, there was also the chance that Caster wanted to use Kun Wu as well. No one worked for free.

Well, if there was one thing Ching Shih was confident in, it was manipulating those who dared manipulate her. She had no fear of Caster and was even ready to take him up on his offer.

Until her Master spoke.

He laughed. He mocked. He belittled. He even gripped Rider in dangerous areas, as if trying to balance him by remaining hooked to her waist and chest. While embarrassing, Rider had no time to focus on that, since she was too preoccupied with Kun Wu&#39;s ramblings. He was <em>refusing</em> the alliance?

No, it sounded like the two had history. Apparently, Nietzsche had already tried to contact Kun Wu sometime ago? Probably before Rider had been summoned. Kun Wu was being rather vague with his explanation, but it seemed like a third party had already accosted him for a potential alliance.

&quot;You never told me that, milord.&quot; Ching cut him off, sounding a bit ticked. Perhaps she was angry at the fact that her Master had neglected to tell her about such important details. 

&quot;Am I perhaps not important enough to know about such things?&quot; She pushed him aside, causing him to shake a bit as he was now no longer gripping Rider&#39;s perfect waistline. 

&quot;It&#39;s hard to call ourselves partners if you omit such fine details.&quot; She glared at him before turning back to Nietzsche.</span>

&quot;And you, just cut to the chase. It is obvious that you want something from us, and we want something from you back, <strong>Servant.</strong>&quot; Ching casually blurted out the word. Kun Wu would most likely be confused. Did Rider just call the sharply dressed man a Servant?

&quot;But before we continue these negotiations further, I think it&#39;s unfair for us to be exposed while your Master has yet to reveal themselves. Are they around? Perhaps, they are even monitoring us right now?&quot; She fired question after question, like a volley of arrows that pierced through Nietzsche&#39;s speech. He was looking for a conversation of the psyche, yet Rider was more interested in gaining an advantage above him.

&quot;Well, unless they reveal themselves,&quot; Rider stepped backwards, glaring at Kun Wu with disdain. A gaze that clearly said <em>&#39;Next time, tell me about stuff like this or I&#39;ll kick your &amp;!%@!&#39;</em>. Kun Wu expected some sort of punishment. Perhaps his cheeks would get vaporized yet again. Instead, Rider simply leaned closer and grabbed him by the shoulders, before shutting his mouth with the palm of her hand.

&quot;...<strong>you won&#39;t get another word.</strong>&quot; Ching declared, preventing Kun Wu from speaking while staring at Nietzsche. &quot;Tell your Master to reveal themselves. If they don&#39;t, then I&#39;ll simply have to make it so my Master can&#39;t participate either. Seems only fair to me. Of course, I am willing to compromise...&quot;

&quot;If you tell us your <strong>True Name</strong> and the name of your Master, I might be inclined to hear you out.&quot; It had been barely ten minutes since she met Caster, yet she already made huge moves to gain leverage over him. No wonder she was able to tame an entire fleet with her words alone. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hebisuzawa#0404">@Hebisuzawa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This conversation was getting a little scary. It was clear that Kun Wu&#39;s partner in crime had a snake&#39;s tongue, even if he was an idiot. It wasn&#39;t that Rinne didn&#39;t trust her Servant to be able to handle things on his own, but it was her job to back him up in instances like this. Leaving Nietzche to fend for himself against this fierce lioness and her cub was not the kind of thing she did. Rinne stepped from the crowd she blended in with, slotting herself in beside Nietzche.

     If Kun Wu thought Caster looked like he was from the government, well... This new woman was the picture-perfect image of &#39;someone from the government.&#39; Dark, professional attire. Check! A stone-cold aura? Yep! A gun at the hip, poking out from behind her coat? Of course! &quot;Asking for such intimate details in such a public place is exactly the sort of brazen move I&#39;d expect from you two. Do you know the definition of caution? It&#39;s probably something you should learn pretty quick if you want to have a chance.&quot; When Rinne spoke, it was clear that she had no intention of being as friendly as her Servant had been. Her sharp remark was sent with a disdainful look, mostly at the younger boy.</span>

Even though she&#39;d only been watching for a moment, it was clear as day. Rinne deduced quickly it would be a much better idea to appeal to the mature and elegant Rider before giving Kun Wu the time of day. With a sigh, she produced the poster from her pocket and waved it about. &quot;Look, this kind of thing isn&#39;t what you should be doing with the stakes we&#39;re playing with here. I&#39;d be open to the idea of forming an alliance... But this sort of thing, monetizing and using your Servant for popularity, isn&#39;t what I want from one of my partners.&quot; Amber eyes gave Rider a sympathetic look. &quot;I hope you can understand that.&quot;

    Yep, that was right! This purple-haired woman who hadn&#39;t even introduced herself dared to lecture Kun Wu as if he was nothing but a kid whose childish antics had gotten out of hand. It must be awfully humiliating for Kun Wu, being indirectly told &#39;It&#39;s time for the grown-ups to talk,&#39; as even his own Servant wanted him to stop talking.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche had no problem revealing himself out in the open. He had no idea where his master was, and he was possibly in the face of two enemies. However, the crowd gathered around Kun Wu was enough to guarantee his safety. When Nietzsche finally did let his true intentions loose, he was somewhat surprised with the outcome… in fact, he was rather confused. Kun Wu acted as if Nietzsche had pestered him before. That would be impossible though, Nietzsche had only spoken to Rinne since he was summoned.

Caster pulled at his mustache, thinking of what to say to Kun Wu. The situation had taken an unexpected turn… maybe if he played along, he could get what he wanted. Hopefully, he’d be able to seal a deal before his ambitious Master got involved. After all her plans had seemed more hostile than his own.

However, before Nietzsche could even get a word in, Rider chimed in, silencing her loud-mouthed Master. She spoke with venom in her tongue, being rather clear and concise with her demands. She was clearly on high alert and handling the situation much better than her Master. Nietzsche, however, couldn’t meet the most basic of her demands. He had no idea where his Master was… it’s not like they had split up on purpose; he was genuinely lost.

“Oh well, you see, to be perfectly honest, my Master is-” before he could finish speaking, Caster was interrupted by the introduction of his Master. “R-right there!” Nietzsche nodded along at her arrival, playing cool as if he had always known where she was —even though he didnt—.</span>

Before he could reply to Ching, his Master has started to lecture their potential allies. His heart sunk, afraid that the young detective would kill their momentum, “Master, it’s not your place to lecture. You do not know what Kun Wu here is capable of!” Nietzsche quickly scolded his master before turning back to Kun Wu and Ching 

“Please excuse my Master; she is rather eager to make your acquaintance, is all. We’d love to sit down and talk in a more private environment, is what she’s trying to say… isn’t that right, Master?”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Oh, to be drowning in Rider&#39;s bountiful bosom and caressed by her tender fingers. Men would wage war for such maddening privileges, and the modern day was no exception. All at once, jealous stares pierced Kun Wu from every direction, coming from the very crowd he and Rider had gathered - the people he was supposed to rally in the first place. Well, he got his attention alright, but why was the air rife with hostility?

Kun Wu squirmed, but Rider&#39;s grip was firm. Not firm enough to break bones, but enough to reconfigure his facial skin and muscles should he struggle against it with his full strength. After all, he was only human, and there were limits to how far he could push his physique. 

Clearly, the smart thing to do right now would be to wait till Rider had had her fill. But that wasn&#39;t an option. Not if he wanted to be shredded by all the single males in his area. Plus, he was already getting shredded verbally aplenty by his Servant and now, the new addition to their little circus: Nietzsche&#39;s Master.

Suffice to say, he hadn&#39;t exactly expected the oddly polite man in a suit to be a Servant. For better or worse, he had gotten used to Ching Shih&#39;s brazen attitude over the past weeks and that had sufficiently tainted his outlook on other Servants. To think that a Servant capable of humility existed came as more of a shocker than even his Master&#39;s barbed words. 

Though that wasn&#39;t to say he would take Rinne&#39;s words lying down...<em>if only</em> Rider hadn&#39;t glued her hand to his face! Eyebrows were about the only expressive part of his face that hadn&#39;t been covered. What was he going to do? Wiggle them like worms?

He raised an eyebrow when Rinne came to her Servant&#39;s rescue, then raised the other brow as she started reprimanding his actions. The brows kept rising, while Rinne&#39;s lecture droned on and on...until Nietzsche finally decided that enough was enough and intervened, proposing a moment of truce so that everyone could mind their surroundings, at least a little.

There was tension in the air, but clearly not just between the two Delphi pairs. A government official on patrol, picking bones with a street performer who was receiving daggers from his own jealous audience? 

Gossip was rampant. Chaos was imminent. But it&#39;d take more than that to intimidate the Master of Rider.

<span class="pre pre--inline">&#39;Ahem.&#39;</span> A rather flat and monotonous voice cleared its nonexistent throat, alerting the rest of the debate team to a glowing smartphone held by none other than Kun Wu himself. As words started to scroll across the screen, the same voice, powered by a robust text-to-speech engine, faithfully conveyed its owner&#39;s thoughts in a machine-like manner.

<span class="pre pre--inline">&#39;See, this is why working with you guys don&#39;t sit well with me. Here I am trying to realize my Servant&#39;s full potential, but all you want to do is talk about stakes and alliances like we&#39;re in the military. I may be a Master, but one extra title isn&#39;t going to make me change my M.O.&#39;</span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">&#39;Last time I checked, SERVANT frames do not come with an instruction manual that says they are not to be used for anything other than combat. Monetizing her good looks, using her to boost my show&#39;s ratings. Pray tell, anonymous Master of the government, is that so wrong? How is that any worse than Masters who can&#39;t see their Servants as more than a tool for war?&#39;</span>

Oh boy, his arm was starting to get sore from holding the phone up for so long. Who would have thought that gravity could be so scary?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider kept holding on to her Master with a tight grip, delicate to prevent harm while simultaneously strong enough to keep him in place. She paid no mind to the rather compromising position they were in, not even to the longing gazes of the crowd catching wind of them from afar. After all, she had long since grown desensitized to such stares.

Though she would be surprised at another Master showing themselves. Her hunch was correct and Rinne wasted no time in replying to Rider&#39;s numerous questions, with some added insults designed to berate Kun Wu and mock him for his usage of Servants. Ching was tempted to nod and agree there, finding the female Master much more agreeable than her mumbling Servant.

However, Ching knew something that Rinne didn&#39;t: Do not underestimate Kun Wu.

A statement that he would back up soon enough, as he got tired of being shredded by male gazes and opposing Masters, with his only supporter being a weird Servant with a gigantic stache. This sort of humiliation could not stand, especially for someone who loved having the last say like him! That&#39;s precisely why he took out his phone and took everyone off guard with its surprisingly accurate sounding text to speech features.

&quot;...Those screens can talk as well?&quot; Ching asked in disbelief, rather puzzled at all of these technological gizmos Kun Wu kept around at his apartment. She would have to mess around with them more. 

Most importantly, she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the ridiculousness of the situation. Even with his mouth shut, her Master would constantly find new ways to be an annoyance. That was something that Rinne had greatly underestimated about him, but a fact that she would learn soon enough.

Ching sighed as she let his grip on him go, pushing him aside and allowing him to speak again. Kun Wu would most likely take deep breaths, glad that he could breathe through his mouth again, albeit he did miss being so close to Rider&#39;s chest.</span>

&quot;Since your Master has shown themselves,&quot; Ching glanced at Nietzsche. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s fine for my Master to speak. Now we are on an even playing field.&quot;

She seemed relatively calm, as if she had given the time for Kun Wu&#39;s antics to sink and decided that it was best to reprimand him later, when they were alone at his apartment. For now, it was more important to leave a strong impression on the people in front of her, be they potential enemies or allies.

&quot;I admire your boldness, other Master.&quot; Ching said with a giggle, staring at Rinne. &quot;I&#39;d even clap and give a standing ovation if I could, since you worded it incredibly well: It is incredibly tiring to cater to such a bratty child.&quot; She said with a sigh, while Kun Wu would most likely feel crushed. Did his own Servant just shit on him?

&quot;<em>However,</em>&quot; Ching&#39;s eyes took on a different glint, one more menacing than the three of them combined. &quot;<strong>since when were you under the impression that we were Master and Servant?</strong> Do not treat us as such, since my Master was respectful enough to treat me as an equal. We aren&#39;t slaves to each other. We are merely business partners who see no problem in being brutally honest to one another.&quot;

Her bunny ears perked up, resembling devil&#39;s horns more than anything at this point. Rider then put her foot down, literally. The clack of her high heels resonated with the floor, before a noisy crack appeared on the ground itself. A show of power.

&quot;So, I really do not appreciate your tone towards my associates. It is my duty to reprimand them and I shall give no one else the glory to do so.&quot; She said with a warm and bright smile, which conflicted with her show of strength quite nicely. Kun Wu wasn&#39;t sure on whether Ching liked him or not, but she seemed to be backing him up so far.</span>

&quot;If you want to see exactly what sort of relationship we have,&quot; Rider turned to her Master, an idea having wormed itself into her head. &quot;milord, would you go ahead and start the show? I&#39;ll join you in a few seconds.&quot;

She waved at him, causing his heart to flutter as he heard those mystic words. Rider was voluntarily offering herself up to participate in his performance just to prove a point to Rinne and Nietzsche. Should he take her up on her offer? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche nodded along as Kun Wu’s phone spoke for him. Kun Wu seemed a boy who wanted to do things his way, despite what others thought. These were qualities that Nietzsche admired. Even if Kun Wu was obnoxious and wild, he was in tune with what he wanted and didn’t look to what the others were doing with their Servants. Nietzsche assumed all of this from a few words on the phone, but Caster saw promise in the boy. If Kun Wu nurtured his mind, Nietzsche believed he could become a very powerful individual.

“Well, I suppose Master and Servant are harsh words, but titles are exactly that; I admire the equality in your relationship” Nietzsche gave a gentle nod to the couple. Ching like Kun Wu, seemed to want to live by her own rules. Such free minds could prove a challenge in the future. Nietzsche believed strongly that forming an alliance is the best-case scenario. Rinne, however, took a clear disliking to Kun Wu off the bat.

“Master, she is correct. You are out of line scolding someone who you know so little about. It is senseless to create such hostility towards people we are barely acquainted with. Let us back off for now, and I’m sure we can all work something out in due time.”

Nietzsche tried his best to stop Rinne from outwardly expressing her feelings towards Kun Wu. He felt that the best thing to do was take a step back and revaluate how he and Rinne want to approach things for the future.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu skidded to a halt. He leaned against the railings, then gingerly rubbed his jaw. 

Good. Nothing broke. Which was well within expectations, of course. Rider may have loved to punish, but she was not cruel. It was something he came to learn by constantly toeing the line between what was appropriate and what was not, and the very reason he hadn&#39;t yet been beaten to a pulp by his own Servant since day one. His Servant may have turned out to be a smidge harder to control, but he didn&#39;t dislike that. Control was a strong word anyway, and trust was overrated. After all, what kind of trust was there to speak of if the Servant only offered services purely out of the goodwill of their heart?

But Rider was different. A favor for a favor. She was no stranger to Delphi&#39;s policy. Embraced it, even. In a way, she was the best Servant Kun Wu could have asked for. Trust? Respect? Scratch that. As a self-proclaimed entrepreneur, there was nothing more precious and more reassuring than a mutually beneficial contract.

He had gladly offered himself up as an asset. Naturally, he had every intention to believe that Rider would do the same. <em>Even if it&#39;d take some time to warm her up to the idea of wearing alternate costumes...</em>

<em>Patience, Kun Wu.</em> The youth told himself. <em>Be happy with the bunny ears for now. The rest will come in due time.</em>

Instead he raised an eyebrow at Rider&#39;s sudden request to kick off their show. 

&#39;So soon?&#39; He inquired, entertaining the idea of performing in front of a government official after they&#39;d up and revealed themselves. But then a new thought intruded, and his eyes sparkled.

Rider, asking him to perform out of her own volition? 

He thought back to all those times she had visibly spaced out in the middle of watching his recordings, or learned how to use a laptop just so she could pause and quit the videos whenever he went looking for snacks. Could this be? Was Rinne&#39;s remark the push Rider had needed all along?

&#39;<em>Actually</em>,&#39; He cleared his throat, &#39;I didn&#39;t quite catch that. Care to repeat what you just said one more time?&#39; He feigned ignorance. &#39;It sounded important and worthy of being captured on tape.&#39; He explained, smartphone at the ready. But when all that had earned him was an icy glare from the pirate queen, Kun Wu made his speedy recovery by stuffing the phone into Rider&#39;s hand, as if he had always meant to do so after her surprised reaction towards its text-to-speech function.

&#39;Here ya go! Now why don&#39;t you go familiarize yourself with this crystallization of modern tech while I get the show started for our guests?&#39; If he had sported a tail, he&#39;d be wagging it right about now too. But unfortunately, the limitations of the human physique once again forbade him from reaching his full potential.

Another time, perhaps.

Regardless, such a small blunder did nothing to hamper Kun Wu&#39;s drive. The young Master turned and bowed to Nietzsche and Rinne with a flourish of the arm.

&#39;City Grail War or not, I have no right to turn you away once you&#39;ve stepped foot into my ring.&#39; He said, stealing a glance at the pair. &#39;Unnamed Servant, if you value titles as much as you said, then surely you won&#39;t mind donning the title of a <strong>guest</strong> for now, while I take up the title of a <strong>performer</strong> and entertain you both with a spectacle of fire and lights?&#39;

With a flick of the wrist he snapped open his trusty iron fan. Then the bridge erupted in crazy gyrations of smoke and sparks.

Compared to the tastefully curated chaos back at the <span class="mention">#market-square</span>, the fireworks he had lined up so meticulously along the sky bridge had gone off all at once and brought nothing but utter madness to his makeshift stage. Smoke welled from the ends of the spent tubes in dark currents, being ushered along by the pulls of Kun Wu&#39;s fan, until it completely enveloped the bridge and beyond, plunging the entire area in total darkness.

A gloved hand gripped Rider&#39;s wrist amidst the chaos, giving her a strong sense of deja vu. 

Not this again...

&#39;Come! The subway is this way.&#39; It was her Master&#39;s voice. He pulled at her, leading her towards one of the many exits that had been pinned on the shopping center&#39;s map. Contrary to his inviting words towards Nietzsche and Rinne, it seemed that he truly had no intention to humor the government even if it meant sabotaging his own show.
