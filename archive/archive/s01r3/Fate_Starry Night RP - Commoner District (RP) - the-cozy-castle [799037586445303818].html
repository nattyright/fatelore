                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal reluctantly twisted the knob, ending the stream of scalding hot water. This didn’t plunge him into the freezing cold he was mentally prepared for, the room was too small and the hot air couldn’t escape fast enough through the bottom for that. He was quick to open the door and snag the nearby towel to dry himself off, helping alleviate the overall problem of the cold.

Not much was going through his mind at the moment and that wasn’t due to any hint of  early onset Alzheimers. A mixture of hot temperatures and overall lack of regret over his actions earlier in the day lead to a perfect storm of a ‘No Thoughts, Head Empty’ mentality. Maybe not the best mindset when one had just dealt with their potential demise at the hand of a big fucking dragon.

Nevertheless, he replaced the towel on the rack and threw on his new pair of clothes. Despite the relatively high temperatures he donned his usual attire of a long sleeve shirt wrapped in a heavy coat and baggy pants. And socks. Those toes would never stay warm without socks.

He swung the door open and stepped into the actual nippy air, shivering slightly as he ventured to the kitchen. “What’re you thinking for dinner? We still got those noodles from the other day, should be good enough so long as you ignore the weird smell.” He double checked the fridge, scouring the shelves for those delicious noodles...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Coal took his steamy hot shower, Claudius leaned against the wall adjacent to where the bathroom was. He tapped his nails against the wall impatiently thinking over the recent encounter

Claudius was certainly nowhere near happy.  Coals sloppy plans may have been one thing but in the face of imminent death he sought to endanger himself for Claudius&#39;s sake. This just wasn&#39;t acceptable in the slightest. Claudius was, in his mind, expendable. He had always operated under this ideal. In life he existed to punish defiers of the throne and he would happily die doing so. His loyalty to his job as a servant was no different even if he wasn&#39;t passionate about his master&#39;s goals.

Once Coal entered the room, Claudius&#39;s eyes shifted up towards him, leaving his deep train of thought. Assassin sighed to himself, Coal hadn&#39;t even been thinking of their recent encounter at all. He was more concerned with eating rancid noodles. &quot;Ya speak so casually Master?&quot; Claudius asked, shaking his head. &quot;Supper is the least of our worries, we best be discussing what just transpired not too long ago.&quot; As Claudius spoke Coal would notice Claudius&#39;s old English accent growing a bit thicker than it was previously.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal failed to find the noodles. He had no clue who could have possibly eaten them, or even when. They were here just this morning, he knew because he had to move them to get to something else in there. Either Claudus was hiding the fact that he ate the rest of the noodles, or Ivan had gotten a little hungry and decided to raid his fridge. He’d have to talk to that man and finally get him to stop doing that.

Speaking of, Claudius seemed mad about something. Based on what he said, he probably wasn’t happy with how his makeshift plan had failed with flying colors. He wasn’t very proud of it either, but they were alive! Barely! 

“Dinner is very important to me, and someone stole our noodles. Looks like we’ll have to go shopping or get down to the restaurant downstairs before it closes up.” He got back up and pushed the door shut, facing his Servant. “And what is there to talk about? I’m not happy with how things went either but we’re not dead! And we might have a future ally on our hands, if Caster decides to look for us. I know I didn’t give him exact directions but I’m not even risking that snotty nose brat of a Nobleman and his Lancer getting wind of where we are. Things are starting to look up if I say so myself.”

He went over to his desk and withdrew a plain wallet, stuffing it into his pocket. He went back to Claudius, “Now come on, Ivan told me they got a special going on right now. Two for one! We can eat for a couple of days for the price of one person, and it ain’t getting better than that.”

Coal seemed really confident in his abilities and how everything turned out. Despite Coals confidence Claudius couldn&#39;t help but feel the opposite. The pair had barely gotten a grasp on eachother, Coals lack of interest in Claudius’s capabilities was also concerning.

“Well I suppose we can just have our chat over dinner yeah?” Claudius figured lecturing Coal wouldnt be the best move at the moment. If he got him to dinner at least Coal would have to listen to Claudius’s concerns. Plus everyone is happier on a full stomach.

Claudius sat up from his position against the wall changing into his disguise. “You’re simple minded ya know that?” Claudius stated throwing insults out of nowhere. “Well then you lead the way Master, ill just lecture you over dinner”. Claudius was at least kind enough to let Coal know that dinner would be filled with serious matters, he wouldn&#39;t want him to think they were just going to hang out and have a good time.

Down the hall, down the stairs, into the lobby. It looked about the same as it did the first time they were there, except for the television programming. This time around, it was blaring about the recent attacks that happened in the Restaurant District between members of either faction. He ignored it, instead pushing past the few residents hanging around and into the Hotel Restaurant. 

There weren’t many patrons at this time and considering the circumstances. Everyone was excited that the war was finally starting and tensions would hopefully ease, but the battle not terribly far from here reminded them that nothing had changed. If anything, it was more dangerous than before with servants running around, attacking each other willy nilly. 

Soon enough, they had a table and were sitting down opposite of each other off to the side of the room. Coal had opted for a nice sugary pop, slurping it down as if he’d never drank anything before.

“So, what’s pissing you off this time?”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Claudius watched Coal chug his soda like there was no tomorrow. Claudius had also ordered himself soda opting for Cola. He had never had a carbonated drink of the sort, it certainly seemed strange.

“I wanna talk about what ya did towards the end of our little mission.” Claudius slowly raised the glass of Cola to his lips stopping for a second feeling the weird sensation of the bubbles against his skin. He took a sip puting the drink down with a “bleh” he shook his head in disapproval “too sweet” he commented pushing the drink away with his index finger.

“Anyway master, what i&#39;m talking about is you trying to save me, that&#39;s not how this relationship is supposed to work.” Claudius leaned forward in his chair bringing his eyes closer to Coals. “I live to die by the loyalty I&#39;ve sworn. A king doesn&#39;t fight for his subjects, rather the subject fights for his king.” It would be clear to Coal that Claudius operated on older values, if Coal knew his background as an Assassin for British king this might have made more sense.

“On top of that you failed to utilize our talents in a coherent manner, you’ve never even asked what I can do as a matter of fact. To win your battles you need to acquire the proper information to thwart your opponent.” Claudius then took his finger and placed it against Coals forehead. “This is stronger than any magic or muscle out there you got that?” As Claudius lectured Coal his speaking was more proper than usual, it may seem that Claudius’s bum getup was nothing but a charade.

It seemed that any attempts at a nice night smashing down whatever food that was on the special deal after such a stressful day were not going to happen.

“Listen, <em>buddy</em>,” Coal removed the Servant’s finger from his head and firmly put his hand back onto the table, “If your goal is to piss me off, you’re doing a great job. I can get you a fuckin medal if you want. You want to talk about the shit you can do as a servant? Go nuts. You want to talk about planning more often? Sure, whatever. But don’t start fuckin lecturing me about what you think is right.”

He leaned back in his chair, rocking back and forth on the back legs. “And stop using those weird words. If you use these ‘fancy’ terms like ‘coherent’ and ‘thwart’ I’m gonna fuckin pop a vein.”

Coal grabbed his glass and downed the remnants of the fizzy drink in a few big gulps. He slammed the glass back down on the table. “All I’m gonna say is that if you go down, I’m out of my only hope of getting off this damn boat. Which ain’t something I can afford.”

Their server returned, dropping off a refill for him without even asking. No ice, as per usual.

“See ya say you want ta win, but ya have the audacity to spit in my face when I give ya the recipe for victory. How about you calm down and listen ta me huh?” It might be hypocritical for Claudius to try and tell Coal to calm down, however, he didn&#39;t plan on doing so until his Master did first.

Claudius had become winded from how intently he was talking back to Coal, he took a deep breath holding it for a second to regain his posture. “So how about this, you let me tell you how I think we will win, and if you have any objections, after you listen patiently… you let me know ok?”

It he was going to be completely honest, if it weren’t for this sugar overload from the drink he might’ve thrown a glass down on the ground in the heat of the moment. 

Instead, he nursed the beverage in his hands, slouched back in his chair with the most uninterested look he could muster at the moment. “After you give your little talk, or whatever the fuck you think, I’m getting some food. If you aren’t ready to go when that time comes, I’m gonna decide what you get.” 

Petty, but Coal was getting frustrated at not being in charge of the situation. He usually gets mad when that happens. Might explain a few things.

&quot;Alright, pal. Go off.&quot;

“After seeing the display by Caster its no surprise that hes the guardian of Saturn Aratron…. But if he&#39;s our ally as you claim, well then its not important for now.” Claudius having a formal education was well versed in renaissance pieces and greek literature, both being considered the greatest works of art at his time of birth.

“And well as for Lancer… he&#39;s greek I can tell you that much, he fits the bill for almost any greek hero out there… that shield however, possessed the ability to nullify caster’s magic… I think that is important to note.” Claudius paused from speaking, closing the menu in front of his face.

“Before I move on get me a hamburger... a sandwich with a half pound of meat, that&#39;d be eating rich back in my day” He said with a chuckle

He didn’t care about who his opponents were, they were gonna have to get offed anyway. Unless who they were was a fuckin beefcake incapable of dying. That would suck.

“Hamburger, really?” Really was a bum after all. He had never figured out the appeal of those things. They were below average at best and tended to make a mess of your face in an annoying way. “If that’s what you want, sure. Really makes me sad to hear, hope you get better soon.”

The waiter returned, upon which Coal ordered himself something far classier, a truly wondrous meal full of taste and appreciation for modern times: Spaghetti without meatballs. Hated those things, ruined the whole point of the meal if you asked him.

The waiter took the order and retreated to the back. “Now,” Coal looked around to double check that no one was eavesdropping, “how do we get to the last man standing, huh?”

“Now listen, when we know our opponent we know their strengths and weaknesses, and exploiting moments of weakness is what I&#39;m good at” Claudius was now getting to the part Coal so eagerly wanted to hear. “Ya see the noose ‘round my neck, it suppresses my killing prowess.”

Claudius rubbed his neck with his hand just thinking about the darn thing really ticked him off. “It&#39;s harder to conceal yourself when yer out for blood… But once I remove this thing I should be able to deliver a fatal blow given we have the element of surprise” 

“So Master the idea is, we lay low and scout out our opponents weaknesses, and when we have opportunities we go for the killing blow, no matter how dirty the victory may seem.” Claudius could only hope that this would get across Coals thick skull, the war would be much easier if they were on the same page.

Ridiculous. Sometimes he wanted to strangle his servant for no better reason than to get him to stop talking. Assassins did not become famous for their head on strategies and brutish nature, they did it by not getting caught after slitting some guys throat. 

Of course, he didn’t really understand or want to do underhanded, dirty tactics. Never ever liked doing stuff like that. 

But the war would not let him live out his beliefs. If he had to make buddy buddy in order to gut them later on, so be it. His dreams could haunt him off of this damn boat.

“I assume we’re targeting the master and not the servant, right? Cut off the power supply and the machine dies. Makes sense to me.”

“Now Master I can tell you about my past if you&#39;d like as well but you don&#39;t seem to be interested” Claudius didnt care if Coal knew about him or not, but now seemed like the best time to bring up the subject.

“What is interesting are these hamburger things, where&#39;s this lousy waiter at with our food.” Claudius was probably more eager to try out a hamburger then he should have been. Can you blame him though? Such wonderful finger food didn&#39;t exist in his time.

He looked around once again. Thank god, no one was in ear shot it looked like. Coal relaxed in his chair, swirling around the last of his pop. The dark color looked pretty, and the way it foamed with his actions only made it more visually… uh, there’s a word for it. Appealing? That sounded right.

Moments later, their food arrived. The server dropped the plates in front of both men, replacing Coal’s drink yet again. He thanked them as they left and stabbed a fork into the steaming pile of noodles. “Oh, and you can go on about yourself if you want. I still know about jack shit about you, so any info is nice. You’re from the U.S. or something, right? That’s what it is called, yea?”

He slurped on his spaghetti, sauce flying in a controlled area around his bowl. This man was a mess.

He had no hesitation to reach out and get a mouthful of the sandwich. “I must say master these burger things are quite delicious” He then went on to take another bite. It seemed he might just scarf down the whole thing before speaking

Coal would notice that Claudius let out a “tsk” as the name United States was mentioned. “Well that&#39;s what those traitors would call it.” Claudius then took another big bite out of his burger, at this point he was practically stress eating

“Ya see Master I was born and raised in New York, the best of the colonies if I must say.” Claudius tilted his chair on its hind legs, placing his feet up on the table with zero regard for manners, as if he were reminiscing on his past. “I lived in the Americas during the start of a coup on the British throne, led by my own neighbors of course. The short of it is that I protected the throne by killing those who opposed it, and when people caught onto me, I was left to swing from the gallows.” The assassin rubbed at his neck as he mentioned the gallows. Claudius wholeheartedly believed in the cause he died for, but he was still very sore about it.

This ‘British’ place sounded even worse. Jesus, imagine being from a place called something like that. You’d be mocked and humiliated for time upon end. He felt bad for anyone that had to call that place home.

“Sounds like you didn’t do a good enough job then. Not that it matters now, obviously since you’re here that means that Throne thing saw you good enough to keep around. I just hope you’re strong enough to beat whatever the fuck we gotta go against.”

He kept digging into his spaghetti with reckless abandon. Now his face was a mess and a half, spaghetti sauce splattered all around his mouth. He didn’t even bother reaching for a napkin, instead licking his lips and continuing his crusade against the mighty dinner right in front of him.

“Oi not strong enough smart enough, have ya even been listenin’?” It seemed the one thing Claudius just couldn&#39;t get across was mind over matter. Maybe he was just taking things too literally, he decided he wouldn&#39;t inquire further, Coal deserved a break from his harsh antics.

Assassin lifted his burger to his face taking one final big bite making it disappear. Ketchup rolled onto the plate and dripped on his clothes, it was a gross site… his master wasnt to cleanly ethier it seemed.

“So Master is there anything you wish to tell me now? Or should we enjoy our date in peace?”

He grabbed the napkin from his side of the table, pulling it up and letting the other two utensils clatter and clang on the table. He held it up for his servant, “Here. You look like you’ve never heard of ‘cleanliness’ or ‘manners’ or whatever the hell they call them.”

Any ill feelings towards his servant seemed to be gone at this point. This guy held grudges and dropped them on a dime, what kind of thoughts went through his head to enable such drastic changes?

The answer was probably few, if any at all. Typical of a lower ranking thug, sent on odd jobs and collection runs. You don’t get the position of ‘roughing people up’ by thinking things through all the way. 

Claudius had his work cut out for him, being about all of the brains of this operation. How would these two get anywhere at all with a meat sack of a master roaming the streets? However they did it, it was gonna be a rough time...
