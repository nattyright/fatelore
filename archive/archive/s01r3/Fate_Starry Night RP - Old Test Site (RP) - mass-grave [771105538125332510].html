&quot;Ada, that&#39;s our cue. Come on, we  need to cut them off before they reach the labs. I imagine the delivery boy&#39;s got some special package related to the grail. We stop him and we&#39;ll put them behind in their plans! That&#39;s our first step.&quot; Kari tapped Ada on the arm before hopping onto the leyline and flew away at a rapid pace. By her estimation, they could get there easily in five minutes, set up as quick as possible and pounce on them  with an ambush.

Given the route Coal had taken, they would have to cross through the roughy, boggy  terrain of the Mass Graves. Not only did it serve as a stealthy way into the abandoned labs but the residual spent mana leaking from the numerous mystic codes and suits served as an excellent smokescreen for shuttling servants or potent magecraft through without raising suspicion. As such it also made the perfect place to watch for opponents coming. Kari smiled for once as the weather would prove to be on her side with the near-freezing temperatures, high humidity and precipitation. 

As the party of four would come in, they could not shake the feeling of being watched, though impossible to tell if it was from a beast, machine, servant or something else entirely. Perhaps that was just the nature of wandering through a site with restless spirits and decaying servant suits. Always something around in the shadows...

He thought they would get tired or, you know, consider the other half of their group and maybe slow down a step or two. Instead, they kept going at their crazy speed until it was hard to keep up with them.

Coal was in no way out of shape, but every person has their limits. And he was starting to find out his. Turns out, it started and ended around the Mass Grave Site. The place gave him the creeps, not only because of what sat inside but what it represented. A city built for the sole reason of creating the perfect S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, only to be forgotten and left to the dogs when its purpose was all but exhausted. 

“Hey, can we take a breather? And, you know, turn around?!” He called out to Caster. Or at least tried to, he was starting to lose his breath. Cold air burned his lungs, every small breeze freezing the very sweat building up at the edge of his hairline. At least it kept him from overheating, but that was never the concern in the first place. 

“You hear me?! I’m freezing my ass off back here and we’ve wandered into this hell hole! This place sucks, can we go someplace else?!” If only he knew how the hell they rode on those leyline things, he’d be having a much better time right now...

Whoops. That was a wrong turn. He hadn&#39;t expected to turn up at Persepolis&#39; dreaded testing zone of all places. Just like its name implied, the graves was Persepolis&#39; singular dead zone. Not for the burial of humans, but a gigantic dumpster for decommissioned S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames. There were no buildings to hide in, and no crowds to blend in. No one in their right mind would even want to come here without a good reason.

It was literally the worst place to be right now.

But he wasn&#39;t going to go down without a good fight! Tapio dived into a pile of broken S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, taking full advantage of his small stature to hide among these vaguely humanoid chassis. The last he checked, Aratron&#39;s terraforming capabilities only worked on things related to the earth. Manipulating anything else actually took time, and he was betting on the small chance. If he managed to avoid Caster long enough, maybe they would give up and give in to his demands!

It was then that they reached the mass grave, a hole littered with S.E.R.V.A.N.T. and human corpses alike. The stench was terrible, but Aratron couldn&#39;t sense it. Instead, he felt more perturbed by the leakage of mana in the air. Could Persepolis not even handle its trash correctly? So much dead mana in one spot was a recipe for disaster. They were lucky there weren&#39;t any necromancers around.

It seemed like Tapio was more akin to a raccoon than a capybara, being anything but chill as he dug himself into the trash to use it as a hiding spot. His acts would make any trash pandas feel proud, if only they weren&#39;t extinct.

Aratron did not find this childish maneuver entertaining.

&quot;...Seven. Time is up, student. There will be no extensions to this deadline.&quot; He said in a threatening tone as he raised his arm. Tapio thought he was safe, but he felt a tremor from underneath him. It seemed to be specific to his area. Instead of doing things the hard way and morphing the junk protecting him, Aratron had just decided to terraform the ground underneath all that junk! Tapio had trapped himself in a tomb of trash.

But then the tremors stopped. Instead, he felt something whiz past him. He was scared shitless, wondered if that was Aratron&#39;s doing, before thinking on it a bit more: Why would his grumpy Servant ever bother using something cool like a gun? That definitely didn&#39;t seem like Caster.</span>

Coal didn&#39;t even see it coming. A bullet had his name on it...until he too felt a tremor and lost his balance from fatigue. He slipped on the ground as the bullet flew just past him, having now lost its target.

&quot;Show yourself.&quot; Aratron cryptically shouted at empty air. &quot;I am in the middle of reprimanding someone, if you cannot tell. I also need the other human alive, for we were in the middle of a discussion. Leave, and no harm shall befall you. Keep attacking us, and I cannot guarantee your safety.&quot; 

Coal and Tapio were confused. Someone was attacking them? It seemed crazy for an ambush to be setup at the mass grave, especially since Coal was Assassin&#39;s Master! Who else would be despicable enough to plan a sneak attack like this?

Regardless, Aratron did not seem pleased.

&quot;...I am even willing to ignore the fact that you almost struck at my student. Had that bullet hit, <strong>I would have razed this place to the ground.</strong>&quot; Caster snarled as he motioned for Coal to get closer. Better to stick together than split up against an invisible foe, even if that meant sticking around Aratron. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And now Caster was shaking the ground willy nilly! Didn’t he know better than to disturb the dead and… whatever the fuck you wanted to call all these robotic parts. Was a deactivated Servant Frame a dead person or just a broken machine? Coal had little time and patience to consider such a stupid question.

But the shaking of the ground <em>did</em> throw off his balance, bringing his slowing pace to an end. It took a fraction of a second longer for his foot to hit the ground, which threw off everything about his movement. He wasn’t able to stop himself from moving forward, but he did go down and he went down harder than he would’ve liked. Now he was covered in the dirt and mud and laying on random scrap.

But at least he wasn’t dead. Apparently. Caster’s words did little to bring him comfort. Someone had just tried to kill him? Couldn’t they at least be up front and honest about it? You know, say some cheesy line before putting a bullet right between his eyes sort of honest. Not whatever the hell just happened.

And he was out in a pretty open area. The worst spot for any long range fights. He kept low to the ground, following Caster’s motion to close the distance between them. 

“Hey,” he whispered loudly, “any idea what’s going on? Someone shooting at us? You’re kid really dragged us to the absolutely worst spot if someone’s taking pot shots at us!” 

AND he was getting colder by the second. His shivering was back, even worse than before. Not enough to make things impossible, but his magic was surely shot to shit. He attempted to create a Flashbang in the palm of his hand to test this. The form of it flickered in and out of existence before failing all together. Coal cursed quietly, waiting for Caster to give him just about anything to work with.

Even worse they had been led to some gross dump. It was putrid and littered with corpses and discarded servant frames. Claudius scoffed at the grotesque sight, it seemed people haven&#39;t changed much from the past few centuries 

Claudius’s reflection on the past was interrupted as a projectile went straight for his master. Before Claudius could react Coal was already on his ass safe from whatever was thrown his way. Assassin couldn&#39;t help but feel a little grateful for Caster at the moment.

This place really gave Claudius the creeps and the mystery assailant wasn&#39;t helping. The assassin pulled his knife and brass knuckles from under his coat standing firmly at Coals side. “This isn&#39;t a good Master, the opponent is clearly in a very advantageous spot, despite having Caster here, my suggestion is to try and secure your safety with haste.”

Claudius gritted his teeth just thinking about someone else trying to get a surprise attack in on him. That was his thing, how dare someone try to out assassin him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While most masters would consider it insane to be on the front line fighting where their servants should be, Kari was the exception.  The two pairs of master and servant may not know it at the time, but Kari was far closer to them than Ada was. It was a risky move for sure to be closer to two enemy servants but in a place like the Mass Graves, she had the advantage by far. All she had to do was maintain it and victory was surely hers. 

However, the nice and orderly plan they had put together was already starting to fall apart as instead of scattering in response to the sniper fire, the targets had now clustered together and there was a kid there as well. What the hell was the Mafia thinking, sending this stupid group out towards the Labs? And why was their delivery boy escorted by two servants and a child. Something wasn&#39;t adding up and it was starting to give Kari a headache as she debated following through on the plan and punishing them for their mistake or giving them a chance to turn around. 

She sighed and then picked up a microphone.

Suddenly, one of the discarded S.E.R.V.A.N.T. suits near the group began to spit static as somebody attempted to use its speakers remotely.  After a second of tuning noises, a heavily filtered voice began to speak. 

&quot;Coal Thompson, I know who you are and who you work for. As you just saw, I can more than easily take you out. However, I will give you this one chance to renegade from the Mafia. I do not know what you plan to do with the kid and the Fake Grail but send him back now before he ends up another casualty in your boss&#39;s twisted plans. I&#39;ll even make the choice easier for you...&quot; the voice cut out as the wet ground in front of them erupted in a patch of icy thorns that would be near impossible to move through. Only Caster would be able to detect a faint line of mana trailing off from that patch to some location. The sign was brief, evaporating like a fuse cord. Whoever they were up against was a professional magus...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio felt the ground rattle, tremble and shake - and felt much regret. Just like he had predicted, Aratron didn&#39;t go through the trouble of transmuting the junk around him. Not because it was too much of a challenge, but because the trash heaps were sitting right above a boundeless supply of perfectly good earth! He had become a sitting duck, with movements hindered by the very trash he wanted to exploit as Caster&#39;s wall of stone erupted all around him.

And then the tremors stopped. There was no wall, no cage, no nothing. Confused, Tapio pushed away a few broken mannequins and stuck his head out-

A bullet zipped past his face, missing him by a hair&#39;s breadth as it made a beeline for the ones behind him. A trail of residual mana burst in the bullet&#39;s wake, giving Tapio&#39;s cheek a sharp whip that sent him tumbling back into the trash.

What the hell was that? That boy poked his head back out again like a garden eel. He wanted to catch a glimpse of their mystery assailant, but then the ground erupted as a bed of ice spiked from the ground. A creepy, staticky voice started speaking somewhere among the trash, and Tapio was starting to get a little spooked.

He only knew of one person who had a mechanical voice like that. Could Caster actually be right? Was the Tin Can Man actually coming back to hunt him down?

<em>...Not if he could get the jump on him first!</em>

Maybe Caster would be less paranoid if Tapio could prove himself, and what better way to do that than to confront the root of the problem?

Tapio quietly shrank back into the trash and started digging his way through to where the voice was coming from.

He was also aware of the ironic situation that it was an Assassin being ambushed instead of the other way around. Even worse, it just got a whole lot colder and painful to move around. What a terrible way to potentially die.

But at least the person jumping them wasn’t entirely in the know. In fact, Coal would argue that they might be the stupidest people around here. “Hey buddy, what the FUCK makes you think I got the grail? If I had that shit I would’ve used it by now, no questions asked! I’m Mafia but I’m not braindead!”

Or perhaps they were just using that excuse as reason enough to brain him, true or not. Wouldn’t say he could blame them, considering some of the nasty shit his side has done before. The other side ain’t as noble as they thought themselves though so that made no sense. The entire situation at hand still didn’t make sense to him, but he did know one thing. 

He wasn’t gonna go down without a fight.

“And you got another thing comin’ if you think I’m gonna let you kill me that easily! I ain’t losing this war because I don’t got a choice <em>but</em> to win! I’d beat the shit outta you any day of the week, so show yourself before I whoop Gunner’s ass!”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron felt rather unsatisfied by his assailant&#39;s way of handling things. Not only did they refuse to show themselves, but they indulged in theatrics, such as communicating via audio devices. He sighed as Coal got verbally beaten down and threatened, before the puddles around them erupted into icy spikes. The rain water had been solidified at an incredibly rapid rate. Far more powerful than any weather shift. The stench of mana in the air was the icing on the cake.

They were dealing with a mage. A competent one at that.

How <em>dull.</em>

&quot;...It is rather impolite of you to not address my terms, magus. Were you taught to respond to questions with questions? How boorish.&quot; Aratron replied, making his disdain quite apparent. &quot;Were this an oral exam, you would have most likely scored below an F. May I recommend a refresher on sociological studies? You most likely have a sizable library, considering the little charade you pulled off just now.&quot;

He poked at the ice spikes with his shoes.

Caster then turned to Coal, finding his brief outburst rather amusing. &quot;As my temporary associate said, we do not have the Grail in our possession. If we did, then we wouldn&#39;t be here. Also, I find your claims rather hard to believe: If you really saw Mr. Thompson as a potential ally, <strong>then why did your Servant aim at their heart?</strong>&quot;

There was a brief moment of silence.

&quot;I am afraid you should learn your place, dear magus. Perhaps, consider my earlier proposal: Leave us alone, have your Servant retreat, and your life shall be spared. I have no intention of fighting other contestants just yet. If you continue being an annoyance, however...&quot;

Aratron tapped at the ice once again. Kari felt something odd, as she saw the spikes started to morph and tear off from the ground. Something was controlling them, morphing their properties as they were being combined with nearby junk, Mystic Codes and terrain. Eventually, a figure emerged...</span>

Your signature&#39;s stench was so horrid that it would be <em>impossible not to sense it.</em>&quot; Aratron shrugged, lecturing Kari on her magical expertise while his icy golem towered next to him.

&quot;I hope you do appreciate a golem in your image, however. Made out of materials from your latent mana signatures. In other words, <strong>they have a good sense of where your general location is.</strong>&quot; 

The frigid knight started to move. They were walking forward. If Kari were observant, she would notice that it was walking straight towards her hiding spot.

&quot;Shall you come out, little magus? Or shall you leave us in peace? I am fine with either option, but surely there is one that favors you more? Go on. I&#39;ll wait.&quot; Aratron taunted. He then turned to Coal, glanced at Claudius and whispered to them.

&quot;Assassin. Protect your Master. It is your duty, is it not? I still have matters to attend to.&quot; Aratron groaned, staring at the pile of trash that had been suspiciously agitated throughout the entire speech a few minutes ago. Someone was digging hard enough to shake the trash around them.

&quot;Student! At least approach the enemy Master in a dignified manner! Get out of there, right now!&quot; Caster berated, asking Tapio to come back.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The ice golem was enormous, towering over its creator and their associates while oozing stench from the discarded materials that made up its bulk. It was one of Caster&#39;s less elegant creations, but even they had no room to complain. Function over form, or so they say, especially when they were out in the open, making for easy targets for their crafty assailant. The golem trudged forward like a fortress. It was leading Caster to their hideout!

Unfortunately, perfection is rarely attainable, and even Caster&#39;s magecraft was not exempt. The convenience of making use of their surrounding materials lent their creations to bear both the strengths and weaknesses of those materials. What followed, then, was simply a matter of exploits. 

A bullet caught the automaton square in chest as it moved on the predictable path towards Kari&#39;s hideout, but it did little to hinder its movement. A miscalculation? Did their opponent seriously expect to stop the automaton with nothing but bullets?

But then the bullet morphed, unraveling into black tendrils that latched themselves onto the chest piece. There was a series of small but audible cracks, and then the golem started <em>shedding</em>. 

Bits of earth and ice and mystic code shards chipped away from its joints with each step it took, almost as if the materials themselves have become too <em>brittle</em> to withstand the friction generated by their movement. Then a second bullet punched itself into the golem and exploded.

There was a bump, and then a crack, and the golem crumbled like a cookie right in front of Caster&#39;s eyes. But things did not stop there.

It felt as if the temperature around him had dropped by at least another ten degrees in the short amount of time he had to recoup. Why was it always him? Why didn&#39;t anyone else seem to be affected as much-

And then he looked down and saw that his feet was encased in a chunk of ice. In place of the bullet that had missed him by inches now lay a small broken vial discharging some sort of mana-rich liquid that froze anything upon contact. And it just so happened that Coal was standing right in the center of its range. 

A bullet that could transmute into other things, or had those things merely been disguised to look like bullets from the start? They were dealing with a trickster sniper with nothing but junk and guts!

Even worse they were being shot at from an unknown location. The only positive in this situation was that the opponents seemed to want something from Coal. Maybe they could leverage that even if Coal didn&#39;t have what they were looking for

“Ya think I woulda just let him die?” Claudius asked not liking how Aratron spoke to him, Claudius couldn&#39;t stand know-it-alls, Aratron really just didn&#39;t sit well with Claudius to begin with. “Fuckin idiot” he mumbled under his breath then watching the Ice golem spring to life 

Although Claudius hated flashy displays of magic, he was glad to have it on his side, Caster had managed to successfully disarm the spikes at their feet, and weaponize them all the while.

Unfortunately it seemed that the Ice golem would be a short lived endeavor, but that wasn&#39;t the end of it. Standing close to his master&#39;s side Claudius felt the cold air hovering around Coal. Looking towards his Master it seemed things were continuing to take a turn for the worse. Claudius needed to do something and quick

If the enemy was sniping them from an unknown location the logical thing to do was to break line of sight. Claudius reached into his jacket pulling his hands out only to drop several bombs around him and his allies creating a ring of smoke which would obstruct anyone&#39;s view towards the inside. 

As the bombs hit the floor Claudius would whip out his pistol firing around Coals feet to free him from the ice, yanking him out of the frozen area before his feet could freeze over again. “Master, they want something from ya, maybe we can play on that to keep them from killing ya if worst comes to worst… but our main objective should be shaking off their advantage … we best think fast the smoke will only stay for a few seconds”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">$Kari was rather pleased with her little speech, hopefully with Ada and her demonstrations of power, the invading party would reconsider their actions and at least send the one pair back. Having a kid in the crossfire, even if he was currently dumpster-diving was the last type of complication Kari needed with this whole situation. Of course, her little plan fell apart right away as both Coal and that one servant misinterpreted her ultimatum, worse the latter one was basically ridiculing her for it and asking a stupid gotcha question! 

It was worsening her headache and they could hear her groan over the speaker. To add injury to insult, what she assumed was Caster turned her own magecraft against her and turned them into an icy giant intent on exposing her spot. God, everything was spiraling out of control like it always did with even her best plans. 

<em>Damn it, damn it, damn it!</em> She couldn&#39;t move because the golem would just change its direction and Assassin could intercept but if she stayed still it would lead right to her and even if she could melt it, the enemy could have cornered her. She knew something was going to go wrong today but she should have known it would have been everything! She hated the mess but it was looking more and more like she would have to embrace it and make it worse for her benefit somehow. 

Though there was one saving grace to the whole situation. Ada was becoming more and more reliable by the day and nowhere was that more apparent by neutralizing the golem with a single shot. Alright things could improve from here, but first a retort was desperately needed and people needed to be put in place.</span>

However, it seems you are either really good at playing stupid or you&#39;re actually stupid and decided to wander around a prime smuggling spot. Either way, Coal you&#39;re going to get what&#39;s coming for you...&quot; An eerie silence followed though nothing happened. 

&quot;As for you, Caster. I do not care for your opinion or threats. This is not a place for your master to be and I simply want him to leave before he gets hurt - Hey don&#39;t touch that, dumbass! It&#39;s rigged to -&quot; 

The voice suddenly cut out as Tapio finally found the source of the speaker, an relatively intact servant suit. Unfortunately as he got close to it, he triggered a trip wire that caused a white hot jet of flame to erupt from its core as it burned up what little mana left and started causing violent chemical reactions within. Tapio would have to act quick before his face or rear got char-broiled. Caster would no doubt be able to hear the sizzling of the flame from outside.


Kari cursed as the kid accidentially triggered the curiosity trap. While she hated the thought of using that as a distraction, if she didn&#39;t regain the upper hand, she would likely have to kiss her goals good bye and the thought of letting down her father one last time was one thing she could never accept. And it was a perfect time to use one last part of the original plan...</span>

They flew towards them with a terrible whistling sound and at great speed before shattering with a crack like lightning. Two cones of sharpened hail, from the left and the right converged over the Assassin Team&#39;s head and pelted them mercilessly, even if it wasn&#39;t an exact hit. The accompanying downdraft of wind from both sides made quick work in flattening the smoke screen, letting Ada and Kari be able to at least see outlines of their opponents now. 

Though Kari still had one last devious trick up her sleeve that she was saving. She took a few empty vials from her belt and began siphoning off some of her coolant into them. She wouldn&#39;t use them yet but they would prove an excellent rebuttal to Caster&#39;s arguments at some point. There was enough chaos for now...

Jesus christ, could today get any fucking worse with an arrogant Caster, a kid who thought he was invincible, a servant who was about ten levels below where a servant should be, a random ass noble brat who thought themselves hot shit and a Sniper (probably a Servant who fuckin’ knew) that was god knows where?!

Yes, actually. He found it hard to feel his toes. He looked down to see that as a matter of fact, his feet were now surrounded by ice. That explained a lot, but it didn’t help his already worsening attitude. Even the idea of counting numbers was out of the question. Today was a ‘be pissed off at the whole world’ day. 

Thankfully, Claudius was way ahead of him. A few smoke bombs and pistol shots later and he was freed. And standing. Not sure how the latter was going to help them, but he was up and still freezing. The reduced line of sight was helpful but as soon as it went down he was a goner. How the hell was he getting out of this one?

Well, one thing came to mind. It was incredibly stupid and was more than likely not going to work. In fact, one would even call it suicide. But pretty much every idea had to be considered at this point, even the ones that seemed absolutely awful.

“I got a real stupid idea,” he started, pushing the both of them to the very outer edge of the smoke screen. “You can turn into people you’ve seen, yea? What if the world was given a second Coal? Make it a coin toss to get the right one.”</span>

The smoke shrinking in total area was a bitch and a half, though. Looks like something had to be done, and now. “Caster, got literally anything to keep that Sniper off of us?! Or better yet, see where that ice came from?” he yelled.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Of course not. Do not disappoint me.&quot; Aratron replied to Claudius&#39; snarls. He didn&#39;t care much for Assassin, or other Servants in general. They were just mere familiars in his eyes. However, he had no qualms with them, as long as they valued their masters&#39; lives. There was no purpose to a Servant willing to backstab their own master. Unfortunately, that was a trademark of the Assassin class.

Not that Aratron had time to waste babysitting Claudius, for his golem had bit the dust in just a few minutes. The weapon was...a bullet? No, two bullets, that had somehow cracked the familiar&#39;s sturdy body and corrupted their armor into a state of brittleness. Definitely not the work of a magus, considering that his golem was made out of the same magecraft that Kari had utilized moments ago. Yet the difference between the bullet and Kari&#39;s own mana was like night and day.

He was dealing with a Servant. One intent on confronting them from afar, without revealing themselves.

Saber was the annoying demon from the docks, Lancer was the boisterous Achaean from the mansion lane. Assassin was right next to him while Berserker was most likely Szrac&#39;s Servant. He had never seen Rider before, but he did remember a gigantic vehicle crashing at the docks and forcing him to retreat for his student&#39;s safety. With the current information on hand, that was most likely Rider.

Therefore...

<em><strong>Archer.</strong></em>

Archer and their Master, members of the aristocracy no doubt. The Master&#39;s arrogant tone and Coal&#39;s reactions definitely bolstered that image. That would explain his opponent sniping him from long distances. 

Then came the ice, the smoke and the wind. Coal had been frozen, thawed out and lambasted with air currents while the enemy master kept spewing more conceited and self-absorbed words. Words that Aratron had already heard long ago. Humans never changed.</span>

&quot;You misunderstand, <strong>Archer&#39;s Master.</strong>&quot; Aratron called out his opponent&#39;s identity. &quot;That wasn&#39;t a threat. <strong>That was an order.</strong> You will stand down, or your Servant will <strong>perish today</strong>. Granted, it is probably too late to make amends now.&quot;

He glared at the pile of junk in front of him. Archer&#39;s Master abruptly cut off just when Tapio&#39;s movement had stopped, most likely revealing that the foolish student had triggered a foolproof trap in a most foolhardy manner. <em>Fool.</em>

But of course, Caster would still save him. No matter the cost. He couldn&#39;t do it alone, so he would have to rely on Assassin&#39;s help in that regard.

&quot;Assassin, we are dealing with an Archer. I do not know their location, but their bullets have special properties. They were able to destroy my golem in two hits, but they didn&#39;t &#39;destroy&#39; it, per se. It merely collapsed on its own, as if the bullets had fundamentally altered its structure.&quot; Aratron explained, while sensing a burning smell from the trash pile where Tapio was buried.

&quot;The ice was most likely Archer&#39;s doing as well. In other words, even if their bullets miss, they are still <strong>dangerous.</strong> Archer&#39;s Master also seems to be a trained mage: They summoned those icicles and the wind currents are most likely their doing as well. The mana signatures behind those two spells were identical.&quot; Caster revealed their enemies&#39; respective specialties. A prodigious magus and a sniper with morphing bullets. It seemed like Claudius was far from being the only assassination expert here.

&quot;...Frankly, you two are completely outmatched: Assassin is out in the open and lost his surprise advantage against Archer, so his defeat is inevitable. I am also sorry to say that Archer&#39;s Master seems to be on a different level of thaumaturgical power compared to you.&quot; He stared at Coal, being as blunt as possible. The man would make a mental note to <em>never</em> go to Caster for pep talk.</span>

&quot;However,&quot;

&quot;<strong>Archer&#39;s Master is not my concern.</strong> Also, they are still <strong>human.</strong> My main priority is my student&#39;s survival, and the biggest threat to that has already shown itself...&quot;

Aratron turned away and pointed at the far distance. It wasn&#39;t an accurate indication by any means, since he could be pointing at empty air for all he knew, but the message was clear.

<em>&quot;Are you ready to repent, Archer?&quot;</em>

&quot;In other words, leave Archer to me. You may be a mediocre magus, but you have Assassin at your disposal. Combine your strengths, and you might just be able to beat Archer&#39;s Master. They should be child&#39;s play without Archer backing them up.&quot; Aratron explained his strategy. He could have been nicer about it, but it felt sound. Master magus or not, Assassin was still a Servant. There was no way he would let a normal human beat him.

Before Aratron could make his move, however, he had to rescue his impertinent student.

Or, to be more accurate, he had <em>already started</em> rescuing them. Exactly two minutes ago, right when his speech began. While he had been explaining his strategy to Coal, another familiar was already making a beeline for the capricious student... <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

All he knew was that he had found the source of the speaker, tripped into something (that was long gone), which caused the speaker to ignite and start burning the trash around him. Seemed like it belonged to an old S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. But why would it blow itself up if he touched it? They were deactivated ages ago! No way someone would set one up as a tra--

<em>Oh.</em>

Well, that was just great. Now what? Tapio might be able to pass off for a raccoon with his digging in skills, but his digging out skills were another thing entirely, especially when he was already sweating bullets. He desperately tried to remember any spell in his alley that could get him out of this precarious situation. Maybe something Aratron taught him? What was the last thing he learned?

The creature kept snarling, resembling a miniature shark. A piranha of some sort. However, something interesting was connected to them: A rope made out of an old fishing rod.

Half of a boat, seemingly from the docks, crashed down into the ground, sending metal shrapnel flying everywhere. More pertinently, the gasoline that fueled the boat began to pour out, creating a very pertinent fire hazard. Especially when one considered that portions of the boat were already alight. 

How did it even get there? Nobody could say. They could say, however, it was a problem.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">AHA! Ignoring Caster really paid off! Tapio couldn&#39;t believe how easy it was to locate the source of the staticky voice. Caster and Assassin had been brandishing their magic mumbo jumbo out there, yet he managed to do what they couldn&#39;t with nothing but a pair of keen ears and some reliable digging! That oughta teach them who&#39;s superior!

Okay, fine, he hadn&#39;t really located their mystery assailant. What he had found was only a proxy, a small speaker tacked onto the chassis of a broken S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. But it was still better than nothing. To take all the credit for himself would be incredibly selfish! If he took the speaker back to Caster, then they&#39;ll be sure to know what to do with it.

Tapio made a grab for the speaker...

<strong>Boom!</strong>

A small jet of flames shot out from within the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, causing a series of sparks as it ate up the residual mana in the frame. Burning hot trash bit Tapio&#39;s hand. The boy snapped his hand back, hissing and coughing and tearing up as the smell of burning trash filled the small pocket of space under the trash heap.

Shit, shit! He&#39;d been caught in a booby trap! It was...clever! But it sure didn&#39;t feel good to be on the receiving end of it! The flame licked and crawled along any burnable surface it could grab, and Tapio found himself in a pickle: while he was still largely unaffected for now, once the flame got to his coat and burned it all up, then it would really be game over!

Then the trash overhead started moving as the most ugly familiar he&#39;d ever seen crawled in through the cracks. To look at it was an insult to the eye, but the creature was keen for attention. It snarled and gurgled as it wiggled its ugly tail in front of Tapio...was that a fishing rod?

Caster&#39;s smelly familiar, coming to the rescue!

Oh how far their creations had fallen from grace! Though Tapio was in no position to laugh. He grabbed onto the rope, ready to be reeled back out of the burning heap, but then...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Then he&#39;d have gone back to Caster with nothing to show for his small excursion! He&#39;d be the laughing stock of Caster&#39;s familiars for days, weeks even! 

This simply would not do!

&#39;Wait!&#39; Tapio yanked the smelly fish familiar back. He gritted his teeth, then plunged his hands into the burning S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame and tied the rope around its ankle. It was his spoil of the war, and he wasn&#39;t going back without it.

&#39;Take this fire hazard out of here first! Your creator should be able to patch it up if it&#39;s powered by magic.&#39; He wasn&#39;t sure if the familiar could even understand his words, but he tried anyway. &#39;I&#39;ll be right behind you.&#39; 

<em><strong>As if!</strong></em>

Once the source of the fire was gone, he could happily go back to tunneling!

Tapio grabbed a handful of 4-sided dice from his pouch and started speaking into them. He then used the utter chaos outside as the perfect cover, poked his head out of the hole the familiar had created, and started flinging those dice in every direction possible. 

&#39;<strong>There you are!</strong>&#39;

&#39;<strong>I fooooound you!</strong>&#39; 

&#39;<strong>I&#39;m right behind you~!</strong>&#39; 

&#39;<strong>Tag, and you&#39;re it!</strong>&#39;

Each little die started speaking in Tapio&#39;s voice as they fell from the sky and landed everywhere. The voice was loud and crystal clear, with none of the static from a radio transmission. To anyone within earshot, it would sound as if the boy was right next to them and talking to them in person. 

Prerecorded messages, in a miniature bounded field! Tapio was hoping to catch their mystery assailant by surprise and get a reaction out of them! This would narrow down their search tenfold. Of course, he had no idea where that hunk of flaming metal came from, but it only further convinced him that tunneling was the way to go. After all, nothing can get the jump on him if he didn&#39;t even perceive it in the first place!

So what was it going to be this time? Another freeze charm? A mana bomb? Something even more sinister?

But then the bullet ricocheted off the metal shell of the boat just like any ordinary, non-enhanced bullet one could easy purchase by the dozens at the mafia-run markets. And just like any ordinary bullet, sparks went flying as it grazed the boat. They landed on the gasoline leaking ever so generously from the boat&#39;s fuel tank...

The boat exploded in a shower of heatwaves and shrapnel that made the mini missile rain over Coal&#39;s head look like a total joke. Forget leaving Archer to Caster, if Caster left them now, then there wouldn&#39;t even be a Coal Thompson, or even an Assassin left to look for Archer&#39;s Master!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The plan may have fallen apart right at the beginning  as Kari completely failed to understand who she was facing, but what was starting to take shape was a beautiful form of chaos that fit into Ada and her plans surprisingly well. Even with the four&#39;s attempts otherwise, they were still on the defensive and and half of them being purely passive. 

It was almost kinda sad watching Assassin team struggle in the open.  They were being purely passive in nature which was going to get them eliminated soon if they didn&#39;t change. 

What was concerning was that Caster was now going to attempt to focus down Archer and force Kari to contend with a servant and a master by herself. That was a terrifying prospect to be sure. But also if she threw Caster off his trail completely, she would have to deal with two servants at once which was even worse. There was no way she could handle all of them at once, even in this terrain. What was worse was that Tapio&#39;s little messages were a bit too close for comfort. They would need a stroke of luck to score a decisive victory of any sort here.  


As unlikely as it was, their chance came crashing down from the sky in a rain of fire. A ruined boat brought to an unlikely final resting place and primed to let off one final blaze of fury as marked by the giant who sent it. Kari had no idea how it got there all of a sudden but the implications were horrible. She had always hated fire as it had a way of being uncontrollable in the way liquids were not, it was wild and responded to its own internal wind. A constant rebellion to the order around it which reminded her of a certain servant...</span>

And that&#39;s when a terrible idea popped into her head. Fire was dependent on two things: fuel and oxygen, the latter of which carried by wind that sufficiently large fires could suck in. All Kari had to do was make the whole thing spin. 


Almost dropping a few vials as he rapidly encased them in ice, Kari rushed to the top of the pile and fired off four diamond-shaped projectiles towards the fire. They took on odd paths as each sought to place itself at a cardinal direction around the explosion and then explode with a crack of wind towards each other in a loop. Sure Kari had recklessly exposed herself in her dark red coat but what was going to happen next was all worth it.


The resulting air current from her attack that soared over her enemies head made the whole blaze start to take on a more cylindrical shape as hot air started chasing cold air and vice versa in a feedback loop that threatened to get out of control very quickly. At the ground level, there was a sucking sound as air began to be violently pulled towards the emerging flame tornado and the Assassin team had a very unfortunate front seat to the unfolding chaos.</span>

The shark familiar didn&#39;t quite like Tapio&#39;s attitude, but it reluctantly obeyed. It wasn&#39;t in their style to attack their Master, after all. Tapio watched as the fish dragged the burning S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame away, saving Tapio&#39;s life and giving him ample time to continue his chase underground.

Of course, once the shark emerged with the frame in tow, Aratron could not help but feel disappointed.

&quot;Worthless familiar. Return to scrap.&quot; He exclaimed with disdain, the shark giving one last <em><strong>grrrrr</strong></em> before crumbling to pieces. On the bright side, it seemed like Tapio was doing fine, albeit Aratron wished that his student would just come back to the surface, where it was safer.

But was it really?

First, a gigantic ship crashed around the piles of scrap. It was on flames, yet Caster remembered that intricate design: It no doubt came from the docks, a place Caster hadn&#39;t really visited save for that brief encounter with--

<em>Them.</em>

&quot;I <em>knew</em> that this discount brand Saber would end up being a nuisance.&quot; Aratron sounded disgruntled, but before he could get rid of the ship himself, someone else did it for him. Archer took advantage of Caster&#39;s momentary distraction and fired another of their &#39;magic bullets&#39;. It made the boat leak, the gasoline being filtered out as sparks flew from a sudden ricochet.

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

Caster was glad that his ears were made of stone, because most humans in the vicinity would have received permanent hearing damage. Heatwaves and shrapnel started to rain from the sky, putting Coal and Assassin in jeopardy. Kari took this chance and summoned another air current, absorbing the blazes and creating a gigantic tornado of flame. This treacherous combo could very well spell the demise for Coal and Assassin, unless...</span>

&quot;Is this what modern magecraft has come to? A warm summer breeze is hardly something worth worrying about.&quot; Aratron sighed, as if tired of Kari&#39;s attacks. He had seen everything he needed to see.

&quot;Back to extracurricular lessons with you! If you intend to incinerate me on the spot, then I shall double my radiance and completely <em>vaporize</em> you!&quot; Caster shouted, raising his hand as the entire scrapheap started to shake. Kari could feel the tremors from her hiding spot. Something was coming. A familiar was being created from the junk around them! What sort of terrifying form would it take?</span>

.....

A giant...fan for arms? It was a mass of broken fans that had been discarded by Persepolis&#39; numerous citizens. They were recycled and remade under this odd looking golem. It towered above Aratron by several feet, but what could such a sorry excuse for abstract art even do? The tornado of flames got even closer...

<em>whirrrr</em>

The fan started spinning. Slowly, slowly...

It was pathetic.

Yet Aratron stood tall and firm. His arms were crossed, implying full confidence. Kari felt like it was a bluff.

But it wasn&#39;t. The fan&#39;s rotation increased with every second. It was subtle, but noticeable. Every full spin led to a speed increase. Until...

...The wind currents were starting to rival the tornado. The fiery mass of the destruction was being pushed back by wind itself! It was now spinning back, towards its point of origin: The destroyed ship. Kari would sigh with relief, before realizing that the tornado had grown so massive that it risked sucking her in as well, despite her hiding spot being further away from the ship. Her own magecraft risked to be her own undoing, unless she defused the tornado.

It seemed easy. <em>Too easy.</em> But in reality, Aratron had an ulterior motive.

&quot;Assassin, look out for any nearby gunfire. Call me if you see anything suspicious.&quot; Caster said with his arms still crossed. He was waiting. Waiting for his true target to show themselves.

<em>&quot;Shoot my golem. I dare you. I&#39;m waiting for you to do it.&quot;</em> He thought in his head. *&quot;You may be able to shoot at us from a safe distance, but how long can you keep it up before I triangulate your position? There&#39;s only a few positions around here that give a human a perfect view of the entire area. You have been firing bullets while I was distracted, but this time, <strong>I&#39;ll be expecting it.</strong>&quot;

&quot;Fire away, Archer. That is what will spell your doom.&quot; Aratron whispered under his breath, staring at his golem as he waited for its eventual demise.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Coal pulled Claudius to the side to explain his plan Claudius would place a finger to Coals lips. Claudius was deep in concentration, waiting and listening. Claudius did however hear Coals plan, he would be able to observe that Claudius had already taken on his shape.

And then the very thing Claudius wanted to happen, happened. Two projectiles came flying in from opposite directions. It was clear to him that whoever was trying to snipe them had full control over their projectiles, the most likely scenario would have their assailant in the middle of where the Javelins came from, that narrowed it down to two directions. 

To Claudius surprise the Javelins had turned into a rain of hail. Quickly he pulled out his knife and with keen reflexes parried what came, making sure to avoid any deep cuts, watching his master as best as he could to make sure he was safe. Claudius would update his disguise to try and match Coals injuries.

In a much unexpected turn of events a flaming ship crashed down in the middle of the battlefield. Claudius had no idea what happened all he knew was that the boat was not meant for them, it came out of the sky as if somehow had tossed it into the horizon, like one might do with a rock when they’re angry

However, it seemed the flaming boat had created a very opportune situation for Assassin and Coal. Kari would stand atop a hill of garbage creating a blazing vortex to try and suck Coal and Claudius in. With the smoke now cleared and Kari on the move Claudius needed to only glance in the two directions Kari could be in. Claudius grinned as he saw the girl draped in a red coat. Yes that was her, that must be Archers Master.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A problem was still facing Claudius, what would he do about the flaming vortex? Well it seemed Caster was on the job creating a new monster to reverse the tornado&#39;s direction sending it straight for Kari. With Kari now having to worry about her own attack crashing back into her and Archer needing to destroy the giant fan, Claudius knew it was time to disappear 

Looking at Caster, Claudius pointed to Kari showing what he found before grabbing Coal and diving into a pile of trash while the enemies were occupied. Things were looking much better 

“Master” he whispered, cramped close up to Coal in a smelly pile of rubbish. “It seems Archers Master revealed themselves, if Caster can deduce Archer&#39;s position I can safely focus that girl down. In the case we are found before then, as long as I stay looking like you, they&#39;ll have no way of knowing the difference between us” Claudius peered through the garbage as he spoke making sure to keep his eye on Kari.
 
All he needed was for Caster to get on Archer, that way he could try and dispatch Kari without her Servants interference.

There was a boat, but it blew up, then there were two of him, then Caster summoned a big fan thing to blow away a fuckin fire tornado, and now he was in a pile of trash. It certainly was a chain of events, confusing without any sort of context. He coulda sworn he saw someone in a red coat though…

“Sounds like a plan, Claudius. Good job on spottin’ them. They came out of cover, but good job anyway. Also, where the hell did that boat come from?! I thought they stopped letting servants over near the docks because of that!” 

Coal struggled to think of a way to tactically approach the mage trying to magic them down, but struggled with any sort of approach. The best he could come up with was either smoke bombs or flashbangs, the former proven to be not good enough and the latter potentially still shaky. The explosions and being huddled under some trash was helping with his cold problem, but he still wasn’t sure on it.

“You got any idea how we get close to them, then? And without a smoke bomb, I ain’t relying on that when they beat it so fast. Might have to do a suicide rush, hope we don’t get blasted to bits by the coward Servant or the rich bitch.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio was at a loss.

Mere moments after he had thrown his last recorded die and shrunk back into the trash heap, the outside world exploded. It sounded as if a nuke had been dropped, and he felt the heat and tremor of the earth even as he hide under layers and layers of junk. He was suddenly incredibly thankful for not listening to Caster, though this raised another question.

Weren&#39;t they supposed to be looking for the assassin (ha)? They even had an Assassin with them, and he should be a pro at his job! Tapio didn&#39;t know an Assassin&#39;s job entailed blowing shit up.

When the heat from the outside subsided, Tapio decided it was time to poke his head out again. The giant flaming thing in the middle of the field spelled danger, and he wasn&#39;t interested in waiting for it to come around and suffocate him inside his tunnel. The boy extracted himself from the trash pile and started running opposite to where it was blowing.

Wait, it was coming back around? The fire tornado was <em>alive</em>?

Unaware of the tug of war between Aratron and Kari, Tapio did the only sensible thing he knew and picked up his pace. The tornado was moving at a rather slow pace, and the boy was sure he could outrun it-

He stopped dead in his tracks as he caught a glimpse of a red coat flapping in the heated wind. A stranger on top of a trash heap, a face he&#39;d never seen. A woman who stood in the path of the fire blocking Caster and Assassin from their advance.

&#39;It works! I win!&#39; Tapio fist pumped the air. He had located their assailant before Caster could! 

&#39;You must be working for the Tin Can Man!&#39; He cupped his hands and shouted at the woman in red. &#39;Well, you can leave now! Tell him I said I&#39;m sorry even though I have no idea why I&#39;m even apologizing!&#39;

The flaming tornado did nothing to slow it down as it headed straight towards the golem&#39;s head. Tendrils unraveled themselves as the bullet collided with the fan; they caught on the fan blades and immediately got sucked into the spinning motor in the center, jamming the device until it started creaking and cracking from its own force.

From manpower to wind, steam then electricity, automatons have evolved by leaps and bounds. Yet what these machines have traded for power were ticking bombs in the form of motors and engines. Without them, the entire structure would fall apart, and the golem that was keeping the fire at bay had already lost its only purpose. 

Even if Aratron could clone even more golems from the discarded fans around them, could they keep up with Archer&#39;s bullets?

What they could take solace in, however, was the fact that they had finally pinpointed the bullet&#39;s origin. Its trajectory pointed towards the <span class="mention">#abandoned-labs</span>, which seemed to be in the direction opposite to them and the Master who had revealed herself. 

Aratron had just one problem.

It collided with the golem, destroying its fans as the wind current stopped. The tornado started to resume its former course.

Yet Caster just smiled in response.

<strong>&quot;Found you.&quot;</strong> He raised his hands, forming a window with his index and thumbs as he stared at the direction of the shot. He triangulated Archer&#39;s general position with ease, using the length of his own figures as a reference while also using the burning ship as a landmark. A proficient mage was well versed in mathematics, after all.

&quot;Tch. Far away, just like I had imagined. Thankfully, I came prepared.&quot; Aratron whispered to himself, crouching as the ground beneath him started to shake. Coal and Claudius would be shocked, as they sensed a burning smell from underneath. They then realized what was going on once Aratron grabbed his latest creation from underneath the ground.

He had made a <strong>jet pack</strong> out of scrap!

&quot;Apologies, but this device can only hold my own weight at maximum capacity. It also has only enough fuel for a one way trip.&quot; Aratron warned, staring at Coal and Claudius. The message was clear.

&quot;I leave Archer&#39;s Master in your hands. You should have more than enough time to avoid the tornado now. Use it sparingly.&quot; Caster said, ready to head towards the <span class="mention">#abandoned-labs</span> and eliminate Archer once and for all.

But there was a wrench in his plans. He stared back to the tornado and saw someone else standing next to the lady in red from earlier...

&quot;...Student! Stay away! They are much more proficient at magecraft than you!&quot; Aratron warned, but he realized that he was wasting time. If he didn&#39;t move now, Archer would most likely snipe his jet pack and make him a sitting duck.

&quot;Assassin! Protect my student, or you shall pay dearly!&quot; Aratron snarled, before reluctantly leaving. Archer was the bigger threat. He could only hope Assassin would heed his orders.</span>

The kid was now in <em>clear</em> trouble, and he ain’t about to let him play soldier right now. Not with a Sniper gunning them down (granted, Caster was on his way to stop that) and a crazy ass bitch looking to burn them and then throw their corpses a few hundred meters in any given direction.

He didn’t even bother looking to see if Claudius was following, instead making a b-line for Tapio. He had absolutely no idea what the kid was doing there, hooting and hollering to that fuckin Aristocrat. She deserved not even a greeting, not a single peep unless it was followed by about a dozen curses and mean gestures.

He made sure to stay clear of that red hot inferno that was still too close for comfort, hopping over de-activated frames and whatever else was in his path. He focused on Kari, making sure to burn that ugly, smug face into the top of his mind. This was his moment: prove himself as a competent fighter or go down fighting. And he ain’t about to lose to a filthy magus gifted everything in the world and then some.

And he was approaching fast. He took out his box cutter ahead of time, moving the blade to its fullest extension. It’d be awkward if he tripped and gutted himself, but he didn’t know when he would have another chance to get it out without making things harder. Just a little bit further now...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The thing about tornadoes that everyone except Kari seemed to forget is that they don&#39;t just move in straight lines, they curve and sway along the landscape like drunks. And now with that stupid absurdist scultupe of a golem ruined by Ada&#39;s shots, Kari was free to nudge the pillar of flame in Coal and Assassin&#39;s direction. 

While it seemed to first tilt towards Caster, junk and metal from the boat being shot out at all directions at high speed, but then it roared and swung back around to Coal&#39;s direction and rapidly started gaining on him. He could barely hear anything over the wind and embers shooting past his ears. If he kept on his current path, he was going to endanger both Tapio and Kari. 

And that was when a light caught his eye, a icy shard embedded itself in front of his feet and errupted in more ice that snagged his foot and caused him to tumble, a clunky icy boot now attached to his leg. And just to be sure, Kari sent similar projectiles towards the second Coal? who may be Assassin. She didn&#39;t care who was who at the moment but she bet that whichever was more affected by the cold was the real guy. She simply needed to buy some time and let the beacon of destruction she lit bite down on those who would oppose her.

&quot;Hey what the hell are you doing here?&quot; Kari turned to face Tapio, constantly glancing over her shoulder to cast a few icy shards at the Attack of the Coal Clones. &quot;I thought I told you to leave before you got hurt. This really isn&#39;t a place for you, kid.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m  too busy to actually take care of you so either hide in the trash pile behind me or run back to the leyline. I do not care which but I will not shoot you in the back either,&quot; Kari said as she squatted to the ground, seemingly priming some kind of spell.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Claudius was more than happy with the direction of the battle at the current moment. Him and Coal had located Kari and Caster located her Servant. On top of that they could regain the element of surprise as they hid in a heap of trash…. Or so he thought 

Casters words had done enough to irritate Assassin, he had no plans to save Tapio, he just needed to kill Kari. However Coal was more than determined to throw himself out in the open. “WHAT ARE YOU THINKING” Claudius yelled at Coal as he made his heroic sprint towards the enemy. 

Claudius had no choice but to run out after his Master, afterall if Coal died from the oncoming vortex, or Kari’s icy projectiles it would spell the end for him as well. 

It was one problem after the next, as Claudius ran to catch up to his Master Kari would send shards of ice his way, maneuvering away from and parrying them would be no problem, however, it might give away that Claudius was the fake Coal…. If Kari were smart enough to see through that, certainly she would already be able to tell that Coal was the real Master from his bum rush. The best solution was to go about it normally. 

With a knife in one hand and his metal knuckles in the other he made quick work of the oncoming icicles weaving left and right while swiping down any in front of him.

Claudius ran up to coal grabbing him from behind. “Look at the situation you’ve created,” He scoffed, giving his master a scolding. Had Coal forgotten all of the times Claudius told him to fight with his mind? 

There was very little time to react with the tornado coming and the two now being out in the open again, susceptible to Archer. Claudius held Coal like a football and began to run in a semi circle to try and strafe to the side of the violent winds while approaching Kari. “Master get the block off your foot and stay safe, our only option now is for me to fight in the open.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ugh, not again! Heartfelt or not, he had already delivered an apology. It was about the most mature thing one could do, how dare she call him a kid too. 

Not to mention that Aratron had nyoomed past them in a jetpack, shouting something about taking care of an Archer. This only further proved his theory that the Masters of the aristocracy had been in cahoots with each other, with the Tin Can Man acting as the grandmaster and orchestrating the downfall of everyone who had wronged him in the past. Now <em>that</em>, that was childish. Tapio was leagues above him!

&#39;You&#39;re not the boss of me.&#39; Tapio disregarded Kari&#39;s warning, just like all the other Masters and Servants had done so before him. &#39;Caster isn&#39;t here any more, which means he put me in charge.&#39; He proclaimed proudly. And what did Caster do while he was here?

They took action and bossed everyone around!

And that&#39;s precisely what he shall do.

So, instead of scurrying away like a sensible person, Tapio kept up his advance. When Kari held up her hand to shoot, he imagined himself in a game of dodgeball and got ready to jump out of the way. Unfortunately, Kari didn&#39;t even give him the satisfaction of dodging, as her shard of ice missed Tapio by a wide margin and instead went after the Deliveryman and his stunt double instead.

Once again, he had been dismissed.

No no, that&#39;s not the way to go about this! Be magnanimous, Tapio! Show them who&#39;s the real grown up here!

&#39;...Good job distracting our enemy, Assassin and his Master!&#39; Tapio applauded the two, even as one of them clearly struggled under Kari&#39;s siege. &#39;You have paved the way for me to topple the red queen from her throne once and for all.&#39;

That wasn&#39;t half bad, eh?

Tapio ran up the trash mound and used the momentum to launch himself at Kari. He was going to knock them down.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio was either a very brave, very stupid or by some odd chance, both as he charged towards Kari to knock her down from her &quot;throne&quot; and start his own revolt. It was a truly great moment for him, as for once he could be at the center of the action  and not have Aratron lecture him into the ground. It was his time to shine and he took it with great energy, knocking the squatting Kari flat down on the ground.

However, what he didn&#39;t know was Kari&#39;s fingers were pressed on a mana-channelling wire of sorts and when she was tackled, that wire instead connected to a much more potent source of mana: her chest and the dense bundle of artificial circuits within. On top of her, Tapio could feel a disturbing amount of mana rush out from the woman and towards Assassin and his master. 

Coal and Claudius could almost feel the sheer mass of the mana coming their way. Whatever Kari had in store for them was not going to be pleasant in the slightest. But as it got close, that foreboding feeling disappeared for a moment only for the temperature around them to plummet 5, 10 and then 20 degrees as the rain around them instantly froze and that&#39;s when the ground underneath them erupted.

 A storm of icy spikes taller than Claudius shot out all around them, trapping them in near-impassible terrain while a biting wind howled through the gaps, further chilling the temperature-challenged Coal. Meanwhile the tornado behind them twisted and turned erratically as what little guidance Kari had given it had long since faded away. It was impossible to tell where it was going to head next.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Meanwhile, Tapio began to felt a bit weird as the parts of him pressing into Kari&#39;s back seemed to lose their definition and feeling, almost if it was melting slowly. It was surprising how cold the lady felt too, even through her coat. It would not last for long as Kari shoved him off and unsteadily got to her feet. Whatever just happened drained her far more than she wanted. The falling snow around her condensed into five shards of ice that pressed closely together to take a cruciform shape. Tapio would watch as Kari ran a gloved hand over them and shaped them into an elegant, thin-bladed sword. 

&quot;Do you know what you just did?&quot; Kari said, breathing a bit heavy as her cooling system worked to stabilize herself after the discharge of mana. &quot;Your little stunt just blew your chance to get away. So even if you&#39;re a kid, don&#39;t expect me to go easy on you.  I hope you can fight &#39;cause you just screwed up big time..&quot; 

Kari had a cold yet wild look in her eye as she lunged forward with her rapier, aiming to deliver a slash across the chest.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Hey, put me down you fuckin idiot!” Coal screamed. That block of ice limited his movement but not enough to warrant a football carry! He was banging the block onto any and all surfaces, even slamming it onto the ground in a vain attempt to break it.

Which meant nothing once the temperature dropped dramatically. He knew the forecast was bad, but this was by no means a natural happening. His teeth wouldn’t stop clattering together, fingers felt stiff to the touch despite his heavy gloves. This bitch was as cold as ice, no pun intended.

It might’ve been a blessing in disguise, though. He felt a large spike of frozen pain shoot up out of the ground, nearly stabbing him in the side. Similar ice spikes rose all around them, tall and oppressive in sight and in nature. It certainly did not help with his current predicament. Moving around just got a whole lot harder.

“Oh my FUCKING GOD,” Coal wormed his way out of Claudius’s grasp, banging his foot on one of the now readily available hard surfaces. It took a few whacks but ice dust flew everywhere as it finally released its hold on him. It felt a little better not being trapped within ice, but for he knew it was just a matter of time before it happened again.</span>

Fuck this, fuck the bitch and FUCK counting numbers! He was steaming already and the world seemed fine with such an outcome. Hell, it was encouraging such a state of mind at this point! The only thoughts going through his head were the faint instructions to weave past these spikes AND how nice it would be to knock the ever living shit out of the rich bitch.

“I ain’t letting some AristoFUCK push me around any longer! You’re dead as soon as I get over there, you hear me?! Fucking DEAD!” he slammed his fist into a pillar of blue, barely feeling a single thing. A combination of adrenaline-fueled rage and ice-cold temperatures tended to remove any and all feeling in someone’s body.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Dammit Master you’re going to get yourself killed!” Claudius yelled as Coal broke free from his grasp. Coal was too get up in the moment from whatever strong emotions he was feeling. Claudius did however, understand his unnerving will to fight. In life Claudius fought with hatred willing to die if it meant he could kill those who he hated. 

Despite Claudius’s understanding of his Master he still couldn&#39;t condone his actions, “if you break your fists how will you fight!” Claudius needed to get his Master off a self destructive path as well as approach Kari, and now seemed as best of a time as ever. With Tapio as a distraction hopefully Claudius could get to Kari no problem at all. 

“No point in holding out” Claudius mumbled returning to his native form. He gripped the noose around this neck slipping it off to reveal a mangled and scarred piece of flesh. With the noose removed the air would feel heavy and any magus would be able to pick up on the killing intent he carried. Assassin was clearly stronger than he had been before. His Noble Phantasm was not flashy by any means, rather it was meant to be efficient and get the job done 

Claudius pressed his feet into the ground then pushing off with a gust of air behind him, speeding past Coal leaving him in the dust. With knife and brass knuckle in hand Claudius would destroy the spiked terrain as he maneuvered through it. It was easy to tell that Claudius likely couldn&#39;t be held in place with Magecraft 

Claudius honed in on Kari at an impressive speed, if his path wasnt so obvious it would be hard to see where he was going. As Claudius ran up on Kari it seemed Tapio was in danger. It didn&#39;t matter to Claudius as far as he was concerned he could kill her fast enough to intercept the strike.

Brandishing his knife Claudius would appear at Kari&#39;s side thrusting it towards her ribs to try and achieve one clean fatal blow

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Yeah! I just caught you!&#39; Tapio replied excitedly as he hugged what he thought was the woman in red, but then quickly realized that it was nothing but the torso of a discarded S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. Strange. He was sure he had her within his grasp, so what was that jello-like sensation still lingering on his palms?

It was either magecraft, or he had slipped up big time. Thankfully Aratron wasn&#39;t here to grade him this time, so he had all the chances in the world to try again. 

The boy hopped back to his feet just in time to see Kari charge at him with an icy rapier. 

Well, that sure escalated quickly! Tapio lodged his foot in the trash mound and heel flicked the broken arm of a deactivated frame into the air. He caught it in his hands, then brought it up halfway to meet the rapier before it could reach any part of him.

&#39;Who said I&#39;m running away? This is my best chance to prove to Caster that I can take care of myself.&#39; Tapio relished in Kari&#39;s bloodlust, taking it for attention that he had always deserved. He wasn&#39;t so dense to think that he had Kari beat in terms of fighting prowess, but the boy was still treating the fight like a game! A broken mannequin&#39;s arm, against a rapier fortified by magecraft? Did he have a death wish or something?

Tapio was pushed back as the two mages&#39; weapons of choice collided with each other. He hopped a few steps away, wincing as he shook the numbness out of his hand. Despite Kari&#39;s strike, there wasn&#39;t so much as a scratch on the blasted S.E.R.V.A.N.T. arm. Well, more than what it already had, at any rate.

You pack a mean punch, Master of Archer.&#39; Tapio&#39;s eyes were sparkling as he brandished his makeshift club. He barely processed the figure that had appeared at Kari&#39;s side. Assassin had gone in for the kill, but the boy was so fixated at the woman right in front of him that Claudius may as well be a human-sized shadow conjured up by his own imagination.

&#39;And now it&#39;s my turn!&#39; He swung the broken arm back down at Kari.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Prove yourself? You think this is some kind of game to shoot for a high score? We are in a war. People die in these things!&quot; Kari said as she leaned into her strike, pressing her blade into Tapio&#39;s improvised club. &quot;<em>I&#39;ve</em> lost family to this hellhole! Your goal is nothing compared to what I need to do!&quot; 

She drew back her rapier and moved to parry Tapio&#39;s attack only to run into Assassin&#39;s knife. She felt absolutely sick as she felt the knife carve into her ribs, through her lung and touch the bundle of artificial ciruits around her hear. Yet even as Kari could feel herself weaken, that was when the miracle that had saved her life before unfolded before everyone&#39;s eyes. 

To Claudius, it was a perfect strike that would not only deflate a lung but also stab into the heart of the ice queen before him that had driven his master into a blind rage. He knew it was a clean hit as he could feel it puncture the skin and slide between the ribs. Yet as he slide the knife deeper and deeper, he felt less and less resistance. Indeed, it started to feel like he was slicing water rather than the slight resistance of flesh. And that&#39;s when he would look down at where he stabbed to see the knife causing ripples to spread across Kari&#39;s body like he had dropped a rock in a puddle. 

Meanwhile the surprise of running into Claudius&#39;s knife meant that Tapio had a clear shot at bonking Kari&#39;s head. Yet as it connected with her, the arm seemed to comform to the contours of her head as it was bent as easily as putty. Was she made out of metal like Szrac or what trick was she playing here?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Time seemed to slow down for Kari as every little scrape of the blade inside of her ticked away like the second hand of a clock. Her origin had once again saved her from certain demise but it would not last for long. The sheer amount of mana it took to keep her organs and tissues organized in this fluid state was draining her incredibly fast and putting more strain on the circuits that threatend to burn her heart. 

She reached for her belt and grabbed the closest vials, by fate they were the ones filled with her coolant. Not caring for what they were, Kari did her best to toss them at the surpise foe in her side. The glass vials gleamed in the light, the purple liquid inside sloshing around as they arced and collided with Assassin&#39;s arm. They burst spectacularly and covered it in some kind of purple liquid that seemed to thirstily suck all of the warmth of his arms, though what was concerning was that it also seemed to feed off the mana within his highly active state, making the power more potent. Claudius could only watch as his arm became encased in some violet cast of ice that crawled up his arm towards his spirit core.

In this moment, Kari could only think about not dying. She didn&#39;t want to die today, she couldn&#39;t. She still had so much more to do. She couldn&#39;t die to an assassin like her father had. She needed help...  and so she called out a name, her voice soaked in anguish, pain and a primal fear.

&quot;ADA!&quot; The voice carried itself through an open line in the microphone from before, carrying itself across long distance to a man already engaged with his own problems.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal briefly emerged from his haze, enough to watch Claudius launch himself at near supersonic speeds at the Mage. His noose was gone, no longer covering that nasty skin and deep scars. Since when could he do that…

Augh, it don’t matter! It just means that the Aristofuck was done for, plain and simple. He wasn’t gonna dilly dally and watch it happen, instead pushing onward through the ice poles. Most of them had been leveled in some degree, making it significantly easier to move around.

And he was free, launching himself off the last one and sprinting forward. Assassin had his knife buried deep in her side, but why was she still moving? That would kill even the most resilient of people, no stops. Hell, even the kid was in on the assault, choosing to attack with a broken frame’s arm of all things. 

<em>”ADA!”</em>

Oh no.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal doubled his speed. Something ain’t right. Now there was purple ice covering his Servant’s arm. What the fuck was that shit, how did it get there, what would it do to him?! 

Gradually, that fog of hatred was brushed away. Replace with an even more primal, visceral emotion: Fear. For who, he did not know. It was between himself, Claudius, or Tapio. He couldn’t help both of them, so it came down to which one was in more danger. 

And it had to be the kid. Claudius was a servant, clearly in the middle of his Noble Phantasm. The man knew it, that’s why he could feel his unspent mana slowly yet surely draining itself. He also knew that the kid had some fucky shit going on with him, a special cause of Magecraft. 

But he couldn’t shake that dread, that urge to defend Phoenix— no, Tapio. If that kid got hurt, he’d never be able to live with himself. At the end of the day, Coal wasn’t no killer, he didn’t have the guts to do it. Protecting himself, yea, and his little brother. 

This Pairing of Servant and Master was doomed from the start, plain and simple. That’s why he drove his entire body into the Kid’s stomach. The pair were sent tumbling down the small incline. His vision shook, dazed by his own tackle and the feeling of falling down. World flipped over and over a few more times before he came to a stop.

Watching Claudius and Kari.
