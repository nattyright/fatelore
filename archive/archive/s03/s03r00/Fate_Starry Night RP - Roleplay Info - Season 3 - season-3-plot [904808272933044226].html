It had been weeks since the expedition of the second Nirvana investigation team. They had been sent a month after the respective authorities lost contact with the first investigation team. Due to that, it was not only an investigation mission, but a rescue mission as well. Whatever happened to the first investigation team? Why had Nirvana gone under radio silence?

These questions never brought any answers. Communication with the second team was lost almost as quickly as with the first team. Nirvana was officially deemed a &#39;no man&#39;s land&#39; and temporarily ignored for more pressing matters at hand. Various cities were curious as to why the city had suddenly cut all contact with external communications. Some theorized a revolt. Others theorized an half-assed attempt at independence.

These were only theories. The truth was far more sinister...</span>

It revealed much detail on the origin and propagation of Nirvana, up to the year of 2060.</div>
This newfound discovery was enough to revitalize people&#39;s interest in Nirvana. Albeit it was very much founded by ulterior motives. Several cities and factions were interested in acquiring blueprints on Nirvana&#39;s tech, so the newly formed third investigation team was tasked not only to investigate the city and report back, but to also obtain the city&#39;s blueprints before doing so.

Of course, no association worth its salt would lend away its prestigious members for free in a dead zone that had already claimed plenty of lives. Therefore, the third investigation team had been formed by a ragtag group of individuals, from different backgrounds and associations. They are currently on route to Nirvana, travelling by sea on the same boat as they wonder on what sort of secrets await them at their destination...</span>

It is 2105. The skies are clear. The weather is passable. The sea is tranquil. The perfect conditions for a voyage to a realm beyond.

…

The canopus sails the calm seas, with its crew being as vigilant as ever. Despite that, they cannot deny that it has been quite a while since they had first started their journey. Originally, they had to be picked up individually from various cities spread across the globe. With each stop, the ship grew heavier, packed not only with flesh, but the weight of their burdens. All of them had a reason to join this mission. A sense of purpose guiding them towards&#160;<strong>Nirvana.</strong>

Granted, who knew when they would get there. It had been a few days since they had picked up the last investigator of the crew and were finally headed towards their destination. Their immaculate patience was starting to run dry, especially since some of them had been on the boat for weeks.

Perhaps as a diversion, several members of the investigator crew started proposing an early summoning of their Servants. They had received mandated S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames from some of the few organizations backing the third expedition to Nirvana. It was the only boon they had received besides the canopus itself.

After all, who would invest so much into a suicide mission? If talented mages from the first and second expedition hadn’t made it back from Nirvana, what chances did&#160;they&#160;have?

…

No one would mention that out loud, of course. There was no need to dampen the morale in an already packed crew. A wise choice, since they would receive a ray of hope to reward their efforts.

On the next morning, they witnessed a signal. A flock of seagulls in the distance, soaring across the skies as they perched on top of the canopus and started scouting for food. The captain was quick to knock them off, albeit the birds still managed to fly off with some rations and bottled water.

But the message was clear: The birds weren’t migrating, but their presence alone spoke volumes. Wherever there is fauna, there is flora.

And wherever there is flora, civilization.

Nirvana was close. They could feel it.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It is 2105. The island is quiet. The weather dome is functioning. The echoes of the waves can barely be heard. It is truly paradise on Earth.

…

How long has it been since Nirvana received tourists? How long has it been since the last zoo exhibit or stage play? The last email or call back from a sponsor was several years ago. The city had definitely seen better days…or had it?

For the first time in ages, it was finally quiet. No more droning tourists. No more camera flashes. The animals were allowed to freely roam their respective environments, as nature willed it. Plants and flora growing without the unnecessary trimming to abide by human beauty standards. It was a true paradise with zero attempts at being ‘commercial’ or ‘purchasable’.

The mark of such divinity should not be scarred by outsiders. That is something that all islanders universally agreed upon. While they stuck to their own business and didn’t necessarily agree with each other, they knew that the threat of others invading their paradise was far more dangerous than their own kin.

…

Granted, they haven’t received visitors in years. The last group had been easily dealt with, and while tensions were high for a few months, they had completely died out afterwards. It had been a peaceful few years, until…

…A wave of dread hit all of them. They weren’t psychic, nor were they capable of predicting the future, but they instinctively feared something.&#160;Something&#160;was approaching from the sea beyond. Something that dared to threaten their paradise.

…

Then a few weeks passed, and nothing happened. Tensions started to calm down as Nirvana’s inhabitants realized that sometime, a sixth sense was not a reliable source of information.

Though, the last few days have been particularly weird. The seagulls native to the island had returned with plastic bottles and scraps of food. Did Nirvana always have so much junk lying around?</span>

While the investigators engage in idle talk and conduct their summons, the rest of the ship&#39;s crew are not so privileged. Leisure time is a rare commodity for an experienced crew, let alone an inexperienced one such as the team that formed the third investigation. They were fresh sailors guided by a novice captain, willing to set foot on this voyage only due to their economical condition. It couldn&#39;t have been a crew larger than 20 men, investigators excluded.

<em>&quot;Guide the investigators safely and obey their commands. Your compensation shall be an impressive sum.&quot;</em>

Those words from their sponsors remained impressed in their mind. While they were complete amateurs at handling a ship, their ambition for wealth and good fortune was what kept the ship together in the first place.

And finally, they had reached their destination.

&quot;Land ahead!&quot; One of the sailors screamed, staring at the horizon from one of the canopus&#39; numerous telescopes.

Indeed, it was a mere blip on the sea, but it was there. The sign of an island.

There were no reports of other known islands on the map, except for one.

Nirvana.

&quot;What&#39;s the estimated distance?&quot; The captain asked while twirling their untidy beard.

&quot;One more day of travel, sir.&quot;

&quot;Sound. Start warning the rest of the crew, and after that, warn the investigators as well. They will probably want to see this.&quot;

&quot;Understood, captain.&quot;

And with that, the crew was set into motion. Various sailors started preparing the ship for its first docking in ages, while the rest headed over to the investigators in order to warn them about their impending destination.</span>

The estimate had proven accurate, since the canopus was now miles away from its destination. The crew was excited, yet frightened all the same. This was entirely new territory. Who knows what awaited them on the island itself? Two teams had explored the nature reserve city, but neither team had returned.

What lurked beyond Nirvana&#39;s fa&#231;ade?

&quot;Attention, all crew members. We will be docking at Nirvana soon enough, since our scout has relayed that the city&#39;s docks are still intact. Docking is expected to commence in 10 minutes. Please make sure to not lose your luggage and prepare yourself for some rough turning.&quot;

As promised, the ship started moving erratically, doing some close turns to reach the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span>. It was enough to make a few people seasick, but thankfully it was a swift and safe journey.

Albeit the docks left much to be desired.

The sailors stared in awe at the sheer amount of ships parked next to the city&#39;s docks. They weren&#39;t shipwrecks, but they weren&#39;t exactly inhabited either. Rust covered them, along with moss, algae and other invasive foliage. The docks themselves were in a poor state, covered in dirt, grime and more flora.

Nirvana hadn&#39;t had visitors in a while. Nor had it expected any visitors, it seemed.

Just a mile left from the city docks, albeit the crew had no idea what expected them...

It had been a day since the islanders received their warning. First by Koji, who observed the odd behavior of his birds, returning with junk that could only scream manmade. Second by a peculiar Caster, who had warned them about an incoming threat.

Of course, these were only rumors. Until finally, their worst nightmare became true.

<em>A new ship had docked.</em>

Primal rage started to surge within their hearts. It was a combination of anger and fear. How dared these outsiders invade their realm? How dared they corrupt their paradise? Unforgivable.

They should be taught a lesson on respect, as soon as possible. Maybe it was time for the good old neighbor talk. Starting by knocking on their front door.

The long journey had come to an end as the ship&#39;s crew were ecstatic at the prospect of touching land once again. Of course, nothing had prepared them for Locusta&#39;s invasive weeds, nor the explosion caused by Ruth&#39;s crown. In a sense, you could say this was a momentous occasion. They had finally figured out why the docks seemed abandoned and why the past investigation teams never returned.

Nirvana never wanted help, nor visitors.

With that knowledge, it was time for the third investigation team to act, lest they meet the fate of their predecessors without even touching land. Even the ship captain knew this. If they relented now, they would be perfect targets in the open sea. No, the best solution was to face their assailants head on.

&quot;...All crew members, do not panic! Maintain your stations and brace yourselves. The ship will <strong>dock</strong>, no matter what!&quot;

And they committed, steering the wheel as the ship now accelerated towards the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span>, unfazed by the attack of Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants. At the current speed, it should reach its destination in the next 20 minutes...
<span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@investigator</span> 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">A mile before docking...</div>
Just as the charlatan in pink had warned, a ship was approaching the island.

Unforgiveable. Unforgiveable. <em>Unforgiveable.</em>

Two warnings weren&#39;t enough. They say that third time&#39;s the charm, but would another slaughter suffice? The outside world was getting increasingly rude about its advances. When would they get the idea that Nirvana was now closed off to all outsiders?

Not anytime soon, it seemed, since their response to a broken hull and a sea of weeds was to keep moving. Locusta&#39;s territory had yet to reach its full power, which allowed the ship to still move. Such obsessed fools.

The only solution was to indulge in an even more macabre slaughter. Ashley knew that. Locusta would commit to that. Ruth and the newly awakened mourner understood that as well. So did the rest of the islanders.

This ship will <em>not</em> make contact with the island. None at all.

Despite the ambush, despite the losses.

They had made it to land.

Out of the 20 crew members who had embarked on the ship, none remained. Most of them had perished, with some investigators stating that their corpses had been repurposed in an unsightly manner by one of Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants. Not even the captain had made it out alive, leaving them stranded without a proper pilot.

The ship was in a sorry state as well, torn by the pressure of a Caster&#39;s weeds alongside the numerous scuffles that had happened on board. It would take several resources to repair it, but that was assuming the islanders would give them the time to do so.

Unsurprisingly, they didn&#39;t. The moment they docked, a swarm of islanders started making a mad sprint towards them. Knowing that they were outnumbered, the investigators all retreated, splitting up in random directions as they hid away and vowed to survive.

A day had passed since then. A vague headcount had been formed, one that could have been either optimistic or pessimistic at the same time. Regardless, most of them had begun to assume that around 40 or so investigators had survived from the original crew, albeit they had no way of keeping tabs on each other. In fact, some even refused to communicate further: Altruism was optional. All that mattered was obtaining Nirvana&#39;s city blueprints, figure out the reason for the aggressive inhabitants and then skedaddle out of there.

Protecting fellow investigators was never a part of the contract. As cruel as it sounded.

Regardless, not everyone was cut from the same cloth. Some of the more altruistic investigators had decided to group together, knowing that there was strength in numbers. The more opportunistic investigators overheard this, thinking about using this alliance for their own gain. Eventually, packs had started to form.

How many would survive by the end of it all?</span>

How many hours had it been since they had arrived?

Two?
Four?
Eight?

...

A whole day.

Such thoughts filled Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants with disgust. For an entire day, these repulsive outsiders had already contaminated much of their island. Their search had resulted in them finding various items scattered about. Plastic bottles. Bandages. Cans of beans. Even droppings and urine.

It drove them mad with contempt. How could these individuals live with themselves? They were no longer eligible for a dignified death. No, they would <em>suffer</em> at their hands and wallow in eternal torment.

All outsiders were enemies. There were no exceptions. Pacifism was a foreign concept in this land. You either lived, or you died.

But a killer&#39;s instinct could only last so long. Even murderers needed to recuperate. Despite their urges, Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants were still human. They needed food, water and sleep as much as anybody else.

The massive search party returned to their homes, realizing too late that they had been searching for almost 12 hours straight. They gathered scraps, ate their fill and headed straight to bed. Resting, to hunt another day.

Of course, this didn&#39;t apply to all islanders. Some of them had chosen to spend their time in other ways, be it out of necessity or out of simple novelty. Who knew what they had planned?

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Another day passed as the investigators were now only slightly better off than they were before. Rumors started spreading around about a Caster named William Shakespeare, who had apparently assisted them during their initial scuffle against Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants. While his motives were unclear, he seemed to be sincere in his desire to assist the investigators. In exchange for his own protection, of course.

Perhaps Shakespeare&#39;s objective was something worth discussing over at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deserted-cottage</span>, a dilapidated looking building that had been selected as a temporary meeting spot for various investigators. They needed to work as a team to not only decide their next plan of attack, but also to share information and survive.

For now, the objective was simple: Discover what made Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants so hostile and attempt to reason with them. If that failed, simply obtain Nirvana&#39;s city blueprints and leave the city, albeit that was easier said than done. Those who dared to return to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span> would find their canopus heavily damaged and on the verge of giving away. The ice that fixed its hull was melting, causing the ship to slowly sink. If the investigators did not attempt to repair the ship anytime soon, it was very likely for the entire boat to plummet to the bottom of the abyss.

Of course, the islanders knew this well.

They knew for a fact that the reasonable investigators would try to leave the island, so it was best to cut off any possible escape routes. They also knew that the more foolhardy might try to invade deeper into Nirvana&#39;s infrastructure, in which case they needed to enhance their own defenses. It was akin to a game of cat and mouse. One where the islanders outnumbered the investigators almost one to a thousand.

It was simply a matter of waiting for them to crack...

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Time went on as Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants kept playing a lengthy game of cat and mouse with the outsiders. Search parties were still roaming the island, albeit not as often as they were previously. With no sightings of the investigators yet, the islanders were back to square one, incapable of locating the hideouts of these filthy parasites.

That&#39;s not to say that the investigators were fully covert: A fight broke out at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#merch-store</span> just yesterday, and while there were no witnesses to whoever emerged victorious from that scuffle, the leading theory was that it had been instigated by an investigator.

Similarly, there have been reports of Madame Ruth&#39;s angels gathering at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#forest-general</span> in order to meet with an unexpected guest. Whoever that may be.

Despite these setbacks, the investigators have been making an active effort to pursue their mission, starting by gathering clues on Nirvana and obtaining more information on their surroundings. Perhaps the solution came from their predecessors: Why not retread the possible steps of the past investigation teams? It could potentially lead to new discoveries. Albeit, maybe the islanders were counting on them to repeat past mistakes...

However, there is such a thing as being too focused: Those who have visited the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span> recently will have now noticed that the canopus is merely a day away from plummeting into the abyss. Berserker&#39;s frosty layer of protection has almost melted off completely, allowing the ship to flood as it is now in critical condition.

The journey to discover Nirvana was arduous, but the journey back home seemed equally torturous.

A group of investigators have been seen around the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span>, presumably trying to save their ship from the clutches of Nirvana&#39;s sea. Unfortunately for them, it seems that a few islanders have headed there as well, with the most sinister of intentions...

The rest of the investigators have instead grouped up at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deserted-cottage</span>, discussing their current findings, along with any clues that could lead them to solving Nirvana&#39;s mystery. It seems like a few were absent from the meeting, causing the team to wonder what ever happened to them...

Last but not least, a new threat has risen from beyond the grave to exterminate islanders and investigators alike. A destructive battle occurred at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#dantes-workshop</span>, resulting in mass collateral damage along with noisy howls. The beast, known as Vortigern, still lives. Some have even reported loud howls coming from the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#darkest-woods</span> late at night. Who knows what its next prey may be...

Time passes. Tragedies and comedies both come and go. But at the end of it all, which side will the curtain be facing?

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The howls of a beast echo across the woods, attracting the attention of both investigators and islanders. It is said those who bothered to investigate the forests never returned, having disappeared off in the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#darkest-woods</span>.

Meanwhile, the investigators resume their efforts to discover more about Nirvana. After a briefing at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deserted-cottage</span>, they have directed their efforts towards exploring the desert biome (<span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#desert-hospital</span>, <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#dantes-workshop</span>).

Likewise, the islanders noticed suspicious activity around the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#canned-goods-store</span>. A few cultists reported sightings of something odd lurking in the shadows. Thankfully, those sightings were dismissed as mere tricks of the light. Hearsay to scare the already tense islanders.

And just like hearsay, gossip travelled far and wide. The <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#lake-general</span> was temporarily off limits to Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants. Not because of any unique or particular reason: The citizens could just smell trouble whenever they sensed it. They had a natural knack for it. Hence why they knew that disturbing the good doctor and his patient during a meeting would be tantamount to suicide.

The more days pass, the more they stay the same. Is that a surprise or is that simply Nirvana&#39;s true nature? A land of eternal paradise, destined to last forever.

So long as its blotches are thoroughly cleaned.

The <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#tropic-general</span> has been tarnished by the scars of battle, a sizable portion of the jungle having been burnt to a crisp by powerful flame Magecraft. Traces of dried blood and dead animals also litter the area, showing signs of a struggle between Servants.

Likewise, the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#forest-general</span> is still healing from the wounds it received in a previous scuffle between Nirvanans and investigators. Some rumors claim that one of the island&#39;s most notable cultists was involved in the battle, but none may know for sure besides the birds.

It&#39;s been a full week since the investigators have arrived, yet they seem to be as far from the truth as ever. What exactly happened on Nirvana? What steps should they take next to discover the mystery behind the island?

One can only hope that they find their answer soon enough...

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The fires at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#tropic-general</span> have finally gone out, leaving behind only consumed ashes and greens to blacks. While the culprit has yet to be found, many already have their own theories as to who it could have been. Commotion has also been heard around the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span>, with most of Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants giving up on attacking the Canopus after repeatedly suffering heavy losses on their raids. Instead, they tightened the search parties around the island itself, aiming to catch the investigators off guard while they are at their most vulnerable.

Perhaps this plan could succeed, for there have been rumors of outsiders approaching <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-o’connell-estate</span>, alongside urban legends of a ghost haunting the premises. Of course, no one can confirm for sure. Except by visiting the place itself.

Howls continue haunting the island, coming from some nondescript creature that leaves devastation in its wake. Most common sightings have occurred around the tropics and the forests, causing both Nirvanans and investigators to write those areas off as danger zones. Better to deal with an enemy that you know of than a complete stranger, after all.

Despite all that, things seemed to be getting even worse. Animals started getting more irritable despite the string of destructive events, leading to a chaotic wave of aggressive assaults as preys attacked predators and predators attacked Nirvanans. Likewise, the tropics seem to harbor some deep resentment towards the fire as a sickly aroma now permeates the burnt ashes that surround the jungle. Missing people reports have also been slowly posted around Nirvana, with the vast majority of the islanders blaming the outsiders for their troubles.

But is this the truth? Or is it merely a trick of the light...?

The wildlife more aggressive. The grass more pungent. Even Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants could feel it. An odd smell permeated the air, as if a sign that much more was to come.

Not like the investigators had any time to research that, since they were occupied with their own set of problems. An ominous cult has been putting wrenches in their plans, causing several members of the Nirvana investigation team to dedicate their efforts to investigating said cult. If only they knew the truth about the vile woman that rules over them...

Meanwhile, the other investigators attempt to find out more clues regarding the nature of the mysterious Berserker, Vortigern. For what purpose was he summoned? And to what end? Considering his hatred for investigators and Nirvanans alike, he seems to be a piece of a puzzle that doesn&#39;t match.

As if to drive that point further home, some of the islanders have started running their own investigations into the matter. Whoever assisted the outsiders could have only been from inside Nirvana, but why? The city was paradise on earth. Who would ruin such peace, and for what purpose?

The answers would be revealed soon enough...

Both Nirvanans and investigators felt a chill in the air as they attempted to catch some sleep for another tomorrow. Little did they know that the story was inevitably reaching its climax. There would be no intermissions. No breaks nor detours in the plot. Everything would be brought to its conclusion.

By the time the investigators woke up, they could hear the screams. Animals going mad, squawking and snarling and roaring. They attacked anything that moved, as if driven by a primal instinct to maim and kill. The air felt heavier than usual and it was becoming a chore to breathe, pressure coming from all sides as the investigators felt like their heads were being squeezed. The city itself felt like it was sick of their presence and had resorted to making their lives feel as miserable as possible.

Even the Nirvanans couldn&#39;t escape this odd sensation. A thought breathed into their heads, one so invasive that it was impossible to ignore. It gave them a simple order: <strong>Kill.</strong> Kill the outsiders. Eliminate all threats from the outside world. Living beings and people that were not assimilated had no right to remain on the island.</span>

Some were receptive to this command. Others weren&#39;t and painfully struggled. But none could escape the bloodlust, nor ghosts nor mortals. Their desire to kill the outsiders far outweighed any logical thought they had left. Search parties were quickly formed, aggressive, yet organized. They would scour the entire island, looking for traces left by the investigators. And when they found them? They would finish the job they should have done ages ago.

It didn&#39;t take long for the investigators to notice this erratic change in behavior. Their hideouts were compromised as they were forced to move swiftly to avoid being ganged up on. Still, this sudden change in circumstances was most strange. Why did the city feel so inhospitable? Why were the islanders acting more madly than usual? It didn&#39;t add up. No, Nirvana&#39;s mystery still felt unearthed. There was no point in leaving the island if they couldn&#39;t at least solve that.

This was their mission: <strong>To find the truth behind the island&#39;s mysteries.</strong> To see whether they will succeed or not, has yet to be seen.

Shortly after the brief scuffle that was rumored to have occurred between some cultists and the outsiders, the heart of the forest, <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#darkest-woods</span>, was ravaged by a mysterious flood. Animals fled from their homes and started invading other areas, resulting in an imbalance in the ecosystem. It would take days for things to go back to normal, provided that the frenzied creatures haven&#39;t killed each other off first.

Meanwhile, flashes of lightning were spotted at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#beachside</span> in broad daylight, on a perfectly cloudless day. This would be the second time Nirvana&#39;s borders have been struck by lightning in barely half a month&#39;s time. Weather dome engineers, however, denied any claims that the lake reserve&#39;s weather dome has been malfunctioning. As such, a brief warning was issued via The Nirvana Times™️ for citizens to avoid hanging out at the beach for the time being. 

Almost 10 days have passed since the outsiders set foot on the island. Aside from the occasional disturbances in various corners of the nature reserves, it seems that things have started to quiet down. Either the outsiders have gotten smarter at blending in with the Nirvanans, or the Nirvanans have gotten better at their hunt. As for the stragglers who are too weak to fend for themselves...

Well, it&#39;s only a matter of time before this batch, too, have found their home.

Investigators were left to their own devices as they explored every nook and cranny of the island, while the city&#39;s inhabitants returned to their day to day lives as if nothing had happened in the past two weeks. It was eerily calm. Too calm.

Shadows were meant to hide from light. Likewise, the Nirvanans too knew that they had to cloud their intentions from the outsiders. The last few search parties had come up dry, finding no prey to get rid of. The outsiders that had survived the past days were no doubt seasoned and experienced by now. The islanders had grown predictable in their search routines. This wouldn&#39;t stand, especially since coexistence was impossible. Outsiders were like a wild tumor that needed to be excised. Collaboration was impossible.

Which is why the Nirvanans started holding secret meetings. Lurking in the dark, discussing plans amongst their neighbors. None of the investigators would suspect, since they were too busy exploring the areas that they had missed. The <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#main-lab</span>, the heart of the city, looked rather alluring. Likewise, rumors of outsiders being sighted at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#tropic-labs</span> started to spread around town. Both sides were enjoying the calm before the storm, gathering all sorts of ammunition to use in their next fateful encounter.

The finale would soon be upon them.

The skies had darkened. The seas grew turbulent. The wind changed direction. It happened in the span of a few hours, beginning at sunset, before culminating at dawn. The apocalypse was here. Enough had happened for something <strong>wicked</strong> to awaken.

Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants were the first to notice. Their day to day life was interrupted by a redder sky, most likely caused by a fault in the weather dome. It would normally be a simple matter of letting one of their various engineers handle it, but the oddities didn&#39;t end there. Farmers found their crops disheveled, filled with gunk and goo that felt scalding and poisonous to the touch. Those who made contact could only watch as their arms and limbs were liquified, becoming one with whatever mud had started to infect the island&#39;s flora.

Trees started to exude this brown substance, like tree sap and resin. It was heavy in mana and dense enough to assimilate anything that touched it. Animals started to disappear, and those that survived had bloodshot eyes that drove them in a feeding frenzy. One that involved mercilessly slaughtering prey, be they carnivores or herbivores.

Surprisingly, the islanders didn&#39;t feel agitated by this. Once they realized the mud&#39;s harmful properties, they simply adapted and warned others to avoid it. It felt homely, for whatever reason. Just another element of nature that they had to live with. If anything, most of them were still irritated with the task at hand. Those damned outsiders. Without a doubt, they had something to do with this. They should all pay...

...

The investigators themselves were caught off guard by the red sky. The mysterious mud started to affect their surroundings, turning lush greeneries into treacherous death traps as some perished by the mud alone. Those who survived were few and far in between, trying to think of a way to adapt and move forward. Not only that, but they had noticed an increase in hostility from wildlife and islanders alike.</span>

In fact, they started feeling on edge as well. Anger seeped through their veins, along with irritation towards others and themselves. Thoughts that would have never crossed their mind were now happily resting upon their heads, filling them with malicious thoughts. Something was terribly wrong with Nirvana. Something that might threaten the entire world if it were left unchecked. The mystery needed to be solved, no matter what...</span>

Their minds are afflicted, imbued with a curse. Something worming deep inside, giving them the compulsive desire to indulge in their obsessions...along with the extermination of all outsiders.

Even the investigators aren&#39;t exempt from this curse. Some of them have already gone mad, howling at the moon like beasts of the night as they assimilate themselves into the islanders. Others narily avoid such a wicked fate, doing their best to avoid the corrupting sludge as they make their way through the island. It is obvious at this point that Nirvana is no normal place. Something terrifying happened here, yet they lack answers on what exactly it was...

Was it Vortigern, the beast that scourges the island? Was it William, the bard who might not be who he seems? Was it Verga, the writer filled with forbidden pleasures?

Was it the island itself?

The answers lie at the heart of Nirvana. Where it all began. The first site of the incident...
