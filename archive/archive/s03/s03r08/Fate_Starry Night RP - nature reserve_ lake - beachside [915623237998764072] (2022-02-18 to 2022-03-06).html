                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ruth had been through a flurry of emotions. Firstly Banshee’s passion incited from the battle. To having an evening with her beautiful servant all to herself. Then Verga coming to her estate. Picking apart her being, like a skilled surgeon with a scalpel. Stitching it back together. Helping the woman be more open to displaying her <strong>hunger</strong>. 

Needless to say… she needed time to think. 

The beach was always one such place the holy woman would run to when she was just a girl. When she needed to have space from others. 

On a day such as today, Ruth chose to wear a beautiful two piece swimming suit, covered by a beautiful(and easily removable) sun dress. A sun hat sitting gracefully upon her head. 

Taking a seat the woman reclined. Leaving her thoughts to dance through her head. 

The beast of <strong>consumption</strong> within her, constantly giving whispers of killing another. Eating of them. Leaving nothing behind. Whispers which would lead her down the road of ascendance. Then there are other thoughts of her own, which battle said beast. Those of her death. Those of her servant’s duty. Those of the islanders and investigators alike that could stand in her way. 

All of these thoughts had brought her into a meditative state. Whilst holding a book in one hand, called <em>Soldier Luna</em>,  and a glass of wine in another.</span>

The breeze was smooth and refreshing upon the skin and several trees castes long shadows upon the sandy grounds. It was a rather peaceful day, though things are always capable of shifting in an instant. 

As Ruth relaxed a frantic young man hobbled towards her. It was thin in the face and rather sickly of the body, but what distinguished him was his cult regalia identifying himself as one of Ruth’s many. When he got just close enough he’d fall upon his knees before her and lower his head. “Madam Ruth, I saw you from across the distance and I felt I needed to pay my respects to you, in addition to inform you of a new development concerning the latest batch of interlopers who trod upon our sacred place. Will you give me the honors of speaking on such matters, or is my approach too grave an offense?” Get close, that’s all they needed to do. Establish contact and proceed from there. The boy shall watch from afar, there was no need for conflict. At least that is what he wanted. Gather necessary information and leave before suspicions arise. This shall be easy enough, the only question would be if Assassin could compose their nature. <span class="mention" title="&#198;nkidou#4116">@&#198;nkidou</span></span>

“Ah… new information of those <em>swine</em>. Excellent, my child. Please regale me of such exploits and I shall reward you in a most… <em>fitting</em> manner.” The cultist sat up from her reclined position, wine glass half full. She took another long deep drink from it, placing a name to the face while also looking to <strong>consume</strong> him if given the chance.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The head remained bowed though their eyes were trained on Ruth as Brandon began to properly explain the situation. At least a version of it. “Recently a collection of our members has gone missing. Last time they were seen it was near the old canned goods store. At first I assumed they may have gotten together offered themselves up to you and your prominence. Though there has been no word of them coming to see you, so I next presumed it must be those infernal interlopers.”

As Assassin peered at the woman before them who stood so proudly over their presumed lesser. There was great deal of darkness in their soul a blackness fear that swelled around the heart that they’d never let be revealed in the light of day. Despite that effort, there was no amount of strength of Will or Power that could hide away what she saw deep within. It would surprise many what truly festered inside her mind and heart, but there was one thing at the edge of her fear and thoughts that barely gave any context of true association to her inner anguish. A single word present that peaked the curiosity of the shadow being. Perhaps this could be used to their advantage. “After further investigation on these matters I discovered a few whispers of the intruders searching for something here upon the island. The details are not clear on what exactly yet, but we are close to finding answers. Although we did came across a name that seemed to be popping up. We kept hearing mention of a “<strong>Rosemary.</strong>” Assassin was carefully in her delivery, she didn’t know if the cultists would know this name or not so it was presented in a way and in tone that did not portray knowing or ignorance.

Her intentions were to lead in conversation to what occurred in the past, but to ask directly would be too suspicious. She needed to give some information that would come across as a revelation of sorts to put Ruth off the scent of foul play. In addition…Boogie was morbidly curious on the Cult Leader’s reaction.</span>

I would not be surprised if they also took them.&quot; Ruth spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. A hint of rage within her eyes, at the thought of <em>Ace Colin</em>. The Genevan Soldier. &quot;It brings me such sadness to hear of more of your brothers and sister being... slaughtered in such a merciless manner.&quot; 

That hungry gaze did not avert itself from her presumed lesser. Many thoughts fluttered of how she would <strong>consume</strong> his essence... Perhaps the pleasures of flesh, or the taking of his flesh itself... 

&quot;Whispers of that <em>woman</em>...&quot; Something shifted in Ruth&#39;s demeanor. A sense of guilt mixed with love perhaps. &quot;She is dead. Sacrificed to bring forth my Angel of Death.&quot; Her words were less like honey and now more cold. Detached almost. &quot;What do you know about their <em>investigations</em> into her?&quot; The cult leader tilted her head, touching Brandon&#39;s face ever so gently. Caressing him into giving more information.</span>

If only she had more insight would she be able to tell that this one being she does not want to bite into. Brandon appeared to shiver at the touch trying to collect his words. Ruth gave a glimpse into the backstory of Rosemary a nudge in the direction that Assassin needed. Perhaps this will prove effective. “Nothing entirely specific madam, though I believe it does directly tie to their fate. The investigators kept repeating the name Rosemary, that finding what she and the others had unearthed was the key to it all. I do not know who these others could be…do you think they could be referring to the previous batch of invaders?” 

His head shook in confusion as he previously glanced up deeper into the island, there was an expression of confusion and worry. “Did they accomplish more than we realized? Were those pests able to make connections throughout the island, corrupting its inner workings like a cancer.

Brandon turned back to Ruth with much more worry in his eye than before. “What shall we do madam?”</span>

Boogie could already deduce the likely status of those adventurers, but she&#39;d never speak it aloud to Ryn, at least not until it was actually confirmed. 

Brandon&#39;s smile grew devilishly from ear to ear as if awaiting a bed time story they had heard a hundred times. The look of both frustration and longing were present in their eyes, and it was clear that only the divine words of his leader would satiate this craving of theirs. &quot;Let them rot, let them rot, <strong>let them rot!</strong> In the back of the servant&#39;s mind she&#39;d hope for master to listen in on what was being said, for this may be the key that he has been searching for.</span>

While the previous investigators were of little concern to the holy mother. Especially when it came to their names, there were flashes in her memory of a few distinct faces from the previous investigations. Including that of Dorian&#39;s.

Ruth had seen Dorian, and not only that but he had enough of an impact on her that it felt her more negative emotions. Boogieman caught her, the lead they were working towards was finally within their grasp. All that was left was to press a little further, though she had to tread carefully, Assassin did not want unnecessarily give away her identity. 

A devilish grin grew across their face again as Ruth explained what would be the fate of the investigators. “As you wish madam, your will be done.

Bringing their bodies uncomfortably close to one another. The servant being able to see her ravenous <strong>hunger</strong> even more distinctly. 

The woman then placed a kiss upon his neck. A kiss which then turned into a bite as Ruth made an attempt to place her mana drain within her thought to be servant.</span>

Her hands were forcefully pulled away from him as that same devilish shine of a smile etched across their face. 

There was something wrong, something horribly wrong. Ruth’s marking kiss, one she had performed on countless of her followers appeared to yield no results. Her circuits did not tie into anything, almost as if they swam aimlessly in a thick muck. On top of that, her bite was incapable of piercing their flesh, almost as if it was made of an exceedingly thick and hardy rubber. “You’re behavior has brought me forth, your reckless abandon for the sanctity of life produced an ember of desire that grew into a burning inferno of unshakable famine. Your act just now has pushed us over the edge. Your puppets are no longer enough, the well is too big for you to fill us.” Both the voice and visage of the young cultist began to shift and morph almost fluidly into something recognizable but had to be impossible.</span>

Her hair was disheveled, teeth were razor sharp like the point of a knife, and her eyes were a deep blood shot yellow. What stood before the cult leader was not a person, but a demon of her own creation. One of her deepest fears brought to reality. The karma of her actions had built up and produced this, the monster she tried to hide and pretend she wasn’t. “<em><strong>They no longer satisfy our hunger, and you know how much we need to feed.</strong></em>” In an instant the maw of the creature shot forth biting down hard against Ruth’s own neck, ripping and tearing at the flesh, not just in a means of defense but to eat, to devour, to <strong>consume</strong>.”At last, it quite literally seemed that Ruth bit off more than she could chew.</span>

As Ruth was now face to face with herself. Not exactly herself, but a mockery of who she is. Of what her origin has to entail. 

<strong>Her own fear of dying by her origin.</strong>

“N-no… we still have time. We still can take Nirvana as our own. We can still spread across this <em>damned world</em>” The holy mother spoke before the creature made its lunge. 

Flesh was torn and blood was smelt in the air. As ozone soon after was smelt. Ruth was now succumbing to her own <strong>hunger</strong>.

Three bolts of lighting struck down from the sky. In an attempt to remove this creature from her body, to cease further intrusion on the body of the thing that used to be Ruth Naomi.</span>

Agh!

Boogie, you dummy! 
Ruth, you weirdo!

All could&#39;ve been well today if only you both hadn&#39;t fancied each other a snack! Why is it that every confrontation here must be so bloody and perverted... it&#39;s deeply upsetting to this bush here. Is violence and greed simply how the world is outside of these quiet shrubs? How depressing.

Fed-up, this bush rustled impatiently. It would be silent no longer. Thunder roared from above, and from the greens nearby, strings clamored. This was no relaxing beach day, not anymore. This was battle! A symphony fit for such was due, and of course, by the mysterious hands of nature, it came.

As the rumble of music raced just beyond the sand, the sinister being that was Brandon, Scary Ruth, and the Boogieman all in one would feel energy surge through it&#39;s malleable body. It grew stronger, more durable too, emboldened by booming strength that seemed to pulse in sync with the erratic rhythm dancing about the beachside. Without uttering a single lyric, it cheered.

<strong>Endure</strong>, Boogieman! 
Stand your ground!
The bushes sing for your victory. . .

And you, Ruth Naomi?
The bushes sincerely hope you survive.
After all, you still have much to tell. . .</span>

Ruth was fortunate in the fact that just before coming here Ryn had pulled his servant and requested that she’d temper her proclivity for killing those who deserved judgment for their sins. It’s for that reason that Assassin was merely, for the moment, acting in self defense. Not biting down into any areas of the neck that would expire her to rapidly. Although if she perished during the struggle and in no small part to her arrogance than Ruth will have no one to blame but herself. 

Assassin could see the fear in the cult leaders eyes, the break that all of humanity when faced against their own peril. No matter how strong they may be, or courageous on the battle field, every single soul in existence has something that makes them hide away in terror. That was one of the few universal truths of this world, and Boogey was the one who actively used it to their advantage.</span>

They struck down and stung quite a bit, but unlike a great of Assassin’s Boogeyman had a harder hide than most and with the addition of a melodic tune in the far distance Assassin was able to take the brunt of it without loosing their grip. A hold that unfortunately for the cult leader was now getting tighter. Taking one last big pull of flesh from Ruth’s shoulder Assassin stared demonically at her seemingly peering into her soul. “I can not be so easily disposed of like the rest of your cattle. You can not hide away from me Ruth, I live inside you, at the core of your being. Whether I am standing before your eyes or buried in the pits of your heart. Our hunger shall not be quenched, <strong>ever</strong>, you know this to be true. No amount of expansion shall relieve me, for you know that despite feeding endlessly the hunger does not go away. Though that’s not what truly concerns you, it’s the fact that it’s getting worse, that you desire more and more, never being satisfied or at peace. This is the only way out of the cycle, you know it, you just can’t admit it. Though if you insist on resisting than I suppose then I suppose I will have to make the choice easier on you.”</span>

A swift knee to the abdomen was felt by the cult leader as she hung there helplessly. What could this demon of her own design be intending to do if not continue to feast upon her. That is when she’d see the limbs begin to stretch and extend out in either direction. Ruth’s own arms followed suit as they were tugged to both the left and write of herself. This would continue until Ruth’s arms were angled horizontally, yet Assassin’s arms continued to stretch and pull at her victim past the point of being taut. That devilishly toothy grin spread the entire time as if taking some morbid enjoyment out of the torture. “If you won’t go down peacefully, I suppose I’ll have to make the idea of resisting less favorable to you. Remember, <strong>you have brought this upon yourself</strong>”

The pull became harder and more forceful far beyond the point of where Ruth’s limbs could reasonably extend, yet Boogey continued to stretch further and further until at last a loud <strong>POP</strong> as both of Ruth’s arms were dislocated from their sockets. When this at last occurred, Assassin let go of one of the arms and with a massive swing downwards she slammed the cult leader hard into the sand creating a small crater. From there, Assassin released their grip and slowly stalked forward towards their prey with no telling of what monsterous thing she had in mind to do next.</span>

&quot;<strong>We Understand our CURSE. Our NEED To CONSUME. You Are But a cheap MOCKERY. Drawn from our own memory. </strong>&quot; It spoke loudly spitting towards its adversary, before it was grabbed up. 

And like a reckless child playing with a doll, The Monster&#39;s body was roughly battered, and bruised. Leaving their two arms now wholly dysfunctional. 

It&#39;s face was down cast, but soon unnaturally snapped upwards. Their ravenous eyes looking Through Boogie Man&#39;s body. The gaze only focused on consuming that thing before them. As 7 bright points appeared upon her forehead. One fired point blank at the Boogie man. As that familiar Scent of Ozone was smelt again, going to follow up and follow through with the break made by the mote. 

Going to engulf the False Ruth that stood before them. While that thing that was Ruth Naomi stood up again. Arms limply hanging at her sides. Head then snapping towards the source of that tune... an all too familiar tune... &quot;<strong>That man... Should be DEAD</strong>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What a terribly bloody exchange. Or, well, more of a beat down. Seriously, for being told to hold back and <em>not</em> go for a kill, the Boogieman was being real brutal. The crimson stained sand and limbs stretched thin were enough to make a squeamish bush shrivel up at it&#39;s roots. This one in particular could practically hear the <em>pop</em> of Ruth&#39;s sockets despite it&#39;s distance, and, rightfully, groaned a quiet <em>&quot;eww...&quot;</em>

It almost wanted to root for the cultist. Almost. Seeing the beam shoot from Ruth&#39;s temple at the vicious servant above her reminded who should be cheering for who, and in response, the music thundered from the greens even louder. The reinforcement upon the Boogieman&#39;s body chipped away from Ruth&#39;s smelt glut, allowing it to burn the servant at full force-- but the protection was reinforced not a second after, courtesy of the thrums in the greens.

It was too loud and the distance too long for the shrubs to hear anything the two combatants spoke from the sand. But as the cultist rose, her head, jerking towards the source of the roaring music, the air thickened. A fleck of <em>brown</em>, as opposed to the <em>blonde</em> she knew of, stirred almost unnoticeably between cracks of green.

Do not be a fool, cultist; the man here is not &quot;dead.&quot; Dead hands cannot pluck strings. Music, however, is timeless as a familiar tune is unforgettable.
Remember: there&#39;ll always be someone to remind you of your sins...</span>

The flesh of the False Ruth was indeed singed and burned. Though as the flames died down and the scorched flesh was revealed, based on how they held themselves one wouldn’t be able to tell the damage was anymore then cosmetic. Throughout the whole encounter that same grin persisted and those dagger like eyes stared deeply into the cult leader. It seemed it’d take more than a single star to take them down. “**if you so readily understand us, then why do you resist? Our starvation is endless, our hunger is unquenchable. Whether it is now or later, you shall succumb to your own vice.  Just as grandfather wanted, through our sacrifice the world shall be saved.” 

In an instant, the one arm of assassin rapidly stretched out nearly in flash and with strike of sharpened claws upon their hand cut across Ruth’s femoral artery. The other arm shot forth and wrapped itself around her neck, constricting and stopping the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. This tactic will rapidly stop her fighting. Ryn may have to use his magecraft, but that was a reasonable cost to capture their target.</span>

Causing the three bolts to just fizzle out into the sand. 

Before its neck was gripped with force. With another slash being made into its groin, blood soon flowing out. It’s arms then began to grab at those of the False Ruth, trying to rip itself free with no avail due to their dislocated state. But consciousness was going to fade soon. So very very soon. 

<strong>KILL</strong>

An overwhelming murderous intent was then felt, as the ravenous eyes snapped towards the bushes once again. 

<strong>BURN</strong> 

<strong>LEAVE NOTHING BUT ASH</strong>

Boogie would then see as the six remaining motes of light began to accelerate right towards Ryn’s location. Collapsing into a very bright singular point. A wicked smile was all that was plastered upon the beast of consumption’s face. 

Consciousness then left the thing that used to be Ruth Naomi. Proud to believe that ‘Dorian’ would be no longer part of this world.</span>

By the way the sand had become more stained in crimson... the sickly red hue that the cultists body had begun to drip with... and also the vaguely toasty scent. In the worst of ways of course. Burning flesh was no delight for the sense of smell.

Regardless, as all went down, it had begun to seem like this battle was about to come to a close. Though slightly burnt, with the help of the music, Boogie still stood. And Ruth? Why, she could hardly stand! The only thing holding her up was the servant&#39;s hands, ripping her body to shreds. . . perhaps it was hightime to put a stop to this. Before someone did more than get hurt-- before they died. It wasn&#39;t supposed to turn out this way after all, and the more blood-spilling violence that occurred, the more compelled this bush was to standing right up, arms waving, shouting &quot;no more, no more!&quot; like a referee in a bout gone too far.

But alas, it seemed not all the fight had left Ruth quite yet. The glare she made at the bushes, murderous to the very core, was enough to petrify even this &quot;referee&quot; right in his place. Marbles of pure light shone about the crown of her head. The bush, dumbfounded, counted.
1, 2, 3... 4 . . . 5 . . .

But as the seconds passed, he was sure he counted out 5. A moment later, he saw 4. The fourth collided with the third. Then the third with the second. Till, at last, but one shining star remained, growing by the millisecond, as if absorbing the light from the very Sun above. It was bright. Oh so bright, that the boy hiding between the leaves succumbed to a blink, just to shield momentarily from its intensity. When he opened his eyes however, not only was it bright-- it was huge! Bigger than the beach-- than the azure ocean behind it, even! For just a moment, he was fascinated by it, vermillion orbs flashing between the greens like awed rubies.

The truth only donned on Ryn when it was too late- when he took in a sharp gasp, and his lungs burnt of scalding air, because the light was not, in fact, growing... it was merely getting close. Very close. Very quickly.
The music screeched, and then, halted.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At this point the facade of Ruth’s face faded away and was replaced with Boogie’s usual complexion while the body relatively stayed the same, an odd change at a time like this, especially since only Ryn would be able to see her face. Yet she made sure to look him up and down as she placed him gently back to the ground. “It is alright now master, you are safe. You are not experiencing any pain now are you? If so, tell me. I will gladly take you to retrieve medical supplies if necessary.” There she goes again, her attitude could change at the drop of a dime. No more than a minute ago she was quite literally forcibly bleeding out a woman and now her she was doting on him again. What truly went on through her mind.”

While waiting on a response Assasin would turn to see the motionless body now laying upon blood soaked beach. Stepping forward Boogie leaned against a nearby tree, that is when Ryn might catch something specific…Boogie’s back, it was harshly singed and burned. It seemed as she curled her master in her embrace, as they melded into the shadows, the edge of the explosion just caught her enough to do a margin of damage. Far more than 2nd degree burns from before, this time blackened upon the flesh of what would have been Ruth’s body. There was no telling how much it hurt, for Assassin didn’t show it, but still she was maintaining her composure all the same. The damage didn’t seem too severe, especially for a servant as hardy as she was, although an attack such as that should not be knocked or ignored. If she took a bit more of the explosion it might have temporarily knocked a chunk out of her.</span>

“Master shall I go receive the women? She is presently bleeding and may need your magic to heal her. As I promised I shall not kill her without your permission, though we can not rightly let her leave. She knows too much, or at least more than I am comfortable with. Besides I only got a glimpse into it, but this woman has a connection to the one you are seeking. I shall follow your lead, what is your orders master.” Boogie kept a steady eye on what remained of the area, ensuring there were no passerby that might interfere. Regardless, on how chaotic she can be at times Assassin always intends to be strategic with how she acts, especially when it carried such importance as this.</span>

The third time in a week or so that she has paid a visit to that terrible hound which resides within. 

The holy mother stared up towards the empty darkness. Soon two lights made themselves known, along with rows upon rows of sharp terrible teeth. 

“<strong>Whore of Babylon.</strong>”
“My personal <em>monster</em>.”

The two beings spoke, a cordial tone at first. Before the beast barred its teeth. 

“<strong>A pitiful display. You really believe that we could consume the world with being taken down so EASILY</strong>” It roared as the teeth began to reach down, threatening to rip the life right from Ruth. 

“You are but a simple beast. Good thing you are <em>mine</em>. We shall achieve godhood we desire. With <em>tact</em>.” The woman spat back as the beast pulled away ever so slightly. 

“<strong>I tire of this conversation.</strong>” 
“I do as well. Leave me be.” 

Inky thick blackness then overcame the beasts eyes as it backed away. Teeth still barred as it disappeared. Leaving Ruth in total darkness.</span>

And just when it seemed such had occured, an unknown force pounding against his chest and the world collapsing into darkness around him, he held his breath tight.
Was this death?
It felt like it. Dark. Cold. Quick. 

But, strangely, it didn&#39;t feel lonely. Not at all how he imagined death to feel like... was there someone with him in the dark? Company on the trip to the after life? Hah. How reassuring.
Ryn closed his eyes despite the pitch black never ceasing, and in the few seconds this ride lasted, murmured the name of the man he hoped was his company to the cold end.
&quot;Dorian...&quot; 

Light broke from above, cracking the blackened world rapidly around him and turning his murmur into a query. Illuminated, Ryn saw leather-bound arms wrapped around his waist. When finally the light fractured the world whole, the lad found himself held up upon the beachside once again. His lungs remembered their contents, and violent coughs ruptured his entire body between the hands that held him up. He was still hacking and wheezing come time he was gently let down, doubled over and eyes squeezed shut, desperately trying to overcome the stinging dryness the heat had plagued his throat with.</span>

He&#39;d almost died. He was sure of it. Just a second away from being a piece of burnt up Nuello-- so how come he wasn&#39;t? The boy turned up, holding his throat, and appeared surprised to see the familiar woman before him.
&quot;Boogie...? 

She&#39;d saved him. Again. Just like last time. He was safe now... though, Ryn was still in shock as his servant spoke. It was only when she turned slightly away, exposing her back to him, charred to a crisp along her coat and skin, that snapped him out of it.
&quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; 

Eyes turning glassy, he trudged towards her, only to buckle to his knees. His guitar clattered at his side. He was still dizzy from the panic of it all... but looking up at his servant, he could tell she was trying not to show any signs of pain. If she did at all that is... the vaguest thought that, perhaps, she didn&#39;t want him to worry too much, passed his mind. Gulping dryly, he hurriedly rubbed his eyes, and turned his gaze to Boogie&#39;s face, answering her straight. He put on a nonchalant expression. 

&quot;I-Im... fine. Don&#39;t worry about me. Always saving me right at the nick of time aren&#39;t you? M-My hero...&quot;
A raspy chuckle came weakly from his lips, and the boy slowly got to his feet. He closed the distance between them, and pat his servant&#39;s shoulder. Wouldve given her a hug to show his gratitude, if it wouldn&#39;t have hurt to wrap an arm around her scorched back.</span>

When she pointed out the body in the sand, Ryn followed the Boogieman&#39;s gaze. He stared out a moment, before pursing his lips, and wordlessly shuffling towards the shore. A couple dozen seconds, and he stood over the limp body of Ruth Naomi, nose crinkled at the sight of her. She looked awful... and her blood was beginning to pool into a blotch of crimson sand outlining her body. There was no doubt about it; if they left her here, she&#39;d bleed out to death. Didn&#39;t need to finish the job, even if they just up and went along their day. 

Ryn chewed his lip and glanced at the sea. Surely they couldn&#39;t do that, though. Leave her to die here? They hadn&#39;t come to kill her in the first place-- things weren&#39;t supposed to happen this way! Everything he and Boogie did here seemed to lead to someone getting hurt; everyime, it all just sorta happened... then again... Ruth started it. She bit Boogie&#39;s neck first, and if it&#39;d been the real Brandon, who knows what would&#39;ve happened to that man. By all means, she wasn&#39;t someone &quot;good&quot;-- hell just a couple days of ago, they&#39;d deemed her the source of all &quot;evil&quot; bundled up with those delusional cultists! Yet, it was... hard, coming to that same conclusion now, seeing her battered to a bloody pulp at his feet. Not to mention, she probably knew everything there was to know about Nirvana, including what he wanted to know. 

The boy blew quietly through his teeth before casting his eyes down at the woman, and with a face blank in thought, pondered softly aloud.
&quot;Ruth Naomi, to live... or to perish...&quot; 

Two fingers raised to his temple, massaging an impending headache. What would <em>he</em> do...
&quot;...&quot;</span>
