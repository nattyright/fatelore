It took longer than expected. Terrible storms plagued the desert the entire route back, so what became a day of trekking swelled dramatically as Donald tried to protect Cameran from terrible winds. Eventually though, they made it, and promptly crashed asleep.

Except Granel couldn&#39;t.

He stared at the ceiling, pondering the journal. What had happened to <em>shshshsh</em>? Why would they invert towards the people hunting him down? How did the Nirvanans seduce someone to their side so absolutely? Death? 

No, that didn&#39;t make sense. Nirvanans would rather maul than seduce one to their side, so that could only mean one thing:

<strong>This land was rotten.</strong>

If that was the case, then were the Nirvanans actually evil, or were they a byproduct of the environment? If that were the case, Granel was ignorant and violent, not them. He was no better than Nirvanans.

&quot;What were you thinking, <em>shshshsh</em>?&quot; Granel whispered as the sun slowly began to rise as dawn broke. He shook his head. No! This was a trick! It was them! It had to be them! <strong>They</strong> made the land rotten, and had elected to stay! It was their fault! Theirs!

With a grumble, Granel crawled out of his sleeping bag and poked his head into his bag. No booze. Low on food. Yep, this was terrible. They could go fishing, but that journal mentioned the state of the wildlife. Did he want to get mauled by a goldfish?

Granel considered it, before shrugging. He took off his suit, revealing a tank top. Bulging against it was a metal spike. Granel sighed. It froze against his skin, as always. Cold mornings were the worst.

If he was gonna go hunting, he&#39;d need to borrow Donald&#39;s sword. Waking him up was unwise, though. Maybe he could sneak towards the sleeping Scotsman and borrow his sword.

By the time they had returned to their ginormous cottage, Donald was exhausted to the bone. Cameran seemed fine enough but surely less active as he was in the hospital. He related to the insect greatly as he collapsed on the floor once he stepped inside. If Granel had any concerns about the status of his Servant, the most he could figure out was that he wasn’t dead. 

While Granel contemplated many things, Donald had the exact opposite game plan. Not a single thought broached that head of his, and especially not while asleep. What point was there to think when one of them was doing it all for the other?

Especially thoughts of hunger. Like Granel. Donald had slept on just the one and almost all of the other apple, but his status as a Servant let him get away with it. The brute needed sustenance in the physical form. His huge frame would make a hunt bothersome, but anything was better than nothing.

As the board creaked, Donald stirred slightly. Splayed flat on his belly, his gun arm twitched. Shit. 

However, his eyes did not open. If anything, he seemed to fall even more asleep. A groan escaped his lips as he shifted. Rolled onto the side, now with his sword in an even more advantageous position. With the Scot determined to sleep longer, surely it would be simple to snatch the weapon and go out on his own.

Another step. Another. Almost there… now just to reach out and–

<em>Click</em>

Granel couldn’t even process what happened. One moment, the Servant had been asleep as a rock. The next, his Master would stare down the cold barrel of a flintlock. Nearly as cold as his chest spike.

Donald still looked half-dead, with those half-open eyes. “Oh. Just you.”

He dropped his weapon almost immediately, but kept his finger on the trigger. “Got me there fer a second. What’s yer gameplan &#39;ere? Sabre er flintlock?”</span>

Granel inclined his head to Donald&#39;s sword, a faint smirk on his face. Bless his Servant&#39;s heart. He and Donald disagreed on several issues, but the Servant&#39;s heart was in the right place, and Granel wholeheartedly respected him.

&quot;<strong>The sword. I was going hunting. We&#39;re low on food, and I don&#39;t feel like breaking into town, see. Figured I&#39;d check on the wildlife that the journal mentioned.</strong>&quot; Hunting and info gathering all at once? Efficient. If Granel did anything well, it was tying mission and life together.

And quoting soap operas.

&quot;<strong>Do you mind? Feel free to go back to sleep, or prep a fire. I&#39;m not that good at cleaning game.</strong>&quot;

Granel could probably rip the skeleton out of a bear that he hunted. He was also excellent at deft maneuvers. Cleaning corpses? Not on the skill list.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Donald returned the flintlock to it’s previous position and drew the sabre. This close, it looked just like any other sword minus the weird protrusion right below the hilt. Its dull silver shine threw a faint beam of light around the cabin as Donald spun it in the air. 

He held said hilt to his Master, “Go see what ye can find. Leave the cleanin’ and fire t’me.”

Maybe he would teach the brute a thing or two about eating like one was in his own time frame. Not so he could have a potentially useful life skill, but so if this happened again he wouldn’t have to be the one doing all the work. Or any of the work, if he worked his charm. 

Besides, the less fur and bones he ate the better. 

With that settled, Saber sat upright and rubbed the tired from his eyes. It was surely morning, but anything past that was a guess. Cold morning air nipped at his fingers, which left them stiff and lethargic. Worst feeling in the world, hands down. And cold. Argh, there was a joke somewhere in that statement. 

“And don’t lose that thing,” Donald said. “Without that, we might as well use me gun to end our lives before our foes do it fer us.”

He then rose to his feet, only to be hit with a dozen different pinpricks in his body. Sore muscles screamed all over that his decision to fall asleep anywhere was the worst possible, and he rubbed his pained arms. A dozen curses escaped his lips as he started to stretch. Good ol’ fashioned movement would work out most of the soreness, but it looked as if a few of these aches would stick around for a while.

“Oh, before ye go,” Donald called out while bent halfway over, “‘ave you seen Cameran? Don’t feel ‘im on me, and I don’t ‘member where I left him before I conked out.”</span>

Wasn&#39;t he with you?</strong>&quot; Granel asked his Servant pointedly, before looking around and on his shoulders. He couldn&#39;t pat himself down—one small pat from Granel would be enough to crush the roach into oblivion—leaving Donald distraught.

&quot;<strong>If he scurried off, I&#39;ll look for him outside. He&#39;s a roach. Can&#39;t have gotten far.</strong>&quot; Granel said to his Servant, foot out the doorway. It was almost impossible. Finding a roach in the wilderness? A needle in a haystack.

Mason&#39;s hopes weren&#39;t too high, but he could at least promise Donald, right?

The sword had a cool grip, and fit well in Granel&#39;s massive palm. For him, it was essentially a large knife. Nonetheless, it would do. It would be the greatest knife of all time.

Leaving Donald to his own devices, Granel walked out of the cottage. Where to hunt? Where to find the best wildlife? Granel peered across the waterfront, seeing two geese glaring each other down.

Granel blinked.

<strong>HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!!!!</strong>

The geese started mauling each other, much to Granel&#39;s shock. He watched in morbid fascination for a moment, before coming to. This was just like in the journal...

&quot;<strong>HEY HEY, BREAK IT UP!</strong> Granel bellowed, splashing into the water. The two geese continued fighting without even noticing he was there. It was like they didn&#39;t even see him. After a moment, Granel couldn&#39;t bear to watch it any longer.

A flash of steel. Off went their heads.

Was breakfast seriously going to be that easy?

After another long night spent on the ship, albeit after some severe renovations Galvin and Ankou had continued their exploration of Nirvana, with more than a few combination attacks figured out, and a better understanding of the differences in their power, mostly on Galvin&#39;s part, they were prepared to take a more active role in the events going on around the island.

The cool rush of air against his face and running through his air was giving him quite a rush, despite how much he had done it in the past days, flying so freely and fast like this was an experience unlike any other, but for Galvin he was still getting to used to just being in the proximity of his servant, it wasn&#39;t that the cold radiated off this man like a large fan, no the heat was quite literally being sucked out of the surrounding air, leaving him in this strange mid point of warmth from sunlight and what little air that moved by him, and just dead cold that avoided freezing him because Ankou could kind of turn it down, and it still unsettled him even in these situations.

Coming to fly over a large lake he spotted the run down overtaken cottage in the distance, pointing down to it for his servant to see, &quot;Hey big guy, ten o&#39; clock, we got a house, doesn&#39;t look too promising, given how rundown and overtaken it is, I&#39;d feel safe in assuming it stopped seeing much use even before the island went insane. That being said I&#39;m a bit desperate for a lead and if we&#39;re lucky it&#39;ll turn out the building is just a cover for some secret underground lair.&quot; he said the last part with a bit of sarcasm, &quot;Bring us down by the lake if the place is being watched, better to not be boxed in.</span>

Security guy... Granson?&quot; he asked himself peering forwards a bit as he stepped onto the water like it was solid ground, &quot;Ankou, looks like we&#39;ve got a friendly face on our hands here, try not to intimidate him to death okay?&quot; he called back to his servant. Galvin then proceeded to cut across the water walking straight to Granel rather than walking around the water front.

Just as Granel cut them down his voice would speak up, &quot;Sheesh bit of a harsh punishment for disobedience don&#39;t ya think?&quot;

The journal was correct. Animals were fighting one another. He was sure the other goose would fight back once Granel beheaded its rival, but it simply kept mauling its corpse.

Wonderful. If that was correct, than it was likely that the rest of the info would be, too. He needed to warn the others.

As he pondered this realization, a shadow appeared overhead. Was that a <em>chariot</em>? Granel swore. He had been found! He should&#39;ve stuck to the treeline instead of going hunting in the water. Not only would he be slowed substantially, but he was a sitting duck—goose.

A man jumped out of the chariot, and into the water. However, instead of splashing into it, he simply stood on it. This new challenger would&#39;ve been an excellent addition to Beachwatch™️! Yet this power was strangely similar...

&quot;<strong>DIE, NIRVANAN SCUM!</strong>&quot; Granel roared as he held up Donald&#39;s sword, before stopping it a few inches from the other man&#39;s head. Granel&#39;s demeanor changed as he put down the sword, and his gaze softened.

&quot;<strong>Sterling! As I live and breathe! You&#39;re alive!</strong>&quot; Granel boomed as he put down the sword and scooped up Galvin into a bone-cracking hug. &quot;<strong>It is good to see you! How has your Nirvanan vacation been going?</strong>&quot; Granel asked as Galvin&#39;s life flashed before his eyes.

This man was going to crush him!

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Galvin nearly jumped out of his skin as Granel swung a sword at his face. It wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d come face to face with a blade wielding maniac, but it certainly was looking like it might be his last. As his eye&#39;s widened, and his face a light with terror he rose his left hand hoping for his gauntlet to halt the strike... If was wearing it at the time. Once the blade paused mere inches from his Galvin emptied his lungs into a long drawn out exasperated wheeze  as the adrenaline kicked in, &quot;Oh my Go-!!!&quot; he was cut off by the sudden hug.

Feeling his spine straighten out Galvin struggled for air, &quot;G-good t-t-to see you... You t-too Gran...&quot; he forced out with a hoarse and strained voice as his one free hand pat the man on the back returning the gesture, or more accurately tapping out for release, but who could tell the difference? &quot;I&#39;ll tell ya- all about it- if you stop trying to kill me- for two seconds...&quot;

Though telepathically to Ankou he was screaching, &quot;ANKOU GET HIM OFF, HELP ME ALREADY!!!&quot;

This man looked like he kicked puppies for fun, however, he was clearly an affectionate man. Unlike Ankou, it seemed appearance was not the best indicator of character. The servant stepped from his carriage the water turning solid under his feet. The lake had been turned to a chunk of ice, water and Ankou were anything but compatible.

“If you would please let go of my Master.” Ankou spoke in a monotone voice a blistering cold washing over Galvin and Granel. Rider was not intending to come off with aggression, in fact, he had little control over the frost he created. 

The servant paced forward till he was behind the affectionate reunion. Ankou glinted down for a moment, he hadn&#39;t hugged someone in what seemed like a million years.

He had lost control of his own strength for a moment, but could he help it? An investigator, safe and sound!

&quot;<strong>I apologize, Sterling. I forget my own strength sometimes. Please forgive me, a dereliction of my duty...</strong>&quot; Granel bemoaned at his comrade&#39;s expense. Ankou was right. The dude was a sweetheart, despite his ferocious demeanor.  

As Granel babbled apologies, he looked up to see Ankou standing behind his Master like a dark shadow. He blinked once, before shivering. Was the water always this cold? Granel felt his breath mist in front of him.

&quot;<strong>You must be Mister Sterling&#39;s Servant. As an honorary member of the Canopus and Investigation Team, you are welcome to my hospitality. Any friend of Sterling is a friend of mine. Thank you for protecting him, Servant. I apologize for strangling your Master.</strong>&quot;
 
Granel took Ankou&#39;s hand in his massive one, shaking it without asking permission. Scandalous! However, direct contact with someone capable of freezing the lake? Bad move. Frost crept up Granel&#39;s hands, though he didn&#39;t seem to notice.

&quot;I appreciate the hospitality, it has been a long time since I have met a kind soul.&quot; Ankou stepped back behind his master. The agent of death didn&#39;t need anymore physical contact. The last thing he wanted was to accidentally kill a teammate. 
 
Ankou&#39;s pupils wandered the landscape. The servant was trying to locate Granel&#39;s servant, certainly he was close by. Ankou had a plethora of questions for the fellow investigators, however, he would first let his master get the ball rolling. Afterall Ankou knew nothing about their comrades.

It makes them strange.</strong>&quot;

The journal. Granel squeezed his eyes shut before soldiering on.

&quot;<strong>Of course, my Servant is still well and alive. I&#39;ll introduce you. Maybe he&#39;ll have gotten a fire going. And you, Servant, don&#39;t worry about harming me.</strong>&quot; Granel waved a slightly frostbitten hand, which mended itself before Ankou and Galvin&#39;s eyes. &quot;<strong>I am very durable.</strong>&quot;

The security chief turned away from the two, wading across the waterfront towards the disheveled cottage. &quot;<strong>It is good that you two appeared now. You must be starving. Our job in obtaining Nirvana&#39;s schematics haven&#39;t changed, but we can&#39;t do it on an empty stomach. After that, we shall trade info.</strong>&quot;

Letting out an aggravated scream, he spit out any of the blood mixed water that got in his mouth as he eyed Granel up with an almost crazed look, one befitting the Nirvanan scum he was assumed to be, &quot;You maniac! Are you <em><strong>trying</strong></em> to kill me?! You nearly gave me a heart attack with your little charade there!!!!&quot; he yelled pointing at Granel. &quot;

Seven days...

Looking to the security chief again, he raised on hand as mana swirled around it at pat the man a few times, using shifting tides he gripped every drop he could and threw his hand down, forcing all of the water to slide off their bodies and out of their clothes quick drying them in the process. Coming up to the building he looked around for a door, though that seemed to have rotted away a while ago, &quot;Guess there&#39;s not much point in knocking.&quot; he said stepping through the opening.

A fire had been brought to life, and the warmth staved off any cold that dare linger after the sun cast its gaze on the land. Smoke began to seep from the chimney above as the small group approached. 

As they entered, they would see a large man knelt right in front of the fire, a finger pointed at his own face. The astute observer (or anyone with a good pair of eyes) would see that something was on his finger. A cockroach, to be exact. 

“Great timin’!”, Donald said over his shoulder, “just got the fire roarin’. And look, I found Cameran! Was in the woodpile, explorin’. He takes after yer crew, I reckon.”

If it weren’t for the terribly out-of-place black and red hat, this guy would’ve looked a whole lot more… respectable, for lack of a better term. As it stood, the whole scene looked a bit silly. 

Saber paid it no mind, and instead pushed himself up from his current spot. He eyes the two newcomers, but his eyes stuck to Ankou a lot longer than they did to Galvin. Something about this one made him feel incredibly uneasy. However, almost everyone he’d met so far gave off the same impression. 

Best attributed to the circumstances of his summon than anything else. 

“Welcome, welcome! Make yerself at home,” He said to the both of them. “Me name’s Donald McBane.”

He turned his attention back to his master, “Looks like yer hunt went well,” He approached them all as the bug was put onto his shoulder. Two geese? Headless at that. A clean skill, at least. These <em>might</em> feed the four of them, but looks like he’d have to go easy on his own portion.

He took the carcasses from his Master, and looked around. “Right, need a good spot and perhaps somethin’ small to cut with.”

No one needed to know that his experience with geese was a little rusty. Couldn’t be that hard, right? Just get the feathers off and shove it on a stick, seemed simple enough.</span>

It wasn&#39;t his fault that he didn&#39;t know his own strength! Nonetheless, he let Galvin vent out of anger.

&quot;<strong>Don&#39;t knock.</strong>&quot; Granel warned Galvin. &quot;<strong>I tried to borrow his sword and he instinctively tried to shoot me.</strong>&quot; Granel entered first, only to stop as he whistled. Donald worked fast! The geese flew through the air towards Donald. &quot;<strong>I found guests, so we&#39;ll have to make do with what I got. Work your magic, Donald.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Check the pouch. There might be a survival knife in there. Feel free to take a seat, Sterling, Ankou...?</strong>&quot; Granel asked, having heard Galvin spit out the name back on the waterfront. He didn&#39;t recognize it. Hopefully they were powerful.

Wood creaked as Granel took a seat against the wall. The fire crackled, drying Granel&#39;s clothes. A nice feeling, if only they had drink to go alongside it. He coughed once. &quot;<strong>So.</strong>&quot; His demeanor becoming businesslike.

&quot;<strong>I assume you&#39;ve figured out that this island is cursed. The people, murderers. The wildlife has become oddly aggressive. The sooner we get off of Nirvana, the better. Have you found anything, Sterling? Anyone? What of the rest of our comrades?</strong>&quot;

You guys got that in common.&quot; he remarked still a bit bitter for the sword incident as he made his way in. Getting  much warmer welcome than he expected, he gave a simple wave, &quot;Nice to meet ya, should have come to the lake, you missed the most touch reuinion.&quot; he added already seeming to put the situation behind him in the next moment.

 Standing near the fire Galvin appreciated the break from the constant chill of Ankou, hearing Granel call out to him for question he thought back to their seven day excursion, but so far, &quot;Nothing useful I&#39;m afraid Mason. Best I can offer is a few safe places, at least in appearance, with little to no people about so we may have a few fall back points should things get dicey or places like this get compromised. Ankou and I looked around as best we could, checking most of the nature reserves and such since the animals were all acting wacked out, so we assumed we&#39;d get a lead there, but I dunno must have just been the wrong spots to look.&quot; he answered resting a hand on his hip as he held one hand next to the fire.

&quot;And as for comrades, not counting you? No dice, but that might be for the best, if I couldn&#39;t find them, the Islanders should have the same problem, it hopefully means they&#39;re all keeping safe for the most part while we&#39;re here, other than the few war torn places we&#39;ve seen while shuffling about. First place we tried was the swamp, found some Capybaras there, so if you ever get sick of geese there&#39;s more food. I had taken some water from around the places with the intent to see if I could find any irregularities in it. Ya know like trace amounts of mage concoctions that could be spreading this curse through plants and animals that get from it, but with the Canopus wrecked and needing to stay on the move no chance there. You have any better luck?&quot;

If he was disappointed, Granel didn&#39;t show it. Galvin didn&#39;t have much info to spill, unfortunately. That was frustrating. It felt like for each step Granel took forward in finding his fellow coworkers, he remained chained in place on his actual task. He had vowed to protect his teammates, yes, but the best way to protect them was to get off the island with the schematics. 

The schematics, or the people? 

&quot;<strong>We&#39;ve found a bit, Sterling. Money.</strong>&quot; Granel chuckled to himself as he shuffled around in his bag, before pulling out a few bills. &quot;<strong>If you can even call it that. Look at this. Paper! Not even NATs! How these can even be called money is beyond me. Why is Nirvana on an entirely different form of currency? It makes no logical sense!</strong>

Granel seemed to realize that babbling on about money wouldn&#39;t seem very impressive, because he also pulled out a beaten journal. &quot;<strong>Also, this. A prior investigation team journal. It&#39;s been a gold mine of information. Unfortunately, nothing on the schematics of Nirvana, sadly.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Animals. People. They become inhuman upon stepping onto this island. I thought it was because of those Nirvanans. They are animals. But now...</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s frowned, a worried expression on his face. &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t know.</strong>&quot;

&quot;I-If what you just said is the case, then it sounds like we&#39;re on one hell of a time constraint here. If it&#39;s just the island itself, then it also means we have whatever it is too, or we should at least act like we do. You haven&#39;t noticed any changes in your behavior since coming here, sudden violent urges and such? What about the ser... No the summoning should keep that from being a worry, and if anything the magc here is child&#39;s play to them.&quot; he stopped himself not wanting to sow distrust between their partners, &quot;Mason that just means we gotta work fast, We don&#39;t know for certain sure, let&#39;s use that as a center of hope. If this curse works at different rates we cold run into fellow investigators so we need to be cautious on approach... Hell I already don&#39;t like the idea that our welcoming party could have been members of the previous teams. Is there anything else that may give us some direction a place to go?&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Donald paid little attention to the conversation, and set up shop right next to Granel’s bag. Despite being dead, the dead birds seemed to give off an intimidating air. This was new territory to him, as he hadn’t dealt with goose in particular. Couldn’t have been that different than other fowl, right?

The feathers were yanked from the bird, and he made sure they were nowhere near the carcass. A healthy portion of them danced in the air around Saber as he did the task. When he finished that part, it felt eerily reminiscent of the desert. His lips stayed firmly shut.

Next, the knife. He fished around for it in the sack, before he found it within the side pocket. With that in hand, he did more bloody work. Took him back. 

Now was the time to tune into the conversation. Perfect time, too, as Galvin had asked what their next step was. 

“Oh, we got word from one o’ them islanders. William, I think his name was. Said to check out…”

His mind blanked. What had the man said? Blowy blab? Blowy… something.

“Somewhere it blows a lot,” Donald finally spit out. “Granel, ‘ere was the bloody place?” 

The knife continued the graceful assault on the fowl all the meanwhile. Skilled, dextrous hand. A mighty unnatural look.</span>

Rider’s eyes shifted to the table as Granel spread the money out.  “Paper money had been used for a few centuries” the servant commented. “Is it so hard to believe an isolated society would stick to system proved reliable from centuries of use?” 

Ankou took a seat after his statement. His scythe leaned against the table balancing on the butt end. “If the islanders are aggressive we will kill them, Galvin and me may not have discovered much, but we’ve worked on our combat skills extensively. Granel, sharing your information only guarantees a second set of capable hands in your travels.” 

Ankou wasn&#39;t sure of Granel and his servant was bothered by the lack of his information. Ankou, however, felt he needed to reassure the duo that both he and his master were worthwhile to keep around.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Galvin&#39;s question rattled Granel slightly, before he dismissed the former&#39;s concerns entirely. Him? Corrupted? Impossible. His will was unshakeable. He was the victor of dozens upon dozens of battles, and his mind was like iron. He knew why he was on the island, and he knew what he was facing. He would <strong>not</strong> be led astray.

He would not end up like Koji and his obsessiveness or Alex with his inhumanity.

<em>Would he?</em> There were definite parallels between himself and the two Nirvanans. Was the island changing him? Making him more animal? Inhumane? 

They had made their choices. Granel had made his. They had elected to become monsters. Scum. Filth. He had something greater than himself to fight for. He had watched people die in front of his very eyes. Their wishes... Their <strong>feelings</strong>...

They were all part of him now.

He couldn&#39;t entertain the idea that the other side felt the same way.

&quot;<strong>No.</strong>&quot; Granel answered truthfully as he looked Galvin in the eye. &quot;<strong>I am me, Sterling. That will never change.</strong>&quot;</span>

We will gather everyone who has survived. We will gather the schematics we were hired to find. We will leave. Alive. All of us. I promise.</strong>&quot;

As Donald cleaned the carcass, Granel snapped his fingers. Right. William, the sleazebag. Granel didn&#39;t trust him, but he hadn&#39;t lied yet. Misdirected? Insulted? Yes. Lie? No.

&quot;<strong>The snowlands. Yeah, William mentioned those. Are you two familiar with the Caster William Shakespeare? He told us to check our Nirvana&#39;s &#39;heart&#39;. Apparently, there&#39;s something interesting there. I&#39;ve been meaning to check it out with Donald, but now that you&#39;re here...</strong>&quot;

This could work. Sending Galvin off to investigate William&#39;s tip would allow Granel to follow the clues in the journal. They could kill two birds with one stone. Besides, it wasn&#39;t like Granel could go into the snowlands himself. Getting struck by Lancer&#39;s Noble Phantasm already slowed down his healing factor. Could his Mystic Code stop his body from shutting down?

&quot;<strong>You are right, Ankou. A second pair of hands would be nice.</strong>&quot; Granel agreed. &quot;<strong>I think you&#39;re wrong about the money, though. Every single city I&#39;ve visited has used NATs. Even shitholes. Why not this shithole in particular?</strong>&quot;

He grunted, shaking his head like an elephant bothered by flies. &quot;<strong>Nonetheless, my brain hurts. Donald! How&#39;s the cooking going?</strong>&quot;

Not preferable but a lead&#39;s a lead, don&#39;t know how comfortable I am taking tips from the servant of our hosts, but without much else to work on a possible trap will provide us with information of which we are sorely in need of at the moment.&quot;

Turning to Ankou he seemed to have an idea, &quot;Hey big guy, seems like we won&#39;t have to worry about giving up the element of surprise, going up to the snow lands should keep that presence of yours pretty under the radar, so it&#39;ll let us move more freely if we find any people up there. No need to risk cutting through town and alerting them just yet.&quot; he said making his way over to the security chief

Galvin grew a genuine smile as he looked to Granel, resting a hand on his shoulder, &quot;And hey.., Glad to hear it Mason, if you went crazy then this mission might actually be hopeless, so make sure to keep a level for all our sakes okay?.&quot; he said more encouragingly than anything else, as a slight glow came to the hand, &quot;Here let me place a little watermark, seeing as we&#39;re splitting up again real soon I figured I better have an easy way to find ya again.&quot;

In actuality, things had worked out somewhat well. What he lacked in pure experience was made up with a little brute force and a whole lot of luck. His cuts had been well, and soon enough the geese resembled those you’d find in those plastic bags at the store. 

And now, time to actually roast them. Unless that other Servant knew how to immediately cook a goose this size, this would take some time. He had already prepared an outline of a spit over the fire, with a few of the sturdiest logs propped up against the walls. 

Since there wasn’t a good wood log to stick through the birds (two of them, at that), he got a little creative. 

Granel and Galvin might’ve seen Donald hold up one of the ovular bodies. The other hand held up his prized sword. He wasn’t–

<strong>*Ka-THUNK</strong>

Just as they had been beheaded, it was now skewered by the same blade. A vaguely clean blade, but it would have to do for now. Worst came to worst, any potential intruders would be baffled and terrified as he plucked a glowing sword with two partially cooked birds still stuck on. 

The other one followed suit soon after, and they were ready to go. The aforementioned wood logs were adjusted, and the blade was carefully balanced between them sideways. Geese sat above the flames that licked and nibbled at the flesh. 

What a feat of ingenuity!</span>

The commotion from Donald&#39;s cooking would grab the reapers attention, his eyes darting to the skewered geese. Ankou stepped towards the cooking birds, the circles around his eye holes growing wide. He looked at the geese like a child opening a present on Christmas day. 

&quot;... Donald is it? These birds how do they taste? Are you a good cook? When will they be ready?&quot; Suddenly Ankou began to list of a slew of questions. Whatever important stuff the group was talking about Ankou found himself far more interested in the makeshift rotisserie. Perhaps that&#39;s a natural reaction for someone who loves for thousands of years but could only east for the first 20 or so.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">“Aye, that’s me name,” Donald replied. The other Servant had decided the important talk anything but, instead focused on the makeshift spit. Specifically, the two geese that were now being caressed by the open flame. Already did the fat start to sizzle and plunge into the fire, which filled the air with a pleasant aroma.

Donald leaned back, now cross legged in front of the fire, “And take ‘er easy! They’ll be done when they’re ready. As fer those other two…”

He leaned close, real close. As close as he could to the other individual whilst on the ground. A hand covered his lips, “We’ll find out together.”

Donald roared in laughter, a few good chuckles that threatened to shake the sword off of it’s perch. “I jest! I ain’t too bad, but they’re just birds in a fire. No spices to go with ‘em. No ale. As we said in the army, the hungrier ye are, the better they’ll be!”

“Hope yer starvin’,” He took off his hat, “cause otherwise they’ll be quite uninspirin’.”

Saber used his hat as a makeshift fan, an attempt to make it any less cool in the little cottage. If he backed up, it’d do the trick. But those birds needed to be watched closely. Besides, the important talk wasn’t terribly exciting to the Scot either.</span>

Granel&#39;s eyes filled with tears as he fished around his bag for a handkerchief, sniffling all the while. After a few moments, he found one, and proceeded to blow into it. 

The resulting noise caused the cottage to rumble, and Nirvanans on then other side of the island could probably hear it. Hell, they&#39;d probably think it was a storm and not some extremely large invader blowing his nose.

&quot;<strong>Mister Sterling, you give me too much credit. You&#39;re too kind to a nag like me.</strong>&quot; Granel sniffed, reaching out a hand to accept Galvin&#39;s watermark. He and Donald had been alone together for so long, that a friendly face saying that he was doing an excellent job was enough to move the man to tears.

&quot;<strong>That&#39;s right!</strong>&quot; Granel boomed, flaring up at once. &quot;<strong>We cannot afford to slack off. I will work twice as hard to ensure the safety of our staff, or I am not a member of the Canopus&#39;s Security Division!</strong>&quot;

With that solemn vow, Granel looked over to Ankou and Donald. They seemed to be hitting it off. That was good. Donald needed some time to shine while Granel and Galvin plans. If Ankou and Galvin were to head to the heart of Nirvana, it could be dangerous. Who knew what William would be up to?

&quot;<strong>Donald, I think you should go with them.</strong>&quot; Granel said, much to the surprise of all, including himself.

Once the thunderous sound boomed out from the security chief&#39;s nose, it took the young magus back a bit, putting on an awkward smile he pat Granel&#39;s shoulder a few times, &quot;Uhh... N-no problem Mason, really I&#39;m just being honest.&quot;

Shaking Granel&#39;s hand, Galvin used what little moisture on them to draw the seal on Granel&#39;s palm with his little bit of mana infused into it to complete the mark, with a nod he&#39;d step back. &quot;Hold on you sure you want to send your Servant with us? I mean not that I doubt your ability to wreck anything that comes through that doorway, but we do have other servants roaming about, I don&#39;t know how safe this is.&quot; he questioned.

Donald stroked his thick, hairy beard, deep in thought. “My thoughts go with Galvin o’er here. Yer big and tough, but that means nothin’ to some of the folks we’ve seen and met with. That bloke I gutted, <em>god bless his soul</em>,” Donald quickly muttered, “wasn’t a push over. I got lucky, plain as that.”

However, splitting up certainly had some benefits with it. More ground covered, more odds to met some of the Canopus Crew:™:, and with him, they had better odds in case it was a death trap to make it out alive at all. 

“Well, we need to ask someone very important,” Donald turned back to Ankou. However, he didn’t ask the other Servant. Instead, he reached into his shirt and pulled out the cockroach. 

“What’dya think, Cameran?” 

Cameran wiggled his antennae with reckless abandon. Maybe he was just hungry still. “Oh, little guy, I know. These geese will be done before ya know it. Promise.” He pet the brown insect on its head, a comforting motion.

Was it right to be worried about Granel without Donald, or was the opposite the real concern?</span>

Surely one man couldn&#39;t take on a master and a servant. Ankou and Galvin would just have to trust in Granel&#39;s ability to move safely. 

Rider turned his head to Donald. He watched as Saber turned around doing what seemed like asking Ankou&#39;s opinion. &quot;Yes I am fin-.....&quot; Ankou held his breath, his voice falling still. He staired silently at the cockroach, the blue flames in his eyes dimming. Answering a question for someone else on accident is embarrassing enough... But a cockroach... Ankou shook his head, this man was crazy.  

&quot;Master I think we should trust Granel&#39;s capabilities, let us eat and then investigate.... I presume &#39;Cameran&#39; will be coming as well?&quot; As Ankou spoke he could only think of one thing. It had been many thousands of years since he got to taste food, and now he&#39;d have to share it with a pest?

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The questions of assurance rung on deaf ears as Granel pulled out <em>shshshsh&#39;s</em> journal and stared at it. He had to figure out what was happening on Nirvana. Was this island truly corrupt? Were these citizens to blame?

He hated Nirvana. Its people. Its wildlife. Everything. He wanted to set the preserve up in smoke and leave it forgotten to the pages of history. 

He hated the people, who attacked without warning. Even if they weren&#39;t to blame.

He hated—

He hated...

<em>Why am I so concerned about these people? They should just be killed and left to rot! They sold us out and butchered everyone like dogs!</em>

<em>Kill them! Liars and scum! They&#39;re killing your companions!</em>

Why couldn&#39;t he decide?

&quot;<strong>What a pain in the ass.</strong>&quot; Granel muttered, before looking up to see Donald and Ankou chumming it up. He sighed and wiped his face as Galvin&#39;s watermark took effect, obscuring half his face in a bright light.

&quot;<strong>Do not worry about me. I&#39;m weaker than before, but I&#39;m still more than enough for most people. If a Servant&#39;s Noble Phantasm couldn&#39;t kill me, do you think a couple halfhearted stabs can?</strong>&quot; He tried for a halfhearted smirk, but the muscles in his face twitched.

&quot;<strong>Besides, I want to look more into this journal and see if I can get more info on it. It&#39;s surprisingly boring, dull work. You know that, Donald.</strong>&quot; Granel waved a finger, giving Donald a flashback to their hospital search. Never again.

&quot;<strong>Besides, you can always fly back using Ankou&#39;s chariot, yeah? It&#39;s a non-issue! Besides, you&#39;re going to the literal heart of this accursed place. If there was anything that required two Servants, it would be that. &#39;The Heart of Nirvana...&#39; Even the name is ominous.</strong>&quot;

He tried for a laugh, before clapping his hands together, scaring off every bird in a five mile radius.

And while he didn’t agree with Granel’s assessment of his own personal damages, all it took was a quick assumption of the work he’d do on his end to get Donald with a deep scowl. “If that’s ‘ow it is, then yer on yer own.”

Neither man elaborated on what exactly happened in the hospital and unless one of the other two wanted to pester about it, then the secret would die with them. Considering how quickly it got Saber to clam up and kill his jovial mood, though…

“And, well, if that’s ‘ow ye work,” Donald said to Ankou, “then perhaps this isn’t a completely suicidal plan. I hope yer ride can carry three.”

Donald finally let the cockroach free, back to scurry on his shirt. “Granel, when were ye thinkin’ on actin’ with this plan? Considerin’ the time of day, I assume it’s not before long.”</span>

Goodness, how much time had they spent from hunting to cooking and planning? To be fair, Granel had woken up substantially later, due to being exhausted.

&quot;<strong>We have a few hours before it turns dark. It&#39;ll take a few hours for me to get back to town, and I&#39;d rather it be dark by the time I cross.</strong>

Sleeping bags were folded, packed, and Granel hoisted his backpack onto his shoulders, before shrugging. &quot;<strong>That journal mentioned several labs. Figured I&#39;d walk across the island and work my way back here. It&#39;s a big place.</strong>&quot;

As he was explaining his plan, Granel looked hungrily at the geese. They <em>did</em> look good. Nonetheless, he sighed. It wouldn&#39;t even fill him up, most likely. &quot;<strong>You&#39;ll have to eat without me, naturally. Please be cautious, Sterling, Ankou.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>And you, Donald. Die, and I&#39;ll resummon you and kick your ass myself.</strong>&quot;

With that, Granel walked out into the doorway, and saw the expanse of Nirvana stretched out before him. A beautiful place, but not worth throwing your life away for. What was <em>shshshsh</em> thinking?

It was time to find out.

Granel Mason put on his sunglasses, gave his Servant and company a thumb up, and walked away.

&quot;I uh, guess I&#39;ll just have to take your word for it Gran, I&#39;d say don&#39;t get yourself killed out there, but I get the impression whatever tries to do ya in will be in more trouble, so just keep your head on straight for when we see ya again.&quot; he responded waving  slightly to see the man off.

Looking to Ankou and Donald, &quot;Well... then I guess that just leaves us, we should hurry and eat up, we&#39;ll need our energy for where we&#39;re going... Wait do you guys even need to eat? Not that I&#39;m trying to hog the food just I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually seen Ankou do it this past week...

And just like that, he was gone. Hopefully for only a short while.

That just left him and the other pair. An average guy, and… whatever the hell Ankou was. “The bugger was found with the journal,” he explained. “Apparently, its owner was the writer himself. Figured I’d keep an eye on it fer him.”

“And you bet yer ass I’m eatin’ one o’ these birds!” He took a cursory glance at the fowl, still early on in their roast. If he had to guess, it would be… another hour, minimum, until they finished. “Just cause I don’t <em>’ave</em> to don’t mean I <em>won’t</em>. Gonna take a bit, though. Get comfortable, make yerself busy, whatever ya want.”

Snowy and blowy, huh? At least he was used to that sort of weather. Not at all like the sandy and blowy he’d just escaped from.</span>

&quot;It just so happens I can fit three. You&#39;ll just have to sit with the corpses is all&quot; Ankou&#39;s coach harbored an almost infinitely large space to store millions of wandering souls. However, Ankou wouldn&#39;t actually be so rude to stick Donald with the dead people. He would make the servant sit in back when the time came. 

&quot;You never offered Master. Its not my place to demand anything from you other than a warriors prowess. Had you offered food I certainly would have taken it. If you recall I&#39;ve been walking around for a long time now... I only got to eat for the first couple of decades of my life.&quot; Ankou grunted clearing his head. The servant had spent enough to time thinking on food.
