The Garden now stood more resolute, more alive than it was following the death of Rosemary. Her frantic energy was once again felt and seen in the estate. 

But what was of concern for the Memory of the druid was the smoke. A fire could spell her final end. All she could hope was the berserker keeping her grounds safe, and that it did not get anywhere close to them.</span>

The emperor didn&#39;t know where they were going or if they were going the right way back to their desert workshop at the hospital, he was just moving. The fire would be a large smoke signal to any islander that wanted to investigate and if they found them, they would be as good as dead. It has been difficult regenerating mana for the Caesar as most of his time was spent watching over the handicapped Dante during their venture. 

He was... tired. The first Emperor of Rome so badly wanted to lay down and pass on. For the first time in the week that they had been on the island, the fighting and combat and stress of battle had taken its toll on him and now he oh so wanted to go to sleep. He didn&#39;t know he could get tired the way he had. He had expended so much mana just to keep himself going, healing his injuries as much as possible to be able to function, but he was meeting his limit. Vortigern had broken him physically and it was only a matter of time before his mental strength wasn&#39;t enough to keep him going. Occasionally he could see parts of his being flutter off of him into the light. He was glad that Dante was blind, he would be worrying about his declining form. 

It mattered not for Octavius however, as long as he brought Dante to safety, he would be fine with that end. The boy had proven himself capable of at least acting on his own and making his own decisions. He had grown out of his shell somewhat. Enough to risk his safety to help Octavius in the battle against the mad king. He could commend that.

Curious and hoping that this was the refuge that the Roman sought, he brought Dante closer.

&quot;I might have found us a shelter to recover in. Hopefully, the owner isn&#39;t home.&quot; Octavius said jokingly, although Dante could hear the bit of a raspy choke behind Octavius&#39;s voice as if he was trying his best to appear healthy and his usual joking, calm, and collected way. Octavius moved closer to the front door and who knows what caused him to do this, the blood loss, the tiredness, who knows, but Octavius then processed to knock on the front door of the estate.</span>

Yet, no answer came. Instead the door yielded itself open to Dante and Octavius. Leading into a cluttered and cramped living space. 

Still looking well lived in, it could be possible that the owner of this estate was gone? Perhaps they were slaughtered by one of the other investigators? 

Either way more questions than answers were formed. 

Eventually Octavius would pick up on a well walked and maintained path amongst the clutter. Heading to the exterior of the estate. 

Perhaps this lead to the greenhouse they could see upon approaching the building?</span>

Well, and he didn&#39;t want to accidentally divulge his waining health. Either way, now they were at some home for some islander that undoubtedly would want them dead for whatever mad reason. The door opening after the knock was off-putting and suspicious to the Emperor, but he couldn&#39;t dwell on that right now, what mattered was the fact that there was a shelter in front of them. As long as he found some way to keep at least Dante safe, it didn&#39;t matter what was in this house. The Caesar hated this damned island. There was no civility present within them, why were they so hostile to them, Octavius oh so wanted to find out why, but as his health wained he just hoped that the owner of this place was more open to conversation. Had previous investigations been violent? Is that why they were killed on sight now? Was this the home of some islander that was slain by their predecessors or wronged by them in some way? While meeting the owner of the estate would make things complicated, not meeting them would have different and also unpleasant implications. After all of the trouble the past week had brought, he wished dearly that the owner of this house hadn&#39;t met a terrible fate, if only the emperor could bring peace to this abominable island, he would be satisfied.

&quot;The door opened for us. Let&#39;s hope the occupants are reasonable.&quot; He said casually as he walked forward through the door. &quot;Perhaps we are welcome Dante?&quot; The emperor chose not to answer the question about his own very needed rest. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

He looked at everything inside the home, the clutter, the stuff. This place was someone&#39;s home alright and either this hoard was a manic obsession or it just hasn&#39;t been well kept for whatever reason. The Roman would know for sure when they made their way to the greenhouse at the end of the estate, if it was still kept up, the owner was alive and they were in a trap. If it was desolate and unkempt, they were likely dead. Easy as that. After that curiosity was sated, perhaps he could then rest. 

As they walked, Octavius pointed out every object in the estate. &quot;This place has been lived in. There&#39;s stuff everywhere. I saw a greenhouse on the way in, perhaps that will tell us if this place still has an owner, and maybe there might be some food that we can eat.&quot; In the process of describing the home, Octavius made an error in his speech that Dante might catch on from when he took care of the emperor after the first fight with Vortigern. The Saber&#39;s method of eating a lot of food to replenish mana. As well, the Emperor never brought up wanting to eat food for himself as a priority, he either ate it to replenish mana as needed or because he was bored.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius didn&#39;t even realize that Dante had left his side. His words were obscured in the emperor&#39;s head as he felt a ringing in his body. The woman out in the greenhouse surely should have seen them or heard them come in right? Perhaps she was the one who let them in the first place. This obviously was a trap of sorts, because why hadn&#39;t attacked immediately? Would she attack them? The Roman chided himself at the thought. He was already at the point of believing that every person on this island would want to kill them on sight, although it wasn&#39;t unfounded. Finally, as he shook himself out of his stupor to recognize the words that came out of Dante&#39;s mouth, it was clear that Octavius was sidetracked by something to not answer his master immediately. He didn&#39;t want to alarm Dante, he was already blind and low on mana as is and he didn&#39;t know the extent of the damage to his eyes. He could feel every single shock from when he tried to see and didn&#39;t know if stress agitated it or not.

&quot;Oh yes Dante I&#39;ll get some rest, it won&#39;t be too long. Just enough to replenish a bit of my mana... Of course...&quot; He trailed off a bit as he turned and looked to his master again, resting in a chair. Good, that would make things easier. Octavius then turned back to the greenhouse and stared at the woman for a few more moments before walking over and entering the enclosure. He looked at the surrounding plants and area to gather his bearings of the place before turning his attention to the destroyed yew tree and back to the woman as he stood a few feet away, not sure on what to say for a moment. Although his normal eloquence would be lacking in this conversation, he hoped that for once on this accursed island, speech would rule the day.

If you wish us gone, we will leave. We want no trouble, we&#39;re simply moving back to safety from danger.&quot; He said, slightly pleading in his tone. The woman could tell that it hurt to speak for Octavius, not just because his body was broken, but his pride as a servant and an Emperor was in question. Octavius has never begged once in his life, and while he wouldn&#39;t start now, less than stellar performances needed to be made from time to time. He was in pain and dying. All he had was Dante and the words that he cultivated in his time on earth. He didn&#39;t even know if they were the only investigators left on the island. While he hated to plead with what was technically the enemy, he wouldn&#39;t let his pride override his will to live and to survive. It was how he remained in power for his entire life. 

&quot;I know not why you opened your home, whether it was to trap us and ensnare us or some other hostile intent, but understand, I don&#39;t want to make another enemy.&quot; He finished and patiently waiting her response with bated breath, his body tensing at what he would assume would be a re-run of the previous week on this island. Although this time would be the last act.</span>

“Please make yourself feel welcome here. I’m sure the lady of the mound will also understand when she returns.” In that moment she placed a hand upon his shoulder. Well what felt like a hand, when in reality it was vines coming from a nearby garden bed. Whilst his enhanced senses where dulled in the moment he could tell that something was different about this woman. 

Rosemary then turned away walking back into the garden and inspecting some of her fruits. “You need something before that frame of yours falls apart… an apple should do just the trick.” Vines then again began to move, picking an apple before presenting it to the Roman emperor. “Please eat this.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The emperor didn&#39;t believe his ears when the woman spoke to him. This... This had to be a trap or some sort of ruse... but he couldn&#39;t deny that he wasn&#39;t enticed by the fruit. The emperor didn&#39;t expect his desperate pleas to be met with kindness, it was a last-ditch effort to secure their survival, this both intrigued Octavius and made him suspicious. Either way, there wasn&#39;t much in the way of choices for the Roman, if he didn&#39;t take the fruit, it&#39;s not like he had other sources to replenish his mana and as well, he didn&#39;t want to upset the woman by refusing her hospitality. On the other hand, if this fruit was poison or something malicious he&#39;d be eating right out of the devil&#39;s palm out of desperation. 

With these two lines of reasoning, Octavius took the apple from the woman. As well she was off-putting to the Saber. Her touch was gentle, yet uncanny. It felt real yet as well it seemed wrong. And who was this lady of the mound? A servant? Another resident of this estate? Perhaps they were also reasonable, and this woman said that she would understand they were taking residence there, so that would mean that there could be animosity. The animosity could be mended thanks to this woman. That thought made Octavius&#39;s tension fall away as he looked down at the fruit once more. Whether he was delirious or not, this seemed like the perfect deal. 

&quot;Why help us? And pardon my manners, what is your name?&quot; He asked politely as he looked back to the woman from the apple, which he held tight in his right hand. He wanted to be sure that he wanted to put his life in the hands of this woman.</span>

Eventually the anxiety eased, taking the fruit from the out stretched vine. “Thank you for trusting me.” Rosemary smiled.

“It must be hard to do… the name is Rosemary. Rosemary O’Connell, might I have yours? “  The kind druid tilted her head. Curiously looking the Roman up and down. Having a few guesses come to mind, but not wanting to say her first thought outright. Lest she upset a prideful Roman. 

“Why help you? Well this place should be a sanctuary to all. It’d be best to celebrate Rosemary’s memory in such a manner.” She spoke as if nothing wrong was said. Was this Rosemary before him a spirit? Was she a servant disguising herself as a human?

As well, he blinked a few times from her statement about Rosemary&#39;s memory. He was just about to respond with his name when she said that. It caught him off guard along with everything else in this estate. Now with this new information, he could slightly see the actual vines behind the woman&#39;s form. While this should have alarmed him, it made him feel slightly at ease, yet also concerned. What or who killed the woman? An investigator? Someone taking advantage of this kindness? Had this been a test then of sorts? He continued to have questions about this woman form in his head, but he knew he needed to start by answering her own. 

&quot;I am Sab-.&quot; He stopped himself as he looked back down at the apple before looking back to the woman. Trust had to be first met with trust. &quot;No, I am Caesar, a Saber class servant from beyond these shores. If this encounter truly is as honest as it seems to be, perhaps I will tell you which Roman specifically with that name that I am. Apologies for the formality Rosemary.&quot; He said, still honoring her name regardless if she was a spirit or a memory or whatever the woman that called herself Rosemary O&#39;Connell was. It mattered not to the Roman, she was letting them into her home to rest. While he wasn&#39;t wholly convinced, he was slowly believing it more and more.</span>

The mass of vibes which acted as her limbs, spread themselves out once again. Attending to various things around her garden. Curiously none touched the plants, only ripened fruits, and other structural issues in the garden. “Now then, Caesar. Did your master make it out alive as well? Will they be needing attended too?” She spoke in kind tone. Perhaps this woman was not a threat. Perhaps she truly did hold their best intentions.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The emperor laughed at her joke. &quot;You have nothing to worry about there Rosemary, I&#39;m better than them.&quot; He said without a hint of humble restraint. At her inquiry about his master, he held his fruit tighter for a moment before relaxing his hand. There was no threat there, it was merely a question. &quot;Yes, although he&#39;s injured his eyes on our last battle. He&#39;s over there inside of your home where we came in. He&#39;s sleeping comfortably in one of your chairs.&quot; He said with a slight bit of endearment I&#39;m his voice as if the action of sleeping in a chair was the most profound thing to do in existence. Nonetheless, there was a smile on the emperor&#39;s face. At that moment, he went back to the task at hand. Specifically in his.

Octavius stared down at the apple again. He looked at the red of the fruit. It reminded him of the blood that covered his body from his wounds. The red of his hair and armor. The hair and the armor, stained red across time and space by the blood of Rome and every person that died fighting and defending it. If he ate the apple, that would mean that he couldn&#39;t turn away from his original mission in life. The reason that he was stained with the blood of every decision that Rome made. That he made. The blood that covered him and Rome are the same, every decision and every road that Rome paved was made from his will.

Another road would be paved today. He wouldn&#39;t deny his nature any longer, if he were to die, he would die regret-free. If he was going to trust, it wouldn&#39;t be half-assed. He would take this woman&#39;s kindness as his own. He would believe that there could be peace before death. Even if it was slim, he had to believe it to be true and fight for that belief.

So I will take that first step.&quot; He said stoically. For the first time since the Vortigern fight, he had base back in his voice as if his words themselves were mending his body and spirit. This declaration was more than a simple promise. &quot;There will be peace.&quot; 

He would then take a bite his first bite from the apple.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Ahhh Roman Pride in all of its glory.” Rosemary mused as Octavius responded. Eventually answering her question of the whereabouts of Dante, simply nodding as a few vines began their dance towards the interior of the house. “I do hope he chose the couch to sleep on, that was really the best piece of furniture she owned.” 

Then the Emperor stared down towards the apple. Deep in thought. Finally breaking the silence, as if he came to a profound realization. 

The realization that those of this island could be reasoned with. Could be made peaceful to the outsiders. “Hope can be a useful tool, or a man’s greatest weakness. Be wary of <em>who</em> you place that hope into. This master of yours sounds like a fine gentleman to place said hope.” She responded whilst Octavius bit of the apple. 

Due to the nature of the fruits which reside in this magical garden, a singular apple gave him the energy which was on par with a mana battery. Allowing for the repair of his wounds, and keeping his spirit origin stitched together.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius felt himself reinvigorate from the introduction of the mana gained from the apple. His wounds healed, his spirit origin no longer in danger of falling apart, he was whole again. Octavius gave his usual sly grin as his mana swelled, his mana creating a light gust for just a moment underneath his feet as not just the emperor&#39;s mana was replenished, but also his conviction. He knew what he needed to do. Even if it were just him and Dante left on this island, he would find a way to make things right or at least pave the way for someone else. He turned back to Rosemary and gave her a genuine smile, not Roman bravado turned into a smirk nor an Emperor&#39;s prideful look of superiority, but an actual smile from Octavius. 

He then chuckled as he spoke. &quot;I understand Rosemary, thank you for your hospitality and your advice. I&#39;ll be careful with whom is place my trust further, but I will be open-minded once again before I turn to the sword. I&#39;m the emperor of peace first, Saber Servant second.&quot; He looked back inside in the direction of Dante and sighed. &quot;He has a long way to go. And seeing as you&#39;ve restored my spirit friend, perhaps you can put some spirit into Dante for me. I... I&#39;m a bit tired at the... Moment.&quot; The Roman began to sway from. his spot in the greenhouse. Had the apple been poisoned? Was this whole thing a ride to kill them? 

No, it was just that the emperor was now not in total survival mode anymore that his adrenaline had returned to normal levels. His previous sleepless night and stress and tension were gone now and all the emperor could do was let his body tire and slumber. Octavius walked over to a nearby wall, sitting down, before passing out and beginning to softly snore.</span>

The doctor stirred, until finally he simply opened his eyes for a bit. Luckily, the drain on his circuits wasn’t as harsh as before. Rather, with Saber having quietly dealt with his issues, the way his eyes dully throbbed, it only felt as if he would have had a severe headache. He tried to open his eyes again, the soft brown irises trying to focus on something, anything but only it’s hazed outline of everything.</em>

<em>He could hear his voice even when he tried to rest, the low confident and yet stern tenor of his servant conversing but he didn’t know what he could have been talking to. . . And about what? Dante tried to lift himself, his arms against such a notion and yet he had to know what or where he was, he’d have to find him. The Master moved up entirely, the figures casting a variety of shadows about him which he tried to navigate through, the sound of tables of wobbling and the sounds of furniture being bumped into with his quiet whispers fo swears and “ouches” the only thing that showed he was awake.</em>

<em>His hands were stretched before him, and soon he found himself away from the room he had lied in. In the middle of the estate, the smell of earth and nature was strong.

Quickly vines knit themselves together, creating an earthly bed which he could fall upon to rest. Rosemary was a little panicked by this, but it soon faded as Octavius now rested at her feet. “I shall hope I can, dear Caesar.” 

Whilst this occured the vines continued their slow March through the manner. Reaching the kitchen and digging through the stores for the kettle and tea cups. 

A few diverged from the group and met the blind Dante, trying to guide him away from danger. Or at least keep the boy from unnecessarily harming himself in his blind stumbling through the cluttered home. Then he spoke asking for Octavius’s whereabouts. 

“Oh dear, he’s asleep at the moment.” A new and unfamiliar voice was heard. As another strange sensation brought him in, embracing him. Was this the estate’s owner? Why were they hugging him?</span>

He heard it again, someone’s voice other than his own and his servant’s. He just needed to see who it was. Octavius had said the house was empty. . . But he had a feeling someone had to have been here. The doctor’s steps had been small and bite sized, careful that he wouldn’t fall, and with that, he occasionally had his feet accidentally tap against the earthen roots that snaked along the floorboards. Dante callously mistaking them for furnishings.</em>

<em>It was when the doctor had gotten closer to actually tripping when something caught him in the brink of time. Dante let out a sigh, something he held even when he traversed the home, fearful he’d have bumped into a knife or a wall, or something more ridiculous.</em>

“Th-thank you Octav—“

<em>He couldn’t finish the sentence when he heard the voice come even closer, only inches maybe centimeters away from him. That. . . That wasn’t Octavius who caught him? Even in his blind state, Dante hadn’t lost his deer like alertness, the fact that something had held onto him, that wasn’t his servant was alarming, and with a harsh pull the doctor yanked back and fell to the floor with a loud and almost surprising cry. Was that the owner?! Octavius had been wrong, and what did she mean he was sleep! Islanders from he saw weren’t nice at all! And he couldn’t see! How was he to run?! Dante scrambled backwards, his hands patting the ground into to pat the roots that littered the floor, as he tried to find a clear way to back into.</em></span>

“Sleep as in a rest at the end of an exhausting day. Not the endless March into darkness.” The voice spoke in a calm reassuring tone. “You have a strong servant. He cares for you, I hope you know. But his true name will be a secret between the two of us.” The kept its calm melodic tone. Doing it’s best to keep the doctor from going into a further panic. 

The vines who had ventured into the kitchen has begun to set water to boil. Picking out a variety of leaves and flowers for tea. 

“Perhaps a cup of tea, to help calm the nerves? My name is Rosemary O’Connell. Might I have yours?” The woman spoke again the vines approaching and trying to gently touch his shoulder, letting him know of her presence.</span>

But, you are seeking shelter. What good would I do to her memory if I maimed those who visited this place?” What did that mean? Her memory? 

There was a small pause in her response, as if she was examining the boy. Another sensation was felt along his face. “Your eyes? Are they doing okay? Did you happen to place an artificial circuit there?” The woman questioned before the sensation retreated. “If you can’t see at the moment I can always help you. Perhaps even a conversation… not about your time on this land… but about your home?” The woman offered as a singing noise was heard from the distance and more vines began their March back to the pair. 

“Looks like the water is ready! Tea time it is. I apologize but if I had more time to prepare I would have made some cakes to go along with the tea.”</span>

However, something that puzzled him a bit was the idea of her saying “her memory”. In whose? Had someone died? He didn’t know. . . Rosemary’s judgement of Dante had been spot on, clearly he had something wrong with his eyes!</em>

“You’re c—correct, I simply overworked them. . . It wasn’t very smart to, but it’ll be fine—I think. I don’t know. I think maybe it’ll be fine? I just . . . I could use whatever help you are offering.”

<em>Even with his issues, his nervousness showed like a flag upon him, and it was so easily painted on his face as well! Dante fiddled his hand with his pockets, or busied himself with looking down and away a bit, almost like he had been more mouse than man. Then the woman continued about her questions, asking about his home under introduction of their tea talk, which Dante could hear the kettle singing it’s high pitched soprano in the back rooms. His good arm instinctively went into his pocket as a mean to look complacent like his other arm, and hoped her gaze hadn’t shifted towards it.</em>

“Sure! Um. . . Yes, and do not apologize, I’m s—sure I wouldn’t have been able to enjoyed the cakes with this issue currently anyways. B-but my land? My home? I uh. . . I don’t know where to really start?”

<em>He was sincere in his reasoning, how could he talk about his home? Which home? The land he had grown up? Why would that have been of any importance to her? Had she expected people to come here in order to explain their origins?</em></span>

What meant to be something calming and nostalgic didn’t come across as such. “Perhaps… I should reword it. Just tell me of what you miss from your home. Cause no doubt you must have traveled a great distance to reach Nirvana.” Rosemary explained further as the vines finally reached their location. 

Gentle noises of the cups and tea pot being set down where heard. “I have a few blends for you to try! Including a white peach tea, her attempt at matcha, and a variety of others. All up to you to choose!” It seems as if she has completely unnoticed the good and the bad arm, as The Druid’s memory went on a tangent about the tea making process and ‘her’ favorite teas/different old earth cultures and their teas.</span>

One of her favorite pieces of literature was about the Japanese matcha tea ceremony, quite a thrilling piece. There should be plenty of literature you could find within the clutter if you really wish to indulge, my dear.” The voice of Rosemary spoke so clearly and so kindly. As the white peach tea was prepared within the kitchen, the vines then beginning their slow, delicate March back to the green house. 

Then she went quiet for a moment, realizing she did not quite explain that she is more of a concept than a person. Something that seemed to bring great discomfort to the memory of Rosemary this time. “Ah… yes… the Rosemary O’Connell… murdered by a past lover to summon a servant.” 

There was another pause. no doubt causing more anxiety to spike in Dante’s mind. What is this thing he was speaking to? 

The pause seemed to stretch forever. The beats of his heart lasting decades. Then the silence broke reality returning to its normal pace. “I appreciate your apology for her death. I know for a fact she would have found you as endearing as her first grandson.” The voice spoke, not exactly giving Dante more context to what this ‘Rosemary O’Connell’ was.</span>

Something in him was almost falling from the sky, and the gravity that pulled him down was mortifying. He hadn’t heard that correctly, maybe. The dead didn’t talk. . .

“Thank you Rosemary, I have to apologize for my fear. . . Not all of the people here have been quite helpful. Vortigern. . . The woman with the strings. . . The doctor and his servant. . . So many have been on edge.”

The doctor Koji, and the callous woman. All of them having their own issues, but somehow they were all disdainful about his entrance. Why? Koji and his comment about entering their backyard. . .

And how they have all seemed only hostile. With particular interest being paid to the mentioning of a doctor. Perhaps the very same who would share tea and cakes with the land’s original care taker. 

Either way another question was postured to Rosemary. “The  Lady of the Mound is a… Berserker. She had her own theories on who exactly she would summon, but for certain she is a Fairy. Given another life in the form of servant hood. As for the other. Their name is <em>Ruth Naomi</em>.” Upon speaking this name the garden had two contradictory emotions felt. Those of rage and nostalgia for this singular person. Which could be felt in how the name was spoken. “Bad things can only happen if you choose to pursue that woman.”</span>

He walked over to Dante and Rosemary, grabbing a seat of his own and sitting down next to his master, crossing one leg over his other, and leaned back into the chair.

It was the least the Roman could do, and names held extraordinary power, so the fact that even if this wasn&#39;t the original woman, he still considered her as such. Either way, she had been killed by this Ruth Naomi person to steal her servant. The warning was genuine and Octavius would intend on taking it seriously. 

&quot;Thank you Miss Rosemary for the warning. We intend on staying out lane so to speak. If she doesn&#39;t come after us, we won&#39;t have any reason to seek her out. It&#39;s not like she has any information we need anyways. Speaking of, straight to business and Berserkers, do you know of another such Berserker, Vortigern. Large gentleman has wings and a crown, two swords, one purple, one red. Screams a lot, quite undead looking. Able to regenerate very quickly.&quot; He sighed before he continued the next part because it was information he withheld from Dante. &quot;Survived a direct hit from my Noble Phantasm and regenerated from just his legs. Can you tell us anything about him?&quot; He tried his best to explain the beast to the best of his ability as this was the opportunity he needed to learn more about the island.</span>

He didn’t know how he was to go about avoiding her, but if she so easily able to murder her lover for a summoning of a servant then she easily could have done the same for whatever sick intention.</em>

“A fairy and berserker? I’ve never . . . Expected something that sounds so nice to sound so. . . Daunting? No, clearly she has to be nice right?—“

<em>The sound of Octavius’s bold tenor made Dante turn towards his direction. Surprised to see he had been able top hear their conversation. With his blurred figure, Dante tried to make the emperor’s feature more and more clear. His words were like fierce slaps against the master’s face, how he had told that Vortigern had lived, Dante’s hands went to the table in a mixture of anger and surprise and shock.</em></span>

He&#39;d need a lesson at the very least, on the history of Rosemary&#39;s homeland. But this lesson would have to wait as the Caesar had awoken. 

&quot;Ah, welcome back from your nap. I hope you had pleasant dreams, Caesar.&quot; The vines then slid the cup that was set for Rosemary&#39;s image over to the saber. &quot;It is the least I could do for you both. She could be a rather big... Issue for your endeavors on this island.&quot; 

Then both brought up the name of that king again. Vortigern. Apparently summoned to this land as a berserker. With quite the impressive skill for healing his own wounds. &quot;Ah... well I do know that he was a king, a tyrant, from Arthurian legend. But to hear him summoned to this land, that does sound like a bad omen.&quot; 

&quot;From what she knew of that particular mythos of Britannia, Vortigern never had a remarkable ability to heal from any wound. Perhaps someone else has modified his being?&quot; The memory of Rosemary postured while the vines gently nudged the Doctor&#39;s hands. Offering the tea cup for him to partake from.</span>

He still withheld important information such as that. He didn&#39;t regret it either way. As he took the tea in his hand he looked down at the liquid as he spun it for a moment with a swish of the cup. Caesar wasn&#39;t going to apologize about this, for now, he would tell all that he witnessed to them for the sake of information, even if Rosemary didn&#39;t know much of the beast beside his historical origin. &quot;I lied to you so you wouldn&#39;t panic. Waiting until now to reveal that information as necessary for our survival.&quot; 

That was his only words on the matter as he continued in to explain what had happened at the end of the fight, the part of Dante hadn&#39;t seen. 

&quot;It seemed after I obliterated the majority of his body, he regenerated from just his legs. Then albeit in a confused state, he stabbed me six times with a different proficiency that he didn&#39;t have prior. He looked as if he had just been summoned in that spot after the blast. He spoke with intelligence. He moved with grace. He was definitely under some sort of control and the obliteration of his body removed such control it seemed. As well the enhancements and abilities he had could be traced to the doctor, Koji. In a prior fight with the king, the doctor fled, but a look of realization was in his eyes and he returned to fight the beast. Although it equally fought both of our groups, it intended to kill Koji with the last of its strength before he fled to heal. I intend to find out what he knows at a later time, especially since I have his address.&quot; He finished his info dump as he sipped upon the tea Rosemary provided. &quot;And thank you for the tea Rosemary.&quot;

While she didn&#39;t directly know about Vortigern, that was better than nothing. That meant that for sure Vortigern was under a third party.</span>

However, the master held his tongue even when he felt that what the saber had done would have been important. . . He should have told him this! He should have! But it didn’t matter, he tried to focus on Rosemary’s pieces of valuable information. He didn’t know what this Ruth Naomi entailed, but clearly the woman had expressed her concerns on it all.</em>

“By big. . . How big do you mean of a problem? If you’re worried of her, I assume we should be worried too?”

<em>Just how much did this woman have to her that the duo would have to be warned about her presence? Dante shook his head, trying to not picture some woman who could easily slaughter them without a blink of an eye, and instead took the teacup that was nudged towards him and sipped it, trying to take his mind from it.</em>

“Vortigern has managed to regenerate its body. . . How is that possible?”

<em>The idea that he had been moving about was unnerving to where his stomach churned. However, Rosemary seemed to contradict them. Or the vision that his saber had. . . The Vortigern she spoke of didn’t regenerate? He had done so with his arm. . . But also somehow with his upper body. And now he was intelligent.

Then her head tilted back towards Dante, as the boy spoke again. &quot;She has... quite the grip upon this land. Had it somewhat ages ago when they were a couple. But she might be easily evaded.&quot; Reassuringly Rosemary spoke. 

&quot;As for the myth of Vortigern, I am not the most clear on minute details. But it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise to me if a king such as he held some legendary swords.&quot; The memory offered up what she could recall as they spoke more. &quot;Now if this was a hero from the land of Eire, then i could answer many more questions. But, as they are of Britannia... I have less readily accessible knowledge of that.&quot;

The more he knew about the doctor&#39;s wife, the more he could maybe pry out of him, or get him upset, either or. This information would merely be a back door option however, he didn&#39;t want to bring him and his servant into a brawl. From how that Rider fought against Vortigern while weakened, he didn&#39;t want to fight that beast at full strength, especially not under his terms.

It was disappointing as well that they couldn&#39;t get much information about Vortigern here, but beggars couldn&#39;t be choosers, answers would come in due time. The Roman hoped that the doctor could provide more insight because Vortigern wasn&#39;t a natural servant, not even close. It was a fact that a servant&#39;s abilities were tied to their history or myth, and if there wasn&#39;t any information that would lead to Vortigern&#39;s regenerative abilities, then they needed to fight whoever was behind the mad king for questions. 

As they had exhausted Vortigern&#39;s questioning and Ruth was made clearly an avoid at all costs, the next person of interest would be Ashley. Octavius rested his elbow on the chair rest and his cheek on his fist as he swirled the teacup once more. &quot;So Miss Rosemary. What do you know about Ashley? Purple hair likes to play with strings and bodies. Certain within the realm of necromancy.&quot; The Roman asked casually to the dead woman.</span>

&quot;Ah, the Drakin girl? We never did interact much. She was a bit eccentric, never did sleep much.&quot; The vines then tugged on that marker upon Dante&#39;s being. &quot;Is that where he ended up receiving this?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius listened intently to the rest of the information presented patiently as he continued to sip upon the tea. After the last words were said, Octavius drank the rest of the tea and set it down on a nearby table and a small smile and a satisfied sigh. &quot;Well Miss Rosemary, thank you for your hospitality and your help, your kindness is appreciated greatly. You have reinvigorated our commitment on this island.&quot; He said as he slowly stood up from his chair, his wounds now just about fully healed from eating the apple and then resting. &quot;Even though you may be dead, I&#39;ll carry your name and memory forward with me.&quot; Octavius stretched as he stood as he ran a hand along the wall of the estate. &quot;Shame what befell of you and every native person on this island. We&#39;ll do our best to help the inhabitants of Nirvana.&quot; He said confidently as he looked back at the memory of Rosemary. &quot;I shall visit these Islanders in my own time, see if we can&#39;t come to a reasonable conclusion.&quot; The emperor then turned to Dante. &quot;Dante, are you ready to leave?&quot;

With the new fire in his soul, Octavius now had plans forming in his mind. To investigate that building, to speak to Koji and his servant in their home, perhaps even meet this Ruth or someone close to her. If he could find commonality between them, he could make peace on this godforsaken island. If not by words, then they would find the reasoning for the island&#39;s misgivings, and take care of it.</span>
