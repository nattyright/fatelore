The small amounts of gear he had left behind, either lost, or water logged. With his servant and he done with their little excursion and finally returning to the ship, he got see the aftermath of a battle they had missed, and in the back of his head he could only question repeatedly how things may have been different had then been here rather than galivanting around the island sight seeing, doing their jobs they were here for, it almost made him sick to his stomach trying to picture what it&#39;d be like having to face the rest of the investigators, any who were injured, or witnessed a death here or over the course of this whole mission so far. the look he could see was like looking down the barrel of a loaded gun.

&quot;So I leave the place for a little bit and this is what they do? Ruin my things, flood my home... You know this gym meant more to me than any of the depraved hobbies these people partake in meant to them.&quot; he said walking atop the water moving across the floor using his water stride spell mostly to keep his shoes dry, as he stepped around trying to pick up anything of use or at the very least get a lead, not that he felt there was really anything to find, &quot;Well I hope you&#39;re happy big guy, your little, let&#39;s not expose ourselves plan really is turning up some great results here. We&#39;ve gotten zero work done, and the home base has been wrecked. And as much as I&#39;d like to be pissed at you, you&#39;re not the one who&#39;s being paid to call shots when they&#39;re need to called.&quot; he spoke to Ankou, though admittedly most of the anger was directed at himself, in the end he was the master, as scary or assertive as his servant may have been there was little he would or could do when he said otherwise, &quot;We need to pick our game up and get to the bottom of this... Mess, starting now.&quot;

In their absence the place of operations had been completely wrecked. What once smelled of rancind body odor now wreaked of rotten wood and salt water. &quot;Galvin, our sightseeing wasn&#39;t pointless. While our comrades did the dirty work we figured out which parts of the island are less inhabited, these locations will serve as great cover will they not?&quot; Ankou stepped forward looking down at Galivn with his hollow eyes. 

&quot;The gym is destroyed, but that is all the more reason to keep it our base of operations. When the enemy was here we were not, and so our whereabouts are unknown. Say we were seen on the island without knowing it, our enemy wouldn&#39;t suspect us to return here of all places.&quot; The servant tried to justify his course of action, explaining that their absence in combat was an advantage. &quot;However, Master, I agree if there is a time to get involved it is now. It is time to make ourselves known.&quot;

As you said we&#39;ve been to the less populated areas, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not possibly under some kind of watch, so we still have to be wary of that. I didn&#39;t detect much while we were out there, other than the general foulness of the everywhere in this place, but that should be enough for us to help coordinate something later on, assuming the rest of the crew have been going straight for the enemy or suspicious places, they might not have as much of the island surveyed as we do, and information is a big key to staying alive in situations like these.&quot; the young man said calming down a bit to look through their options.

&quot;I have to say it probably shouldn&#39;t be too hard to track them down, I&#39;ve heard some rumblings, seen a few flashy lights, and plumes of billowing smoke. We could head to those places and see if we can pick up their trail from  there. I would go through the main city, but I get the impression the more people that see us only gives the Nirvanan masters more chances to spot us, plus the last thing we need is to waste time on the lesser locals. But that plan does still run the risk of possibly stumbling across any remaining enemies in the area, could spark up another fight and get us singled out, though I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;d have that much trouble with that.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ankou wrapped his hands around his scythe leaning his weight on it as Galvin explained his plan. The boy hit a few good points that Ankou couldn&#39;t agree more with. Being outside the loop was becoming a detriment, however, Ankou still believed there to be a strong advantageous attribute to their situation. Regardless Galvin was right, meeting up with fellow investigators would be the best-case scenario. The hardest part would be doing so unseen by the opposition. “My carriage allows us to travel through earth and stone as mere aspirations, being seen is not one of our worries. However, as you may have noticed Master,  I cannot hide my presence as well as my physical being. A frost follows in my wake, such a phenomenon would be noticeable on a tropical paradise.” 

Ankou’s voice halted as his feet stomped across the floor, his position was now perfectly parallel to Galvin. “Should my presence be traced I am confident in my skills to dispose of our enemies. You, on the other hand, I know very little of your strength, hit me with your strongest ranged attack, that sack of water you carry isnt nothing is it?” There was a sudden shift in Ankou’s tone, does he seriously want his own Master to attack him?!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The young master had a very perplexed look on his face, quirking a brow as he pointed to himself curious if he understood that right, though the assertion made him move passed that, &quot;I&#39;ve worked my entire life to show people why it&#39;s a mistake to think I&#39;m nothing, and you&#39;re gonna be no exception here, I&#39;ll just try and not kill ya.&quot; He answered getting a bit fired up to see how he could match up, he wasnt one to to bow down from a challenge., &quot;Alright,... It&#39;d be a good idea to see how I can stand up to a servant anyway since I&#39;m going to be getting well aquatinted with more than a few in the coming days.&quot; Walking over to his calabash, he figured it wasn&#39;t a big deal to try this, given he had an infinite supply to work with.

Hefting the large guard up onto his shoulder, he knelt down on one knee as he popped the cork off. What little empty space was left inside was quickly filled as Galvin shifted water into the opening a bright glow emanating from it as he mixed his mana into the water. Reinforcing it&#39;s power and preparing it to accelerate rapidly. &quot;I was still working on it a bit, but the idea so far is a bit if a water spear, or javelin, but to call it nothing would be giving me far too little credit buddy.&quot; He explained briefly. With a quick breath, Galvin braced himself fir the kick back as the pressure inside the gourd reached its peak, a spear head made of water would extend from the mouth of the calabash aimed straight for Ankou and with one final exertion of effort, he unleashed his attack. A powerful stream of pressurized water a combination of shifting tides and water bullet, pushed to it&#39;s limits for a two staged assault, the first being a directed piercing attack. The water shot out like a beam crashing against Ankou&#39;s body.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ankou nodded along as his Master prepared to strike. The servant&#39;s request was odd but he was glad that Galvin was on the same page. Ankou wanted to test Galvin’s metal, in doing so Rider would be able to create a combat plan for future encounters. The servant took a deep breath, the flames of his pupils flickering. As Galvin prepared his attack the room would get noticeably cooler. 

Galvin’s projectile rushed towards the servant, the attack was fast, Ankou was pleased with his Master&#39;s ability to manipulate water in such a dangerous way. Just as the spear of water came within a few inches of Ankou the room would frost over, the projectile turning to an icicle. The servant scythe spun in his hand deflecting the ice spear into the rotten wall behind him. Ankou moved with excellent speed and accuracy, the difference between Master and Servant was night and day, after all, it&#39;d be unreasonable to expect a magus to stand against a heroic spirit, especially one as ancient as Ankou. However, Ankou found what he was looking for. He pointed to the icicle in the wall. 

“Our abilities go quite nicely don&#39;t you think? Do not be afraid to attack more Master, perhaps we will learn more” What Ankou saw was the creation of a weapon. Galvin’s ability to weaponize water and Ankou’s ability to freeze it in an instant could work in tandem.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Galvin, in the back of his mind figured his attack wouldn&#39;t stand up to a Servant, much less Death himself, but watching one of his strongest purely ranged attacks so effortless dodged and frozen over still felt disheartening a fair bit. As Ankou spoke the little bit of shock he was in was interrupted as the man mentioned the synergy of their magic, nodding his head along, &quot;Yeah should be able to really cause some havoc with this, I have a few more creative ideas.&quot; he responded balling up his fist and punching the ice pillar to break it off from his calabash so he could stand up again, &quot;I&#39;ll try to cut that one off a little sooner might make for a good hand held weapon when you need it.&quot; he said perking up a bit more. It was for the best after all if he could defeat a servant with his more technical rather than potent power, they couldn&#39;t have been worth all the effort to bring them forth.

Setting the calabash down on the floor, water would gradually start to creep up it&#39;s sides and pour itself directly into the mouth to fill it up once more. Squatting down he placed his hand in the water at his feet and imbued his mana into it, &quot;Why don&#39;t we get a bit of a storm going then?&quot; with that, Galvin punched his fists together, before directing his hands around to shift the waters on the floor to move them around throwing torrents of sea water into the air, throwing it up above Ankou&#39;s head before pulling it down hard in a flurry water bullets raining down on the servant.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ankou grinned at his Master&#39;s enthusiasm. Despite their previous dispute the pair seemed to be on the same page for now. Combining Ice and water was a weapon they could pull out of thin air to surprise unsuspecting opponents. Ankou stepped back preparing for Galvin’s second attack. This time the magus created a flurry of smaller projectiles instead of a concentrated one. As the bullets rained down, once again water would turn to ice. The servant swung his scythe above his head deflecting the ice needles above him. Admittedly Ankou let a few get through, getting a taste for how hard his Master could hit was important.

A shower of thuds rattled the floorboards, ice bullets penetrating beneath Ankou&#39;s feet. “I like this attack as well… Ice is deadlier than water… Should we try more, or is our synergy clear? Perhaps it would be best to think our attacks over for the night and show them off in our travels?” The two hadn&#39;t worked on much, in fact, their team attack was thought up at the moment, however, Ankou was both eager and confident in his ability to get involved firsthand.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;It seems pretty clear to me, but I think it&#39;d be a good idea to get a little more theory crafting out of the way, though I imagine most on the fly stuff will come in handy as we go along.&quot; The young master answered, crossing his arms as he took in a breath to ponder their current situation as he walked through the shards of ice that sat planted in the floor. Grabbing the ice spear they made, he pulled till it came out in his hands, though it wasn&#39;t much trouble to get it out of the rotten wood, and foot by foot he&#39;d break off more of the shaft, crunching the ice under his foot, &quot;I have a few more ideas to pull out... that could catch a few of the locals here off guard. I mostly thrive in area control... Eh well that&#39;s not entirely true, for the most part there&#39;s not many around who I can&#39;t trounce in an upfront fight... but when it comes to magic other magus tend to keep their distance for obvious reasons.&quot; he said only pausing for a short second as he grunted with effort at another stomp as he made more progress.

&quot;It means I need to sway as much of the fight in my favor as possible... and to do that I spread water over the immediate area and collect more as I can to keep it up, as flash as it may be it&#39;s the more subtle uses that give me the upper hand... Up until now though it&#39;s mostly been the liquid stuff at my disposal, stuff my eh... Sensei he said to call him, passed on to me. With ice on demand in the mix now it opens a lot more doors to how I approach some scenarios... adds a good bit more punch while I&#39;m at it.... So if we play our cards right, we could eliminate a few masters and leave their servant... Stranded if we&#39;re lucky, no master, no mana... Which means no body.&quot; he went on before he had an appropriately sized ice spear in his hands still containing his mana, poking the tip a bit as he twirled it around he spoke, &quot;Could mean we get a lot more crafty rather than upfront, either way we got time to burn, let&#39;s cover the details some.&quot;</span>
