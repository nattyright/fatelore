She had never visited a forest as dense as this. But, she had seen similar such places. Namely, coral reefs, the blood of the gorgon crystallized in the seas. Both of them were habitat to a great many creatures, be they the mammals, birds, reptiles and insects of the land, or the fish, crustaceans and amphibians of the sea. They were shelter. Places to hide from predators, or ambush prey.

There would be no better place for one to conceal themselves from society, from nosy islanders or inquisitive investigators.

At least, that was Scylla&#39;s theory, the one echoing in her mind as she barged through the dense thicket. In truth, she did not know whether William had truly chosen to hide here. She did not know the man enough to envision his mind, predict what actions he might take. But nevertheless, she would leave no stone unturned in this search, no matter how insignificant or unlikely a stone it was. 

After all, that despicable author had much to answer for.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Scylla roamed far and wide. She could hear the chirping of crickets. The subtle footsteps of wild foxes. These animals would normally attract her attention, if only to play a short game due to her bestial nature. Like a cat, there was a certain joy in hunting prey down.

This time, however, she had shut down those urges completely. Instead, she explored the forest with pinpoint precision, faster than a laser as she attempted to find any trace of her target. She was so dedicated that she had left behind all notions of remaining close to Koji, digging deeper and deeper into the forest as the sun was almost blotted out by the thick trees that reached for the clouds.

&quot;Achoo!&quot;

Eventually, her persistence paid off, causing her to hear the faint sound of a living creature. One with higher sapience than the average insect. Not only that, but she could feel the heat around her rise as well. The body heat, or to be more specific, mana residue of another Servant was lingering around. As she snuck past branches and leaves, she came across a rough looking campfire powered by coals.

The man of the hour was resting there, yawning as they read a book while casually eating some sort of sandwich. Her keen eyes inspected the food closely and...was that a <em>pie on a barm?</em>

Regardless, she had found William. His oversized hat was a dead giveaway. Judging by the looks of it, he hadn&#39;t noticed her presence yet. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

Her expression hardened, as her various tendrils retracted back into her body, the earful one wriggling with particular glee. With all the unnecessary bulk removed from her body, she lowered herself down, every muscle in her body tightening at once. She was the arrow upon a taut bowstring, aimed directly at William.

No more games, no playing with her food. This time, his suffering would be more than a punishment. It would be <em>permanent</em>.

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

The arrow was loosed, and Scylla pounced forth upon her prey, aiming to pin them to the ground in a single moment. After that, with their mobility culled, it would be effortless to tear out his still-beating heart and gnash it to bits between her jaws. 

And then, he would depart this world, back down to the deepest depths of the underworld. And she could continue her hunt uninterrupted.</span>

<strong>CRASH!</strong>

A collision sent William flying. Or at least, it would have, had Scylla&#39;s grip not been so tight. Instead of being ejected like a missile, he would be forcibly restrained to the ground, courtesy of Scylla&#39;s numerous tendrils and talons. He already felt his legs restrained. His wrists immobile. His neck could barely turn. All that could be felt was Scylla&#39;s cold flesh, pressed on his body and far less attractive than he had envisioned. He felt tempted to make revisions to his previous article on the Nirvana Tim-

<em>&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</em> William squealed in pain, feeling one of the tendrils stab at his leg. Blood oozed out, causing him to realize that the threat was very much serious. So, he would reply to it in a way befitting of a serious poet such as himself.

He endured the pain and muttered a few words, still holding the pie in his jittery hand.

&quot;I have mushy peas too if you&#39;d lik-&quot;

<strong>STAB!</strong>

&quot;Ack!&quot; And another one. This time, to the stomach. It missed his esophagus by a long shot, but it was done purposefully. Upon reaching her prey, Scylla realized how pathetic they truly were. Her mind suggested she finish this quickly, but her heart said otherwise. Her heart that had been shamed by William&#39;s obscene poetry had whispered sweet words in her ear, telling her to endure to whelp&#39;s suffering while keeping them powerless from doing anything. The moment she noticed any Magecraft, she would finish the job, pronto. If she didn&#39;t, well, she would simply have her fun.

As if realizing that, William relented from using tricks or Magecraft. Instead, he used the most important tool a playwright could have: Acting.

&quot;I-I think we got off the wrong foot here. So, uhm, you come here often?&quot; He said with a smile and wink.

<strong>STAB!</strong></span>

A furious snarl tore its way into William&#39;s ears, a sharp sensation of pain flooding throughout his body as the various appendages binding him tightened. It was, in a sense, a scathing critique, like having his editor strike out whole paragraphs of his prose, all the while filling the margins with dismissive annotations and review. Except in this case, the manuscript in question was his body, and the offending ink was his own blood pouring across it.

And the pen that so casually scrawled over his work was a rending claw. How unfortunate, that it was attached to Rider, whose existence was akin to a lit torch. Even more unfortunate, that William had created plenty of kindling.

His obnoxious behaviour? That scandalous newspaper article of his? Sticking his nose into the battle at the Canopus? It was so volatile that he was practically a powder keg. All it would take was a stray ember for it all go to up in flames.

<strong>&quot;Even if he were here, Naoharu Koji would have no interest in healing your wounds.&quot;</strong> Rider hissed, a talon tracing the veins of his neck, leaving behind scrapes and scratches as it went. <strong>&quot;He, too, has decided to be rid of you. You will never again interfere in my hunt. Never, ever, EVER AGAIN!&quot;</strong>

<em>SHLCK!</em> A stabbing pain emerged from his back as a stinger dug into his flesh, just narrowly missing the spine. Indeed, her prey was well and truly stuck. No escape to be had. Her revenge was all but guaranteed. 

And yet, no call went out to alert Koji.

<strong>&quot;...But, I shall entertain your final delusions, witch-author.&quot;</strong> Scylla growled, forcibly pulling William&#39;s chin up as she did so. <strong>&quot;Tell me, why interfere in my hunt? What do you have to gain from keeping those miserable invaders alive, allowing them to do as they please? What justifies such idiocy?&quot;</strong>

Just as it seemed that William might catch a break, the talon on his throat raised up, poised directly over the jugular.

<em><strong>&quot;And say it in a fifty words or less.&quot;</strong></em></span>

The more Scylla stabbed, the more inhuman William&#39;s noises got. Not in the sense that they reminded her of beasts, for that would be doing them a disservice. Instead, it made her feel grateful that all the sailors she had drowned in the past had far more pleasant screams. She wouldn&#39;t be able to stomach drowning 30 or so Williams.

&quot;The doc would do <em>that?!</em> Man, he&#39;s colder than his home. No wonder he lives up there. Even sent me his mermaid to finish the job instead of doing it himself.&quot; William exclaimed, looking disappointed before returning to Scylla&#39;s question.

&quot;Why I did it? Well, back in the ancient texts, dating from long before the flood, there was one known as <em>Do it for the Vine</em>.&quot; William smirked. &quot;I suppose that would be the closest comparison to make, if you know what I mean.&quot;

There was an awkward moment of silence, followed by Scylla stabbing yet another portion of William&#39;s flesh.

&quot;Aieeeeee!&quot; He shrieked, panting heavily afterwards. &quot;Okay, okay! I&#39;ll talk. My reason should be fairly obvious: Drama. This island has stagnated far too long. The plot is the same. The setting is the same. The characters are the same. We have grown accustomed to our routines to the point that we perform them mechanically. This island needed new blood!&quot; He shouted. &quot;Whether it was ready for it or not.&quot;

&quot;Besides, I <em>loathe</em> seeing plots be underused. Hints that aren&#39;t picked upon. Foreshadowing that is considered a &#39;sudden development&#39; by blind readers.&quot; William scoffed. &quot;This island&#39;s story has been brewing for decades. Yet none of its inhabitants are close to reaching the truth. If that&#39;s the case, then all I could hope for was outsiders discovering it!&quot;</span>

Before he continued on, he gave Scylla strong glare, one unbefitting of the meek poet from earlier.

&quot;What about you? Did he even tell you anything about the island? Or are you clueless, just like all the rest? What are you even fighting for?&quot; His words felt sharper than her own talons. <strong>&quot;Are you his lady or his dog?</strong> I always wondered that.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was a lengthy pause as Scylla considered all that William was saying, listened to his lofty speech. One might easily be able to mistake that for her listening, or even <em>agreeing</em> with his points. But, the scowl that continued to linger on her face throughout the dialogue communicated much the opposite. It was hard to tell, given the circumstances, but she&#39;d soon clarify any misconceptions.

<strong><em><u>&quot;TRIPE.&quot;</u></em></strong>

<em>RIP! TEAR! SLICE! SLASH!</em> Her furious tendrils went into overdrive, whipping against his skin as though the author were nothing more than a common criminal being punished, flayed alive by the cat-o-nine tails. Her brutality was equal only to the rage burning in her eyes, staring a hole directly through William&#39;s head.

<strong>&quot;Do you really think &#39;narrative&#39; justifies such? That my victory is worth less than that of my opponent because of the spectator&#39;s whims? That reality needs an author to direct it? That this island&#39;s story has any need to be heard in the first place?&quot;</strong> Scylla snarled, tightening William&#39;s restraints once more. <strong>&quot;You could not even match the prompt without waffling on for ages. You are no Homer. Dare I say, you are far worse.&quot;</strong>

With her limited amount of curiosity now spent, Scylla had been fully intending to execute the playwright now and be done with it. However, in this instance, his incessant button pushing and nerve touching would pay off, and spare him. 

Spare his life, that is, not the pain.

<strong>&quot;Idiot!&quot;</strong> Scylla snapped, slamming her fist into William&#39;s chest as she did so. <strong>&quot;What makes you so high and mighty, lying here dying? You, too, are a servant! You, too, are just another slave to the whims of your master! What makes you any different from the rest of us?&quot;</strong></span>

It hurt like hell, lacerations and scars surrounding his body, but he never sustained any fatal damage, nor did Scylla notice any attempt from him to dodge. She was sure that a lesser man would have died by now, considering the amount of abuse the poet had received from her.

Ah yes. She forgot that she was dealing with a Servant. What was that skill called again, Self-Preservation? She remembered Koji mentioning it once while they were discussing William. Apparently, it allowed people to survive lethal blows by a hair&#39;s breadth, like slippery game that escaped a hunter&#39;s clutches.

&quot;...Don&#39;t you <em>dare</em> insult a story like that.&quot; William snarled, flashing bloodied teeth at Scylla, his smile disappearing. &quot;So, what if a story is garbage? What if it&#39;s bad? Why does it matter if someone wins or loses? <strong>Should that type of story not exist at all?&quot;</strong>

He interjected between groans, still reeling back in pain from Scylla&#39;s assault. &quot;Why should a &#39;good&#39; story receive exposure while bad ones remain forgotten? Can you even consider that fair? Just because this island is hell on earth, its pleas should go unheard?&quot; A booming intensity followed his voice as Scylla&#39;s fist collided with his chest. Regardless, he kept going.

&quot;Laughable! Especially by you, a pawn of fate. I may have no Master, but I live freely.&quot; He glared at her, his implication clear. &quot;I may die here, but all of Nirvana will remember me. What about you? Your Master sees you as disposable, yet you are forced to dog him around. When you die, no one will remember you. Your tale will be forgotten. None shall even know of what sort of figure you were in life.&quot;

His voices crackled around the campfire, searing Scylla with truth as she would be reminded to exactly how cold Naoharu Koji could be. Despite the bond she had, she felt no connection at all to her Master, nevermind him actively attempting to learn more about her.</span>

&quot;The story of William Shakespeare will never end. It simply has new beginnings.&quot; The bard laughed in Scylla&#39;s face. &quot;Good, bad, all are equally worthy in the grave. The same applies to stories: Be they trash or high art, at least they are out there to fill the world with inspiration. The only thing worse than a bad story is one that is <strong>never told</strong>.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Finally, Scylla&#39;s assault would stop. Her tentacles did not loosen their grip, she did not back away from the cornered rat to let it free. But, her torture stopped, the claws and barbs that stabbed and slashed at William falling still. Her brow furrowed, and for the slightest moment, there was a hint of something at the back of her eyes.

<strong>&quot;Some stories... Would be better left untold.&quot;</strong>

For the first time since their meeting began, Rider <em>spoke</em>. Not growled, not snarled, not hissed or howled or roared or shrieked. They were not the rabid calls of a vicious monster, driven only by instinct. No, they were human words, softly whispered so quietly that they could just barely be heard among the ambience of the forest, born from genuine emotion. A prolonged sigh escaped her lips.

<strong>&quot;You could never understand that.&quot;</strong> The servant shook her head, looking down at William as she did so. <strong>&quot;You are a playwright. All you see in this world you see through the stage you love so dearly. People are just characters, places settings, their past backstory. Do you suppose that those outsiders are grand heroes, as the Greeks landing on the shores of the Trojans? That the inhabitants of this isle should be reduced to villains, tyrants and monsters who should be foiled, solely because you will it? All that destruction, in search of a modern Iliad?&quot;</strong>

Her gaze hardened.

<strong>&quot;You are not a god. You are a man. You have no right to meddle in the tragedies of others. It is not your place. Your role is to observe the tale, record it, pass it along. Mine is to be slain by some valiant hero in search of a princess to rescue. So be it.&quot;</strong>

And yet, despite her best attempts to seem unbothered by the fate that awaited her, the regret crept through. Another life, another death. A master who wouldn&#39;t mourn her. An enemy who would brag of how they slayed her. And a poet who would scrub away all nuance in the name of his own personal narrative.

<strong>&quot;Such is life.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">William remained silent, his expression unchanging. He allowed Scylla to let it all out. Convey her own worries and frustrations. She delivered plenty, putting emphasis on how traumatized she was. On how horrifying the tale of the abominable Scylla could be. Some stories were better off unwritten, not because of who they could inspire, but who they could damage through words alone.

&quot;...It&#39;s you who doesn&#39;t get it.&quot; William finally spoke up, whispering as he felt his injuries grow numb. &quot;Since when did I call this a play? One where no matter how talented an actor may be, you would never fail to recognize them as a person playing a role. Romeo never actually existed. Hamlet was simply a person on stage reading from a script.&quot;

His fist clenched in anger. &quot;I am writing nothing as phony as that. This story is not a play, but a <strong>legend</strong>. A myth. When time passes, do you think people will see the outsiders as heroes, who saved this island from itself? Or as villains who threw our balance in disarray? Why not <em>both?</em>&quot;

Those words echoed in Scylla&#39;s soul. Heroes as villains and the other way around. Of all the laughable things she had heard from this hack of a poet, this was one she could barely laugh at.

&quot;You called me a man, <strong>and you would be right.</strong> I am simply delivering a setting and letting individuals be true to themselves. People are characters and characters are people. We are the stuff dreams are made of.&quot; William gave a soft smile. &quot;Both of these stories can coexist. Stories with differing views. One where we are the villains, another where we are the heroes. Is that nothing but fair? Or are all heroes born good? Are all villains born bad?&quot; He cast Scylla a strong stare.</span>

&quot;Stories are more than just propaganda. Stories give hope. Despair. Inspiration. Love. Truth. I am tired of seeing them be used as tools. A <em>legend</em> is nothing but brutally honest. How many people have argued over different depictions till the end of time? If I had to pick between black and white, I&#39;d rather pick <strong>both</strong>. All stories are equal, be it one where the hero is a villain-&quot;

He slowly extended his arm, which had been released from its shackles once Rider started talking about her perspective on things. Scylla theorized an attack, but relented once she realized that the bard&#39;s palm was half bloodied. No arcane incantation could harm her either thanks to her Magic Resistance.

She watched as William reached for Scylla&#39;s face, his jittery palm sliding on her cheek as he tenderly rubbed her face and slid a thumb on her lips.

&quot;-or the monster is a hero.&quot; He flashed her a warm smile. &quot;You&#39;re hurt, aren&#39;t you? I can tell that whoever wrote your own story spared no expenses in making you suffer. I have a knack for noticing these things.&quot; He gave a light giggle.

&quot;But there is no reason for you to stick to that script. Don&#39;t actors always improvise their own lines? You could soar for the stars, if you truly willed it.&quot; William took his chance, extending his other arm and grabbing at Scylla&#39;s hand, which was now as sharp as one of her tendrils. Despite the threat of being cut, he slid his fingers anyway, enduring nicks and scrapes as she felt the warmth of his bloodied fingers wrapping themselves around her in ways that only a lover could match.</span>

<strong>&quot;I could write your story.&quot;</strong> William leaned forward, whispering in face of her lips. &quot;One with only the two of us. One where you don&#39;t have to play the role of the monster. A story that doesn&#39;t elicit hurt or pain, but pride instead. A tale that makes you feel proud that you are still alive.&quot;

His words lacked his usual jesting. They felt sincere, like a confession. When was the last time Scylla had experienced such strong emotions and warm touches? Had she grown so used to Koji&#39;s demeanor that cold was all she knew? Could she even consider herself a woman if that were the case? <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

It sounded too good to be true. It was too good to be true. Scylla knew this perfectly well. There was nobody in the world who could love a being as foul as her. Nobody who could love a monster like her. Nobody.

But, to be sought after once more, to be loved as she had in the days of her youth... Such nostalgic memories clouded her judgement, sheathed her killer instinct. How she longed for those days, before her fall from grace. To grasp that fleeting beauty once more, return that ephemeral time in which she had been truly happy. How blissful an idea.

It could not be done. That perfection was so far away.

...But, might she settle for less?

William&#39;s offer was tempting. He was a fool, but a sincere one. He had plenty of reason to lie, but he was an author, not an actor. In this moment, his betrayal, his libel, it all seemed to fade into the background.

<strong>&quot;I...&quot;</strong> Scylla began, her face returning to the earlier shade of crimson. A fairytale ending with a happily ever after was all that she ever wanted. Where she could be her true self without fear of rejection. Where her outside was not forced to define her inside. Where she could discard the mask of being a monster, and live as the maiden she once was. Like Romeo and Juliet, Theseus and Hippolyta. 

Yes, how blissful that would be...

<strong>&quot;...Very well.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Man and beast stared into each other for what felt like hours. Scylla&#39;s skin was cold and pallid, but William&#39;s touch had more than enough warmth and sincerity for the two of them. It felt like a shock for Rider to be treated so delicately, after enduring a lifetime of hatred and curses. She thought that was her nature, no, she <em>knew</em> that it was her fate to be a monster. People like Koji even reinforced that, proving that she was nothing more than a means to an end. A foe to vanquish or a monster to destroy.

And yet, there was the thought of flipping it all upside down. The desire to take charge of her own life for once. Her ambition started to rise above the surface, creeping into her visage as she betrayed her beastly visage. This wasn&#39;t the face of a monster, but that of a <strong>woman.</strong> She gave in, a docile reply emerging from her lips.

William&#39;s eyes widened as his cheeks seemed flushed, matching Scylla&#39;s own shade of crimson. &quot;You...agree with me?&quot; He asked, dumbfounded as he stared at her a second longer. His hands froze, before his lips curled into a smile as she felt a tighter grasp around her waist, being dragged closer.

<em>&quot;Uoooooooooh!&quot;</em> William cried out, hugging her passionately as he buried his face in Scylla&#39;s chest, much to the latter&#39;s confusion. She didn&#39;t know how to react: As awkward as the gesture was, it was filled with a degree of softness and affection. Emotions that she hadn&#39;t experienced in centuries. A different type of hunger awakened within her, one that went beyond the realms of flesh and mana. She started to crave that warmth of his.

&quot;You won&#39;t regret this one bit. I&#39;ll do your story justice. I&#39;ll make sure <em>everybody</em> gets their happy ending!&quot; William ardently promised to her, staring at her from below as he kept hugging her tight and stroking her numerous tendrils. Despite having barely known her, he was already treating her like a companion in arms.</span>

&quot;Welcome, Rider. From now on, you are officially part of the <em>Neo New Shakespeare Globe™️!</em>&quot; He laughed out loud, clearly having come up with the name on the spot. &quot;So far it&#39;s just me, you and, uhm, well,&quot; He blathered a bit before continuing. &quot;you&#39;ll meet them eventually! For now, just relax and smell your newfound freed-&quot;

&quot;Oh right.&quot; He finally remembered that last detail. &quot;How are you going to break this down to the good doctor, hmmm? If he&#39;s really after my ass, I doubt he would be happy with me stealing you away from him.&quot; 

He stroked his chin, before realizing that he had a set of perfectly fine pillows in front of him. He rested on Rider&#39;s bosom and closed his eyes, drowning deep in thought. Seconds passed as he ran a billion different scenarios in his head. The answer was less than satisfactory.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m basically <em>dead</em> if he finds me.&quot; He said with a deep gulp and a faint smile, clearly fearing Koji&#39;s wrath more than anybody else. However, he then turned to Scylla.

&quot;Unless...?&quot;

He nuzzled closer to her, resting his head so that she could clearly see his eyes below her chin. &quot;You could deal with him, right? You&#39;re the only one with a connection to him, after all.&quot; He pouted.

<em>&quot;Pretty please?&quot;</em> He gave his best impression of puppy eyes, causing conflicting emotions in Scylla. When was the last time someone had approached her like this? Begging not for their miserable mortal lives, but begging for <em>her</em> to help them out? William Shakespeare was a fool and a charlatan, but something about his honesty spoke to her. He never seemed to hide his intentions, instead allowing himself to be fully open. Just how had this human survived in life? <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And so, with their arrangements made and their agreement in place, their partnership was all but sealed. There was only one thing to do to finalise their pact - Kill Naoharu Koji...?

Despite all her disdain for her master, the idea of killing him off made her face scrunch up, as though she&#39;d just eaten something sour. But, then again, why should she care about him if he did not care about her? That thought helped to dull the edge off the notion of murdering the doctor, up until the moment she remembered that it was he who summoned her in the first place, meaning she couldn&#39;t even have gotten this far without him. Yet, she never asked for any of this, did she? No, she hadn&#39;t asked to be summoned! Besides, he had tried to kill her first! Yes, this would just be delayed retribution. Although--

The debate going on within Scylla&#39;s mind was hardly educated, lacking the observation or wit one might expect from Socrates or Plato. It was clumsy, closer to a playground argument than a true discussion, with her brain playing every party. The sheer mental energy it was taking to think this over was so great, her brain didn&#39;t even have the resources left over to process William&#39;s touchy-feely grovelling.

Of course, part of her knew this path would always end with this conclusion. There was no such thing as a &quot;true&quot; happy ending. All of them ended in one person&#39;s tragedy, a tragedy which would inevitably have the rough parts sounded down over the course of years and years. Still...

<em><strong>&quot;William is here. Deep forest. Alone. Come quick.&quot;</strong></em> Rider spoke through the telepathic link, choppy messages send directly to the brain of Koji. One of the few times she deigned to use this mental link, and it was to kill her master? How awful. 

But, it was for the best. It was for the best. It was for the best.</span>

A tiny squeal emerged from the poet&#39;s mouth as he rustled in the leaves, regaining his bearings as his chin slowly coped with the lack of warmth around it.

&quot;Wait, you&#39;re pawning the job off to <em>me?</em> You&#39;re a monster, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot; William sighed, trying his best to remain hidden in the bushes. He was small enough to fit, just barely, as Scylla watched her plan unfold in admiration.

Or at least, she would have, had she not noticed that eyesore. While William fit nicely, his hat certainly did not. It stuck out of the bushes, half of it emerging at the very top. It was clearly giving him away, yet the bard didn&#39;t seem to care! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The inner enclaves of the forest was a different beast compared to the outer rings. It was densely packed with trees and vegetation, so much so that there seemed to be only darkness beneath the canopy despite it being the middle of the day. Navigating it was hell. Navigating it with a <em>tour guide</em>, on the other hand, was less hell on the mind, but more so on the calves.

Hiking. The bane of every Naoharu family member&#39;s existence. It wasn&#39;t as if Koji had never taken a walk through the forest before. But those were leisurely walks, walks designed for relaxation as he went about his business of birding. Walking through the forest with an agenda, on the other hand, proved to be much bigger of a challenge than he&#39;d imagined.

Two miles in, he started lagging. Barely another mile later and he <em>insisted</em> on taking a short break. No amount of Verga&#39;s sarcastic pep talks would move him, it seemed. And so, the writer was forced to wait as well, with nothing to entertain him aside from a few birds and squirrels in the trees. 

Meanwhile, Koji found himself a nice tree stump. He sat stretching his legs, then took a drink from some bottled water that he clearly nabbed from the store before they&#39;d departed.

&#39;I checked myself out.&#39; He caught Verga&#39;s inquisitive gaze and replied smoothly. Truly, not a single stain on the doctor&#39;s credit score. Impressive.

He kept quiet after that, taking time to relax his tired muscles. He seemed more broody than normal, if that was even possible.

Somewhere in the thicket of the forest, the magic radio inside Scylla&#39;s mind switched on. 

<em>&#39;...You&#39;ll have to be more specific than that.&#39;</em> Came Koji&#39;s clear, lofty voice. Yet another criticism? He wouldn&#39;t let her catch a break!

<em>&#39;Which direction from the stationery store? Any landmarks nearby?&#39;</em>

Great. Now she had to be descriptive as well.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Was this their first break or their third one? Verga didn&#39;t know. He simply knew that while he thought himself to be rather inept at long treks in the wilderness, Koji had him beat in that regard. For someone who communicated with birds so often, they didn&#39;t seem to be a fan of nature.

&quot;Shall I bring some wine too while we are at it?&quot; The writer exclaimed, his voice dripping with sarcasm. To his surprise, Koji didn&#39;t reply with one of his sardonic remarks. He merely remained silent, gazing at the trees in front of him like he were caught in a trance. 

&quot;Are you passing out? Leaving the mortal realm?&quot; Verga took the liberty of standing in front of the stump, crouching so that he would meet head level with Koji&#39;s furrowed brow. &quot;That wasn&#39;t part of the bargain. You may only die <em>after</em> this whole situation is resolved. Hmm, come to think of it, is there a reason you didn&#39;t just check yourself out early? Who knows, maybe your fabled princess is waiting on the other side!&quot; He laughed as he stuck his tongue out.

&quot;So, have you taken notice of William&#39;s recent actions? Besides what he did to you, of course.&quot; Verga asked, as if making idle conversation while waiting for Koji to deign him with a reply. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span>

&#39;Cry about it.&#39; His voice exuded nonchalance as he regained some much needed personal space. &#39;If I pass out, then you&#39;ll have to carry me the rest of the way. Better not rush me if you still value your back.&#39; He said unabashedly.

He contemplated Verga&#39;s question next. &#39;You mean what he did to <em>Nirvana</em>,&#39; he corrected the writer with a frown. &#39;From what I gathered, Rider and I weren&#39;t the only victims. He got himself stuck to those outsiders like a piece of chewed gum.&#39;

Unknowingly, he tightened his grip on his bottled water, making the plastic crinkle and groan. The thought that William was still running around like a cockroach after all these days made him squeamish, but Verga&#39;s question wasn&#39;t much better. The topic was on point, but it felt too deliberate, almost as if Verga was looking to dispense some immense wisdom with William as the bait.

&#39;What are you getting at, Verga?&#39; He demanded. &#39;Knowing you, you wouldn&#39;t be satisfied with talking about the weather unless there is a storm brewing on the horizon.&#39;</span>

His violent pink was a far cry from the greens, browns, and greens of this forest. His camouflage was awful. He was truly lucky he had made a pact with the apex predator, given his status as a puffy little pink bird. 

But in this instance, prey would have to act as predator. If Koji found him first, this whole ruse would come tumbling down, and she would be down and out on both fronts. No, in the name of her happiness, this plan had to work.

So, tendrils sprouted out from her body once more, scooping up whole clumps of dirt, stray branches and fallen leaves, and proceeding to smear them over the garbs of the ambusher-to-be. It wasn&#39;t long before those shades of salmon were turned to shades of trout. But fishy metaphors aside...

<em><strong>&quot;There was a campfire. Just look for smoke and follow it.&quot;</strong></em>

A sigh escaped her lips. God, what an asshole. Every word he spoke made this entire dirty trick seem less dirty and more fair. Well, aside from the dirt upon William, of course, but that was fine.

That was for the best.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Of course, William was completely oblivious to his lack of camouflage. He had never needed to hide once in his life, being a famous playwright whose name echoed across the entirety of London. Such was the nature of his extravagant colors and attention seeking behavior. Scylla&#39;s assistance was quite helpful, but he didn&#39;t seem to appreciate it.

&quot;Hmm? Wait, hey!&quot; He cried out, feeling dirt collapse on his head and force him to crouch even further down. Branches dropped to the ground as he felt the weight of additional layers of camouflage resting on his cranium. This would be followed by Scylla forcibly having her way with the multicolored menace, painting their clothes from shades of crimson and pink into disgusting black.

&quot;No! Why did you do that?&quot; Shakespeare squealed in pain. &quot;This cost me a fortune back in life. From the finest tailors too!&quot; He complained, before being wordlessly shoved back into the bush. If this was Scylla&#39;s way of showing her allegiance to him, then no wonder Koji acted so prickly towards her.

&quot;Am I just supposed to wait here forever?&quot; The poet asked grumpily. He had no idea of Scylla communicating with Koji from a distance. After all, he wasn&#39;t one to know the joys of bonding. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Verga almost bit his tongue as he felt his skull be pushed backward by Koji&#39;s robust finger. The man&#39;s eyes homed in like a hawk, telling him to mind his distance as Koji started to discuss the long list of William&#39;s errors. His first and most important error, however, was making himself an enemy out of the good doctor.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid my bones are too brittle and tired to carry you around.&quot; Verga said with a smile. &quot;So if you were to collapse, I hope you don&#39;t mind me saving myself first.&quot; He cackled before sensing that Koji&#39;s gaze was colder than usual. The man was expecting misfortune.

&quot;You are quite astute, no doubt.&quot; Verga clapped. &quot;Well, I&#39;m asking more so to confirm this more than anything. But have you noticed him ask any odd questions recently? Be it in the near present or the distant past.&quot; The writer asked while twirling his stache. &quot;Because he did ask me an odd set of questions once. Namely, what sort of books I liked and what genres I preferred. While this would be considered amicable talk amongst common strangers, to a writer it is a great offense. After all, if our tastes could not be discerned by the books we wrote, then do we even <strong>deserve our title as writers?!</strong>&quot;

He broke out in laughter after that, as if he had just told the greatest joke of all time. Koji was unamused and once Verga realized that, he awkwardly coughed himself into a frown.

&quot;As much of a brat as Shakespeare is, even he knows this unspoken rule amongst writers. Yet, he asked anyway, meaning that he was on the lookout for something. Funnily enough, I saw him grab a large pile of books from the store just a few days ago. He said he was borrowing them. In typical fashion, he never returned them.&quot; He explained. &quot;Have you noticed anything of the sort yourself?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;My contact with him ended the day the outsiders arrived.&#39; Koji replied with disdain. &#39;He&#39;s been keeping well clear of me ever since.&#39;

&#39;Although...&#39;

Verga&#39;s confession got him thinking. Koji was no writer, but the way Verga talked about a writer&#39;s livelihood was something he could relate to. Every doctor had their own specialization. Each one of them had their own methods of meeting and handling their patients. Even Koji swore by some practices passed down his family line, and would gladly trade blows with anyone who dared criticize him otherwise.

After all, his skills defined him. Anyone who came to him oblivious of the types of illness he treated would be turned away with a frown and a firmly shut door. 

As such, Verga&#39;s words resonated with Koji, enough to elicit a reaction out of him.

&#39;...My condolences?&#39;

That was such a half-baked response.

But Verga could sense the gears in Koji&#39;s mind turning, as the doctor stopped strangling his bottled water and retreated into himself, no doubt trying to connect the proverbial dots in Verga&#39;s words. &#39;He owes me 15 credits.&#39; He restated. &#39;That was not an excuse. I spotted him a few times before when he was caught smuggling books out of the <span class="mention">#stationery-store</span>. Suppose he was doing your so-called research on Nirvana&#39;s writers?&#39;

His lips quirked into a mocking smile. &#39;For all the reading he&#39;s done in this life, his writing sure has degraded.&#39; 

He was no doubt talking about the newspaper. Before Verga could respond, however, the doctor rose from his makeshift seat.

&#39;Rider has contacted me,&#39; he explained, revealing the reason behind his sporadic moments of silence. &#39;William is indeed in the woods. Next to a doused campfire.&#39;

Did Verga know about it? Was that why he suggested they look here? He cast Verga a glance that was <em>almost</em> accusatory, as if asking him <em>what the hell are you writers smoking, camping out in the woods and sleeping with dangerous beasts?</em> 

&#39;Well, there would be smoke, for starters.&#39; He continued as he flexed his mental connection to the nearby birds he had operated on. He settled on a few aquiline creatures and ordered them to locate the closest smoke signal.</span>

William would suddenly feel as though a cat had caught his tongue. Or, in this case, might it be better to describe it as a tendril catching his jaw? Yes, less metaphorically apt, but more literally accurate. Hardly what the author would have preferred, but in this instance, it was what he&#39;d have to deal with.

Then, slowly but surely, so as to be unnoticed, the tentacle shifted his head to the side, towards the canopy of leaves and branches above. There, he would lay eyes upon a bird - not one of Koji&#39;s, no, it was too oblivious to be one of his prying eyes. But it served as a fine example to demonstrate her point nonetheless.

<strong>&quot;He&#39;s on his way. Just wait. You&#39;ll have your chance soon enough.&quot;</strong>

At that, the tendril loosed it&#39;s grip and swiftly retreated back inside her. After that, Rider took a moment to change gears. What did actors call it? &quot;Immersing oneself in their role&quot;? Yes, that was it. In this instance, she was immersing herself in the role of a version of herself in an alternate timeline, a Scylla who had allowed William to foolishly escape from her clutches. Not a role she enjoyed playing, but a role she needed to play.

Then, she waited. After all, it would only take a few minutes at most for her other &quot;actor&quot; to arrive on the stage...</span>

He couldn&#39;t blame him, of course, but he found that reaction rather amusing. The doctor was normally cold. Detached from the events occurring on the island unless they mattered to him and his mission. For William to elicit such venomous reactions meant that he had truly put him back by a decade or so in terms of research. Whatever happened on the ship, Verga felt sad that he had missed it.

&quot;He owes me more than that.&quot; Verga replied regarding the statement on credits. &quot;But I agree. I could hardly believe that the famous William Shakespeare, known for his impressive plays, would behave like this when summoned as a Servant.&quot; He chuckled, about to continue, before Koji paused him by revealing Rider&#39;s message. The doctor cast the writer a judgmental stare.

&quot;...I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in the position to ask me that sort of question, Mr. Koji.&quot; Verga replied while stroking his stache. &quot;Just like how I leave you to your own devices, I expect to be left alone all the same. But yes, I did notice William start to frequent the wilderness more often. He would return with mud on his clothes and leaves on top of his hat. Not that he ever noticed those subtle details.&quot;

&quot;Whatever he is planning, it involves the warm security of nature. Only befitting of Nirvana, I feel.&quot; Verga said while crossing his arms. He saw Koji send a signal for his birds to scout ahead.

&quot;If anything, you shouldn&#39;t be asking me that. Your pets are more attuned to nature than I am. Surely they would have noticed something amiss in the past few days?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

He groaned instead, only to feel the fish tilt his head upward as he saw birds flying in the skies. His eyes widened, acknowledging Rider&#39;s message as he nodded repeatedly to show that he got it.

&quot;I get you, I get you. Thanks-&quot; William was about to say something, but then paused. &quot;Hmm, you know, I never caught your name. Since we are buddies now, we might as well do a round of introductions, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He exclaimed with a cherubic smile, albeit Scylla would be incapable of seeing it, since he was completely covered by foliage. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span>

I will refrain from judging prematurely.&#39; Koji resisted the urge to roll his eyes. From the way Verga described it, William seemed to be spending ample amounts of time in the forest <em>digging</em>. But digging for what, exactly? 

<em>...Inspiration?</em> Koji immediately flushed the thought. <em>Surely he jest...</em>

He responded to Verga&#39;s question with a shrug. &#39;I can&#39;t read minds, Verga,&#39; he corrected the writer. &#39;Barring the species who are capable of mimicking human speech, I can only see what the others see. In real time.&#39;

As if to demonstrate, he strengthened his connection to one of the birds he dispatched into the forest. Tapping into the avian&#39;s sight, Koji&#39;s own eyes glazed over as he was now seeing the forest from the bird&#39;s eye view. This one seemed to be scouting the peripherals of the forest. There was no sign of smoke. 

He switched to a different bird. Then another. It was like switching between a set of security cameras, except that he had minute control over the camera&#39;s placement...

&#39;Found them.&#39;

In a few breath&#39;s time, the scouting was over. Koji blinked, his eyes focusing once more on his immediate surroundings. He looked up at patches of the sky through the thick canopy, as if trying to pinpoint his relative position to the sun. Eventually, he decided on a direction: an uncharted path through an abundance of undergrowth that led even deeper into the woods. 

&#39;Rider has accosted William,&#39; he informed Verga, though there was a hint of confusion in his tone. &#39;She&#39;s-&#39; 

He hijacked the bird&#39;s vision again and tried to make sense of what exactly he was witnessing. 

&#39;-trying to bury William in dirt?&#39;</span>

Eventually, she would spot what she was looking for - an unassuming pigeon. Had it smelt the wafting aroma of William&#39;s awful &quot;&quot;sandwich&quot;&quot;, and come to feast? No, it had not. Though she could not claim to be an expect, Scylla could tell that little birdie belonged to Koji. Call it gut instinct. 

Fish and bird made eye contact, and with a <em>tch</em>, Scylla turned away, hiding her face from the beady-eyed freak as she stared off into the treeline. She had to act casually. She couldn&#39;t address the mud-clumped bush containing William, lest Koji catch on to the ruse. Of course, he might have already knew... but even at worst, the two servants could easily double-team and defeat the doctor. Hardly the outcome she wanted, but she kept the thought in mind, in case a backup proved necessary. 

Then, silence fell upon the clearing, broken only by the occasional crackle of the fire and the sway of the leaves. But after a pause, she would mutter a response to William&#39;s question. Something to make their partnership official.

If that were the case, I feel like you would sleep sounder nights.&quot; He smirked, watching Koji&#39;s strong, yet distant gaze. They were starting intently, but not at Verga. It was more comparable to looking through a microscope.

Within minutes, he found them. Within seconds, he described the current situation. It seemed like Scylla had found William, but hadn&#39;t killed them yet. Instead, she was giving him an early grave. So it seemed?

&quot;Interesting.&quot; Verga mulled that piece of information over, stroking his beard as he walked past Koji. &quot;Well, what are you waiting for? It&#39;s one thing to see through a lens, but another thing entirely to see it through your own eyes.&quot; He stuck his tongue out, vivaciously licking his own lips in anticipation. It felt like Verga was expecting something, but Koji struggled to know what exactly.

Regardless, the writer was right. Now that he had located his Servant and his target, there was no point in wasting any more time. He stood up and followed suit, the two men walking through a thick web of trees, before finally coming across their objective.

&quot;Greetings, miss.&quot; Verga saluted Scylla a dozen feet away, giving a light bow and head nod. &quot;I believe we haven&#39;t met. The name is Verga. Giovanni Verga. I&#39;ve come for that insult of a writer that you have found recently.&quot; Despite his politeness, he was standing from a safe distance, very much wary of any sudden misunderstandings. He then motioned for Koji to come forth.

&quot;I&#39;ll let you two catch up.&quot; He snickered, patting Koji&#39;s shoulder and inciting him to start talking. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

It was hard to understand her intentions from glares and movement alone, especially since she was very much the type to remain grounded and static, like a true beast designed to conserve energy as much as possible. At the same time, he couldn&#39;t help but find her attitude curious. It felt familiar, giving him flashes of inspiration as he almost found her endearing. Perhaps, it was due to how she reminded him of someone else.

&quot;Scylla?&quot; He repeated that name pursed from her lips, dots slowly connecting in his head as he remembered that tale stored in a frozen section of his mind. &quot;<em>That</em> Scylla. I see.&quot; His mouth curled into a smile, but Scylla wouldn&#39;t notice it, for the bushes hid him away. Before he could comment on her origin, Koji finally showed up, looking as disgruntled as usual. However, this visit came with a surprise gift.

<em>&quot;Verga?!&quot;</em> William screamed in his mind, hearing the Italian&#39;s suave, yet repugnant voice fill the air. He was frothing at the mouth, biting his lip at the thought that Verga was assisting Koji. This was terrible! Those two on their own were already a pain in the butt, but together? It was like you were asking for trouble!

Of course, he couldn&#39;t intervene, for Scylla had asked him to hide. He decided to wait and see what Rider did. His fate rested upon her hands. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span>

After business hours are over, you&#39;ll hardly find me so endearing.&#39; Indeed, once this farce was over, Koji was determined to take a break from all the literary Servants on the island. He&#39;d had enough gossiping to last him a decade...

Unfortunately, the trek through the woods did little to soothe his mind - if one could still call it a trek, that is. As the writer and doctor neared their destination, Koji&#39;s arms were shaking from the sheer strain of pushing branches and twigs out of the way. He emerged from the trees looking as if he&#39;d just run a marathon. Verga&#39;s shoulder pat of encouragement only added to his burden.

&#39;Do not touch me.&#39; Koji warned the writer as he swatted his hand away , his breathing heavy. &#39;If you have nothing useful to contribute, then kindly keep all of you to yourself.&#39;

<em>God, he wanted to lie down so badly.</em>

It took him monumental effort to resist the urge. Scylla was standing in the open, her expression arranged in a way that Koji felt inclined to call <em>stupid</em>. In fact, it was precisely the kind of expression he&#39;d have expected from someone who had just tried to bury a Servant alive...only to find out the hard way how utterly unfeasible it was.

With a sigh, Koji approached his Servant with legs that felt like lead. &#39;Alright, Rider. Show me where you&#39;ve buried him.&#39; He cut to the chase without so much of an introduction, leaving Verga there to hang out with the backdrop. 

&#39;<em>If</em> you succeeded in doing so, that is.&#39; He placed more emphasis on the word, sounding like someone who had just witnessed his hunting dog lose their prey. But who could blame him? He had already spoiled himself on the ending.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Finally, after what felt like hours but was closer to minutes, Koji would arrive. Normally, that might be cause for celebration, that everything was going to plan. But there were two issues that stuck out to her, one subtle and one obvious. First, the look on Koji&#39;s face, even more bitter than usual, as though he was being forced to do menial chores. It bode ill. The second issue...

Giovanni Whoga? Upon looking at the decrepit old man, Scylla&#39;s eyes narrowed. Rider had no idea who he was, but she could tell he was a servant. What, had the doctor already picked out her replacement for when she inevitably axed her? How despicable.

This ambush had just gone from &quot;safe bet&quot; to &quot;risky gambit&quot;. The numbers advantage had been lost, and the power advantage balanced. She could practically feel the panic radiating from the shrub, but she pushed it to the side. It was too late to back down. Now or never.

<strong>&quot;There.&quot;</strong> Scylla pointed out towards the dirt-smeared bush. Her voice was dripping with disdain, though who, exactly, it was targeted at was unclear. <strong>&quot;In the bush. He&#39;s either dead or dying. If you feel so inclined to gloat, Naoharu Koji, then do so quickly before he bleeds out.&quot;</strong>

Trick him into getting into range, and then hope that William could finish it. That was her best shot. Perhaps her only shot. But with the hook cast, would he take the bait?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The bard overheard the conversation perfectly. It seemed as if Scylla&#39;s hunch was right, since Koji had somehow figured out that William was hiding nearby. Even worse, Scylla had pointed towards his bush, meaning that he didn&#39;t even have the element of surprise anymore. He was like a cornered rat, waiting to be caught. If this was Scylla&#39;s way of setting up an assassination, then no wonder her tales ended in tragedy: She <strong>sucked</strong> at it!

But William did not lose hope, for there was something else he could do. Without warning, he popped out of the bush as leaves and dirt piles fell down from his head and shoulders. His clothes were black and brown, perfect for someone trying to camouflage, but pointless when that person was flailing their arms wildly in an effort to be seen.

&quot;Hey! You&#39;re just telling him where I am? What the hell!&quot; William shouted, gathering the three&#39;s attention. While Scylla&#39;s blood was most likely boiling from rage, it seemed like William hadn&#39;t given up on the assassination. It was subtle, but she could notice an intense stare in her eyes, before it vanished and refocused on Koji. What could he be planning?

&quot;Well, I might as well play catch up.&quot; William sighed, shrugging as he leaned towards Koji. &quot;What&#39;s up, doc? Reconnecting yourself with nature? What&#39;s <em>he</em> doing here, hmm?&quot; He side eyed Verga, who was currently laughing. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

&quot;Sheesh. I&#39;d like to think my hands are a lot softer than bird talons.&quot; He said as his stache drooped in disappointment. He let Koji have his say with Scylla, before hearing some scuttling foliage.

When William emerged from the bushes, like a geyser extracted from its earthly mantle, Verga broke down in a fit of laughter.

&quot;Bahahahahahah!&quot; He chuckled, weak at his knees as he almost leaned on Koji for support. &quot;I don&#39;t regret this trip at all. This was more than worth it. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Koji?&quot; His face was a wide grin, as if taking joy in seeing William be reduced to a filthy, dirty animal.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t mind me at all. Just keep being yourself.&quot; Verga puffed out air upon seeing that William noticed him. &quot;I am merely a witness to these events, not someone who actively participates in them.

His eyes narrowed slightly. &#39;Are you shitting me?&#39; He said softly, but there was something close to anger in his voice. &#39;A canine buries their food. You are not a dog, neither is Will-&#39;

The dirt erupted, sending leaves and damp soil flying. A black and brown shape leapt from the dirt mound. It was no menace. It was just William, covered from head to toe in blood and filth.

His clothes were tattered. His hat, surprising, was still on his head. Koji threw up his cane and poked it in William&#39;s direction, keeping the bard well away from his clothes.

Needless to say, William&#39;s attempt at making small talk fell on deaf ears.

Irritation flickered in the doctor&#39;s sharp eyes. <strong>&#39;Explain.&#39;</strong> He demanded of his Servant, his voice going hard around the edges. He turned to take a long and hard look at Scylla, as if he were seeing her for the first time.

&#39;This is your idea of a hunt? <em>This?</em>’ Koji gave the shabby looking bard another jab with his cane, his expression incredulous. &#39;I never took you as one who relishes toying with your prey instead of killing them. Tell me, Scylla, have you gone soft, or have I misjudged your capacity all this time?&#39;</span>

The doctor looked unhappy and visibly so, since his glare was not only directed to him, but Scylla as well. He spared no expenses in grilling his own Servant, pointing out their incomptence, seemingly unaware of what lurked beyond the surface.

&quot;Or maybe I&#39;m just hard to kill?&quot; William interrupted his rant, regaining his attention and glare as he condescendingly gripped at Koji&#39;s cane before he could receive another poke. 

&quot;Maybe you should dirty your own hands, doc, instead of letting others do the deed for you. You want something done right, you do it yourself!&quot; He pointed the cane to his chest, his message loud and clear, especially to Scylla.

As William showed his neck, encouraging Koji to cut it, he subtly conveyed his intent to Scylla.

<em>&quot;Strike him from behind while he is distracted! He won&#39;t see it coming!&quot;</em>

It was so bold of a plan, yet one that might work due to its hurried improvisation. Actors made do with what they had, be it a play, a musical or a movie. Such was the nature of improvising. Could Scylla then play her role as the director had envisioned? <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span></span>

And now, she&#39;d have to deal with the consequences. The string holding up the Sword of Damocles was fraying, straining, close to breaking entirely.

And then, of course, came the critique. Koji had truly missed his calling in the world. Why be a doctor when he could have been a critic instead? He certainly enjoyed discourse enough for the glove to fit.

<strong>&quot;For one so obsessed with defeating death, you seem utterly unaware of how fickle it can be. How the line between living and dead can be impassable or non-existent without reason.&quot;</strong> Scylla growled, fists tightening as Koji poked in the direction of William. What a truly detestable man. On second thought, perhaps it would be better if she killed Koji herself? Something about poetic irony, perhaps? The tool turning against their master? 

Tch, didn&#39;t matter. Not anymore. As the doctor turned away, Rider saw William&#39;s signal. It truly was up to her to land a killing blow, then? So be it!

<em><strong>SQUEEEEEEEELCH!</strong></em> The doctor would suddenly find his body much less intact, as a flower of tendrils blossomed through his torso and out of his chest, roots of barbs and spikes spread through his insides. And then, as quickly as it arrived, it was forcibly dragged out, shredding much of his insides as the vicious appendages returned to her body once more. Even with his enhanced biology, it was enough to keep him down, at least for a while.

With this sham of a hunt completed, Scylla looked over at her &quot;master&quot;, rent so thoroughly. A pang of guilt hit her heart, but she did her best to smother it, refusing to accept it. 

<strong>&quot;This is for the best, Naoharu Koji.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji burst into a sudden laugh. &#39;Oh, I am <em>painfully</em> aware.&#39; His smile faded as quickly as it came. <em>&#39;You have no idea.&#39;</em>

He didn&#39;t elaborate. That wasn&#39;t what he had come here for. What had started out as a hunt was quickly turning into a farce. Nor only did Scylla fail to dispose of William, she seemed perfectly fine with letting the bard run his mouth. 

Something smelled unbelievably fishy.

Koji wrinkled his nose and realized that the scent had come from none other than William himself. Looks can be deceiving, and William was the perfect living proof: underneath the rags and dirt was a bona fide Servant. Even as a Caster, his strength was leagues above that of a normal human.

Koji was made acutely aware of their differences as William easily intercepted his cane and started waving it all over his once pink outfit. He pointed the tip over his heart, then his neck, as if inviting Koji to take a stab himself.

&#39;Don&#39;t be stupid.&#39; The doctor was powerless to stop William as the latter waved his cane around like a magic wand, dragging the doctor&#39;s arm along with it. &#39;If I could harm you with my own hands, I would&#39;ve done it ages ago!&#39;

As if to prove his point, he accepted William&#39;s offer and pushed, driving the tip of his cane into the bard&#39;s neck. &#39;There. <em>Satisfied?</em>&#39; He asked, looking at William with mock seriousness. As expected, William neither budged nor bled, as the fortified wood failed to leave a single scratch on what was supposedly one of the most delicate parts of the human skin.

His hands were sore. His arms were aching. The rest of him didn&#39;t fare any better. What was he even doing out here?

Koji felt a light tug on his mana reserves. It was a small, almost imperceptible gesture, like taking a cup to ladle out the ocean. But nonetheless, the cup had been filled, sending ripples across the water. There was a stir behind him. The oceanic stench intensified-

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">An immense warmth poured out of his chest. Pain exploded across his torso as Scylla&#39;s tendrils half rammed, half wormed their way through him, thousands of tiny barbs carving their way into his back and shredding him from within. Koji staggered into William, no longer clutching at his cane, but at the bard as his knees buckled from the stress. 

A series of uneven gasps escaped him. There was no scream, as air had been torn out of his perforated lungs. Blood seeped out of his body, thick and syrupy and dark. The doctor crumbled messily onto the ground, clutching at the multitude of wounds across his torso as his insides began to burn.

<em>He was going to-</em>

Koji lay in the grass, curled into a fetal position at William&#39;s feet. It would be <em>oh-so-easy</em> to kick him while he was down. Some sweet sweet retribution for all the times he had abused the bard for breathing the wrong words. How delightful would that be? 

As William contemplated his options, the doctor&#39;s pitiful form writhed and spasmed as he struggled for breath. He didn&#39;t seem to be dead yet. Was he going to die soon?

That was a question only Scylla could answer.</span>

&quot;Won&#39;t hurt as much as this though.&quot;

Tendrils invaded the doctor&#39;s body, emerging from various ends like a flower in bloom. The bloody rose was a sight to behold, blood pouring down and wetting the ground. He was more hole than man at that point, being barely conscious as his survival instincts kicked adrenaline back to his heart. He was still alive, but the light was flickering from his eyes.

He then felt a weight on his head. Then on his shoulder. Eventually, a larger weight was resting on his back. He wished he could see what that was, but he didn&#39;t even have the strength to turn his head around anymore. However, he could safely assume what was going on thanks to his ears. He would have to be blind to not see it.

&quot;Toodle-doo! Planet Koji has officially been...&quot; William amped up squatting on top of Koji&#39;s body before rising up like a shooting star. <strong>&quot;conquered!</strong> From this point onward, this land belongs to the Shakespeare House.&quot; He recited smugly, tapping his foot against Koji&#39;s arse.

&quot;I had no idea that my day would turn out to be so intense. First, I get attacked by your Servant. Then, I get to see you grovel on the floor, lying in a pool of your own blood. Say doc, what does the doctor do when they get sick, huh?&quot; He taunted, taking a comfortable seat on the man&#39;s body as they stretched their legs.

&quot;You&#39;ve been so, so worried about someone else&#39;s life that you never bothered to think about yourself. No wonder you were unable to save your dear wife! No one who values their own life so poorly can ever hope to rival the acts of creation itself.&quot; He mocked him by patting and brushing his hair, treating him like a child.

&quot;Well, unless you&#39;re a writer of course. Hahahahahah!&quot; He broke into laughter.</span>

The old man kept going for a few more seconds, wiping tears from his eyes before he regained his composure.

&quot;I have to say, I never expected Mr. Koji to be cornered so easily. Either he was that tired or-&quot; Verga cast a glance to Scylla, who was still fresh with her Master&#39;s blood.

<strong>&quot;he really did trust you, didn&#39;t he?</strong> Perhaps, not the same trust he held towards his lover or even his friends, if he had any.&quot; He pushed his glasses up. &quot;But the same affection that you would hold towards a pet. It&#39;s still a sign of love nonetheless. That being said, I know that I would be livid if my own cat bit me.&quot; Verga snickered, boasting a wide grin as he observed Koji&#39;s condition from afar.

&quot;Such a shame though. A man like Koji does not deserve to die here.&quot; He sighed, stroking his beard as he remained puzzled in thought. He looked like he felt unsure on what to do next. &quot;He has so much more going for him in life. Certainly, he deserved a better death than this.&quot;</span>

Don&#39;t you agree, Scylla?&quot; He flashed her a smile. &quot;I have no idea what your relationship with the good doctor was, but it certainly didn&#39;t seem like a happy one. So I&#39;m giving you a chance. A chance to spin your own tale.&quot;

The bard stood to Koji&#39;s side, his arms fully extended and pointing at the downed, bloodied man. It was like a magician revealing what was behind the curtain. &quot;His life is in your hands. No longer are you a mere monster. No longer are you a beast limited to following orders. You are the <strong>main character.</strong> Now, what type of protagonist will you be? Vengeful and sweet? Strong but innocent? A seductive femme fatale with a heart of gold? A stubborn fish that is loyal to a fault?&quot;

&quot;Now is the time to choose. Forge your own path. Whatever you pick, I&#39;ll support you!&quot; William wrapped his arms around his shoulders while puckering his lips out. He then cast a nasty glare towards Verga.

&quot;And of course, you won&#39;t bother stopping this grand show, will you uncle?&quot; He snarled.</span>

&quot;No. I am curious to see what the lady thinks as well. Whether a man like Naoharu Koji deserves to live or die. It will be an interesting experience: To see whether a beast can transcend her identity or not.&quot; The old man chuckled.

&quot;Well, what are you waiting for? I haven&#39;t got all day.&quot; He smirked at Scylla, applying even more pressure on her as the two Casters stared the woman down. This was it. This decision would impact the rest of her life on this earth. The moment she opened a gate, the one behind her would close. It was far more terrifying than any battle she had been part in. No amount of wounds, injuries or pain compared to this.

A monster being given free will. A beast being given agency. No longer a foe to be felled, nor one to be conquered and owned. For once, she was allowed to make her own decision. Was this the start of a new legend? Or was it the start of something bigger? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">William was laughing. Verga was laughing. But, Scylla was not. Far from it, her mood was hardly celebratory. There was joy to be found in a hunt, the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of a full stomach. There was joy to be found in self-defence, in surviving conflict, in avenging yourself against those who seek to bring about your end. But there was no joy to be found in this. This was <em>murder</em>, and nothing else.

She had thought that it would have been cathartic, to slip free of her leash. But instead, it felt hollow. Emptier than the deepest, bleakest empty. An emotional deadzone. 

…Well, that was not entirely correct. Leaking out through the walls of her guarded heart was pity, pity for the beaten and bloodied man lying in front of her. It was certainly a low point for the man, to feel his life slipping away as he lay in the muck, while the enemy he sought to destroy posed over his limp body. 

<strong>”He trusted me…?”</strong>

Yes, this strange old man was right. Koji had trusted her. Not as an equal, as brothers and sisters in arms, but as a surgeon trusted their scalpel. It was not impressive, but that did not make it any less of a real trust. And, of course, that meant that this was not a liberation. This was a betrayal. She was no different than any other treacherous fiend who once roamed the earth. No different than a certain witch whom she hated so dearly. Like a mirror image reflected through dirty water.

But, it was still up to her to decide Koji’s fate, as William and Verga rejected any claim. No, they wanted to simply spectate. Observe the conflict, meddle where it benefited them. They had no cause, no motive except their own. Then, they were masterless? And yet, they lived anyway. No bond pinned them down.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">No, that was wrong. Her eyes trailed down to the doctor’s arm, where his artificial circuit lay. The bond had never pinned <em>her</em> down either. Some part of her had always known that. She could have simply elected to walk out of that snowy cabin and never return. So then, why had she chosen to remain?

A leash. A precise choice of words. A leash restrained, but it did not imprison. It allowed freedom, but promised direction. Freedom to roam upon the path of fate, but not off it. As irritating and as sharp-tongued as Koji could be, he was a firm hand to hold that leash. One that would prevent her from giving in to her worst traits, her savagery, her impatience. Someone who could keep a stopper on the bottle of boiling rage inside her, relieving pressure where necessary, but never allowing it to overflow and shatter. Something she could never do on her own. The maiden could keep the beast at bay, but she could never defeat it.

Could William be that hand which held the leash? Could he use that same judgement? That freewheeling playwright wanted her to be the main character, but those were big shoes to fill. To be the main character, the leading actor, was a prestigious thing, but it was no easy feat. One needed to balance comedy and tragedy, joy and sorrow, to be both independent and a team player all in one. 

But more than any of that, they were the <u>driving force</u> of the story. It was their desires that drove the path of the story. Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, they were all born from the actions of their main character, steps forward to achieve what they wanted.

All Scylla truly wanted was peace. To settle down, live quietly, and be loved. That would not make an exciting play. That would not be the story that William sought.

Once again, her eyes settled upon the wrecked body of Naoharu Koji. Was any of this really for the best?</span>

A pause, then she spoke again, pushing the presence of Verga to the side and addressing solely William.

<strong>”Your ambitions for me are… flattering, but I cannot accept honours above me. The spotlight is all well and good, but I have no interest in being the centrepiece of this island’s drama.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The bard waited expectantly, his eyes wanting as they stared through Scylla&#39;s joyless visage. He was goading her, inciting her. Waiting for her to finish the job. To start her new story as a character reborn.

But that moment never came. For her face devoid of feelings was now showing far more emotion than a monster could ever have. Her glare pierced through William, knocking him aside from the sheer intensity of her eyes alone. He felt a lump fall down his throat as he remembered just how many skewers he had endured from that femme fatale.

Her gaze then softened as she started to speak sincerely, letting her true emotions out as she openly expressed her ideals. She was never born to be an actress, be it in a villainous or heroic role. This was nothing more than a play, after all.

&quot;...Are you sure you don&#39;t want to think about it a bit longer?&quot; William attempted to bargain, sweating bullets as he flashed her a nervous smile. Perhaps Scylla simply needed some more goading. Perhaps he hadn&#39;t appealed to her enough.

&quot;This man hurt you, didn&#39;t he? Treated you like a monster. Saw you no better than an animal.&quot; Scylla was a perceptive creature. She could tell whether men were lying to save their skin, but she couldn&#39;t sense that desperation in William&#39;s words, only pure sincerity. It got to the point that she couldn&#39;t tell whether she pitied him or Koji more.

<em>&quot;Yet you&#39;re sparing him?&quot;</em> He asked, throat palpitating not out of fear, but disbelief. The more he spoke, the more Rider could sense that the bard&#39;s fear towards her was slowly morphing into something far more primal. Something she could relate to rather easily. Rage.</span>

William paused, steadying his hat as if he were trying to phrase his next words correctly. &quot;You know, I couldn&#39;t care less about Koji. Whether he lives or dies is none of my concern. I have no reason to hate him nor love him. But <em>you?</em> You have every excuse in the world to <em>absolutely despise him.</em>&quot; Venom dripped off his tongue. &quot;Do you think that I don&#39;t know of the legend of Scylla? A writer of my caliber has read far and wide.&quot;

His face twisted into a snarl. His eyes embodied pure malice. Shakespeare was always a pest in Scylla&#39;s eyes, but for once, her body ran cold. There was no humor in his voice. No annoying joke to make her wish to punch his face. Instead, there was simply silence as he glared at her in disgust.

&quot;You think you&#39;re a monster? No, <strong>you&#39;re even worse than that.</strong> I&#39;ll tell you what you truly are, Scylla. An obstacle. A setpiece. A villain of the week. A minute encounter in the microcosm of the story. You don&#39;t exist for your own sake, but for the sake of others. <strong>Your only purpose is to embellish the hero&#39;s long list of achievements.&quot;</strong> He growled, face shrouded in shadows as he accusingly pointed towards Scylla.

&quot;To tell you the truth, I graduated from your Greek stories since grade school. To me, your legends aren&#39;t about how heroic heroes are or how friendship, love and trust trump all flaws. No, your stories simply state that you might as well be <em>worthless</em> if you aren&#39;t born as a hero. It&#39;s the pinnacle of cruel realities.&quot; He was frothing at the mouth, emitting spit as it took him a great deal of composure to avoid stuttering.</span>

&quot;The monsters, like you? They don&#39;t matter. Once their role is completed, they simply exit the stage, as if they had never existed. Sure, they might get some fans here and there, but can they ever really take the spotlight away from a hero? Heh, no. Of course not.&quot; He chuckled out loud, as if he had rehearsed this speech several times already, to the point he found it ludicrous that he was still repeating it.

&quot;So why? Why do you insist on playing such a terrible role? One that leads to ridicule and suffering? Your purpose in life is to look good on the hero&#39;s resume. Your purpose in life is to give people a challenge. Your purpose serves anyone but <em>your own.</em>&quot; He then pointed to Koji. &quot;Do you know how many Servants he has summoned and cast aside? How many Heroic Spirits he has engraved upon himself? You were meant to join them!&quot;

He shouted, stomping the bloodied grass around them as Verga watched on in amusement, stroking his stache and giggling throughout.

&quot;Yet, by some miracle, you&#39;re still here. You had the chance to take back your life with your own two hands, <strong>yet you squandered it!&quot;</strong> William yelled, his breath running ragged as he took deep breaths to recompose himself. Rider remained silent, enduring the conversation as she mulled over his words.

<strong>&quot;I refuse to write that story.&quot;</strong> William&#39;s voice boomed, to the point it no longer sounded like the bard from earlier. It was the voice of someone bitter. Someone who forever went unloved. Rider understood that well.

&quot;Even if my characters are weak, lame, ugly and stupid...&quot;

<em>&quot;...I want them to beat cool, strong, beautiful and smart protagonists.&quot;</em> He thought.

&quot;Even if I wasn&#39;t born with talent. Even if I&#39;m misguided, stupid and good-for-nothing with a terrible personality...&quot;

<em>&quot;...I want to beat the talented, smart, likeable and genius writers.&quot;</em> He thought.

William stepped forward, pouring his entire soul in his words.</span>

&quot;Bravo. Oh, bravo!&quot; He giggled, his laughter sounding too good to be fake, yet too sarcastic to be sincere. &quot;You truly moved my heart with your ridiculousness, William Shakespeare. Who knew that England&#39;s most famous writer acted like such a petulant child? Bahahahahah!&quot;

He laughed, much to William&#39;s annoyance as the bard glared at the Italian with disdain. &quot;Imagine complaining about something as simple as villains playing to lose. If the monster that we barely knew of killed the hero in cold blood, well, I&#39;d ask for a refund! No wonder your works are so mediocre.&quot; He cackled.

&quot;I suppose us men really are the trash that dreams are made of! Bahahahah! I&#39;m sure she agrees as well.&quot; He turned to Scylla, noticing the determined glare in her eyes. Despite William&#39;s words, she seemed intent on letting Koji live.

&quot;It was futile for a man to attempt to communicate with a monster in the first place.&quot; He relaxed his legs as he leaned on a nearby tree, stretching his arms. &quot;You&#39;ve lost your touch, Shakespeare.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite Verga&#39;s sickening demeanor, his bluntness was usually on point. There was no doubt that Scylla would rather trust Koji over William&#39;s delusions of grandeur. For a second, the writer looked betrayed, as if he had expected to win over Rider&#39;s ambitions. He quickly corrected that expression to a nervous gulp.

&quot;Well, it is your choice to make. If your decision is final, then I have nothing else to add. It seems like we are nothing alike.&quot; William scoffed, disappointment seeping from his voice. &quot;What a fucking waste of time. To think I believed that you, at least, would be able to understand me. The suffering of the small fry.&quot;

The wind&#39;s direction changed. The rustling of leaves felt ominous all of the sudden. Scylla&#39;s beastly instincts were screaming at her to run away. She could sense something approach. Something familiar.

&quot;Then, if you insist on following these horrid trends.&quot; William ground his teeth against each other. &quot;Allow me to assist you: No longer will you play the role of the hero, but the role of a villain. Your defeat will bolster <em>his</em> list of achievements and allow for the birth of a new brand of hero.&quot; 

Rustling could be heard in the distance, followed by crashes, groans and howls. Trees started to collapse, one by one, like a stack of dominos.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong>

&quot;You shall be the next victim to be placed on his altar.&quot; William smirked while Verga stared in awe, realizing that something incredible was approaching their location. &quot;Be glad, Scylla! I&#39;m giving you the opportunity of a lifetime: If you are capable of defeating this next foe, then you might as well be considered a hero!&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Scylla had been expecting many things. Mockery, perhaps, or reluctant acceptance. but a tantrum? That had not been one of them.

Watching this man, one of the most prominent playwrights of all time, who told stories that echoed through the ages, irrevocably shifted culture in his wake... And yet, he was so defensive, so bitter about his past. He was a man who enjoyed more fame that Homer, more recognition than Vergil, one who put centuries of Greeks and Romans to shame. So, why did he react in such a way?

A thought occurred to Rider. Perhaps it was a foolish thought. Perhaps it was misplaced, just the idiotic barking of a mad dog. But, listening to one of the most accomplished writers of an age past suffer a breakdown over how unloved his literature was, it sparked an idea that lingered in her mind.

<em>This man is not William Shakespeare.</em>

But she could not linger on that thought for long, because at this moment, another more pressing realisation would be made. A link between two figures, at first unrelated, but now dragged to the forefront, at the centre of it all.

<em><strong>Vortigern.</strong></em> As the Berserker leapt towards Scylla, swords primed, she barely had enough time to bring her arms up, partially blocking the blow. Even then, the blades bit deep into her flesh, and the mere force of the blow sent her skidding back across the dirt.

<strong>&quot;YOU!&quot;</strong> Rider snarled at Vortigern, before her eyes flicked back over to William. <strong>&quot;So, you&#39;re the one whose holding the leash of this mad dog? How pathetic. Unable to make a new legend, you&#39;re forced to parasitize yourself to those of others!&quot;</strong>

She grit her teeth and clenched her first before surging forth, aiming to counter-attack against the howling fiend while he was still recovering from hitting the ground. As she came into range, she let loose a strike, an uppercut aimed squarely at the tyrant&#39;s neck.

<strong>&quot;So be it. If your true colours are so utterly repugnant, then I&#39;ll just make you eat your words, faker!&quot;</strong></span>

It seemed like hours. It probably had been. His chest was burning, and he had lost all sense of time, or of the place, or the danger of exposing his back to a Servant who was now more foe than friend. He forgot about Scylla and her act of betrayal. He even forgot about how he had come here, or that he had ever been anywhere else. All that mattered was to endure the current sliver of time and make it to the next. 

<em>He was going to-</em>

<em>Breathe.</em> His insides burned as if they had run against a hot poker. As if his lungs had been stuffed full of hot coals. He was vaguely aware of a weight being placed upon his body, ripping open more skin and sinew like rubber bands. And he felt nothing. Nothing but numbness.

<em>He was going to-</em>

<em>Sleep.</em> Drifting in and out of consciousness, the chatters above him sounded like the revving of a heavy-duty lawn mower. The noise drove spikes and nails into his skull. It was agonizing. A little less so as he collapsed onto his side and let gravity to take over. 

<em>He was going to-</em>

<em>Heal.</em> A great warmth enveloped him like a soft feather duvet, leaving him in a feverish stupor. Too weak to muster the strength to lift a finger, he lay in the grass like a baby, allowing his mana-rich blood, the crystallization of the Naoharu family&#39;s wisdom, to begin its work.

The smell of earth, grass, and rust brought him comfort. Piece by piece, his body began to knit bone and stitch flesh back together. Gaps of missing flesh was filled, and the skin that regrew over his muscles was as smooth as it always had been.

It was not enough.

A growing pool of blood gathered beneath him, thick and sticky like honey, the color so dark that it could pass for black. The rate of discharge was startling. It seemed that doctor was going to bleed himself dry before his veins and capillaries could repair themselves.

But the delirium brought about by his overworked organs had dulled his awareness. He was in no state to diagnose himself, let alone realize the fruitless labors of his magecraft. 

As the undead beast&#39;s presence stirred the forest awake, Koji felt himself drift into a valley of peace. Detachedly, he watched the scene unfold through the eyes of a dying man: fallen trees, scorched earth, shadows dancing across the frame of his vision. A clash between legends. Between men and beast. Between the desire for grandeur and the longing for happiness.

There was just no point to it all.</span>

She had eluded his previous blow and survived the brunt of it, but there wouldn&#39;t be a next time.

Knowing this, Rider launched herself at the tyrant and struck him right in the neck. Blood spurted out of his veil as it felt like he was choking on his own blood.

&quot;Grrrrrrrrrr&quot; Snarls could be heard as Scylla realized that despite her attack being successful, Vortigern hadn&#39;t budged an inch. His eyes flashed at her, filled with rage.

<strong>&quot;GRRRRRRRUOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> Vortigern yelled, wrapping his arms around Scylla and holding her in a choking embrace. She felt like her bones were being tenderized as blood erupted from her mouth like a volcano. To further sully her, the mad king started to viciously headbutt her, as if mocking her attempts to strike at his head.

<strong>SMASH SMASH SMASH</strong>

Her vision blurred as the last few images in her head were Vortigern&#39;s bloodied visage, the Berserker having bashed his head on hers so much that his own forehead had started to bleed.

&quot;UOOOOH!--UOOOOH!--UOOOOH!&quot; He screamed with each collision, finding an offbeat rhythm as he continued to hug and pummel Scylla to death.</span>

After saying that, his face turned to a grin. &quot;But at least know that you will have lost to a worthy opponent. One on par with the heroes of old. His power level is 530,000, he&#39;s popular with the ladies and he even has a <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em>™️ subscription! Ladies and gentleman, witness the one and the only...<strong>Vortigern, King of the Britons!&quot;</strong>

William clapped to himself, stroking his own pride as he admired Vortigern&#39;s strength. &quot;So, what do you think? Pretty cool, isn&#39;t he?&quot; He laughed as he watched Scylla receive another headbutt.</span>

His body had gone into shock, yet not even adrenaline was enough to boost his body&#39;s healing factor. He felt sluggish and on borrowed time, wondering if he had enough blood in reserve to stabilize himself. As a doctor, he knew deep down that it would take a miracle to save himself.

&quot;Look at you now. So puny and unsightly.&quot; A familiar giggle echoed in his ears, or what remained of them. He couldn&#39;t even turn around his neck to see, so he limited himself to voices.

&quot;This is what fate brought you to, Naoharu Koji. A pointless death in a pointless life. Truly, I should let you die right now.&quot;

Footsteps got closer.

&quot;But human lives are born out of despair. That is why we crave so deeply for hope. Without despair, however, our lives lose meaning. Hence the world can never truly be rid of it.&quot; 

A warm feeling pulsated around his chest. The blood felt warmer than usual. He sensed a surge in vitamins and nutrients up his body. His heart&#39;s circulation was on point. This wasn&#39;t normal by any means. He realized this once he saw that some of the holes on his skin had disappeared, as if they were never there.

&quot;This story is not done with you yet, Koji.&quot; Loud chattering followed as Koji finally regained the use of his neck. He turned around, observing his surroundings as he saw Verga standing right next to him.</span>

&quot;To see you perish like this would be a loss for the fine arts. I don&#39;t think I would be able to find a similar muse on this bewitched island.&quot; He laughed, lightly placing his foot on Koji&#39;s stomach before kicking him into rolling.

&quot;Now, wake the fuck up. You have a king to dethrone.&quot; Verga chuckled, twirling his stache as he glanced back to Vortigern.

&quot;...If <em>that</em> even is a king.&quot; Verga said with a far more spiteful tone. &quot;Gross. Gross. Absolutely hideous. Who would make something so vile? Something so...<em>irrealistic?</em>&quot; His teeth were behaving like grindstone as he seethed at the sight of the Berserker. &quot;I bet that&#39;s not even a Servant at all!&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her hit had landed, but to assume that it would have killed the corpse king would have been optimistic. No, he had survived far worse than a broken neck. All Scylla had hoped for was to stun Berserker, but it appeared even that ambition had been aiming too high. He wasn&#39;t fazed at all.

Which meant that it was time for <em>his</em> counter-attack.

<strong>SMASH, SMASH, SMASH,</strong> like a Newton&#39;s Cradle, the collisions between skulls repeated ad nauseum. Eventually, the guttural howls of Vortigern would become fuzzy and indistinct from one another, merging together with the sound of her skull being caved in. Blood was rushing out of her, her ears, her torso, her arms, her mouth. Pain ran amok through her body. Truly, the tyrant&#39;s strength was unmatched.

But even as her senses started to fade, the unbearably smug voice of William remained sharp and clear. And that, if nothing else, was a <em>powerful motivator</em>.

<strong>&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;</strong>

Out from her broken chest emerged a bundle of dozens of tendrils, each of them thrusting out like a spear. They would pierce Berserker&#39;s chest, but ultimately do little to damage the titan, each of her tentacles getting stuck in his ribcage. But, that was precisely the point. Attached to Scylla, and exerting themselves against the immovable object that was Vortigern, it would act like a spring, tension building and building and building, before <em>SNAP!</em> It was all released at once, forcing Rider out from Berserker&#39;s grasp and sending her tumbling out to the undergrowth.

With a groan, she staggered up to her feat. Now they were back to square one, except Scylla was infinitely worse off than how they had started. This was bad. <em>Very bad</em>

<strong>&quot;Ngh... This incoherent lunatic is supposed to be your protagonist?&quot;</strong> Rider spat at William, her voice almost incredulous. <strong>&quot;How laughable. Tell me, what</strong> <em><strong>lies</strong></em> <strong>did you feed him to trick him onto your side?&quot;</strong></span>

Time she was sorely lacking.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji remained still. The world spun around him, splinters and flesh flying about in a whirlwind of mayhem, but he remained in the eye of the storm, unflinching. Untouched. He watched Vortigern brutalize Scylla with bright clarity, almost like an out-of-body experience.

He watched. Waited for sleep to come to him. Seconds stretched into minutes stretched into hours and days and he stopped counting. It became easier to breathe.

One by one, Koji flexed his fingers as if he&#39;d just unthawed himself. He felt the knuckles pop. Warmth bled into his arm from his heart, which was beating strong. There was plenty of blood to pump. Plenty of oxygen and nutrients to carry through his veins. His body felt lighter, as if a burden had been lifted and dumped into the ocean.

He felt something hard against his stomach, rolling him onto his back. He looked up and came face to face with Verga&#39;s crooked smile.

<em>&#39;The story is not done with you yet,&#39;</em> the old man&#39;s eyes twinkled with a sinister delight. 

Silent and unmoving, Koji stared at Verga as events from moments past came rushing back into his functioning brain. The world stopped spinning.

He flexed his hands again, testing their strength, and found the numbness fading. Both of them were also uncharacteristically <em>empty</em>.

&#39;...Fetch me my cane.&#39; He managed to speak, his voice sounding like it hadn&#39;t been used in days. There was no one else around to hear him, so Verga would have to assume that he had been appointed as the errand boy.

This was the thanks he got?</span>

&quot;Eh?&quot; The writer asked with a confused tilt, before having a light giggle as they stuck a finger inside their ear and rubbed it clean. &quot;What is it? What did you just ask for?&quot; He leaned his head closer, towering above Koji as his ugly visage was now impressed into the doctor&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Your cane? Really? Do I look like a dog who fetches sticks?&quot; The man snarked, a smile on their face, yet their anger was palpable. &quot;Get your own damn cane.&quot;</span>

He gave Verga a knowing glare. It seemed that the doctor was finally able to gather his wits about him, and the first thing he did with them was drive Verga up a wall with his words.</span>

Were it not for his shades, one felt like he might be stabbing the doctor with his eyes alone. &quot;Your dog is currently being massacred.&quot; He said with a ticked off smile. &quot;Frankly, I was hoping she would put up a better fight. After all, it would be exhilarating for both of them to perish.&quot; He stuck his tongue out, clearly imagining said scene playing out in his head. Ah, how poetic would that be...

He returned to reality a few seconds later, reluctantly grabbing Koji&#39;s cane from the ground and delicately dusting it off, making sure that no dirt nor dust could tarnish it. Koji wondered why the writer would spend so much time caring for his stick, until he saw Verga toss it at him with force.

<em>BONK!</em>

It collided right with the doctor&#39;s head, giving him a minor concussion as the cane landed right into his lap.

&quot;Fetch.&quot; Verga chuckled, stifling his giggles through his palm. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? You were the one who wanted a dog metaphor, so here we are.&quot;</span>

Either give me results, or get your mug out of my face.&#39; 

As quickly as it tore open, the wound stitched back up, but the pain lingered for a moment more as if he&#39;d caught a bad case of migraine. It annoyed him greatly, <em>all of them</em>, Verga, William, Scylla, and...

His eyes fell on the monstrous form of Vortigern, the last piece of the puzzle snapping into place. Vortigern was a clumsy and unsightly work of plagiarization. From its uncanny regenerative abilities to those tacky, bird-like wings fashioned out of brambles and branches. <em>Especially</em> the wings. Those stung like an eyesore. A defilement of his research. An utter tragedy. 

And now the culprit had been caught red-handed.

Koji was livid. <strong>&#39;You couldn&#39;t have failed harder had you tried,&#39;</strong> he snapped at the mud-covered bard, deflating his ego like a popped balloon. &#39;I&#39;ve always considered you a fool, William, but this is your worst piece yet. What part of <em>&quot;leave my wife out of this&quot;</em> do you writers not understand? What part of it gave you the idea that <em>that</em> was permission for you to copy my research!?&#39; 

He pushed Verga aside and advanced on Scylla. 

&#39;Drop the spineless act,&#39; he said coldly. His rage was being replaced with pitiless calculation, piece by piece. &#39;You&#39;ve already committed the gravest sin of stabbing your Master in the back. How much lower can you <em>possibly</em> sink?&#39; 

&#39;Finish what you couldn&#39;t in the hospital. Destroy that abomination.&#39; No amount of barricades would shield her from the penetrating disdain that emanated from her Master&#39;s words. &#39;Remove its limbs. Clip its wings. Burn it into the ground. <em>Die if you have to,</em>&#39; he added softly.

Vortigern stood still, staring at his chest wounds which had started to drip blood. He snarled, taking a deep breath as he pumped his chest out.

&quot;Uoh!&quot; He shouted, spurting out any dangling droplets of blood as the wounds on his skin were now healed shut. This madman was resilient.</span>

During the test run, the king&#39;s limbs were practically atrophied due to years of non use. Now, they had finally thawed. The Vortigern of now was more than a match for the entire island, let alone Scylla.

&quot;You think? Who&#39;s the one looking cool here, hmmmm?&quot; William gloated, deflecting Scylla&#39;s words with ease. &quot;I don&#39;t see him getting beat to a pulp, do you?&quot; He glanced back to Vortigern, taunting Scylla further. &quot;You wanted to be a hero? Well, here you go. A challenge that would cause even Heracles to kneel in defeat!&quot;

He chuckled as Vortigern growled alongside him, clearly pumping himself up for his next attack.

&quot;Also, I&#39;m hurt. My words for you were nothing but sincere.&quot; William twiddled his thumbs. &quot;Likewise, I&#39;m nothing but honest with my good friend&#39;s motivations. You see, he&#39;s rather fond of someone called-&quot;</span>

Vortigern refused to let William name his beloved, instead screaming her name out loud for the entire island to hear. He then used this newfound strength to charge at Scylla head on. Rider was incredulous: Did her opponent really plan on attacking her head on and pierce through the trees that she had erected as barriers? She wouldn&#39;t put it past a Berserker, but-

Vortigern jumped, rising above her so-called barricade. There would be no time to rest, as he immediately plummeted himself to the ground and stabbed Scylla in the gut like a shooting star. She felt the scalding flames of his flaming sword once again, followed by another deep thrust to her chest as the glint of the purple sword filled her eyes, almost dulling the pain she felt with its beauty.

&quot;Uooooooooh....&quot; Vortigern observed the downed Scylla, as if staring at a cut of meat. She could sense those thoughts well, since she had acted similarly when devouring prey in the past. Legs were meaty, arms less so. Chest was a no. Head was terrible.

She felt sick to the stomach at the thought of suffering the same fate at Vortigern&#39;s hands. Her body wanted to move. In fact, she <em>knew</em> she could move. But for some reason, she couldn&#39;t. Her limbs felt more brittle than usual and her tendrils were slow and sluggish. Had she already been hit in her vitals?

&quot;Uoooooooooh!&quot; The tyrant screamed, gripping at the handles of his two blades with force as he pulled them in opposite directions. Scylla could feel her insides squeal and turn as she realized that the mad king planned on ripping her in half like a cake with a knife embedded in it. The thought repulsed her as her survival instincts took action. There should be a way to escape this!</span>

He adjusted his hat before noticing the doctor stand up, as if he had miraculously revived himself from the abyss. Verga was next to him, smiling. He put two and two together immediately.

The bard raised an eyebrow, hearing Koji&#39;s incessant yapping for around five seconds before cutting him off. &quot;Blah blah blah. Do I look like I care about your wife?&quot; He shrugged. 

&quot;Not everything in the world revolves around you, doc. I <em>do</em> appreciate your research though.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Works like a charm, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; He said as the two could hear Vortigern&#39;s screams fill their eardrums. He then watched Koji walk closer to his Servant. He kept a safe distance away from Vortigern, but was close enough to deliver his words. Despite Scylla&#39;s situation, he had no mercy for her.

&quot;I don&#39;t think that will be necessary, doc. I mean, look at her!&quot; William giggled, staring at the downed Rider. &quot;It will be over soon. You might as well sit around and enjoy the show.&quot; As if to support that, William lead on a tree with hands behind his head, not having a care in the world. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji&#39;s attempt at encouragement was both utterly unhelpful and simultaneously totally typical. But, Scylla could not find it in herself to rebuke him. Partly, that was because of her wounds, the fact she was losing so much blood that soon she wouldn&#39;t have any left inside her body. But partly, it was out of some kind of malformed guilt, born of a malformed decision. After all, it was her fault things had come to this. Therefore, she was the one who would have to set things right.

But his little threat about de-summoning her did little to encourage her to fight on. If anything, it was a reminder of where the line between life and death was drawn, and how she was rapidly approaching it.

She was interrupted by another manic howl in the name of Rowena, accompanied shortly after by the dirt crating. Before she could truly process what was even happening, the twin blades of the tyrant pierced her chest, but she couldn&#39;t even bring herself to scream out in pain. She already felt like she was running on empty. Was this really her limit? Was this truly how far she could go?

<em>No</em>. This couldn&#39;t be it. She couldn&#39;t allow this to be it. She had to survive this. Force Shakespeare and Vortigern alike into a retreat. Live another day. Atone for her sins of her present life, so she might return to the past she craved.

Easy to say, but when you were on the wrong end of the food chain, it wasn&#39;t words that mattered, but actions.

As Vortigern&#39;s swords began to rip her apart, a flurry of tentacles burst from every inch of her body, each of them ending in a razor-sharp protrusion of bone. Her plan was to mincemeat Vortigern, force him into the same situation as her. If they were both bleeding out, then if nothing else, she might be able to force a mutually assured destruction. 

But as her tendrils hit their mark, they would do less than nothing. Their pointed ends blunted. Their vicious speed slowed. Then, they withered away like flowers in the winter.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">So, this was what William meant by <em>show.</em>

&quot;Surprised?&quot; The bard asked, loud enough for Scylla to hear even through the pain of having her guts be rearranged. &quot;I have to say, you&#39;re a lot cuter when you&#39;re silent! That being said, I&#39;d very much appreciate feedback on your new look. Do you have a mirror?&quot;

He was blathering nonsense, or was he? Scylla didn&#39;t have the faintest idea of why the writer was asking about feedback now. Was he not satisfied with seeing his magnum opus tear her to bits? She could practically see-

-Oh.

The moment she stared down at Vortigern&#39;s swords was the moment she realized that her body was no longer hers. If it was hers, then it belonged to a different time. One where she had yet to become the villain that she was now. Her tendrils had vanished, replaced by the frills of an elegant dress. Her arms went from monstrous and bulging to delicate and flowery. Her claws disappeared, replaced with polished nails. She felt more like a princess than anything else.

Was this a dream? Did Servants have delirious fantasies when death came knocking down their door? No. Judging by William&#39;s words and Koji&#39;s own bewildered expression, it seemed like she had truly changed. She couldn&#39;t even feel her fangs anymore, noticing that they had been replaced by a perfectly normal set of human teeth.

This was her, back when she was a lady. Back when she had yet to become a horror of the seas. It was a cruel reminder of the life she could have once had. It felt like staring into a mirror darkened with her past regrets and ambitions.

No wonder her strength had vanished. Scylla the monster had ceased to exist, replaced by the one thing she had wished for the most: Scylla the woman.

&quot;I told you.&quot; William interjected. &quot;I never lie. Not even once. I was absolutely serious when I said that I intended to make you the main character.&quot; His voice sounded a bit dispirited, as if part of him felt frustrated at this ending.</span>

&quot;But your chance has come and gone. Rejoice, knowing that you shall perish not as a monster, but as a woman!&quot; He declared, raising his arms in the air like he was some divine conductor.

&quot;Finish her, Vortigern!&quot;

Scylla&#39;s mind went into a panic as she felt her frail, human body start to bear the brunt of the mad king&#39;s tearing. Her thoughts were messy and confused: How did William manage to turn her back? <em>When</em> did he first turn her? She wracked her head, trying to remember, until it hit her.

When that lousy bard got touchy-feely with her chest...

He had been scheming even back then, playing the role of the fool to lower her guard. She stared back down and to her shock, she noticed words embedded in her bosom, revealing themselves only now that the plan was in motion. She would normally reach for those, but could already feel her body losing strength and her mind giving up. So, these were the limits of a human-like body. How ironic. For her to be defeated by her own wish. It felt sickening.</span>

Koji&#39;s rage subsided. Not because he had calmed down, but because he had sensed a far angrier person near him, causing his keen senses to go into high alert. Normally, this meant trouble, but in this case, he could sense that the target of that rage was not him.

Verga had taken off his shades, not even a smile on his face as he stared at Scylla and Vortigern with utter contempt. His teeth chattered sinisterly and one could feel that he was biting down deeply.

&quot;Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting.&quot; The writer muttered like a broken record. &quot;Move, Naoharu Koji. Move and assist your Servant!&quot; He ordered, pointing at the doctor with a stern look in his eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t you find it repulsive? Your research used to perform such wicked deeds. Not only that, but also-&quot; He glared at Scylla. <strong>&quot;That despicable Magecraft.</strong> That affront against reality.&quot;

His eyes stabbed William from afar, judging him under several perceptions and spotlights as Verga held nothing but hatred towards that man.

&quot;William, you foul swine. How <em>could</em> you? How could you edit a story that you haven&#39;t even written? Even worse, you completely changed Rider&#39;s nature. Something born in fantasy does not even <em>deserve</em> to live on our plane of reality!&quot; He snarled, a maddening glint in his eyes as Koji felt that Verga would stomp William in an instant if he had the power to do so.

&quot;Even worse, your Vortigern...They are a mockery! A mockery of the world. There was no such king, especially not one with such overwhelming strength. Just where did you grab that pile of trash from?! Hmmmmmmmmmmmm?&quot; He asked, his limbs shaking from anger and disgust. He felt second hand shame upon witnessing something so offensive to him and his ideals.

He turned back to Koji, his face looking desperate. &quot;Do something, Koji! I can&#39;t bear to watch this garbage unfold any longer!&quot; He tugged at his stache, pulling them tightly on opposite ends as he held a temper tantrum like a baby.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her eyes stared down at the ephemeral memory of her body, now brought forth into the present. The beauty of her youth, her innocence, gifted to her once more, only to be sullied by the wrath of one who cared not for it, who could only be swayed by his own ephemeral memory.
 
Had it always been William’s intention to let her live like this? Or had it always been a ploy to make her easy prey, another line to be added to Vortigern’s legend? If one had the gift of hindsight, they might have been able to take the evidence presented, the actions and emotions of the players on the stage, and draw from them a fitting conclusion. But intentions aside, the fact remained that William had been true to his promise. He had returned her to the woman she once was, if only for but a moment. And now, he was going to take that gift away…
 
…Aaaaah, how cruel. 
 
To have her deepest dream torn from her heart, twisted against her, and stabbed into her back. All the joy that should have come from reuniting with herself was taken away. With all the monstrosity removed from her spirit origin, what was left? What remained of the woman who was only known for being a monster when that was taken away? A rank of Golden Rule (Body) so low that it was practically non-existent? Some scant amount of divinity that she possessed before she fell to the abyss? 
 
Not enough to fight back against Vortigern, let alone defeat him. What could a woman, a fair maiden of a time long past, do against this knight of insanity, driven past his limits by the magecraft of a hack fraud author. 
 
But, she couldn&#39;t be mad. Even as her perfect body was torn apart, her dream defiled right in front of her, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to scream or cry, to feel rage of sorrow. No, at the end of this life, all she could bring herself to do was <em>laugh</em>.</span>

<em><strong>&quot;Your hero just killed a defenceless maiden.&quot;</strong></em> 

This was to be Vortigern&#39;s grand victory? William had called it an act of monster-slaying, the noble knight overcoming the ferocious dragon and proving their merit. But, he was so full of bluster and hot air that he could not even read the subtext of his own work. His &quot;monster&quot; had been defanged, reduced to a mere mortal by a curse of magecraft. Meanwhile, his &quot;hero&quot; barely even resembled a human, screeching and roaring as they slaughtered without a second thought.
 
<strong>&quot;You were right. Your characters</strong> <em><strong>are</strong></em> <strong>weak, lame, ugly, and stupid. You</strong> <em><strong>are</strong></em> <strong>a talentless, misguided, stupid good-for-nothing. But even in spite of your efforts, all you&#39;ve managed to prove is that your story</strong> <em><strong>isn&#39;t worth reading</strong></em>.<strong>&quot;</strong>
 
<em><strong>RIIIIIIIIIIP!</strong></em> As those final words left her mouth, the butcher Vortigern would finally finish his work. The burning blade, the purple sword, both were united in their purpose of brutality, from which Scylla was afforded no mercy. In the end, the conclusion was inevitable. 
 
Completely disembowelled, her flesh and bone mulched and scorched beyond recognition, all her most vital of organs now reduced to pulp and meat, the body of Rider could stay alive no longer. Without so much as a groan, Scylla went completely limp, her body falling down to the muck with an unceremonious thud. An ignoble death for an ignoble creature. 
 
Perhaps she would find peace elsewhere. But she did not find it here.

His sharp eyes locked on the fight in front of him, a mad glint beneath the calm. &#39;This is a formal test of her abilities,&#39; he told Verga, though it sounded as if he was trying to convince himself rather than the writer. &#39;If she can&#39;t even best an abomination of William&#39;s creation, then by all means, she deserves to perish right here and now.&#39;

For what use was a hunting dog who cannot bite? A scalpel that cannot cut? He had bought into her legend. Coveted her strength. And so he tolerated her misconducts, time and time again. But now?

&#39;I need results,&#39; he added, firmly. &#39;I need her to prove it to me that I did not make a mistake in keeping her bound.&#39;

But contrary to the doctor&#39;s wish, Scylla&#39;s fate had been sealed since the moment Vortigern had set its eyes on her. Her body was taken by the purple and flaming swords, her flesh rent and bones broken. Try as she might, her strength failed her. Her body crumbled like a sandcastle waning at high tide.

For a fleeting moment, Koji caught a glimpse of the woman underneath her monstrous constitution. Weak. Frail. Her delicate form but a paltry resistance against Vortigern&#39;s might. It wasn&#39;t a fight at all. It was a one-sided slaughter. 

She never stood a chance.

...

&#39;No.&#39; Koji refused Verga&#39;s second plea, his voice dry and hollow. His face grew ashen. &#39;I...&#39;

He felt an insistent pull from deep within him, some emotion that had been carefully chained down now struggling to resurface. White gown. Fluorescent lights. Blood-stained sheets. Alarms from IV pumps, oxygen monitors, and feeding tubes. The smell of antiseptics, bleached linens, metal instruments, blood, and despair.

He realized that he was having a bad reaction. &#39;I can&#39;t help her.&#39; He repeated in an attempt to convince himself. &#39;I can&#39;t. She-&#39;

<em>-is not Flo.</em>

&#39;-Scylla.&#39; The named tasted like ash on his tongue. &#39;Scylla.&#39; He said it again, trying to ground himself in reality. He was in Nirvana. Scylla was his Servant. Servants come and go. There was no death to speak of in their demise.

&#39;I can simply summon her again.&#39;

Silently, Koji approached Scylla&#39;s corpse. He pushed aside the smoldering flesh and entrails that had spilled out of the cavity in her body, rolled up his sleeves, and plunged his hand into her mutilated torso.

A series of revolting, squelching sound followed. Koji dug his hand deep. He wormed it past Scylla&#39;s ribcage, and went straight for her heart. He was going to reclaim her Spirit Core.

<em>I can still bring her back,</em> the doctor thought numbly.</span>

Scylla&#39;s body had been utterly broken, leaving behind only guts and entrails as her two halves would be launched on opposite sides of the forest. A thick intestine barely tied them together, but the spectacle was as macabre as it sounded. Vortigern could hear the sound of blood sizzling on his blade, as he extracted it from the now bloodied ground. His purple blade took an almost crimson hue from the amount of organs that it had damaged.

&quot;Uoooooh...&quot; The Berserker calmed down, as if his bloodlust had been momentarily sated by Scylla&#39;s death. He had neutralized the strongest threat there, giving him time to breathe and relax his muscles. He had finished her off in two strikes. It felt quick. It felt <em>easy</em>.

And despite that, his mind still felt clouded. How could he remain still when Rider had gone down laughing, refusing to feel fear in her final moments? That was-

&quot;...Worthy of praise.&quot; Vortigern whispered coherently out of the blue, albeit no one was there to hear it. Everyone was far too focused on Scylla&#39;s demise to notice.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Even William could not escape that, for he was deeply enthralled by that ending. Scylla had perished in the span of a single minute, but he had been keenly observing her to gauge her reactions to her inevitable fate. Emotions, feelings, passions...He had wrote them down on his journal in excruciating detail.

&quot;Even in death, she still cursed me.&quot; He muttered to himself, respecting Rider slightly more for that. Even so, he respected <em>himself</em> more for coming up with this quick strategy: Not only had he accomplished Scylla&#39;s wish before she died, granting her the closure she so desperately needed for her character arc, but he had simultaneously assisted Vortigern as well. A double combo.

&quot;Drama, suspense, tragedy,&quot; William chanted out loud, raising his arms to the sky as he felt like praising God. &quot;all of these were embodied right here, right now. Not only were you fierce and terrifying as the most foul of villains, but you were beautiful and tragic as the most fair of maidens. Glory to you, Scylla. You shone like the brightest of stars in death! I&#39;ll be sure to remember and give you full credits when I publish my tale.&quot;

He finished writing on his book, closing it as he revealed the cover, titled:

<em>Death of Scylla, Tragedy of the Beautiful Monster</em>

He praised her further while walking over to Vortigern, a satisfied smile on his face. Scylla was a perfect opening piece for him. His first actual tragedy penned by him and him only. There was no doubt that Vortigern had gained quite the experience upon witnessing such fleeting mortality in front of his eyes. Yes, he could say that Berserker had truly &#39;levelled up&#39; a bit, meaning that he could now face far stronger challenges.</span>

As William giggled in satisfaction, he noticed Koji run at Scylla&#39;s corpse, or the top half of it at least. He desperately tried to start Rider&#39;s heart back up again, attempting to gather materials for the next summon. William could hear the sounds of everything that would make a man squeamish, causing him to stare at the doctor in pity.

&quot;Doc, she&#39;s not coming back. How about you buy a copy to remember her, hmm?&quot; He waved his book from afar, trying to gain Koji&#39;s attention, but to no avail. It was clear that the doctor&#39;s mind was long gone, causing him to obsessively focus on a single goal.

This too, was a tragedy. Albeit, one so pathetic and uninteresting in William&#39;s eyes that he didn&#39;t think it was worth wasting any ink on it.

&quot;Hmph. Let&#39;s just go, Vorty. I don&#39;t feel like killing some doctor with a few screws loose.&quot; William motioned for his Berserker to leave, but to his surprise, Vortigern instead walked forward.

&quot;Hmm? Vorty? Vortigern? Hey! Are you even listening?&quot; William shouted, stomping his feet around, but the king merely ignored him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern marched forward, sheathing his swords by lowering his arms and letting them slightly scrape the ground. It was his sign that he had no intention to fight, but to observe. He walked barefoot to Koji, noticing how the doctor refused to acknowledge the presence of anyone but Scylla. More interesting was the fact that Vortigern could sense that something was off. This man was not staring at Scylla. It didn&#39;t feel like he was looking for Rider. His arms moved, but his soul was imagining something else.

Vortigern could understand that well.

&quot;You too...Have lost.&quot; Vortigern whispered, standing next to Koji with a solemn look on his face. &quot;I, too, wish I had her.&quot; He pointed to Scylla, which initially confused the doctor, but the message was clear. The giant did not mean Rider&#39;s corpse, but the message within. Both of them had lost someone dear to them. Both of them could never move on from that fact.

Though, he was surprised that the mad king could be so calm yet so furious at the same time. Just moments ago he was screaming his lungs out and speaking through animalistic growls, but now he was communicating through words that were slow yet eloquent. It was puzzling, but Koji didn&#39;t dwell on it much, for something else popped in his mind as he sensed Berserker&#39;s actions. It was akin to staring at the mirror, the only time where Koji was capable of looking at his own face without a tinge of guilt. Where he could stare into his eagle eyes and see the glint of determination hidden underneath.

He could see those same eyes in Vortigern too. And that made him sick, sick to the stomach. That sort of passion was reserved for him and his wife only, then why did this...<em>thing</em> have that as-

He remembered William was around. He remembered the bard blatantly admitting that he had stolen his research, but was that the <em>only</em> thing he had stolen? Koji didn&#39;t know whether to feel furious or not.</span>

&quot;Without her, your life is pain...&quot; Vortigern muttered, as if trying to comfort Koji, unaware of how the doctor felt towards him. &quot;I can help...Uoooh...&quot;

The Berserker raised his sword, right above Koji&#39;s head. He nodded his head lightly, as if asking Koji for permission to go ahead. &quot;No more suffering...At least.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The noise and commotion faded into the background as Koji concentrated on the woman. He narrowed his focus, as if by sheer willpower he could guarantee her wellbeing. His hand continued to worm its way up her torso. He felt the blood, flesh, and crushed bits of bone slide between his fingers as they wrapped around the pulpy mass of her heart.

An intense heat burned his palm, the overworked Core of his dead Servant scorching hot against his skin. But Koji ignored the pain. Moving with grim determination, he began to dislodge the heart from the veins and membranes that secured it in place.

A heavy footstep fell beside him. A repulsive smell invaded his senses. It was the stench of decay. The scent of a dead king walking. Koji looked up and found himself staring into the eyes of the undead king.

&#39;...What are you talking about?&#39; He asked. But despite that, his face showed a glimmer of recognition. There was something familiar about Vortigern&#39;s look...

No. <em>No.</em> Koji violently pushed the thought aside. &#39;Shut up,&#39; he snapped at the Berserker. &#39;Shut up, and let me work.&#39;

But Vortigern paid his words no heed. After all, he was a tyrannical king. And a tyrannical king did as he pleased. Berserker lowered his sword as he stood by Scylla, his posture solemn, as if he, too, was mourning her death. He hung his head as he uttered his prayers, his words rife with grief. The gesture was thoughtful. Touching. It was overflowing with a tender emotion that could only be understood by those who had once suffered loss.

It filled Koji with inexplicable anger and pain.

He began to laugh. Derisively and scornfully. He laughed until his sides were sore. He laughed until he had tears in his eyes. Until he was so weak that he laid his head on the corpse and quietly wept.

The doctor&#39;s laughter hinted at insanity, but Vortigern knew all too well to not judge by appearances alone.

&quot;My name is...Vortigern. I am king...of Britain.&quot; Vortigern repeated his introduction. &quot;This island. Mine.&quot;</span>

And yet...

&#39;You are a pitiful thing.&#39; Koji said, more to himself than to the baffled king. &#39;Your delusion precedes you. This is no Britain. Take a look around you!&#39;

First, the mad tyrant that mocked his existence with their presence alone, followed by the spoony bard that was the crux of all of his recent troubles. He wished that the two of them would evaporate into smoke. He even felt like saying that out loud, but before he could...

&quot;Misery, misery, misery. That is what you have chosen, William.&quot; A booming voice pierced the air, catching the three off guard as Koji heard squeamish noises coming from Scylla&#39;s corpse, yet his arm was not moving. Someone else had dared to defile his Servant, inserting their arms inside of her core.

&quot;Playing with forces that are not meant to be controlled. Editing tales at your leisure. What sort of writer <em>are</em> you?&quot; Verga snarled, his voice filled with vitriol as Koji sensed powerful mana signatures coming from the Caster&#39;s body. He had rarely seen Verga exert himself like this, for he loved to constantly stay on the sidelines and observe instead of getting his hands dirty. For him to actively participate in the encounter meant that whatever had occurred deeply frustrated him.</span>

&quot;Not only do you dare to create that abomination-&quot; Verga tossed his shades aside, pointing at Vortigern with disdain. &quot;-but you have also sullied this Servant with your insufferable antics. As an impartial narrator, it is my duty to simply observe and let things happen. But this?! <strong>Absolutely not!&quot;</strong> He declared, mana signatures reaching their peak as Koji felt a pulse coming from Scylla. Her beautiful dress started to revert back to horrid tendrils while her ladylike fingers morphed into disgusting claws. No, this was even worse. Her more human aspects were vanishing. Arms turned to razor sharp fins while her face was now more fish than woman. Her lower half started to regrow as a mermaid&#39;s tail instead of a proper torso.

&quot;Rise, if you would, beast of the deep! No longer as some phony human, born in fantasy. But as a <strong>real</strong>, terrifying creature from the Greek seas. Beat that abomination into a pulp, for it is your purpose.&quot; Verga chuckled, finally releasing his hold on Scylla as mana flowed through her corpse. It seemed as if something else had activated within Rider as well. Something that laid dormant, but had now finally found the chance to resurface. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The curtains fall on <em>Death of Scylla - Tragedy of a Beautiful Monster</em>. The applause it receives is great. No, that is too modest a term, it is positively rapturous. It was so moving a story that the audience could scarcely hold back their tears. Tomorrow, the critic’s reviews will come flooding in, and the idea of a “solemn mockery” will be nothing but a distant memory. William will step out of the shadow of Shakespeare. 

But now, the theatre is mostly empty. The witnesses to the tale have all left, departed to the auditorium to chatter amongst themselves. Only a few stragglers remain - the triumphant playwright and his lead actor, the grieving widower, and the sole critic unmoved by this performance. But unbeknownst to all, the performance is not yet over.

After all, whoever said that death had to be the ending?

The curtains rise once more. We find ourselves at the bottom of the ocean. The water here is dense, the temperature frigid. Everything is cloaked in an impenetrable darkness. There are no fish swimming about, no algae clinging to the seafloor. Life cannot survive at such a depth. All that one can find is death.

This is <strong>The Abyss</strong>. The last place upon the Earth that mankind has yet to explore. The only place upon the Earth that mankind will never explore. Civilisation may reach out beyond the heavens, across the stars, and touch the farthest ends of the cosmos, but they will never find this place. It is an impossibility that even dreamers dare not challenge. There is no triumph to be found here. There is no glory to be found here. It is the charnel house of nature, where the unloved and unloved of her creations may find peace, unremembered.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Underneath our feet are the remains of all that have sunk here, now reduced to nothing more than bones. Human, beast, monster, god, it does not matter who they once belonged to. There is no virtue here. There is no nobility here. As time passes, all that finds its way here is dragged down to the same level. Here, all is made equal with time.

The monotony is interrupted by a stirring in the waters. A massive husk, beaten and broken, is sinking down. It has been sinking for hours, but the wounds the corpse bears remain fresh. Faint traces of blood still trickle out from scarred flesh, tense muscles still twitch and spasm from time to time. But, make no mistake: This creature is dead, slain for the simple crime of abhorrent existence. Who had killed her? Herakles? Vortigern? It did not matter. The deed was done. The hand that dealt the final blow was of no concern to the dead.

It was once called “Scylla”. But that name is no longer necessary. As it decays, it will soon be stripped of the burden of individuality. It will become bones on the seabed, and nothing more.

It continues to drift down, down, further down. But before it can land upon the ocean’s floor, it is stopped. A gigantic hand reaches out to catch the falling corpse of the leviathan, and it lands softly within the palm. It is held tenderly, as though it were no different from a newborn babe. The fallen calamity, treated with kindness for the first time since its metamorphosis.

Our eyes lead us towards the source of this affection.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It is primordial. One who is older than mankind, who predates even the Olympians and their trifles. It rules the water, a domain that it shares with many of its brothers and sisters. It has no throne, but it nevertheless demands worship. It is lord of the ocean deep, the father of many, nymphs and dragons, witches and demons. It is one of the few who may trespass into The Abyss without consequence. It is the one who holds the torch of eternity within their soul, that which will burn forever and a day before it is extinguished.

It is called Phorcys. 

The god raises up their hand, bringing the ruined body of Scylla up to their face. Three purple eyes stared down at the deceased, at the chasmic cracks running along their carapace, the mangled stumps that were once tentacles, the thick bruises all across their flesh. But their gaze inevitably settled on one location - the body of a woman, forcibly consumed by her own monstrous form, shackled to it through grotesque transformation.

<em><strong>”O’ daughter, how pitiful it is, to see you fallen so far from grace. None could handle the shining pearl of your beauty, least of all yourself. None could handle the fearsome savagery of your ire, least of all yourself.”</strong></em>

Far away from prying eyes, where none could eavesdrop upon what was said. In this moment, the god allows themself to lower their guard. They allow themself to be vulnerable, not as a divine being who lost a follower, but as a father who lost their daughter. Are they crying? Far submerged as they are, it is impossible to tell. Nevertheless, they do not pause. A hand rests upon their chest.

<em><strong>”But it is that folly that makes you more glorious than any other. More godly and more human. More divine and more demonic. It is what makes you worthy of living.”</strong></em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Fingers clench and claws pierce scales as the father wounds themself. Slowly, surely, they pull open their chest, ripping their own torso apart without so much as a grunt of pain. To see a god wounded is rare; even rarer was to witness them wound themselves. But they did not do so without purpose.

As shredded muscle and crumbling bone fell away, the constant gloom of The Abyss was rebuked by azure light. Inside of the Phorcys’ chest, among the ichor that flowed through his veins, in the place of his heart, was a brilliant blue flame. Even now, so deep into the water, it burned so brightly, so intensely, such that it could have set the Aegean sea ablaze with but a spark. Fingers wrapped themselves around the flame, and with little effort, plucked it free from his chest. The god’s eyes glanced over to their fire, before returning to Scylla.

<em><strong>”My life shall be yours. May you live nobly. May be the most beautiful maiden, the most hideous monster, and the most revered god. May you be what you wish to be.”</strong></em>

The two hands of the father, one holding his departed daughter, the other holding his flame of life, would meet. The Torch of Eternity was granted to the daughter, imparted into the body of Scylla, fused with her very being. At that moment, as his authority left him behind, so too did the father fall still. A life traded for a life. 

In that moment, as her eyes would begin to open once more, Scylla would recall naught of what had occurred moments prior. Her death would feel like nothing more than a bad dream, a nightmare from which she had just awakened. Her resurrection, likewise, was a mystery to her, an enigma for which she could offer no answer. But as the exhausting chill of the underworld left her body, a thought entered into her mind. 

No, to call it a thought would be generous. It was more an instinct, a primal drive of the subconscious. All that it offered was two words, a name.

The wreckage of Scylla’s body combusts into the same azure flame. From head to toe, it burns every inch of her, each fragment of bone, every droplet of blood. But it is not a fire of destruction. No, it is as Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to grant it unto humans. This is a fire of creation. The heat is so intense that even William, a servant standing at a great distance, can feel it on his skin. That is to say nothing of what Naoharu Koji, a human standing next to this inferno of renewal, would feel.

Like a phoenix from the ashes, her body is reborn. Fuelled by eternity and further driven by the influence of Giovanni Verga, the tragedy of the storm drags themselves up. Scything talons dig into the dirt, voracious maws snap and gnash at the air. As the last of the embers fades away, the next page is turned. The woman is gone. The Monster is born anew.

<strong>”KOOOOOOOOOOJI!”</strong>

They are the apex predator of the seas. One who inspired fear in the heart of any who made their living on the water. But, the key word there was “apex predator of the <strong>sea</strong>”. Even at the peak, what could such an abomination hope to do on dry land, miles away from the nearest lake, let alone the sea?

<em><strong>”A bond forged not in blood, but on the hunt. Within the spiralling seas were we born anew. A perfection of symbiosis, a harmony of chaos…”</strong></em>

The sound of rushing water filled the forest clearing. But no matter which direction one turned, they would be unable to find any oncoming flood, nor even a sudden rainstorm. So then, where was that cacophony of crashing waves coming from? If they were to follow their ears, they would track the sound down to its source - none other than The Monster herself.

<em><strong>”...I decree it now. A new hunt shall begin! I shall sate my hunger! You shall slake your thirst! Allow me to be the gateway that reunites us! Reach through the aeons and come forth once more, my sister in arms!”</strong></em></span>

Immediately, the clearing would be flooded. Swirling water surged out from nowhere, demolishing trees, stones, and anything that dared to get in the way of this force of nature. Before long, all would be swept up in this whirlpool of chaos, masters and servants alike, dragged along by this arcane tide.

But The Monster’s prey is not a mere human. Not a mere author. Her feast of choice is revenge on that which brought about her ending. To make him pay for trying to hunt the hunter.

<strong>”VORTIGEEEEEEEEERN!”</strong>

With a roar of rage, a thousand maws, claws, and tendrils descended upon the Berserker.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern stood silent, but slowly started to lift his swords back up. If he could make a frown with his face, then he most certainly would have. Despite being a Berserker, he wasn&#39;t oblivious to his surroundings, so he could sense something foul afoot. His suspicions were confirmed once he witnessed Verga manipulating Scylla&#39;s Saint Graph, giving the rise to something far more powerful.

No, not all of this was Verga. In fact, most of it seemed to be propelled by Scylla. The only reason it hadn&#39;t manifested yet was due to William&#39;s interfering. Now that his enchantment had been broken, the seals placed on Rider had been released. Something terrible had awoken.

Stormy seas filled the forest, far more sudden than the swiftest of flash floods. The chilly ice water reached Vortigern at the waist, his blade sizzling as vapor surrounded the four Servants. He paid the cold no mind, for he was already long used to it. What he feared was Scylla-

No, could she still be called that? Even though it was clearly the same creature, she had morphed and changed so much that she might as well be an entirely new being. A true monster from a time long gone.

She unleashed her Noble Phantasm with impunity, aiming to devour Vortigern in a typhoon of razors, tendrils and claws. The king was sucked in, his flesh being gradually ripped apart as his arms&#39; tendons held on with all the force they could. It was a momentary reprieve, since it was obvious at this point that he couldn&#39;t tank the blow. At best, he could deflect it. Which is what he tried to do.

<em><strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em> He unleashed a roar that rivalled the monster&#39;s own, spinning his entire torso counterclockwise to conflict with Scylla&#39;s own rotation. His blades followed suit, creating a spinning vortex of flames and moonlight as his swords started cutting down at the mass of tendrils restricting him. He kept digging through that vortex, trying to get to the core that was Scylla.</span>

William had no idea what Verga had done, for their Magecraft did not come with the ability to revive Heroic Spirits. If anything, this was all Scylla, which meant the prospect even more terrifying. He could plan around Verga, but he hadn&#39;t accounted for the fact that Rider might have been hiding more tricks up her sleeve. Tricks that were only unleashed after death.

&quot;What are you doing, Vortigern?! Kill her now, before she becomes a problem!&quot; One could sense the desperation in his voice, but it was futile, since Scylla had already made the first move. Shakespeare could simply watch in horror as his fabled Berserker was being shredded in the distance, Scylla following suit as the two monsters engaged in a brutal dance in the seas.

&quot;...Verga, are you <em>fucking</em> insane?&quot; Spite and rage filled his tone as he stared Koji and his fellow writer down. &quot;What is that? Have you seen the type of monster you have unleashed? You think <em>that</em> is real?!&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It always felt satisfying to be correct, especially to someone like Verga. In his years as a university student, he had read on all sorts of Greek myths, for his homeland was quite a fan of those. Scylla was one of them.

Therefore, he had made a gamble. If this was truly the Scylla from those tales, then it was obvious that she would have an ability to cheat death.

He smiled once he realized that he had called it right.

&quot;Of course I can see. I&#39;m not blind just yet.&quot; Verga twirled at his stache, watching Vortigern and Scylla fight in the distance with amusement on his face. Of course, nothing could compare to the hateful and dejected look on William&#39;s face. It was oh so satisfying.

&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t it be real? Were you not briefed in by the Throne of Heroes? Various figures that we considered legends in the past, actually turned out to be real people. Feats overblown, of course.&quot; Verga giggled. &quot;Dragons were real. Monsters were real. Therefore, would a creature as Scylla not be <em>real</em> as well? I merely restored her to her glory days. She did the rest on her own.&quot;

He snarked, right before the three felt the impact of a crashing wave. At this point, all of them were soggy wet and freezing.

&quot;Much more real than the garbage you&#39;ve conjured up.&quot; Verga&#39;s tone turned acidic. &quot;Your disgusting, repulsive Vortigern. Gross, gross, gross!&quot; He emphasized with the chattering of his teeth. &quot;I won&#39;t rest until that pile of filth is destroyed and any proof of his existence is erased. Isn&#39;t that right, Koji?&quot;

He turned to the doctor, who was currently suffering a huge case of mana drain. &quot;You hate that creature as well, don&#39;t you? A mockery of not only your research, but your dreams as well. I can see that in your eyes.&quot; He flashed a wide grin. &quot;So, why not erase it? Out of sight, out of mind, as I say!&quot;</span>

He had come so far with his plan, only to be opposed by the first roadblock on the road. Vortigern was strong. Nigh unbeatable, even. But the fact that Scylla was now going toe to toe with him struck fear in William&#39;s heart.

Even worse was the fact that Verga had crossed a line that should not have been crossed. The rage in William&#39;s eyes grew more refined, morphing into a far more dangerous emotion: Hatred.

&quot;<em>Gross?</em> Yeah, that&#39;s about what I feel right now.&quot; William laughed, but hate did not leave his words. &quot;What would <em>you</em> know about trash? You&#39;ve never wallowed in filth. You&#39;ve never endured the struggles of the little men and women around this world.&quot;

He never once broke eye contact with Verga. The seas blanketed their knees as William took out a book from his cloak.

&quot;But this story has yet to end, and it will end in your defeat. This pile of trash will swallow you whole!&quot; William shouted, a pen manifesting on his hand as he carved a whole new meaning to the book&#39;s cover.

<em>Death of Scylla, Tragedy of the Beautiful Monster TWO</em>

&quot;Do it, Vortigern! Show them how monstrous you truly are!&quot; He raised his arms to the sky, rain pouring down on his body as he witnessed the fight between tyrant and titan. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

It was the most beautiful flame he had ever seen. Fiery and calm, fleeting yet strong. For a breathless moment, Koji basked in the beauty of it, in the warmth of the flames on his exhausted frame. But only for a moment. All too soon, the comfort turned into pain.

Heat. Unbearable heat. A flood of heat engulfed him, singing his clothes, burning the air from his lungs. The skin on his face, hands, and arms blistered under the touch that rivaled the sun. 

A scream rose in his throat, but he choked it back. Pain. Agonizing. Excruciating. Beyond bearing. Pain unlike anything he had ever known or imagined.

Terror engulfed him. 

He dropped to his hands and knees. Fingers plowing deep lines into the earth, he pulled himself, inch by slow inch, away from the burning body of his Servant.

Then came the flood.

Salt water doused the flames. It washed away the heat, providing only the briefest of relief before the salt bit into his open wounds. 

A helpless cry escaped him. It was so visceral and raw, weak and pathetic. In the short span of a day, he had been traumatized, gouged, torched, stung, both mentally and physically, then healed over and over and over and over and over and over-

Somewhere in this endless repetition of brutalization and healing, his nerves had become frazzled, and his composure fell apart at the seams.

He needed help. 

He needed to reset.

He needed to get away from it all.

Verga&#39;s impeccably shined shoe, now completely soaked in water, planted down beside him. His cackling voice immediately followed, ripping over Koji&#39;s wounds anew as he forcibly turned the doctor&#39;s attention to the very thing he wanted to escape from. 

Scylla. Vortigern. Resurrection. Flo. Fiction. Reality. Scornful words. Provocative words. Incessant nagging, carping, bickering, and jeering. 

Like vultures, the duo of Servants gathered around Koji, showering him in <em>oohs</em> and <em>ahhs</em> while feeding on his misery. Spit and ink flew over his head; the Writers indulged themselves in a glorious <strong>pissing contest</strong>, each of them fighting tooth and nail for the ingenuity of their interpretations over what was real and what was not.

&#39;...&#39;

Verga&#39;s ears would perk up as the doctor finally broke the seal of silence. Why, he was almost starting to worry about him! He leaned down further, so that he could catch whatever it was that Koji would say-

&#39;I don&#39;t care.&#39;

<em>Ouch.</em>

Then. Louder.

&#39;Leave me alone.&#39;

And he thought that the doctor and him were the bestest of friends.

<em>&#39;Please.&#39;</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The fury of The Monster was met by a flurry of blades as Berserker sought to keep the beast at bay. But, it was a losing battle from the start, a fundamental misunderstanding that decided the battle from the beginning. Not of &quot;Scylla&quot;, the writhing terror, but of Vortigern.

One might assume that it was in trying to cast Berserker as the protagonist, the noble hero that felled the monster. But, that was not the case. Though one would not think it at a glance, if one were to glimpse beneath the surface, they would find that Berserker was more than capable of being a virtuous knightly sort. 

No, this was not a mismatch of good and evil, but a mismatch of &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot;, in an abstract sense. The Monster was a manslayer of the sea, well known for bringing about the death of mankind in droves, especially in water. But Berserker had no such experience when it came to fighting against monsters, nor in seaborne combat. Against Rider, confined to a human vessel and on dry land, that mattered little. But with her humanity sealed, trapped in the midst of a vicious whirlpool, that contradiction was pushed to the forefront.

Every appendage that was cleaved off, two more came forth to replace it. It was an unsustainable defence. It was wholly unsurprising that The Monster would eventually break though, two arms reaching past the parries and slices, grasping the branches sticking out from Vortigern&#39;s back.

<em>Remove its limbs. Clip its wings.</em> The words echoed in her minds. The words of Naoharu Koji. The words of Glaucus. Her grip tightened, fingers digging into the bark. <em>Burn it to the ground. Die if you have to.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em><strong>SNAP!</strong></em> The sound of cracking wood would echo out, overpowering even the cacophony of rushing water. With a single motion, The Monster had just snapped the wings of Vortigern, leaving them just barely functional. But, she was not done. With her prey crippled, The Monster descended once more, a dozen maws biting down upon Berserker&#39;s true body, ripping apart his flesh and bone, drinking deep of stale blood, savouring a fresh kill. Revenge truly was a dish best served cold.

Before long, the carcass of Vortigern would fall back down into the water, looking more akin to carrion than a living being. It would float along for a moment, carried along by the flow of the maelstrom, before being dragged under by the waves.

The battle was over. And not a moment too soon.

<strong>&quot;Nnn...&quot;</strong> The Monster groaned, its massive body slumping down onto all fours. The flow of water had begun to slow down, and after a few seconds more, it would halt entirely, leaving little more than puddles behind. Her grotesque body would begin to shrink backwards, as though retreating into their initial human shape. <strong>&quot;Still hungry... So tired... Uoooh...&quot;</strong>

Naoharu Koji would begin to feel the gigantic strain upon his magical circuits lessen, but the damage had already been done. Though she had handily won the battle, Rider had nevertheless spent all that they had in doing so. Even then, if it weren&#39;t for the element of surprise and the support of Verga, they might not have been so lucky. Had they lacked those critical boons, the battle could have gone either way.

But no matter. What was done, was done. Victory was attained, and though the cost was steep, that was all that mattered.</span>

The Monster breathed her last gasp, and as she fell to the ground, all her most monstrous details faded away. By the time her body hit the dirt, they were all gone. All her pure humanity given by William, all her pure monstrosity given by Verga, all of them were long gone. Lying there, entirely exhausted, was Scylla. Nothing more, nothing less.

<strong>&quot;Ngh...&quot;</strong> Rider murmured, writhing about as they walked the fine line between consciousness and unconsciousness. <strong>&quot;It is done... Naoharu... Koji...&quot;</strong></span>

Even with the strength of warrior, the Class of a Berserker and the mythical twin swords, he was but a man. He was nothing compared to a bonafide monster, one far realer than he was. With every gnaw, slash and strike, he felt that statement tenfold, corroborated by pain. He dropped his swords in the vortex, the blades washing up on the ground, followed by his carcass. He didn&#39;t even have a torso left, nor any limbs discernible enough to be considered human. His two wings floated up to his body, cracked and almost destroyed from the harsh flood.

The Servant known as Vortigern was dead. His rotten flesh feasted upon by Scylla. Not appetizing in the slightest, but she would take anything to keep her mana reserves going. Unfortunately, her choice in Master was rather poor, as she immediately ran out of juice due to Koji&#39;s own circuits and fatigue.

The battle had concluded, with its victor clear. Through unlikely odds, Scylla had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. An ending that subverted all expectations.</span>

William kept staring at the puddle of blood next to him, all of it belonging to Vortigern. His glare showed his emotions perfectly.

<em>&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot;</em> He looked in disgust, his face turning pallid as Vortigern&#39;s head washed up to his feet. The bard felt like speaking up, but a lump got stuck in his throat, causing him to gargle uncontrollably as he covered his mouth. He felt sick to the stomach, tempted to puke from stress alone.</span>

Just like in the novels of yore, battles were decided in an instant. Though, he certainly hadn&#39;t expected to see Vortigern be devoured whole. &quot;You talked a big game, with heroes and villains and <em>blah-blah-blah</em>-all that crap. In the end, though, I feel like you bit off more than you could chew. Your character&#39;s death wasn&#39;t even tragic, nor comedic. It just...happened!&quot;

He chuckled, before tapping Koji on the shoulder amicably, patting him quite a bit as he leaned into his ear. &quot;No need to worry, my dear friend! Your reliable Servant answered me in your stead. I&#39;m sure this more than makes up for her betrayal, doesn&#39;t it? Hmm?&quot; He said, as if asking a question. 

&quot;Or, perhaps, <em>you could even kill her right now.</em> She seems quite vulnerable and it would be one less burden for you. Unless you&#39;re comfortable sleeping next to someone who might backstab you again, that is.&quot; He licked his lips, tempting the doctor and gauging the man&#39;s reactions. This trip would have been pointless without a good meal, after all.</span>

Sweat trickled down from his forehead as he kept staring at Vortigern&#39;s head, dropping his book in the sea as Scylla&#39;s death never got a proper sequel. His mind was fizzling and in disarray.

&quot;...You find this funny, Verga?&quot; The bard grumbled, clenching his fists in rage. Thoughts ran in his head. Why had Vortigern failed? Was he not strong enough, or was it William&#39;s fault? Should he have supported his Servant more? Had he underestimated his opponent? Why? Why?

Why was he always destined to lose?

&quot;Well? Answer me!&quot; He kicked water up in the air.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Verga replied nonchalantly, his face completely blank. In fact, he looked bored. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</strong>

&quot;I don&#39;t know about this Vortigern. I know about the Vortigern from history. The one from books. But I don&#39;t know <em>your</em> Vortigern. You never introduced me to him. Built up to him. Showed me his developments or experiences. His backstory and current endeavors. I felt no attachment towards him whatsoever.&quot; The writer stated bluntly, before his face hinted at traces of disgust.

<strong>&quot;I simply knew that he wasn&#39;t real.</strong> A hodgepodge of elements. A Frankenstein of tropes. An Arlecchino of writing. Tell me, how exactly did you build him? Did you take portions you liked and sewed them together, like how you would copy and paste a file?&quot; Verga broke down into laughter. &quot;I find that utterly ridiculous. That is <em>not</em> writing! Simply stealing!&quot;

He laughed, much to William&#39;s dismay. He walked forward and placed his foot right on top of Vortigern&#39;s decapitated head, treading on its crown.

&quot;You could not handle the results, that is all. This is what happens when you write something with no conviction behind it. What was his goal? What were the themes he represented? The morals? Rage is an emotion, not a message. What did he accomplish in that fight, besides shred Scylla to pieces? He is an empty shell of a character.&quot; He shrugged, feeling as if he had said something basic and elementary. Something any 5th grade student should know.</span>

He pointed to Koji, the one who had recognized Vortigern as a fraud. The one who saw exactly what made Vortigern tick. The only one there who could truly understand his creation. His audience.

&quot;You simply didn&#39;t notice because it didn&#39;t tickle your fancy, <em>you piece of shit.</em>&quot; He spat at Verga&#39;s shoes. &quot;Just because he&#39;s a sum of his parts doesn&#39;t make him lifeless. He has feelings. Feelings meant to be read. Messages meant to be seen!&quot; He shouted passionately, fervor behind his voice.

&quot;You didn&#39;t notice because you aren&#39;t the target audience. All you do is jerk off to your own narrow view of characters. Realism? Despair? Sadness? Just your sick fetishes! You know <em>nothing</em> of what makes a character tick!&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Oh, but I <em>do</em> know.&quot; Verga replied immediately, much to William&#39;s confusion. He stuck his tongue out and continued. &quot;What? Don&#39;t look at me like that. I wouldn&#39;t know what despair even was if hope weren&#39;t around to remind me!&quot;

He giggled. It was then that William understood that Scylla was a mere kitten compared to the type of monster Verga could be. A writer who fully understood the difference between good and evil, yet would always choose the latter whenever possible.

&quot;I am different from you humans, you know? While others feel happy when they help others or see others succeed...I feel at my peak when I break things or see people fail.&quot; He licked his lips in anticipation, as if staring down new prey.

&quot;But do you know how I do it? How I break people down? How I make them fall like a stack of poorly placed bricks? It&#39;s simple, really.&quot; He giggled for a second, covering his face and mouth before William would be blinded by a ray of light. Verga had unleashed his eye bleaching smile, his grin stretching as wide as the equator while his pearly whites were brighter than the Sun itself.

&quot;I tell them,&quot;

<strong>&quot;Believe in yourself!&quot;</strong>

He stared at the sky, his eyes suddenly bright and cheery eyed. William didn&#39;t know how the man had done it, but it terrified him. Verga&#39;s eyes were now filled with <strong>hope.</strong> Pure and sincere <strong>hope.</strong>

ざわ..ざわ..

<strong>Hoping</strong> to see others&#39; <em>despair</em>, that is.

&quot;Believe in yourself and in your dreams! Follow them relentlessly! Bit by bit. Little by little. Eventually, it will come true!&quot; Verga chuckled.

&quot;And what to do when it becomes true? Well, aim even higher! Find new dreams! Keep going, and going, and going, until you <em>can&#39;t anymore!&quot;</em>

His lips parted as his shining smile twisted into a sadistic grin.

ざわ..ざわ..

<em>&quot;And then you fall.&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall. FALL!&quot;</strong>

He kicked Vortigern&#39;s head, splashing water around as the head landed right next to its corpse.</span>

&quot;Fall until you reach the Earth&#39;s core. Until you disintegrate into nothing. Like a matchstick. Heheh.&quot;

His eyes gradually lost that luster, before returning to that emptiness filled in despair. &quot;You support someone, you are seen as an angel. Support them enough and they start thinking they are above others. Then, once they fail, abandon them like trash. More often than not, they will self-destruct.&quot; He grinned at his handiwork, twirling his stache with glee.

&quot;If I had to choose between being an angel or a devil, I&#39;d very much rather be the <em>angel.</em>&quot;

It was then that William realized the true extent of Verga&#39;s folly. This man was an ever consuming Sun. Both good and evil were accepted by his embrace, for they provided him entertainment. Burning everything in his path, but still burning bright. He was a creature with endless fuel at his disposal. A monster that burned everything he touched.

&quot;And this is what you are missing.&quot; He suddenly extended his hand and flicked William on the forehead.</span>

Gross. Gross, gross, gross!&quot;

His teeth chattered as the mere thought of Vortigern drove him in a frenzy. &quot;Ah, but at least he&#39;s dead. I won&#39;t have to think about that garbage for the rest of my life. Plus, his death did give me some fine entertainment.&quot; He glanced towards William.

He couldn&#39;t stop giggling. Something so simple, yet something he had clearly overlooked. No wonder he felt like the giants dwarfed him. But no more. No longer would he let himself be trampled.

&quot;Could have told me that earlier, instead of going for this so called dramatic reveal.&quot; He formed quotes with his fingers, his earlier frustration having disappeared.</span>

William&#39;s face morphed into a grin as he stuck his tongue out and mimicked Verga himself.

&quot;Of course not, Verga. I&#39;m not scum of the earth like you.&quot; He giggled. &quot;You act superior simply because you figured my character out? Laughable. You can&#39;t see the forest for trees.&quot;

There was a moment of silence. The only thing that moved were waves and Scylla&#39;s panting. The two writers stood at a standstill.

It was then that the tremors started. An ominous growling followed.</span>

The waves got stronger as a miniature vortex appeared around Vortigern&#39;s corpse. The wings reattached themselves to him, branches stabbing his back as they flapped gently.

&quot;You think yourself an elite writer just because of your realism boner? Well, let me ask you this, Verga.&quot; William gloated as he grabbed his dropped book from the water. He wiped it off and started crossing out the cover with a marker pen.

&quot;Have you ever read a comic book? Do you know how they handle their deaths? It&#39;s quite the laugh, I assure you.&quot;

He scribbled a new name on top.

<em>Death and Return of Vortigern.</em></span>

Bellowing from the deep, the beast resurged in its full glory. Swords, body, crown. Everything had returned. It was as if he had never been killed at all.

Waves crashed down the three from Vortigern&#39;s movements alone. He was erratic and unpredictable, much like anybody would be after witnessing their own death. Each step caused a crack in the ground, a ripple in the sea. He was might brought to life.

The Berserker eyed Scylla in the distance, as if tempted to pay her back for the defeat from earlier.</span>

Vortigern replied, suddenly lowering his swords and staring at Koji and Verga with disinterest.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I will.&quot; The Berserker replied in perfect English, much to William&#39;s shock.</span>

&quot;Tch, whatever. Killing you now would be a terrible ending, regardless. There would be no tragedy nor comedy. It would simply...happen.&quot; The bard reluctantly admitted.

&quot;But next time! Ohhhh, next time!&quot; He promised. &quot;The next time we meet, Vortigern&#39;s strength will be tenfold. He will level mountains, devour volcanoes and brave blizzards. He&#39;ll be far stronger than any of you have ever seen, and even better-&quot;

He glared at Verga.

&quot;He will have a plot, a story and motivations that will make you cry buckets. I <em>dare</em> you to find despair in his heart by then, you miserable old coot.&quot; He proudly declared, before turning to Koji.

&quot;And he&#39;ll surpass you. Far surpass you. Unlike you, he will actually get a happy ending!&quot; William stuck his tongue out, mocking Koji in his wounds once again before wrapping a cloak around himself.

&quot;Until then, toodle-do!&quot;

He poofed out, vanishing in a puff of pink smoke. A faint hat could be seen in the distance, far too large for its own good. Seemed like William had made a quick getaway, most likely after Vortigern.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;...You are correct. The rest of you lot can only get worse.&#39;

Koji jerked his shoulder away as Verga tried to lay his hand on him. He stumbled to his feet, slipped, and caught himself on the trunk of a fallen tree. For a brief moment, he blinked in amazement at his reflexes, which had never felt this sharp. Then he collapsed onto his knees in a strangled cry.

Oh, how he body ached. Every breath, every movement, was like a new adventure in pain. And it was only gradually getting worse. Faint burn marks scored his skin, now accompanied by scrapes from where he&#39;d fallen. The wounds weren&#39;t going away. Not at a rate that was perceivable to the naked eye.

His body felt light. Unbelievably light. He hadn&#39;t felt this <em>liberated</em> in years. He also hadn&#39;t felt this <em>empty</em> since...

&#39;It&#39;s gone.&#39; He muttered, suddenly becoming acutely aware of how hard his heart was pounding against his chest. His pulse was so rapid that it made him feel dizzy and weak. &#39;You&#39;ve used it all up.&#39; 

Between his blood loss, Scylla&#39;s revival, and her rampage, Koji had finally drained every last drop of mana from his blood. What flowed through his veins now was light, fluid, and completely ordinary. His body had shed its sluggishness. He was finally allowed to function like a normal human being.

And that made him vulnerable.

<em>You could even kill her right now,</em> Verga&#39;s advice cackled in his head. <em>She seems quite vulnerable and it would be one less burden for you. Unless you&#39;re comfortable sleeping next to someone who might backstab you again.</em>

Dazed, Koji began to drag his ragged body towards his fallen Servant, whose bulging limbs and tentacles were rapidly shrinking and returning her to her summoned state. He knelt down beside her writhing form. &#39;I should deactivate you right now,&#39; he said, reaching for the bond he had forced upon her. &#39;You&#39;ve failed your task. You have no right to remain here.&#39;

His fingers twitched, consumed by the phantom sensations of digging through clumps of her remains. His eyes still stung from the salt of his dried tears. Or was it the seawater? Or the blood?

&#39;This is for the best,&#39; he explained, before recalling her symptoms from the night of the summoning. Unlike many of the Servants he had deactivated before, the process seemed to hurt her greatly.

&#39;It&#39;ll be fine,&#39; he reassured her. &#39;You are barely conscious. It won&#39;t feel much more than a sting.&#39;

Then, as if to ease the pain of her passing, he took her hand in his.

And held it for a long time.</span>

Not only were they utterly spent in terms of mana, but the old wounds that were inflicted by Scylla had started to reopen. Verga was no medical practitioner, so his Magecraft could only heal in limited ways. Koji looked like he required additional assistance, but-

&quot;I hope you do understand that I cannot assist you further. As an impartial narrator, it is my duty to make sure that events proceed without the author interfering. You will have to make your own decisions from this point onward.&quot; The man chuckled, causing Koji to view him with scorn. Verga had just aided them in the fight, but now he was backing off? Talk about an arbitrary metric.

&quot;Whatever choice you make with Scylla, it will certainly be an interesting one.&quot; He smiled. &quot;You weren&#39;t wrong. She seems to suit you well. Both of you are selfish and not above using others for their own gain.&quot; He snarked, clearly referring to Scylla&#39;s betrayal, which looked tame compared to the long list of sins Koji had committed during his stay on the island.

&quot;I wish you two well. Ciao!&quot; He bowed, gracefully making his exit to the backstage as Koji crawled over to Scylla&#39;s resting pace. After walking for a full minute, Verga looked behind him for a second, seeing the doctor sit over the Servant, still indecisive.

&quot;Bleh.&quot; He stuck out his tongue in disgust, before finally leaving. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>
