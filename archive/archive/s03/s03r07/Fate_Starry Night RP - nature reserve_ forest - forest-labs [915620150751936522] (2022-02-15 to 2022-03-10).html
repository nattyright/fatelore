Every bird had its nest, every frog had its pond. Humans were no exceptions either, requiring homes in order to be truly comfortable in life. The same applied to ecosystems: The vastness of the forest was dwarfed and humbled by the existence of its labs, which had monitored its environment for decades.

Keyword: Had. The labs were now untouched, overgrown with vegetation and practically abandoned. The forest had been left to rot and grow beyond its established limits, leading to a thick blanket of vegetation and fauna in the surrounding areas. Not even Nirvanans were willing to find shelter in this desolate, yet thriving realm.

Of course, that also meant that it was a perfect hideout for those who had no intention of being seen. A place favored not only by the runaway investigators, but by people who needed to remain covert. Rumors started to spread around about Nirvanan Servants being sighted at the forest. In particular, the writer Servant known as Giovanni Verga was known for his leisurely walks in the wilderness. Quite odd for a defenseless Caster to wander alone in such a desolate area.

Unless they had something to hide?

Alex still wasn&#39;t one-hundred percent sure if Ruth Naomi was their target, but Alex had a feeling that a confrontation between the two of them was inevitable. A ravenous creature such as Ruth would not be satiated until she consumed everything. Thus, Alex sought out more information. A few greased palms and veiled threats had pointed Alex to the supposed hideout of one Giovanni Verga. Who, if the Doctor was to be believed, was Ruth&#39;s confidant in the newspaper business.

Alex strolled towards the entrance of the Labs. Willingly or not, Alex was determined to get whatever this Giovanni had on Ruth.</span>

The two Genevi looked out, finding a once pristine-white, now filthy-green roof that stuck out from the trees and the tall mountains of the Forest District. Their objective, no doubt.

That was the agreement after all, as unfortunate as it was for her, of course. If this is what she needed to do to get Ace to follow up on Caster&#39;s lead, then she will bear with it.

Once Ace took off to enter the labs, she turned to Berserker. &quot;Come on, Berserker. Let&#39;s do some recon around the area.&quot; Making sure the place was safe would be a good idea. 

That was just a ruse however. 

The moment Ace got out of earshot of them, Emeilia whispered to Berserker. &quot;Actually, I have a better plan for us...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Now, Ace found himself inside the conspicuous labs, searching for clues, paperwork, anything the previous research teams might&#39;ve left. More than that, his mind still lingered on William, that pretentious prick. Why would he nudge them into finding more about the island? Why didn&#39;t he tell Emeilia directly about it instead of helping in such a roundabout way? Was this all part of an elaborate plan? If so, <em>what was his endgame</em>?

And, perhaps more importantly right now, <em>did he truly set a trap inside the Research Laboratory?</em> He would soon know if the playwright&#39;s tip was genuine or if it was a hoax.

A hand on his military knife, another on his trusty firearm, Ace walked through the old building, his war-honed instincts at the ready for anything that might jump his way. The interior of the laboratory didn&#39;t betray the exterior: broken science-y stuff, plants growing on pretty much everything and the occasional rodent. No water buckets over the main door either, this was a decent start.

Although, before truly investigating the place, he needed to make one thing sure—that it was both safe and uninhabited.

And thus, unfortunate was the fact that a <em>certain empath</em> was just moments away from making his own entrance to the Labs.</span>

Alex drew their ritual dagger from their coat and snuck further in, sticking to the shadows.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Not a soul thus far. 

Walking down the empty hallways, Ace was surprised to discover that William&#39;s tip might&#39;ve been legitimate after all. It didn&#39;t look as if anyone was inside the Laboratory, he wasn&#39;t greeted by any traps just yet, and the interior looked exactly like what you&#39;d expect an abandoned research facility to look. Much like his anxiety, the grip on his weapons lessened.

He eventually took his dark shades off. The interior was dark enough by itself, there was no need to darken it further with protective eyewear. He pocketed them in his suit and crouched to the ground. What immediately greeted his sight were yellowed papers scattered on the ground. He gathered a few sheets, quickly glancing over their contents.Something about the plants and the animals on the island, reports on how their population evolved throughout the weeks. Nothing surprising thus far. Before they were abandoned, these Research Labs mostly served as a way to monitor and learn more about the species brought on Nirvana, about their habits and the way they interacted with the artificial habitats of the island.

He gathered some of the sheets on the ground and patted them together, a stack quickly formed between his fingers. There was no need to go through their content himself. That would be the <em>rookie&#39;s</em> job once they got back to the <span class="mention">#forest-camp</span>, while his was to make sure the rookie would be busy <em>for a long time</em>.

But it seemed like he would soon get busy himself. A dim light beneath the shadows caught the veteran&#39;s attention, purple in color. This was no trick of the light, <em>something stood in the hallways.</em> He got up from the ground, putting the stack of papers aside on a table. He reached for the military knife on his belt, gripping it with force between his fingers.

A soul had just entered the Labs.

&quot;...Whoever you are,&quot; The veteran spoke, loud and clear. &quot;I suggest you turn around and leave. If <em>Caster</em> paid you to be here, trust me, <em>this isn&#39;t worth it</em>.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ace&#39;s brow furrowed in response to the curious mechanical words. He squinted his eyes, trying to get a better look at his interlocutor. The shadows wouldn&#39;t let him catch any minute details, but the purple glint indicated that this person was wearing <em>something</em> on his head. A helmet, perhaps. He wasn&#39;t sure.

&quot;Verga?&quot; He responded. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that is, but I work for only one thing—<em>Geneva</em>.&quot;

The man&#39;s pride stepped up a notch upon saying those words. He was quite serious, very into this <em>Geneva</em> thing. Even faced with what was most likely a <em>Nirvanan</em>, the veteran couldn&#39;t help but speak of his loyalty towards his country, even if lying might&#39;ve been the better option in this situation. It was automatic at that point, the words were spoken before he even had time to think them through.

&quot;And what would those reasons be?&quot; He went on, curt. &quot;Are you looking for something here? Perhaps are you looking to put a knife between my ribs?”

His free hand travelled to the holster behind his jacket. A faint sentiment of animosity started arousing within the veteran’s heart.

“Depending on your answer, <em>I may or may not have to get violent.</em>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Alex felt an intense, visceral reaction to the stranger bold proclamation of loyalty. Alex had never heard of Geneva, but judging from the phasing, mannerisms, and increasing hostility of the stranger, he had to be one of the invaders. Alex’s instincts screamed at them to kill this man where he stood. To eliminate this intruder by any means necessary. Alex’s grip tightened hard around the hilt of the dagger.

A moment of silence. Alex slowed their breathing. Their more rational mind winning out over the base instinct to kill.

If this man was one of the invaders, then he probably had a servant. Since Alex no longer had one that put them in a major disadvantage if a fight broke out. In addition, Alex didn’t have much going for them at the moment. Servant-less and enemies and potential enemies abound. The invaders would be dealt with sooner or later by the others, but Ruth was a problem that Alex had to address. Besides in this moment alone, they were fellow trespassers.

<strong>”We share a common goal then.”</strong> Alex finally spoke out. <strong>”Ruth Naomi. A monster in human skin. One of her confidants, Giovanna Verga, uses this place as a hideout, or so I’m told.”</strong>

Alex waited for the stranger’s response. Their dagger still held in a death grip.</span>

It seemed the Nirvanan didn&#39;t intend to fight. Not yet, at least. Not that he particularly trusted the person behind the robotic voice, but at the very least, <em>this marked the first encounter with an islander that didn&#39;t immediately turn into a bloody fight</em>. That was something at least. Maybe there was something interesting to look forward to in those Labs, even if that thing had nothing to do with the Labs themselves.

&quot;I know about Ruth Naomi,&quot; The quaint animosity in the veteran&#39;s heart seemed to magnify <em>tenfold</em> as he spoke her name. It seemed he had a history with her, a very tumultuous one at that. &quot;But I didn&#39;t come here because of her or because of that Verga guy. As you might&#39;ve already guessed, I&#39;m not from this shithole. I came here looking for clues, hints, papers...

&quot;<em>Reasons</em>.&quot;

That last word was spoken with a particularly accusatory tone.

&quot;I haven’t found anything nor anyone yet,&quot; He went on, curt as ever. &quot;But let me ask, why are you looking for the monster in human skin’s confidant? You got business with him? With <em>her</em>?&quot;</span>

An islander called the Holy Mother a threat. Even though everything he had seen thus far seemed to point at a hive mind mentality, that of every Nirvanan seemingly wanting the investigators out of their lands, it didn&#39;t stop them from having disagreements or internal feuds amongst themselves. Even more interesting, those internal feuds could be their main priority over kicking the investigators out. Was the robotic voice-person an isolated case, or were there others like him? Food for thought.

&quot;First of all, we are <em>not</em> a threat,&quot; The man retorted. &quot;You&#39;re the ones that forced our hand, we didn&#39;t come here with the intention to fight. You attacked us, <em>we retaliated</em>.&quot;

Once again, the animosity grew. <em>Pulsed</em>. While the two kept their discussion surprisingly civil, the soldier&#39;s feelings inevitably stirred up at each word he spoke. Perhaps <em>unwinding</em> soon wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea...

&quot;Second, why would I ever get in your way? You&#39;d do us all a <em>favor</em> if you got rid of the cultist bitch. If you&#39;ve got beef with her, then by all means, be my guest.&quot;</span>

Alex then strolled further into the labs, closer to Ace. An occasional glance towards the scattered papers around for anything worthwhile.</span>

The two had been quite diplomatic thus far. Belonging to two opposing factions, barely restraining themselves for what they knew was a greater cause, they had no reason to fight still. And yet, the rude, condescending, couldn&#39;t-care-less attitude of the Nirvanan couldn&#39;t help but push Ace over the edge. Much like Alex twisted in anger, the vein on the veteran&#39;s temple throbbed, <em>threatened to burst</em>. Despite his best efforts, it seemed the tension got the best of him. He could no longer restrain himself. Alex could hear the mental noise intensifying, the sounds of hostility and paranoia too big to ignore anymore.

Ace needed to unwind immediately, else the Labs would turn into yet another battlefield soon. With what little common sense remained within him, he closed his eyes, focusing on the blade between his fingers...

The tip of the knife shone bright red, the light blinked out of existence right after. While Alex minded his own business, strolling further and further into the scientific complex, he would be surprised to sense that—

<em>The noise had suddenly disappeared</em>.

&quot;...got it,&quot; A voice rang out in the open, unnaturally serene. &quot;Go look for that Verga guy or whatever.&quot;

How could it be? The man still stood where he was, a stack of papers under his arm, observing the ruination of the Labs with what seemed to be lassitude in his eyes. Yet Alex could hear nothing emanating from him.

<em>Disturbing</em>.</span>

They could tell that the half-hearted attempt at diplomacy was about to break down. But as the noise rose to a fever pitch and Alex braced for combat, it all suddenly and abruptly stopped.

Alex’s anger turned to confusion as they stared blankly at Ace. They had met people who subdued their emotional state before but never someone who’s mind was completely silent. Somehow the invader had either blocked off any form of mental interference or completely killed any thoughts he had.

The situation unnerved Alex, now faced for the first time someone they didn’t know what they were thinking.

<strong>”Right…”</strong> Alex eventually responded. They resumed the search for any information Verga had lying around. Always keeping an eye on Ace however.</span>

It was asleep, but not dead. One little match was all it took for the entire building to explode. Thankfully, the two of them were experts in terms of behaving professionally. Alex would not kill, for it would be a waste of energy. Ace wouldn&#39;t either, for his anger was reserved for someone else.

They kept sifting through files, each of them approaching a different pile. Animals. Plants. Leftover flyers that advertised Nirvana&#39;s now defunct attractions. The amount of useful information was staggeringly low, but some light could be seen through the cracks. Both of them found a file talking about a device developed inside of the labs. The name was missing, for the file was page 42 of 669. Based on what they had found, it seemed like the device might still be located inside of the labs. Perhaps it was deeper inside?

The two kept checking the remaining documents, trying to draw out more conclusions as they found two pages.

Ace found one titled page 51.

Alex found one titled page 62.

Page 51 described a portion of the device&#39;s purpose. Apparently, it had been designed to cut through grass, shred through terrain and penetrate bedrock. For what purpose though, remained unknown.</span>

Page 62, on the other hand, was downright unusable. The device&#39;s schematics had been scribbled and drawn over, which would normally make them useless, but not to Alex. He recognized that handwriting well: This was Verga&#39;s handiwork. In a fit of madness, the Caster had used schematics as additional paper for his drafts. Alex could barely read through the Italian&#39;s rushed handwriting as he discerned a few key words. There was a lot of Ruth praise, followed by what appeared to be a sort of schedule? He saw various dates. Scribbled out, crossed out and erased. That gave him nothing, but it did remind him of his talk with Koji. Was Ruth planning something in the future?

The two individuals stared at each other, realizing that they both held pages cut from the same book. Suspicions aroused in their head, until-

<strong>CRASH!</strong>

A loud noise could be heard, akin to glass breaking. It came from deep within the labs. <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His mind now crystal-clear, Ace had the occasion to stop worrying about the odd Nirvanan and focus on what he initially came for: <em>Investigative work</em>, the culmination of which led to the discovery of a page describing an excavating machine of sorts. Ace folded the page in half, putting it away in an inner pocket. Glancing at Alex, it seemed he held onto a similar page as well, perhaps the one that contained the name of the machine. 

That person was looking for someone named <em>Verga</em>, wasn&#39;t he? If that was truly his motive, Ace doubted the Nirvanan would find any use in the blueprints of a long-since forgotten excavation device, while he on the hand most definitely needed them to accomplish his mission. He needed to get that page.

&quot;Say,&quot; He started, pointing to the paper between the empath&#39;s fingers. &quot;Could I take a look at—&quot;

<strong>CRASH!</strong>

Stopping mid-sentence, the man turned towards the depths of which the startling sound came from, a hand on his magnum. While his eyes had grown accustomed to the Labs&#39; darkness, he still couldn&#39;t see anything or anyone from his current position. The source of the sound laid deeper within the Labs. An animal, or perhaps a person? <em>A second Nirvanan</em>?

While he previously instructed that the investigative operation would stop at the slightest disturbance, there were 600-ish pages still to be found about the excavation device, and much more probably awaited him inside the scientific complex. He was too deep in to fold now, and besides, the veteran had already sort-of made peace with a Nirvanan. <em>He already went back on his word</em>.

&quot;It&#39;s not just the two of us,&quot; Ace said, a hand traveling to his holster. &quot;Someone else&#39;s here, <em>and that someone is very clumsy</em>.&quot;

The veteran took fearless steps deeper inside the Labs, towards the source of the loud shattering noise.</span>

Someone was trying to remain hidden. Unfortunately for whoever it was, no matter how well they could hide and keep quiet, their emotions was something they couldn&#39;t keep down. 

There was fear mixed with anxiety within them. A hint of pride, similar to Ace&#39;s own pride, also brewed inside of them.  Whatever their reason for being here was, it was clear that they knew that they shouldn&#39;t be here at all. They still ventured down into the labs despite this however.

Fits of madness in praise of Ruth along with various dates. Not very useful but it did get Alex thinking. What was Ruth doing for this gathering?

Such thoughts were quickly drowned out by a crashing sound. As Ace started to investigate, Alex followed.  Drawn in by the fear emanating from another human.

<strong>”There.”</strong> Alex alerted, pointing a dagger right at the spot Emelia was hiding.</span>

&quot;This better be a god damn animal,&quot; The man said, his blas&#233; voice echoing through the ruined halls. &quot;Because sure, I can tolerate <em>one Nirvanan</em>, but any more than that’s beyond my capacity.&quot;

Reaching behind it, the man immediately pointed his gun at the noisy intruder, finger twitching beneath the trigger. Surprise overtook him, breaking his composure and nearly knocking the magnum out of his gloved hands. It turned out the thing he aimed his gun at wasn&#39;t a stray animal, but a person.

<em>His rookie.</em>

&quot;...really?&quot; Was the only word he could muster, the initial shock slowly wearing off, leaving place to disappointment and irritation.</span>

Confusion slowly became to build up after hearing Ace as well though. Initially she thought he met up with another investigator, but his tone and choice of words made it clear that the other person wasn&#39;t one of them. 

&quot;Eep!&quot; Like a deer frozen in the headlights, Emeilia stood still once she saw the sight of Ace and his gun in front of her.  In her hands were notes and other pages she would analyzing before one hastily misplaced paper caused the noise that was heard earlier. 

She was caught red-handed. No words could explain her presence here besides that she disobeyed orders and went in anyways. 

&quot;...Sorry, Sir.&quot; As much as she hated to admit it, she was in the wrong here no matter how she tried to spin it. &quot;I couldn&#39;t just stand by and do nothing so I snuck in.&quot;</span>

Emotions slowly returned to him. Irritation, embarrassment, disappointment—not one of them positive. His orders were simple enough, to stand with Berserker until he came back with results. He even fathomed the idea that, should the Labs be completely undisturbed and free of danger, of bringing Emeilia inside so she could work her Brainiac magic on all the hidden information contained within.

Well, he didn&#39;t need to fathom that idea anymore.

&quot;See, this is why I don&#39;t like working with rookies,&quot; He said as he painfully poked her chest with an index. &quot;You think you&#39;re hot shit. You start getting all cocky on your superiors. You question and question their orders, until finally, you start <em>disobeying</em>!&quot;

The reprimands kept going on and on, each one spoken louder and with more anger. She had done it now, Ace was effectively <em>pissed</em>. 

&quot;What if I wasn&#39;t here, huh? What if the weird helmet guy had gotten to you first? You ever thought about that? About the consequences of your actions? You&#39;re a <em>Brainiac</em>, god dammit! <em>Act like one!!</em>&quot;

But even through the anger, his head was clear enough to be aware of his surroundings. This was neither the time nor the place for disciplinary actions towards the rookie. She was now inside the Labs, and Wendigo was god-knows-where. That beast had the mind to protect <em>him</em> in a fight, but not to protect a defenseless young woman in a dangerous forest. He shouldn&#39;t have trusted it with Emeilia&#39;s protection... no, even before that, he shouldn&#39;t have agreed to come here in the first place.

He couldn&#39;t trust Wendigo to protect her, not if she could slip away as easily as she did. The man reached for an inner pocket, for a <em>magnum round</em>. He had to clear his mind once again, lest he would go on yet another mad tangent on his rookie&#39;s behavior, or worse, attack the person with the robotic voice.

The round glowed an intense red, his feelings quickly escaping inside. He then turned away from the rookie, facing the room he was previously in.

&quot;...I&#39;m the issue. I&#39;ve been too lax,&quot; He calmly spoke, handing Emeilia the page he had previously folded in his suit. &quot;We&#39;ll <em>talk</em> about your behavior once we&#39;re out of this place. For now, stick close. Do <em>not</em> disobey, this time. Memorize every piece of paper, every folder you can get your hands on.&quot;

The eeriness of the lack of emotions in this last sentence was enough to throw off both Nirvanan and Genevi alike. This man went from zero to a hundred, and from a hundred to zero in the flash of an eye.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was obvious what would have happened if she got caught sneaking like this. She saw all of this coming so she didn&#39;t give any push at all to Ace&#39;s reprimands. She just stood there ashamed and bore the brunt of it all. 

That was only a taste of what&#39;s to come though. She knew he had more to say to her about her actions. This wasn&#39;t the place however, especially not with a Nirvanan so close by. A constant flow of fear came from Emeilia, but now it was towards both Ace <strong>and</strong> Alex. 

<em>&quot;You&#39;re a Brainiac, god dammit! Act like one!!&quot;</em>

He was right. Emeilia was throwing everything she worked towards down the drain simply because she wanted to reach for more. Though she knew deep down that she was capable of doing better. If some rules needed to be broken for it then what of it? 

This wasn&#39;t the time for that line of thinking however. She was given an order by Ace.

Emeilia held onto the paper once it was given to her and just nodded. &quot;...Yes, Sir.&quot; She didn&#39;t dare to speak again after witnessing Ace&#39;s use of his Magecraft yet again. In a way, it was a sign to know when she stepped over the line. She went straight to examining the papers to start memorizing each detail she can, discarding the last one once she was finished with it.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The woman was dispirited, dejected. Being on the receiving end of an earful from your superior had this effect on most people. She might&#39;ve felt embarrassed, ashamed, uncomfortable at the verbal assault of the veteran, but Ace knew this to be <em>necessary</em>. There were things he could let slide, there <em>have</em> been devious acts the rookie committed that he overlooked. Some things though, he could <em>not</em> overlook.

Orders were here for a reason. A soldier without orders is meaningless. If you, as a soldier, can&#39;t follow even the simplest of commands, then no matter how skilled or how smart you are, you&#39;re nothing. Such was the army&#39;s philosophy, a philosophy he would hammer into the rookie by any means necessary. Not to mention that, rather than acting on his irritation, this was done in the best interests of both Geneva and Emeilia. In his eyes, at the very least.

The man stepped back deeper inside the Labs, close to the cautious empath.

&quot;We share a common goal,&quot; The man said to Alex, sifting through the yellowed folders in hopes of finding more pages. &quot;That&#39;s what you said, right? I have no sympathy for you Nirvanans, but considering our current situation, I can at least appreciate someone who doesn&#39;t immediately go for the throat. I&#39;m Ace Colin, she&#39;s Emeilia Lewis.&quot;

The man looked at a page between his fingers, skimming through the contents before holding it out towards the Nirvanan.

&quot;I suggest we share our findings amongst each other. We don&#39;t have to keep to ourselves, and we&#39;re both looking for something inside those Labs. Seems to me like working together&#39;s the most logical way of finding what we&#39;re both after.&quot;</span>

Alex took the page from Ace and put down the one they were looking at on a desk next to them.

<strong>&quot;You should not expect similar treatment from the others. Twisted, the whole lot of them. They will seek your demise...or worse. You are fortunate in that I have other things on my mind.&quot;</strong> Alex gave that warning before going back to scan over the papers. Still glancing back occasionally at Ace and Emelia.</span>

I seriously can&#39;t wrap my brain around your repulsion to us.&quot;

He banged the stacks of paper a few times against the desk before handing them over to Emeilia. 

&quot;...you know, I&#39;m almost compelled to think there&#39;s something <em>controlling you</em>,&quot; He went on, pointing to his head. &quot;Some sort of hivemind, a psychological parasite that latched onto your brain or something. It&#39;s hard to believe that <em>everyone</em> just naturally hates outsiders for no reason.&quot;

And if that theory was true, then perhaps the odd mechanical device strapped to the Nirvanan&#39;s head was the reason behind his relatively tame behavior. That&#39;s what Ace liked to believe, at least.

The papers now between the rookie&#39;s hands, the man thought back to that page he found. It spoke of an <em>excavation device</em>, didn&#39;t it? Used to break through soil, vegetation and... bedrock. Nirvana was a nomadic city, thousands of meters above the &quot;ground&quot;. Why would it need a device that could pierce through <em>bedrock</em>?

Something didn&#39;t add-up.

The man glanced at the rookie, a puzzled look on his face.

&quot;That page,&quot; He spoke, pointing to the sheet he gave to her. Page 51 of the excavation device&#39;s file. &quot;It&#39;s weird, isn&#39;t it.&quot;</span>

The page Ace mentioned didn&#39;t add up to her either. &quot;It doesn&#39;t make sense. A Nomadic city had no use for a device like this..&quot; She trailed off as she tried to make sense of it inside of her head. Maybe the device wasn&#39;t even made given the condition of the lab. There was no way of knowing for sure, at least for now.

Once inside this place, she thought she might find some answers here but all she found so far was more questions rather than answers themselves. Well, that and a future punishment from her superior. She tried not to think about that however.</span>

An infection to be purged.”</strong> Alex replied almost automatically, a twinge of hatred behind the mechanical voice.

However, once Ace brought up the thought of something controlling them, Alex was about to speak up, but then stopped. Suddenly deep in thought.

Most Nirvanians wouldn’t second question their hatred of outsiders, it was a subject like the weather or sports. A common talking point no one thought too much about. However, Alex was acutely aware of the hatred of Nirvanians. How it ebbed and flowed. How it seemed almost synchronized with the income of outsiders and their disturbances.

Alex then started to then question why they themself hated outsiders. They hated how they riled up the population and made more noise but was that all? Alex had a gut repulsion to the outsiders, they were disgusting in Alex’s eyes. They felt a desire to expel them and protect Nirvana. But… where did these feelings come from?

Alex was no longer paying attention to the outsiders or the scattered papers. Now they were focusing on this strange new idea.</span>

Ever think that, if three different investigations squads managed to stir things up in your oh so quiet island, that <em>you</em> might be the problem? The common denominator?&quot;

Faint traces of annoyances started tainting the veteran’s heart over the course of his discourse, he was no longer a blank sheet to the empath&#39;s acute senses.

While this conversation might&#39;ve been interesting to carry out, offering the Genevi a window on how the Nirvanans saw the situation and the arrival of the so-called &#39;outsiders&#39;, this wasn&#39;t the purpose of their visit.

Ace nodded to the rookie&#39;s remarks. They were on the same page regarding this.

&quot;We might just find that device if we investigate this place deeper,&quot; He said, pointing to an ominous door. <em>The path leading to the confines of the facility</em>. “Let&#39;s do just that.&quot;

If they found it, perhaps the answers to their questions would ultimately unfold themselves to them.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The ragtag group of individuals kept exploring the labs. It was unexpected, for a Nirvanan and an investigator to cooperate for once. If what Alex and Ace were doing could be considered cooperation, that is. One need only look at how viciously they stared at each other, watching out for any sudden movements, to realize that peace was a mere lie.

They walked, and walked, and walked. But nothing was in sight. Desks and tables that should have stored files and devices were completely empty, only accompanied by critters and dust. It was sickening to watch, and even more sickening to realize that they were coming up short. Around two-thirds of the labs had been covered, leaving only one small section. Just when the three felt like giving up and parting ways, they came across a peculiar room: A storage closet. It was filled with brooms, staplers, expired milk. Seemed like it stored most everyday items that needed replacing. Another dead end.

Except for one small detail: An aged calendar on the wall. Besides the distasteful pinup model attached to the calendar, which made Emeilia blush and Ace scowl, it was actually a good source of information. The date was old, dating from years before the third investigation team had landed. However, what was interesting was a thick, red circle around a certain date, along with a note attached.

<em>Moving all equipment to the Main Labs. Forest Labs will receive new equipment next week. Drilling plans will commence in Main Labs, don&#39;t be late!</em>

Interesting. One wondered if Alex knew anything of this peculiar event. <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

As much as Emeilia tried to focus on the papers that were handed to her, she constantly took glances towards Alex. Though, he didn&#39;t need to catch her in the act to see this. Her <em>emotions</em> told plenty enough.

<strong>Fear</strong>

<strong>Anxiety</strong>

<strong>Guilt</strong>

These negative emotions bled from her like an open wound. All of it was producing quite the mental noise pollution around them. This only made the contrast between the two of them all the more strange given Ace&#39;s apparent ability to just shut down his emotions on a whim.

They stayed even when they encountered something that could be important. 

It was a calendar. Tasteless pin-up aside, the notes near the date was more than enough to garner interest from her. 

&quot;I knew it...&quot; Her words were almost silent. It was affirmation in her eyes that she was right. They found something!</span>

Talks of research into the very land that flew over the young prodigy’s head. Bits and pieces of the scattered research papers littered throughout the estate.

Such thoughts were rudely interrupted by the loud, irritating noise coming from Emeilla. The woman racked with equal parts guilt and fear.

As a matter of fact, <em>not much</em> was to be found in the Lab at all. The harsh reality was that, as much as the Genevi wanted to extract information from the research facility, the place turned out to be empty. So, so painfully empty.

Empty... except for a vulgar calendar, a lone note attached to it.

&quot;The rest of the equipment has been moved to the main Lab...&quot; The man read out loud. &quot;A <em>main</em> Lab?&quot;

Was there ever such a thing as a main Lab? Dearest Henry mentioned the various Labs on Nirvana when questioned, but never said anything about a <em>hierarchy</em> of importance. The veteran figured the Labs all worked on the same thing, research about exotic animals or flora or whatever humanity reboot project the old guard had up their sleeves. But the reality was, although every Lab was important in its own way and held a piece of Nirvana&#39;s history, that some Labs were <em>important-er</em> than others.

They would most definitely investigate this &#39;main Lab&#39; by themselves soon.

Besides the brooms and the occasional critter, there laid nothing else. The man looked at the calendar again, taking note of the year.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; He said, a painful realization coming to him. &quot;This date... this note marks the final moments of Nirvana&#39;s researchers. There&#39;s nothing beyond that point.&quot;

At least that was what the veteran thought. That the &quot;drilling plans&quot; described on this calendar most likely spelled <em>the beginning of the end of Nirvana</em>.

And, perhaps more important to the rookie, this note also confirmed her suspicions. That the <span class="mention">#forest-labs</span> were indeed worth checking out, and that William&#39;s tip turned out to be a useful lead rather than a trap to the two Genevi. She was right in believing the playwright&#39;s words, at least this one time. Her quiet words over this realization didn&#39;t go unnoticed.

&quot;...this doesn&#39;t mean anything,&quot; He clarified, clearing his voice. &quot;I still think that coming here was a reckless and idiotic decision, I still don&#39;t trust <em>Shakespeare</em> and I <em>will</em> hold you accountable for your actions.&quot;</span>

&quot;Oh! I didn&#39;t mean anything by that..&quot; An obvious lie. In that small moment of excitement, she let loose something she shouldn&#39;t have. So now all she can do is try to cover up for herself.

Luckily though, she had Ace by her side. Through his words, he knows that William was involved with these invaders in some way and that he was potentially leaking some valuable information to them. Why else would they have interest in this place anyways?

She took a few steps to hide herself behind Ace from Alex. Even though her heart was filled with fear, knowing that Ace was here by her comforted her. She knew if anything went wrong, she had him. &quot;Yes, Sir. Understandable, Sir.&quot; She kept her head low when she responded to him. She already crossed the line with him so it was better not to overstep any further than she already has.</span>

...although, the little circling game she and Alex played around the veteran was starting to get on Ace&#39;s nerves. The group had <em>just now</em> discovered a pretty important piece of Nirvanan history, couldn&#39;t they set aside whatever was on their mind for now and just... focus on the bigger picture for a moment?

The man turned away from the calendar, facing the empath with his large frame.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; The man answered. &quot;We did agree on <em>sharing our findings</em>. This isn&#39;t a charity, give-and-take is what it is. I&#39;ll gladly tell you about Shakespeare or whatever, but I&#39;d like to hear from you too. You took a pretty good look at that calendar, did you recognize something?&quot;

&quot;Also,&quot; He continued, invading the Nirvanan&#39;s personal space with a step, almost pushing him away with his body. &quot;<strong>Could you stop intimidating my rookie?</strong> She very clearly doesn&#39;t like it, and I don&#39;t either.
