                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Darkness once again fell like a curtain of soundless satin over Banshee’s eyes and all pain faded into the abyss. There in the void, that indeterminate ocean, she was left alone with her thoughts, savants of torture on a caliber far above any distilled product Caster could produce. In voices numbering 25, they lashed against their owner with whips of regret, knives of scorn and vices of self-denial. 

She had committed a cardinal sin against her existence, her duty. Abandoning it in a haze of madness and lust to feed that beast she swore to contain. It was so easy to blame it on the berserker she fought but was it not her prerogative that the joining with her master continued even as the haze lifted? Why did she deserve to have love when it could only flicker for a moment before she would have to mourn their death. Love was rebellion against her duty, preferring the company of one over the distant watch of the many.

So she walked through the congealed nothingness, seeking nothing but a forced march through its infinite lengths and stay herself in silent contemplation and excoriation of her mind and soul. Death was not hers to have, for how could her task end when life demanded death in an eternal cycle. All those that died deserved one last song to mark their passing and memory. Love would only tarnish and stain the impartiality needed.

Eventually she came to that sea once more, feeling the waters try to lap away at her earthen skin and stolid soul. The distorted sky above seemed primed for sunrise, ethereal pastels dancing above the water but the dominance of reddish hues would only serve to put her on edge and deepen her pessimism.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was no wreath of flame or call of crow to signify her old master nary that giant’s corpse to who she felt a deep, abiding tie. All that lay below her pale feel was an inky blackness that seemed to writhe and contort, bubbling up capsules of foul thoughts and negative memories. Her armored hands violently shuddered as a red bubble shot by and mocked her with a glimpse of a smiling man weaving romance with his lyrical voice. She breathed deeply of the nonexistent waters and exhaled the thoughts it conjured out of her mind just as she had done for centuries before.

The mass below replied by sending up a veritable column of those consumed so long ago, their own twisted endings as humanity collapsed in on itself under such existential threat. It made Banshee want to scream more than she had done before. Anger and sorrow mixed within her mind with her own doubts and helplessness. The pressure seemed to come from all sides, nausea and acid corroding her insides. Of course, all that would come out were bubbles of emotion-soaked air to join the rest…

The ebb and flow seemed to last into perpetuity, a hellish purgatory meant to trap the mourner of the lost with the memories she so sought to preserve and her own internal losses. When she could scream no more, she found her spiritual body sinking down into the depts to be covered once more. No soil or slime crawled over top but the corpses of the recently departed found their way into those depths with her and in every eye socket, a remnant of soul sought shady refuge or perhaps diminished memories of people trapped in muddy cells…

They stretched on for many yards amidst the muddy ocean bed with Banshee, yet their patterns were both haphazard and meticulously organized. The muddy mass they made seemed less and less like what she believed to be incomprehensible.</span>

One constant, however, was the wailing of those condemned to the bottom with her. A few sung slowly of a new life, many mumbling a monotonous dirge of servitude and a few others still silent and unmoving. She took her time to catalogue each one’s distinct song and memorize each’s soliloquy.

It eased her pain and made her slowly forget her own pains and tribulations but there was one voice that did not conform to the others, one that seized upon her private thoughts that oozed out from her despondent form and sought to drag it back onto the path destined. This was a voice she did not expect, one that she had overlooked on that fateful day and one that would bring her back to the living…</span>

The darkness was fading as the sun’s rays pierced the depths that even they found themselves. What they revealed was the body of one middle-aged woman with dirty blonde hair and a conspicuous hole in her forehead sown shut by purple wire. Immediately the fate of this woman flashed within Banshee’s mind. 

The cold vindictive stare of a soldier baring down upon her, his face scared by countless battles with no mercy peaking through his sunglasses. A skittish woman beside and behind him, her mousy features on alert for any and all threats even as her master delivered death to others. Where was her lady? The bright star of the island could save her yet from that piece of lead slowly drilling through flesh… Why did she not care for her flock? Why did it hurt? How could it hurt so much? Why was it so slow? Oh God, the pain the pain the pain…. Make it stop…. Please…

Banshee blinked her eyes and the corpse stared back concerned at her.

“You are… my fault… Gertrude Valdi, I must be the one to apologize to you. I mistook our master for the threat initially that day… blinded by my assumptions… I caused your cruel fate…” The specter of stone and sorrow hung her head in penance, already beginning to lash her mind for causing the death of a mortal and seeking ways to further increase the severity of her ascetic existence…</span>

There needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel for your work to mean something and I know there is something you want but you deny it… I care not the reason but know this…” Gertrude now held Banshee’s hands in her own, clasping them together while her body managed to marshal up a cheery but determined face, shining like a beacon of hope among the desolation. “You do deserve love. What else would be waiting for you at the end of your duty? For what else are you really putting yourself through this for? That’s what this really is about. ” 

“Now here, you deserve another chance, Banshee. Another shot that no one else could have. I need you to claim that love in <em>my memory</em>. Take my body to do so, tell Ashley to set it and my family free and find Ruth… I believe she needs you more than ever.”

Without giving a moment for Banshee to respond, Gertrude pressed herself against the servant&#39;s spectral form and the two became one. The deceased surmised the contract she must make to commit one final act of loyalty for her patron and so willingly sacrificed her own corpse to the servant to take back to the mortal world. And so fate continued to twist in mysterious ways...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Servants and humans were immiscible, or so Banshee thought. In death, the two were far closer than thought and the immaterium gave far more leeway to the fantastical than the world would normally allow. In that moment, the soul gave up its lease on the future and entrusted not just its estranged body but all of the pure memories it still held onto and the unsatisfied dreams and aspirations left behind by an unexpected departure.

It was here that Banshee would find herself carrying out the final wishes of those she should have mourned. A penance for her lapse in service but also the greatest tribute she could carry in honor of the dead. The body would find use again and Banshee would open her eyes again to find herself in an expansive basement, surrounded by her fellow corpses…

Though in wretched truth, the process was not so poetic. When Banshee&#39;s spirit had slipped back into that liminal space between life and death, sustained and mediated by the power of the Throne, her body began to fade and return its earthen components into the soil, seeking one thing: a sufficient mass to reconstitute her body and resume the duty so integral to her existence. This was not a place of natural earth but a man-made tomb and grimly her body sought out a more readily available body.

With great fortune for the servant but less for the organic frame, a suitable donor would be found and the grains of her body fell away with increasing frequency and surged into every open orifice of the corpse, leaving no cavity unfilled for long. In her mind, the Banshee believed herself to be consulting with the dead whom still had business unfinished and perhaps it is true, the area in which she inhabited was impossible to define according to mortal reality but her body would take over and soon sublimate Gertrude&#39;s corpse into a reconstituted frame and erase all memory of her body existing upon the earthen plane</span>

Even her skin seemed to have a remnant glow of life within it and it would only take a glimpse at the blond hair and outfit reminiscent of Ashley’s puppets to make her fully understand.

“You should not have done this… Gertrude… you did not need to do this…” She watched her hands shake in disbelief and bringing them up to console her face before she began to sob. “But if this is how you seek to be honored after death… so be it, I will make it so…

Ashley had thought her victory over the intruder successful and indeed, her servant had managed to slay the outsider. Yet she could not shake the uneasy feeling that it was not the end. That somehow, the intruder had never left but rather sunk into the ground and bid its time. And so it did up until the point, she felt another string snap from such a force, her fingers found themselves shocked still and pulled taut. It was as if someone had set 25 stones upon a string only meant for one and that instant before release was terrifying. Whatever terrible thing it was, it came from the basement below…

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Such statuesque beauty, preserved forever. The tightening of her muscles, stretching porcelain skin and constricting her breathing until at last it stops dead in her bile filled lungs. Ashley and her puppet watch from afar, panick stricken, and not without good reason...but how could Locusta help herself...

Her fingers grace the Servant&#39;s neck, checking for a pulse, and only feeling the sluggish drain of cold blood rolling through frozen veins. 

&quot;My sister...oh, how much of a gift you&#39;ve given me...but its odd...your core is still here...a Servant returns to the Throne on death, do they not...?&quot; 

The thudding footsteps of her golems, composed of branching and coupled bunches of fungi, reaches from behind, gripping the Servant and lifting her up onto its hefted shoulders, her limp body dangling heavily. 

&quot;Ashley, my Master, fret not. So long as I am here, none of your family can come to harm. This Servant however does seem rather peculiar...she burst through each one of your traps with very little to show for it. Perhaps...well, that&#39;s a talk for another time. I do wonder how your magecraft can work on a being such as this...how deep could your love extend, even to those afflicted by the Throne...&quot;</span>

Down to the basement they descend, the limp body of the Servant held along the mighty back of the fungal warrior, all while Locusta rode in silence, running her hands through the blood matted hair, down to the bodies below. &quot;Soon, we shall be sisters once more, one bound by the Throne, the other to my Master by a single string...&quot; 

Scores of bodies, all preserved in the cool of the basement, all draped and cascading over each other in ragged form. Each with faces twisted into horror at their last moments, each reaching and clawing for the light above. A light Ashley soon would grant them...

&quot;Now, let us make haste. Your family needs growth, my dear Master, and my sister I wish to see with new eyes...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The body of the Berserker of Tairngire was as of much heavenly quality as the promised land her name suggested. Even when that frame was gripped by horrific suffering, death brought back a certain peace and beauty to it. What little pulse within had stilled and her lungs drowned in fluid. The core grew dim and Locusta&#39;s senses would only register a hollow echo reverberating from within it, accompanied only by the sounds of the earth and shifting soil. 

The transfer to golems would mask the trails of sentient grains of sand and soil rolling off the lady lying in state. The Caster waxed on, unawares of this ebbing of her prized sister. Her treasured doll already beginning to slip out of her grasp. 

The golem may note that its load seemed to lighten as they marched deeper and deeper into the basement. Of course it could not think or register the reason for why its load seemed to lighten over time. Perhaps it could be simply chalked up to the fungal tendency to decompose the dead and weave pale tendrils through the corpse-rich earth to form its own body. On that point, it felt in its primitive heart a certain kinship with the corpse. Its master may not wish it, but one day, they would become one.

It was when the corpse of Banshee was laid down on stone did the rouse become truly apparent as that beautiful frame collapsed into dust, betraying the hollowed interior, siphoned away by some mysterious source. Gone was that statuesque face, the long white strands and the servant core that bound it all together. Dust was all that remained...</span>

Another golem perhaps? More likely it had to be just another one of those dolls set to patrol the basement to snare what daring prey may have made it this far. Yet it stopped in front of the door, its shadow illuminated in the window. The doorhandle rattled as the corpse struggled with the lock before the bolt heralded the visitor&#39;s entrance.

The servant that entered was a woman who&#39;s life ended halfway through its course but with her beauty not halfway diminished yet. A pleasant face, to be sure, greeted Locusta with sandy blond hair and calm blue eyes that death could not fog over. These were of course contrasted with Ashley&#39;s gothic tastes in clothing, a long dark dress obscuring the rest of her body. Only the hands seemed to be hidden, clasped behind her back.

The only odditites were that she seemed somehow paler than perhaps this particular body should be, likewise for the ends of her hair. And then it spoke.

&quot;Caster... where lies your master..? My... family and I... wish to be free... of this place... and rest again in open fields... closer to our lady&#39;s estate...&quot;

She remembers the day she was given her, clear as day. Now was just a matter if she should tell them all or not. She walked up to the doll and started to laugh as she roughly grabbed her wrist pulling her closer. 

&quot;You seem to not know.... where mother sends all those who die for her..... it seems you are right where she wished you to be... rotting down here with her dear daughter.... that servant was with the horror Caster.... its turning my family... how dare you..... how dare you....&quot; 

The manic smile never fading from her face as she grabbed the puppets face looking it over, very very closely as a small string wrapped around her neck. A beautiful girl indeed, a very large part of her family, the family her mother gave to her. Did Ruth&#39;s pitiful cultist really not know where the bodies go? Or at least the pretty ones? It was hilarious to her, this one girl could not speak for her whole family no way. They told her they loved it here, she took such great care of them, <strong>they told her they loved her</strong> and nothing was taking that away.

&quot;I should just scrap you... your broken... your crazy.... no way no way no way.... don&#39;t you want to sick around, entertain the daughter of your dear goddess...?&quot;

Walking back she stood in front of the door with a wide grin. &quot;I&#39;ll even take you back to her if you want, she can tell you straight up.... you are part of my family....&quot;</span>

&quot;...Master, be at ease,&quot; Locusta whispers, herself still awestruck at the dissolving of her dear Sister, her fingers sifting through the remains, the sifting granules falling through the minute cracks and crannies in her fingers. She was...gone.

&quot;...Sister...how I wished to be together...how I wished us both to sip from death together.. &quot; 

She turns back to Gertrude, noting Ashley&#39;s frenetic state, her own brow raised at the display. &quot;...Master, while your smile is beautiful, do you not find it odd to see one of them walking without your magecraft?&quot; 

Caster glides to the company, holding Gertrude&#39;s eyes with her own and pursing her lips. Today is a most curious day, indeed...

&quot;My Master is right, though. I&#39;m afraid you are not done walking this earth just yet; you belong to my Emperor now. There is no time for rest. Her family must grow...you must aid that growth. But not before my Master injects her power, fills you with her grace...&quot; 

Caster wished to hold a conversation, but her mind was directed now to the other bodies about, Locusta bending down to feel each of their necks, stretch the skin of their cheeks. The rotted scent of drying entrails and festering wounds did little to dissuade her. If anything, the stench calmed her...

&quot;...This is most unusual...you, body, why are you awake and not the others? If you are still alive, we have no use for you. Ashley, my Emperor, if you truly desire her...<strong>kill her.</strong>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The doll wished to resist Ashley&#39;s grasp but the action surprised her, revealing a grisly spectacle. While the rest of her body was immaculately preserved and cared for by the daughter&#39;s craft, the hands were griped by a particularly ugly form of decay. It was as if her hands were entirely covered in bruises  that ran the spectrum from deep violets to choleric yellows with a great many inbetween preferring shades of crimson and ochre. In some parts, the skin itself seemed to bubble and roil like a fetid patch of hot tar. The lady&#39;s face mustered what little blush it could in its undead state before yanking back her arm with a force Ashley had not seen from her puppets before.

&quot;<strong>NO</strong>&quot; the doll stated with a similar force behind her voice. &quot;Our Holy Mother is practical but she would bury us. She does not know this kind of magic, she can not be responsible for this! You- you must have learned this from someone else! This <em>corruption</em> was not her doing...&quot;

The string laced around the doll&#39;s neck found itself joined by several others rising up from her body though they were slower, heavier with little bits of of fiber already beginning to calcify into crystalline copies. This odd effect seemed to grow in response to her magic and creep onto that purple string.

&quot;*We... I mean... I did not consent to join your family... it is so... lonely... so many sounds down here... yet why do they all originate from you? Where is your... family of the living? We of the dead can not count...&quot; As she said this, the color seemed to drain from her face and slowly take on an eerie alabaster pallor...

Gruffly, the Caster raises her eyes, taking in all of this new puppet and the rather...disobedient nature of her spat with her Emperor. Was this normal? She had never seen her Master employ her magecraft, but even Nathaniel seemed to fall into line easily...

&quot;Puppet, family is the binds we make with souls, present and living. A family of flesh is more that comparable to one of spirit...my Emperor, <strong>your</strong> Emperor has brought you for the purpose of a second life, one without the soul and purely with her. Your holy Mother lost you in battle...and we get to love the remains...and yet, I find you...peculiar. Ashley, what is this? Why does it speak like this...is it part of your magecraft?&quot;</span>

They couldn&#39;t be lonely, they told her they loved her, they couldn&#39;t have lied to her. Gripping harder onto the puppets shoulders her long nails digging farther into the rotten flesh. About to rip them apart, she heard Casters words ring in her head and it clicked. 

&quot;That&#39;s not what she sounds like... the voice.... it&#39;s different... I didn&#39;t do this.... imposter.... you take her body.... she must be so scared... your scarring her monster... how dare you...&quot;

Her purple eyes grew dark as a small snicker crept out of her mouth. It dare ask about her other family..? Didn&#39;t she know better- I guess they wouldn&#39;t... since jt was no longer Gertrude, not in her mind at least.

&quot;Do you mean mother...? I thought you were well acquainted with Ruth... my <em>mother</em> I thought she told all who followed her about me... hr beloved little daughter... or maybe she doesn&#39;t to keep it hidden from followers what she does.... now leave this place.... leave my true family traitor...&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ashley sought to dig her nails into Gertrude&#39;s skin only for them to bend against uncompromising stone. It may still have been flesh and fabric yet its hardness was uncanny. All flesh she could see was pure white and Gertrude&#39;s blond hair was rapidly approaching the same lack of color. Yet her voice persisted even with this decay. Whatever was controlling her body quickly realized that their vessel was being subsumed and their identity revealed. 

&quot;No... Gertrude entrusted me with her voice, her body, her <strong>memory</strong>. You took her body and forced this poison within them...&quot; the puppet gestured to several bubble of violet liquid pooling on her skin like sweat. &quot;You are fortunate her soul has not been trapped within, for the screams would remove any illusion of them  loving you. For then their voices would bear testimony for how lonely and broken you truly are...&quot;

Gertrude&#39;s face became ever more cross as Ashley revealed the depths of her own delusion and yet tears began to well up in the corners of her eyes and render them bloodshot. A preternatural draft carried the last of the dust that once was the pair&#39;s intruder and shrouded the puppet&#39;s hands for a moment before they sagged under new weight. The dust gave way to two weathered iron gauntlets.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“I… regret my violent entrance and later deception yet it seems neither bore fruit in the end… how regrettable…” the figure demurred as what little remained of Gertrude faded away. “If you seek my identity, I am the Berserker of Tairngire, the Mourner of the Dead and Angel of Death under Ruth’s commission. And I will not be needing any lecture you seek to give on her many faults..”

“I can see clearly now… how Ruth has failed you and perhaps left you more broken than she found you… I do not yet know why this island has a tendency to attract such people with queer habits but if this desecration and possession of corpses was encouraged by Ruth… I suppose I will do this both to satisfy my own eternal duty to the dead… and my ties to Ruth,” the pale specter continued, shame melding with the indignation in her voice and perhaps if Ashley was less fixated on her puppets, she might have picked up on the subtle notes of infatuation.

“I have come here today for the corpses of Ruth’s congregation have not been laid to rest but subjected to reanimation. The rules of nature can not be so flagrantly violated. Know that regardless of what action you take now, I will take all those that died on the same day as Gertrude,” Banshee kept any belief that she was responsible for their deaths due to her obsession on attacking Ruth to herself and continued with her stern sentencing. In some bizarre way, it was as if she was holding court and doling out the appropriate measures for the matter of the day.

 “I recognize, however, that isolated as you are and a victim of Ruth’s actions,  thus I will spare the rest of your corpses from internment today. Note that I will be back in one week to collect them and see to it they get the proper rites they deserve.”

“Use this time to bond with the living. They are far better companions whatever you perceive these creations to be. Perhaps then, you will not be so hostile when I come to lay the rest of these tortured bodies to rest.”</span>
