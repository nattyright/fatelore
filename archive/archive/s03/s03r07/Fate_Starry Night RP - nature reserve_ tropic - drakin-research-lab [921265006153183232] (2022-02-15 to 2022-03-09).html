                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The days following the second attempt on the lifeline of the intruders was one filled with an ominous quiet. Caster had shut herself off from Ashley for a few days, preferring to stay on the upper levels of the Drakin Estate and foster her own workshop. Flora had sprouted from the gloom of darkened soil, overflowing from the edges of the Research Lab&#39;s roof. Vines curled and etched themselves into the drab stonework, rekindling the green that this building so desperately needed. Locusta lost herself in a fit of ecstasy, breathing in the fragrant plants and buds, letting each swarm through her body and rekindle her joy for life. She even did it nude. It was a delightful means of reconnecting herself with her true Self, after playing the part of babysitter to Ashley...

Dark thoughts had clouded her mind several times in the interim. Thoughts of her own worth...how she failed to stand on equal footing with that Archer and that Saber. The very thought that she had lost the battle...it sent her back into a frenzy. Several times through the day, Ashley could hear the guttural cries of some rabid animal, along with the thudding beatings of self harm inflicted above. She possibly thought to console the Caster...but part of her possibly suspected it might not be a good idea to be around her. Possibly because Caster&#39;s thoughts extended to more than just herself...

Locusta had envisioned Ashley as an emperor, but each action the girl took only bred ire and contempt. She even considered killing Ashley once...or twice, perhaps...but these thoughts were banished by the woman bashing her skull against the mighty Stone Pine that towered on top of the building. The bloody streams that gushed forth from her head wound were enough to clear her thoughts of such vile things. Ashley was simply misguided...confused. She seeks to ally herself with everyone against a single foe...when she has the power to do it herself...</span>

It had been staring her right in the face all along...even emperors needed teachers. Nero...even she learned all that she needed from Aggripina, a mother above all mothers. To be an emperor is not simply a birth right...it is a skill that is earned through trial and lesson. The diminutive servant squirmed restlessly, the vines encircling her and wrapping her tightly against the broad trunk of a mighty Oak. That was all she needed...and Locusta, while many things, always considered herself a teacher...

~ ~ ~

The duties of Ashley were well-known on the day the duo reconvened; Locusta had already surmised the girl to be a &quot;cleaner&quot; of sorts for this Ruth person, evident by the scores of corpses that were lining the shoulders of one of her lumbering Golems, this one composed of fungus that used a vast network of mycelium to cocoon the broken, gored, and split body parts of what the Caster could only surmise was part of this &quot;congregation&quot; that Ashley had told her about. 

&quot;...This Ruth seems quite the emblematic figure,&quot; Locusta broaches first, having spent a large part of the morning in silence while she was lost deep in thought. No doubt Ashley thought Locusta was still angry with her...poor girl. The Caster had made a vow to never let her worry over such thoughts again, but that didn&#39;t save her from the all too real concept of awkwardness...</span>

I can only imagine a run in with one of those insects...at least she&#39;s not the only one having trouble killing them...&quot; The last bit stung a little harder than she had meant for it to, but the matter was still something in dire need of reprimanding.

Smiling and dancing around like nothing Caster had ever seen before. But it didn&#39;t seem to be the kind of love struck happiness, it seemed, strange... creepy even. Her obsessives nature finally showing itself. She was an islander after all, it was only a matter time before she became like all the others. Crazy and deranged, her obsession slowly taking over her brain as she hummed to herself looking through the many dead bodies completely unfazed by their current state. 

Many of these cultist looks like normal boring people in her eyes, nothing standing out to her after who she just met... his voice ringing in her ears. Beautiful... so many of these horrid intruders were so beautiful. Compared to the bodies that lay in front of her, were these people really worth her time anymore? She wasn&#39;t sure. Throwing some of the bodies to the side, many that looked strange or weak, but mostly if they looked boring.... Out of maybe around ten the first lay there only three now lay on the tables, perfectly asleep. Though their bodies were cut and bruised these three did look much more interesting then the others. Two beautiful young girls, maybe even twins with black hair, and a taller man, maybe in his late twenties with blonde hair.

Looking towards her servant with a huge, almost demented smile, one very similar to the first thing the servant saw upon awakening. She waved her hands around, laughing quietly to herself. &quot;It&#39;s quiet tragic, but I can save them... so its okay.... we have new members of the family now at least right Caster? Aren&#39;t they <strong>beautiful?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Walking around the three tables and tracing her hands along their pale cheeks. Gently opening their eye lids to see just what she was working with. I mean they weren&#39;t as beautiful as <strong>him</strong> but that was fine, they would close enough. Waving her hand in the air, Nate walked over the two girls holding a safe with three different locks on it. She very secretly opened it and opened the two more locked boxes inside. Once finally open were three needles filled with strange purple liquid. It reeked of mana and death. Whatever this was... it was in no way natural. Repulsive even.... Gently taking the needles in her hand she walked over to the first body. The blonde man lay there lifeless and peacefully, having died for his &#39;Goddess&#39; only making her roll her eyes. Very very gently she pressed the needle right where his heart used to beat and pushed down, letting the liquid run through his now unbeating heart.

And for a few moments there was nothing but silence, not a single movement, not a sound, until a single thump. A heartbeat. Wrapping some strings around his limbs ever so carefully, the mans body began to function once more, only Caster could tell just by looking at him, his brain did not return like his other functions, and no blood came out of his wound, only small leaks of purple ran down his chest.
-------------------------
Slowly sitting up and looking around, his brown eyes completely dead, just like all the others as he gently got off the table and looked towards the pair of twins. Ashley only laughed, wrapping her arms around the man and mumbling words no one could hear. Words of endearment, of family. The words of a ruthless woman hell bent on total control and yet her face looked kind, caring, and even honest. There was no malice behind her eyes and yet her actions stated anything but.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The events of the day Banshee fought another Berserker were impossible for her to remove, persisting in their hazy dream-like state. To crack open her skull and delete it through sheer blunt force or dissolve it in pain was not an option, her nerves were deadened and her body would find a way to reanimate and repair. Her duty was eternal and unfortunately so were her memories.  The only recourse she could see to atone for her deviation and dereliction of duty was to starve herself of mana and rest.  

Unfortunately, the first day after the battle, Ruth insisted she recover at her estate and mend her wounds before disappearing into the jungle only for the ghost of Rosemary to find her prostrating before the burnt corpse of the Yew tree for the remainder, saying nothing as her mind attempted to scour her memory and mentally lash herself for such monstrous indulgence. For a whole day, she tended to Rosemary&#39;s garden and refused any fruits from the ghost to the point where her frame would carry her no longer. This occured several times over the course of the day before she finally heard it again...

The crying of the dead, the groans of corpses being moved, the last moans of the dying and the eldritch noises of those who refused to die... they were returning to her mind and so she must cater to their needs in the ways she knew best... a wail echoed from the highest reaches of the jungle canopy and stretched across the region... at last her body could move with that ferocious speed again and as she moved, she could notice a large number of the dead were moving together. She let out a curious note only to receive a sonorous response that brought that dreadful day back into full clarity.

It was more than duty that drew her closer to them, she was in part responsible for their deaths, for their unjust deaths and so she would finally come upon the domain of the witches of fauna and flesh...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Compared to the immaculate grounds and condition of Ruth&#39;s estate or the charming eclectic clutter of Rosemary&#39;s place, the Drakin labs appeared abandoned and well underway of being reclaimed by the jungle around it. Just nearing the entrance, Banshee felt almost overwhelmed by a pungent scent that only she could detect. But this was not one of rotting flesh or disintegrating bone, rather the chemical taint of excess preservatives and the bitter tang of drawn blood. She no longer felt compulsion to ask to enter. 

Instead, she clambered up the side of the building with a speed that would put squirrels to shame and dove through one of the holes in the ceiling. The interior was more overgrown than she had first thought. Copious amounts of mushrooms lined the edges of the rooms and trees pierced the roof. What seemed universal was the sprawl of weeds and vines that grew out of every eave and crawl along the walls. These she would keep a watchful eye on for she did not believe Rosemary had sole control over nature, especially here. 

&quot;The entrance is blocked? How typical. This tomb will open for the one who keeps them...&quot; she muttered to herself before stone pillars rose from the ground and slowly pushed the debris out of the way for their master. And so the Banshee plunged into the depths of the spider&#39;s lair, seeking those snared tightly in its web.

This was the motto Locusta found herself endeared with in her years of life, and so she adhered, watching Ashley intensely from her chair, leaning over the edge of the operating table. The glimpse of the purple liquid, a product of the girl&#39;s Magecraft no doubt, fills the Caster with a sense of pride. The culmination of her own hard work, manifesting into a new form of life...

Even Caster could see it wasn&#39;t true life, however; not the sort of life that she would expect. There was a certain sluggishness to the boy&#39;s movements, a corpse reaffirming to themselves that their limbs, joints, and tendons indeed could help move them. Her Master&#39;s strings seemed to lift the shackles of self-imposed weight on the figure, causing each movement to be slow and airy. His brain did not return...in her mind, Caster could see that this blonde boy was still very much dead. But to her Master, to Ashley, it was as if she was gifted with a child. 

&quot;...You truly are surprising, Master,&quot; Locusta says, the words soft and almost to herself as she looks back to the now empty syringe, taking in the acrid and bitter after-scent of Magecraft. These were puppets to outside eyes, no doubt about that...but are they truly lifeless, when someone like her Master breeds such care and genuine love into each of them? Locusta made a mental note to observe the behavior of this blonde boy...would Independent thought return? Would any higher brain activity? This was truly a marvel...

But alas, all the best innovations find some to impede them. Much like the insect burrowing their way past her plants...

&quot;To borrow a phrase from that ghastly writer...&#39;by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.&#39;&quot; The Caster of the Vile Weeds grins insidiously, looking back to her Master with a glint of anticipation in her eyes. What would Ashley do...and what traps did her Master have in store.</span>

There wasn&#39;t a way in she wouldn&#39;t know but this, whatever it was cut right through them. Turning back to the two boys with a panicked stare &quot;bring the new ones downstairs even the ones I didn&#39;t finish yet, along with the box we can&#39;t have anyone get to them. And no one must ever find out about that damn box.&quot;

Once Nate and Ally had carried the chosen once away. She looked out towards the door. It was a very thick jungle out there, even for a normal person to navigate it would be hard. Not to mention the amount of strings attempting to tie around the person to stop their moments. The closer and closer it got the more she stepped up her game. She could sense where they were inside her web.

&quot;There&#39;s only one...? How is that possible....?!&quot;

Many trip wires that triggered many different forms of traps were snapped. Pit falls, logs racing down towards their victim, even poison darts. But once they were far enough there stood a large war of barbed wires that glowed purple. These were a lot thicker then the other ones. Something this intruded would have to intentionally break. And she knew the second if that snapped she would have to hide. Nothing she&#39;s ever come across so far has been able to simply break that and not mean her direct harm. What did they want from her...? Was it Ruth did she find out what she had done...? Nonononononononononononono...... if she found out she would kill her.... not a second thought.... Stumbling around tryingbto clear any evidence that this place was used by humans, as she looked to Caster in pure panic and fear.

&quot;What..... what is that thing....?&quot;</span>

Locusta catches the scent of panic, only grinning in defiance as she grabs Ashley by her arms. &quot;Is it not clear? Your defenses have never had to contest with foes as powerful as this...why, what if it&#39;s one of those insects? Or those boys that you so carelessly gave your heart to? Or...maybe even your own mother?&quot; She let&#39;s the last possibility hang thickly in the air between them, as the encroaching mayhem comes closer and closer, resounding and pounding throughout their workshop. Caster looks to the door, noting that any moment now, whatever that was coming would burst their way through. So far away from her plants...they&#39;d have an opening to enter through whatever carnage was being concocted, but she would still need time...

&quot;...My Master, it&#39;s perhaps time I show you another skill,&quot; Locusta whispers, opening her palm in front of Ashley. Brilliant light seeps through the center, folding out into dazzling, almost crystalline rays, before dimming to reveal a set of needles. 

&quot;We can work together, this time...place your strings through them. They&#39;ve broken through each defense because they&#39;ve been careless...and we can take advantage of that folly...&quot;</span>

Taking a deep breath to calm her, she turned to Caster with a small soft smile, almost forgiving. 

&quot;We can talk about your comment later... now whatever you do, do not let whatever this is downstairs..... I don&#39;t care what you have to pull to keep them safe... Ally go down stairs, Nate stay nearby just in case things get ugly.....&quot;

The small boy nodded and ran back downstairs after having come back from delivering the bodies. He knew what he job was.

Nathaniel on the other hand only smiled and walked over to the two girls, this is when Caster saw it for the first time. This one he was not as dead as the others, there was a very dim flicker of life in his eyes, a small purple shine in his eyes as he picked up a large metal bat and turned to Caster.

&quot;My lady can you give me some of your thorns to put on my bat, to be more effective.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Banshee plunged into the depths of the research labs, every step down into the earth gave her comfort. This island may be a human-made replicate of the land but the earthen mass that surrounded her still felt like home and home meant strength...

She walked through the corridors without a single footfall betraying her position. It was only in the cobwebs she brushed aside that she felt any sense of presence. Perhaps these were strings to a decayed security system or sensors for the current inhabitants. The specter of stone and sorrow only gave them notice when one caused the floor under her to give way and forced her to sink her gauntlets into the wall and throw herself back out. The presence of the dead still beckoned ahead and Banshee would follow them to their source, now cognizant that this indeed was some sort of tomb, guarding its contents with cunning.

Banshee did not run away when the logs came rolling down, rather she dashed over them with fleet movements and giving little regard to their presence. Those walls that shot poisoned needles would either find themselves blocked by pillars of granite or bouncing off skin that had more in common with stone than flesh. Even the great wall of poisoned barbed wire would be of little challenge to Banshee. All it took was a couple movements of her armored hands to rip the wire from the wall and compress it between slabs of moving earth. Both Locusta and Ashley would finally get a hint about what was approaching as the sound of stone grinding on stone and metal reverberated through the walls for half a minute before silence fell once more.

The boulder that was Banshee kept rolling silently through Ashley and Locusta&#39;s web, effortlessly smashing through all that was put in her way. It was only when she came to a final door did the alarms of broken strings finally cease and silence truly took over, sharing its space within Ashley&#39;s mind with the growing, dominating presences of dread and terror</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A screech pierced the silence as something scratched at the door, followed by a host of other mechanical sounds as whatever was on the other side began exploring the mechanisms of the door and its locks. All of it to be replaced by a singular thud as the door shook and bent from a large mass being rammed into it. Like the carillon of a church tolling the hour, the door would ring six times before the bolts gave way and dust billowed into the room and obscured all.

 The lights would flicker, their very light being consumed by some preternatural hunger. Servant, human and doll would see figures dance in the corners of their vision but no sound accompany them. Only the whispers of some undecipherable language could be heard and never for long, fleeting memories of those who entrusted their worn and damaged bodies to the earth.

As the dust settled and the lights flickered for the last time before giving way to pure, quiet darkness, a shadow seemed to rise from the stairways and stand before them, blocking their path to retreat deeper. The room felt cold and none would feel this more than the puppets, an existential tiredness creeping over what little shred of consciousness they had left. The whispers only remained in their ears, competing with Ashley&#39;s commands, telling them to go to sleep in a soft, comforting tone.

The lights returned and the figure remained where it was. Its stature was feminine even as its form remained obscured by a long dark green cloak and a heavy, white dress underneath. Its face was hidden yet long frayed yet rolling strands of silken hair rested on her shoulders and chest. The smell of freshly dug  soil, a hint of wood smoke and expired flowers was inescapable.

It paid little attention to the doll-like pair, its gaze firmly fixed upon the form of Nathaniel. A gauntlet stretched out towards him as she walked past the two. 

&quot;Come to me, I know what keeps you from your sleep... Let me remove that poison from you...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It would take some time before her Dark Worms and Golems could find their wag into the underground. The hole this...thing made would expedite the process, but it was still quite a bother. Locusta faces a cold reality...the sheer, raw emotion radiating from this being. This was a Servant...a power and calm befitting that of a slumbering Berserker. Such a battle...well, it was out of her hands. She could sense that a well aimed blow could puncture her very frame and leave her as but a mangled corpse. 

So it would be forgivable should Locusta wish to back down from such an encounter...her Master could easily create more of these dolls, and surely they could better prepare themselves for such an invasion. If one Servant found them...who knows how many more could make their way here...

But 2 failures is too many. The Caster&#39;s mind buzzes once more as a flurry of thoughts swirl through it, half her own and half concocted in the depths of her mania. No...Ashley treasures these things. If they were to be destroyed, rejected from existence by this thing...her Master would never smile again. 

&quot;My, my~&quot; Caster whispers, the darkened brow shadowed by the brim of her hat, smiling manically as she considers her options. Fight...deceive...desecrate...

&quot;Never have I seen such rude and obstinate manners...you should introduce yourself to the host when entering a domicile, Servant. Especially when you went through the callous effort of bludgeoning the door off its hinges~&quot; 

Sweeping her arm through the air, a dull, sickly green glow manifests between Nathaniel and the Servant as a shower of needles erupt from the floor, threatening to eviscerate her flesh. Her Master simply has to work her own magic with her...

&quot;Look at me, Servant. If you&#39;re looking to undo my Master&#39;s loving work, I can&#39;t abide that. If you&#39;re looking for poison, I can oblige you~&quot; <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Rewritten Eagan, Princess Bride</span> <span class="mention" title="CookieOmega#1777">@Cookie</span></span>

A deep overwhelming panic started to emerge as she pulled Nate back from the servant not with string but with her hand. She looked towards her with a manic expression, not her normal smile though, this was pure fear. 

&quot;You can&#39;t take him... not again...&quot;

Mumbling under her breath she turned to Locusta, she looked horribly ill even over this woman&#39;s request. Raising her hands a few strings grabbed the servant just pulling her back but snapped from just the shear strength compared to hers, but all she needed was a bit of space. 

Holding onto the dolls arm she turned back to the servant, the mania now looking more like rage, something non of the dolls or Caster had ever seen from this girl. Stepping forward, feeling the darkness around her and yet she didn&#39;t care.

&quot;STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY! HOW DARE YOU HURT THEM!&quot;</span>

She even paid the needles no heed, stepping on a few of them with not even a flinch to satisfy the manic caster as they penetrated the specter&#39;s foot. Her unseen gaze was still fixated upon the body of Nathaniel and Ashley&#39;s silken wires would do nothing to arrest her advance. Only her positioning between prey and predator would make the specter pause.

&quot;Your... family?&quot; It asked and tilted its head to the side, angling its body to try and see the puppet behind her.

&quot;This place smells of a tomb. If you have come to remember a loved one, to disturb their eternal rest is to disrespect them,&quot; its voice grew stern and edged like jagged stone. &quot;Why does the corpse behind you speak and move? This reeks of magic. If you care for your family member, it would be best to hand them over and remedy the disease that plagues their mind...&quot;

&quot;As for you, little one...&quot; The specter turned to face Locusta, giving Ashley a glimpse of a face bleached by deathly white pallor  except for the eyes. &quot;You are of an affliction not unlike mine. I will see you wake up from your unnatural dream in due time...&quot;

Powered on energies far beyond her own comprehension, or being empowered by filthy bards. It was a series of conflicts that almost seemed tailor made to humiliate her...but this one...she was different. She talked of the stench of death, and yet it hung around her like an ethereal cloak. It&#39;s scent...it&#39;s aroma, it&#39;s aura...it was....<em>interesting.</em>

&quot;Oh, is that a promise, my dear? How very generous...but I rather like this dream. I have a new Emperor to shape into a beacon for this world, and a new island that yearns for the touch of my mistress, Hecate. But, if you wish for the calm of the Earth, I can return you to it...&quot;

She eyes the needles plunged through the spectre&#39;s lower feet, watching the dull red blood seep out slowly from her wounds. So stagnant...so dead and cold...

<em>Locusta wanted to see more.</em></span>

Caster feels the grinding of dirt and rubble as her minions begins their descent...they would be here soon...would she survive long enough? Normally a cold fear of failure would grip her, but this glare...those eyes...those dead, listless eyes...they stirred a fire in the Caster herself...

&quot;My Master brings beauty to the dead, and brings life not to the soul, but to the flesh. Would you deny the resurgence of a second life? Of shells right to identity, not unlike you and I, sister?&quot; Locusta wouldn&#39;t give the intruder a chance to answer, as a nother flurry of needles Swarm from above the other Servant, seeking to blanket and skewer her in a shadow of death. <em>My Master, show my work in action. You must fight...you must defend your subjects, your family. I can only do so much to make you the Emperor you truly are...seize your right to sew the seeds of life...become ruler of your domain, and pluck this...</em>beautiful* creature with my blade...* She whispers to herself, hoping deeply that her Master would take the initiative.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Banshee had given little thought to the needles she had stepped on, they were just another ineffectual barrier to make her reconsider her step. She may have many burdens to deal with but the sensation of pain was not one of them. Nor did she care when her cold blood merged with the corrupted liquid within. Anyone who tried to poison a corpse and one so intimately tied with the earth was a fool.

Yet why could she still feel its unwanted presence worm its way up her legs and coil around her heart? Even as she believed herself dead, that artificial heart still spread that filth throughout her body. As if she was as worn down as the day she fought the odd ship homunculus, her vision began to blur at the periphery&gt;

&quot;You may not wish it to end but it will one day soon. It is best done by my merciful hands than what other horrors have been summoned on this island, especially those that warp the mind. Move aside before I bring that appointed time closer...&quot; she said, darting to the side before grabbing Nathaniel&#39;s arm and jerking him out of Ashley&#39;s grasp.  &quot;Body of the departed, I do not bear arms against you but all the same, I must remove the unnatural control that controls your body so...&quot;

The specter stood over the puppet, armored hands reaching down to clench its neck. Yet as she did so, Nathaniel struck out, scoring her face with its coat of thorns and clattering bone. The Banshee let out a scream in surprise as she found her pristine white skin stained with crimson ichor. Buildings of the earth were to strengthen her meager frame yet that had been removed and even constructs had found a way...

All could now see her full face, a woman who had once been of great beauty and vitality, now forever drained of all color by death&#39;s embrace. Yet what stuck out was not her bloodstained face but rather her eyes that were nearly the same color of the wounds.</span>

Where once they might have had difficulty, the metal now skewered cloth and flesh alike with ease. Several buried themselves deep in her neck and chest, barely visible with how far they dug. One blotted out an eye and truly made it the color of blood.

For once, Banshee could feel pain, that cursed fluid entering her system at too many points to absorb with her earthen flesh. It was as if her heart wanted to rot out from her chest and spill onto the floor in a soupy mixture of entrails and foul miasma. She willed the earth to protect her against the rest but only the dust would answer her call, blowing a few off course and scatter to the ground.

That evil feeling, that mounting nausea gripped her throat and made her want to retch more than she had ever done so when alive. All that would come out was a near-deafening cry of agony that sent a violent shiver down her body just as it sought to do for the human, the servant and the reanimated corpses. All would feel the pain of a slow death brought upon my the tools that only the Unseelie Court and the murderers of the world resorted to. 

She wanted to speak against her tormentors but in that moment, too many words clogged her throat, too many final memories of the damned drowned out her thoughts, so she knelt in silence, puncuated by her heaving and small darkened globules of mud dripping off her body, rich with the scent of pain and poison.

Locusta found plenty in this world and in this life beauteous, so long as it paid tribute to her darling mistress or her Emperor, but none brings such joy as the art of watching a body shut down. Even a Servant couldn&#39;t resist her fragrant concoction, the bitter scent wrinkling Locusta&#39;s nose as she breathes in that acrid aroma. Rot, gifted by the cap of life.

&quot;You...look at you...you&#39;re even more beautiful now...&quot; 

Locusta crosses to the shredded corpse, kneeling before the victim and soaking in the very decomposition of her form; her pallid face blanched of color, with only the scarlet rivulets of blood painting her porcelain cheeks. The Caster&#39;s fingers tremble as she caresses the Servant, dancing across the curve of her face and even running through the oceanic strands of her hair. Her smile peeking through, her eyes flashing that bright, emerald stare as she looks deeply into this Servant&#39;s sunken face. By goddess, she is...divine this way...

&quot;...Oh, how lovely it is to see it again. My dear Master...my sister Servant...to relish the slow drip of life as it fades away...by my own hand...&quot; She speaks, slowly, lips softly wrapping around each syllable as she lowers her face, almost drinking in each shallow, choked breath...

This intruder saw her pupils dilate, a surge of excitement as the cat drives the final stake of its claws into its victim. A needle jams into her abdomen, a clean stave through the middle as Locusta brings her face closer, lips but a breath apart as she utters, &quot;Its intoxicating...My sister, thank you. I so love you for what you have given me...&quot; 

Blood billows forth as a stream, coating and dousing Locusta&#39;s hands in a sheen of dim, almost black sludge. It was cold...chills practically stiffening the tendons as Locusta pulls her blade back roughly, catching her Sister by the neck and pulling her in a deep embrace. Her chest soaks through as she holds the limb body close. &quot;I love you, sister...I love you...&quot;</span>

But now simple poison was enough to bring her to her knees? That was not acceptable. To give in now would be to derelict her duty she was bound to... just as she had done not too long ago.

Her body was undeniably corrupted but she did not come to see the poison as that corruption. That was what would wipe the slate clean so to speak. It was the murderer, the foul witch that was her master that was sapping her strength and bending her will away from her devotion to the dead. She was a slow and insidious poison that addled her mind. Perhaps this death would wipe away those memories and give her the clarity she needed.

&quot;Beauty... is irrelevant to my mission here... The dead have no need for it... and neither do I... to accomplish my duty,&quot; the dying woman before Locusta said softly, the poison constricting her lungs and sapping what strength remained while she continued to eye the ground, watching the droplets pool beneath her. 

&quot;To comfort the dying... one third of my prerogative... yet how do I find... an assassin embracing her victim... with... with... this twisted love...&quot; She now brought her one intact eye to bear on her killer, bloodshot from days of mourning and etched with darkened veins pulsing with Locusta&#39;s sisterly love. Banshee found herself dying her lips black as blood mixed with poison and ichor with flesh and all came heaving out. Then the caster would find herself blanketed in a cold, heavy presence as she willingly held the berserker close. &quot;Such a twisted island... undeserving of anyone&#39;s... love...&quot;

&quot;I do not deserve... love...&quot; 

Banshee&#39;s eye fluttered shut and her whole body fell slumped against Locusta and then did she truly feel cold and empty. A beautiful doll in ruined repose, brought low by the unspeaking caretakers of the dead and that which gave them more to feed upon.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While the two servants were fighting, Ashley had pulled Nate back from the fight in a total panic, shaking and stammering under her breath, they couldn&#39;t tell at that moment that something in this poor little girl snapped. A small little snapping sound of wires around the room breaking as she turned to the now limp body. Walking towards it, her long purple hair covering her eyes, some pieces stuck to her face. She gently traced her hands along the now limb servants cheek. There was a bit of sadness in her manic eyes as she looked down. 

&quot;You... tried to take him away from me.... how dare you touch my people you animal.... you don&#39;t understand.... no one understands.....&quot;

She kicked the limp body and turned to Caster. Her face was dark and serious, as she walked over very slowly, but it seemed dangerous as she grabbed Caster by the shoulder and squeezing it tightly. Her same smile from the start, the manic smile the radiated love, compassion and obsession. The smile of a manic ruler as many of the other non poison strings hanging from the roof. Grabbing one of the strings and pulling herself up just in case, she turned to the new hole in her door.

But all she knew is this was a threat, she knew she had an amazing servant. A protector for her people but why did they keep screaming to her, she knew they wanted the door closed but she couldn&#39;t do that now. Not yet not until she knew what this creature wanted from her, and that taking away Nate was not an option, no one would take him away, never again will she lose another.</span>

He in danger from Ashley, trying to figure out what it meant. Looking down at his hands for a moment and trying to move them, just for a moment he couldn&#39;t feel his figures, they wouldn&#39;t move but he shook that thought out of his head. Looking up to where Ashley was he grabbed one of the lose strings and pulled himself up next to her looking down at the servants in silence. It was killing him, what the hell was going on here, why did she want to hurt their family so badly... like some kind of monster.</span>
