Any staff or researchers who worked at the labs seem to be long gone. Instead, the labs have been inhabited by other Nirvana islanders. Some wonder whether or not the city’s own citizens still care for their world famous laboratories…</div>

Driven unnaturally wild and hostile over the last few days. Alex stood before the front door of the run down building, largely ignorant of the biting cold, arm still in a sling.

A part of Alex clawed at the back of their mind. Urging them to turn back and indulge in their base desires, to silence the rancorous noise plaguing this land. Indeed, Alex had not acted against Ruth out of any goodness in their heart. No, it was simply to shut her up. No different than Ruth herself indulging in her hunger.

However, a part of Alex&#39;s mind stirred against it. The uncertainty of what was going on with Nirvana, the connection Alex&#39;s parents had to it, the question of what was dug up that fateful day. Dissonant whispers gnawed at Alex&#39;s very foundation. Something that couldn&#39;t be quieted until Alex found the source.

And so, Alex entered the building and headed towards the Main Dig Site.</span>

As the cold wind hit against his coat Allen&#39;s body couldn&#39;t help but shiver at the cold air slide past the coat and his thin clothes and hit his skin.

His eyes began to water as he take a step after another, it was taking a big restrain on his part to avoid using his flames to keep himself warm. He had been using them to help Ronda fix the ship, well she still did most of the work but it was something he needed to consider. In unfamiliar territory, he really wanted to avoid running out of juice at the worse possible moment. 

&quot;Hey Graf how you faring with the cold.&quot; he asked as he turned around to see his servant before his crimson eyes turned towards the building in front of them. 

Boogey had been searching for this man called Koji but in her search she had found something else, she had been kind enough to let Allen know  and that had lead to their current incursion. They needed to get out of this god forsaken island but they had a job to do, but more than that Allen needed to keep himself busy, being busy make it easier to not think to hard and right  now thinking was scary. Graf probably noticed as well but he had looked troubled, though had began to pop into his mind, thoughts he didn&#39;t like nor were proper for him at all. 

It wasnt hard to put the dots together, the worse things looked the worse he felt and he began to feel he was running out of time.  He didn&#39;t knew what was happening nor how to deal with it, but coming here was a good as a lead as any. It was better than just standing still and waiting at the very least.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It felt unnatural, to see white snow on a blood red backdrop. The sky was a deep crimson, which made the layers of white even the more odd to look at. Alex was never one for sightseeing, but even he couldn&#39;t help but notice the strange happenings around the island in the past two days. Plants festering some disgusting, infectious substance that threatened to corrupt anything in its vicinity. He was wise enough to avoid it, but he feared that it might become a problem in the future.

Even worse, he feared that it might be related to whatever he was about to discover at the labs. For once, he wished that he could have listened to his parents&#39; thoughts once more. Perhaps it would have been easier to get answers that way. 

He couldn&#39;t afford to cry over spilt milk, for his lesser used senses were already overwhelmed by the lab&#39;s insides. When was the last time he had to <em>see</em> to perceive something? Files, dust, signs of a struggle. There was a lot of information to take in, which was hard for someone who had been used to hearing other people&#39;s thoughts for so long. Peeking at people&#39;s minds was easy, if painful, but it had dulled Alex&#39;s ability to understand through text and images alone.

But he wasn&#39;t stupid. He could adapt. It just took time. He walked deeper into the labs, thinking about what he would do if he were a researcher at Nirvana. Where would he store his massive drill device? He would think outside, but there was no traces of drills there. Therefore, it could only be inside, possibly in a secure location. His first thought was the center, for it was typical and logical. Following faded out signs, he was about to approach his location...

...Until his mind started buzzing. His brain growled in pain. Intrusive thoughts from two other parties, albeit faint and hard to discern. It was akin to the buzzing of an annoying fly, but he wanted to swat it all the same.</span>

He couldn&#39;t tell how far away those individuals were, but they were clearly near the labs. Perhaps outside, perhaps inside, but getting closer and closer with each passing second.

...

Allen kept exploring around the lab&#39;s outskirts, loitering around aimlessly with the red sky overseeing him. His hands had gone numb from the cold, causing the lab to look even more alluring as a temporary refuge. Before he even realized it, his feet had gradually led him closer to the building, not just because of heat, but because he was after answers. He had never fully explored the main lab, so part of him felt like he might as well for completion&#39;s sake.

The lab was dusty, but well kept. There were signs of a struggle, but they were subtle. In fact, Allen might even go as far as say that it was one of the better kept labs he had seen on the island. The daunting size, however, made it hard for him to decide where to start exploring. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span></span>

Suddenly, the silence was broken by a piercing mental noise. Someone other than Alex was here. Squatters? Scavengers? Unlikely, most natives avoided the old structures aside from the occasional use as a storage area. No, those that were more likely to explore these areas were…

<strong>”Outsiders…”</strong>

Alex subconsciously gripped the kitchen knife that replaced the dagger lost in the fight against Ruth and took one step back towards the entrance. Then another. Alex then stopped in place.

No. This was not why Alex was here. They had something of far more importance to find. Still, the presence of others was uneasy. Would they be like the hateful man that bashed in Alex’s head? Or more like the unnerving but amicable Ace and his companion? It was not something Alex wanted to leave to chance.

With a wave of their good arm, the cold air condensed and solidified into three small, icy forms before Alex.

<strong>”Slow them down.”</strong> Alex commanded.

Alex watched as the golems skulked into the shadows. A small compromise to their ever more ravenous desires. Alex the turned and proceed deeper towards the center of the lab.</span>

&quot;So... cold...&quot; he said as he let out a chill breath, the snow slowly turning into water as he began to look around. 

Options, many options presented themselves in the form of doors and hallways to take from the entrance as his eyes darted around looking for a sort of map he began to ponder on his options. Time was of essence and honestly seeing how the weather was he wasn&#39;t sure another trip here was possible so he needed to make the most of it one way or another. 

Picking the wrong path would be detrimental, but staying still was not an option either. He crossed his arms as he began to move, in moments like this thinking actually get in the way more than helping, it was a bad habit he had no way of stopping nor dealing with, even if he can see there was no real correct answer at the moment his mind would keep moving in circles trying to find it so he decided to just move. 

&quot;Hey Graf those planes you use can they give us a landscape of this building or something?&quot; he said as he moved through one doors.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Alex headed towards the center, determined and driven by his goal to find out the truth. Hopefully, it was something that could eliminate the problem of outsiders altogether, or even better, something that could silence the voices in his head permanently. It was a stretch, but the desire for complete isolation was an easy gateway into ridiculous ideas.

Eventually, the faded signs became too faded to recognize. He was stumbling around in the dark, realizing that he had reached the section of the building that could no longer subsist on emergency power alone. The main lab was large, far larger than any other lab he had explored in Nirvana. He theorized that its labyrinthian corridors and structure were simply the result of digging more and more into the city&#39;s crust. No wonder he felt like he had taken several flights of stairs to reach his destination.

This further corroborated his theory of the lab being used for drilling experiments. To reach Earth&#39;s mantle and discover something. Something that the outsiders might have been looking for all along. Perhaps if he simply destroyed that, then those foolish investigators would no longer bother him.

Unfortunately, he was still lost, and he couldn&#39;t seem to find the next flight of stairs. He hugged the corridors, exploring every room behind every door, until he eventually came across a rather spacious one. It was littered with dusty coffee mugs, depowered lamps and a set of screens embedded on the wall. A faint light emanated from all of those screens, a sign that they were still functioning and connected to power. Judging by the look, it seemed to be a security room. One massive enough to display cameras all around the lab, that is.

Judging by the keyboard controlling it, it hadn&#39;t been touched in ages. However, the temptation to fiddle with it was alluring. Cameras meant directions. Directions meant labs. It was easy to see how this could benefit him.</span>

Allen kept walking, wondering what awaited him behind those set of doors. A surprisingly normal environment. Dusty and old, but with a sense of homeliness. There were some dents on the walls and signs of a struggle, but it was one of the cleanest labs he had found on Nirvana. This filled him with a sense of curiosity, wondering what made this lab special above the rest, especially since there were no signs of looting or vandalism.

Before he could explore further, however, he heard footsteps in the distance. Faint and almost unrecognizable. Something was in the distance, but he couldn&#39;t quite find them.

...

Alex&#39;s golems had found their target, but they were competent enough to remain in the shadows, just like their master had commanded. They were nearing Allen&#39;s sides, having sneaked past the kid and now standing directly behind the boy&#39;s back. They scanned for other targets and noticed a Servant with a high mana signature enter the building as well. Most likely the kid&#39;s Servant. Two confirmed hostiles. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span></span>

However, footsteps were steadily approaching. Two figures from what Alex could sense. Even if both were only human, Alex&#39;s golems could only stall them so long. With a quicken pace, Alex moved towards the keyboard and started searching.

Meanwhile, as Allen and Graf passed through a particularly cluttered area, littered with dusty furniture and long unused equipment, the golems struck. A nearby filing cabinet groaned as it suddenly tilted over and began to fall on top of Graf. At the same time, an icy golem, no more than two feet in height, dived out from underneath a desk and stabbed at Allen&#39;s ankles before quickly scuttling away. Similar scuttling could be heard throughout the room. The two were surrounded.</span>

As a ship she was built to withstand much harsher weather with ease so a slight bit of chill was no challenge to her. However as they got inside where it was warmer she hear Allens question and she responded. &quot;The plane can tell me about the outside shape and if there is anyone approaching i cant really tell anything about the inside from them. Want me to launch one?&quot; She asked.

Meanwhile her radar though was hard at work and kept track of any movement within a 40 meter radius of her. This movement is something that she did in fact notice and with a flash of crimson light summoned the construct that represented who she was as a ship. &quot;We got movement. Cant tell the number but roughly 30 meters from us... i think a floor below. its a bit difficult to tell exactly because of the walls.&quot; she spoke to Allen as soon as her radar returned pings of activity of things that weren&#39;t static and were moving around. Then another ping to her radar came as two more entities showed up but these were dangerously close. Right as the cabinet let out a groan and began to fall on Graf she jumped back while with her hands she grabbed one of her torpedoes and physically chucked the thing at the icy golem to disrupt its attempt at stabbing Allen. she did disable the fuse so it didn&#39;t decide to detonate upon some random impact. &quot;Seems we have some i cant really see with my radar until its too late.&quot;</span>

Then the answer came, the limits and her radar gave the young man one more card to play and a better understanding.

Someone was here, enemy or ally was still in the air  but knowing his luck it was probably an enemy after all seeing this place so well maintained compared to others only reinforced the idea that there was someone in this place. But then again how it was maintained and people being here also told them that this place was important... for what or how it was to soon to tell and then Graf moved. His servant movements were something he really couldn&#39;t get tired of seeing, seeing a torpedo being throw at his legs it did little to change his expression, no for him who had already decided to fight and believe Graf it wasn&#39;t even worth noticing. 

A smile appeared on his face as all this tell him something important. &quot;We are on the right path.&quot;

Crimson flames began to come together, flocking towards his arms answering the call of their master they began to fuse slowly growing and taking shape into what their master wanted out of them. The flames became two double edge swords Allen took in his hands. 

&quot;Graf get down&quot; he said as he spin in his position, he swinged both of his crimson blades using them to froms a red circle around  him, the crimson slash moved the blades aiming to cut everything around them.  Allen didn&#39;t knew what or who was attacking but doubt this would be enough his real aim was to found their position, as when attacked they would react. Graf had just told him she could catch them when they moved so for Allen their only shot was to force them to move to get a clear shot.</span>

Sudden movement caught the two&#39;s eye as several chairs came flying over the tables, hurtling straight towards Allen.

Pain run though his body as remnants strike him but due his coat and blades it wasn&#39;t much. 

&quot;Tch&quot; he couldn&#39;t help but let out his annoyance at this. He was really bad at this sort of fight, while he could be sneaky he had always preferred a straight up frontal assault which meant he had little experience dealing with a situation like the current one. 

He wanted to just go and destroy everything but he could end up harming Graf in the process or destroy anything what may help them figure out what was happening, that leave him with only 1 option. The blades faded in his hands, the crimson flames were soon replaced by black ones. If his crimson flames shine brightly, these ones emit a dark sinister hue which would normally send shivers through a normal person spine. The flames 

&quot;Belphegor!!!&quot; he yelled a the black flames expanded from his arm covering the whole room. 

The flames wouldn&#39;t burn anything nor they would cause any pain, they didn&#39;t burn flesh but instead they burned mana, as hungry beast they would move through the furniture and engulf the golems. They would become slower and maybe even smaller.</span>

On the other side of the room, more furniture groaned as cabinets and desks toppled over, forming a barricade against the door deeper into the labs.</span>

Then things in the distance fell and blocked off an entrance to some other part of the lab.

&quot;Allen take cover i think i found the attacker.&quot; She was of course just following logic. if somebody was barricading something up it meant that they didnt want anyone else getting in there so she leveled one of her fourteen guns at the forming barricade and took the shot. even though it was her smallest gun firing it still made a mighty CRACK! as it fired and a plume of black smoke followed the shell out of its muzzle. The shell that she fired would fly across the room and hit the barricade where it embedded itself deep within it before detonating. In an explosion that shook the entire structure she had essentially deleted the obstacle.</span>

The Ignis&#39;s flames didn&#39;t had a name, the clan was quite an obscure one even before the world came to an end so they really never had any reason to give their magecraft a name. But if someone were to ask Allen why he picked names for his flames his answer would leave everyone around him dumbstruck. 

&#39;They sound and look cooler that way&#39;

Allen stopped the black flames as he heard Graf&#39;s voice and did as she said moved out of the way using one of the many furniture to take cover as he covered his ears as he knew that an explosion was only a matter of time. He stood still as the smoke began to clear and then suddenly stood up and run towards the door thar Graf had just blow up. 

&quot;Graf we just breaking through!!&quot; he said as he understood something. He hadn&#39;t had a good look at the golems but his logic was the same as Graf if someone was getting in their way that meant they were on the right direction, so they would become their guides.</span>

He peeked through logs and footage, surprised that the machine was still functioning throughout all these years. It had data from the past few decades, to the point that it was actually working to his detriment: There were thousands of recordings, yet he was forced to sift through them in a cumbersome menu that required page and arrow clicks. The first page was too far ahead and the last page was too far behind. He was looking for the exact date of the drilling operation and coming up short, instead resorting to spam clicking through a specific period in time in order to find footage of the drilling.

While doing so, he stumbled across something rather interesting. One of the cameras still worked. In fact, all of the cameras connected to the other labs on the island seemed to be functioning well. The camera at the tropical labs seemed to have picked up rather interesting footage going on outside of it. Two familiar figures could be seen, namely William and Giovanni Verga. Even more surprising was the fact that Alex could see a carcass on the ground there, alongside another figure that felt vaguely familiar.

The carcass belonged to Vortigern, lacking a head from an unseen battle. His eyes widened as he saw Verga and William having some sort of spat. This wasn’t his primary goal, but it interested him, so he kept it as a window in the background. He resumed his search for the drilling operation, finally coming across a date that seemed rather close. He gave it a look and…</span>

It was completely normal.

A bunch of researchers talking on. A herd of journalists taking photos and writing notes. A drill perforating through Nirvana and slowly reaching Earth’s crust…To a resounding success.

No incidents. No tragedies. No aliens emerging from the crust below like in a bad sci-fi novel. Nothing of the sort. A perfectly average day showing off an incredible achievement for mankind. For a second, Alex felt disappointed, wondering if he had followed a cold lead all along.

But then he saw them, hiding amongst the journalists. He took a closer peek just to be sure, but he was right on the money. It would be impossible to miss someone with such a gaudy outfit and a ridiculous hat. William was there, observing the drilling plan with a bored look on his face. This sort of scene would hardly arouse suspicion, but after seeing how William had acted in the past two weeks, Alex felt a bit concerned about the writer’s presence there.

Seemed like he had more recordings to watch. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span></span>

It was in moments like this where Allen was both thankful and annoyed at his  own overthinking. 

As of the many possibilities there was one which scared him, what if the one slowing them was actually doing to dispose of any possible information they could gather? It was something he couldn&#39;t ignore even if he tried, it was then he suddenly fell to the ground. 

His mind became hazy a sudden blow to the back of his head was the most likely cause, they were sneaky he give them as much and even as pain surge through his body he realize he didn&#39;t care. Flames wrapped around his legs.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Alex hammered away at the archaic security computers. While the data from so many years ago being preserved was a good thing for Alex, it meant that there was an exorbitant amount of footage to shift through. While looking through, Alex also found that the camera system was fairly extensive in its reach, having eyes all over Nirvana.

One such camera had an eye on what looked like a confrontation between Shakespeare and the sycophant Verga, along with a headless corpse. It took a moment for Alex to guess that it might&#39;ve been the Vortigern that they heard about at the gathering at Ruth&#39;s estate. Not that Alex knew for sure having never seen Vortigen once. Not that it mattered anymore, he was extremely dead by the look of it. Alex still kept the feed playing on a separate screen, whatever spat Verga and William were having Alex was curious as to how it would end.

Eventually, Alex managed to find it. Footage of the day of the drill project. Alex watched with anticipation as the drill dug in front of an audience of reporters and researchers. Waiting and waiting for the moment. And then...nothing. Nothing happened as the drill hit the crust of the Earth. For a moment a pit formed in Alex&#39;s stomach, the thought that they had been chasing nothing this whole time. Until Alex noticed something, in the crowd was the unmistakable face of Shakespeare. With everything Alex had heard about the man in the past two weeks, there was something off about his presence here.</span>

A fire mage and some kind of...ship...person...a servant most likely. An extremely bad matchup for Alex&#39;s golems. The cautious part of Alex wanted to retreat, they had the location of the dig site. The golems wouldn&#39;t hold the two off much longer. Now was the time to fall back into the shadows once more. But something else in Alex pushed against that instinct. There was something more to this Alex was missing. Some piece of the puzzle that laid just out of sight, just under the surface. The urge began to overwhelm Alex. They continued to mash at the keyboard, searching for what happened.

As Allen tanked the large cabinet and started to run, he felt a sharp stab in his leg and chest. Two ice golems had leapt out of the wreckage of the thrown cabinet and leapt onto Allen. They forcefully turned him towards Graf while hiding behind Allen. One perched on his back while the other hung on his leg. The one on Allen&#39;s back held a sharp icicle-like hand to Allen&#39;s throat as a single drop of blood dripped down. The message was clear, the golems had taken Allen hostage.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">As he felt someone or well rather something stabbed him and them turned him around there was an emotion that prevailed beyond all the others, annoyance. He was getting really annoyed at this things trying to slow them down and even more as he found himself staring at Graf. Still just as much as he was annoyed he could only think one thing from the current situation. 

&#39;They make the wrong choice&#39;

It was really logic, specially as he saw how anger began to show more and more into Graf&#39;s face; while he understood they possessed limited options he really couldn&#39;t see this going well in any way.  While it could stop Graf for a few moments it was just a matter of time till she just shoot them down for daring to attack her master and as someone who had seen her fight Allen knew that she could before they even get the chance to hurt him. But the worse part was that all of that depended on a single thing. 

&quot;I will let my passion burn...&quot; the fact that Allen couldn&#39;t save himself. &quot;...and crush you&quot;

Flames covered his body, the sharp icicle melt instantly and so did the golems trying to subdue them as the flames expanded behind his body as the crimson armor once again covered Allen&#39;s body. Alex was right they were the worse match as the golems were ice constructions against a man who for a single moment looked as if he was made out of flames. 

This was the first time Graf would see him like this and Allen was unsure of her reaction so to make thing easier, he didnt&#39; materialize the mask this time. 

&quot;Well one less problem to deal with I guess.&quot;</span>

&quot;Lets go Graf...&quot; he looked tired but even then he began to walk forward. &quot;...we still to find the person who send those golems after us.&quot;

His steps were slow as he slowly tried to recover himself, well it was just 30 meters or so, he was sure he would be able to manage somehow. He keep his hand on the walk to help himself remain steady as he realized something. 

&quot;Oh which way was it?&quot; he said as he turned and looked at her servant with a small smile.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">As Allen and Graf proceed down the dark, abandoned hallways, they could eventually make out a flicking light in the distant and the faint sound of a clacking button. Following it, they eventually came to what looked like a Security Office. Screens adorned the walls with archaic machinery scattered about. Hunched over in front of the screens with its back turned towards the two was a figure. A strange, tall, lanky figure covered head to toe. A long coat worn in age but well-made, a mysterious advanced looking helmet with a single glowing purple light. It was impossible to tell if the figure was a man or a woman. One of its arms was in a sling while the other methodically tapped the keyboard in front of it.

On the screens Allen and Graf could see views of other labs, perhaps located on other parts of Nirvana. On one particular screen, they saw a scene of what looked like William in different clothing gunning down Verga as the headless corpse of Vortigern laid in the foreground. However, on the main screen was footage of reporters and scientists celebrating something. William could once again be seen occasionally in the crowd. The scene rapidly skipped forward in sync with the tapping of the figure on the keyboard.

<strong>&quot;I was hoping that would take you longer. I really don&#39;t want to deal with you right now.&quot;</strong> A heavily synthesized voice echoed from the figure. Never looking back towards the two. Still rhythmically tapping at the keyboard.

<strong>&quot;Do me a favor and don&#39;t do anything for a moment. Don&#39;t move. Don&#39;t speak. Don&#39;t even think. Just...stay...silent.&quot;</strong>

The figure continued to tap at the keyboard, still not turning to look at the two.</span>

While it make sense that there will be a security room, seeing how hard they tried to slow them down Allen actually expected something else. 

He had expected to find someone trying to break or erase something but from what the monitors showed the man or woman who was typing in front of him was just looking through some footage. The bewilderment produced by the contrast allowed Allen that for a few moments he would follow Alex request to the letter, he didnt move, he didn&#39;t speak not even think.  Yes for a few more moments Alex would enjoy complete and utter silence from Allen before suddenly being bombarded by his complete and total confusion. 

As Allen mind tried to make sense of what had happened a mix of different emotions came suddenly changing in intensity which each second. Normally this would only be an annoyance for Allen but his mind was pretty much used to this overcomplicated exercise but the sudden shift and chaos of emotions would prove something akin to a mildly annoyance to Alex to say the least.  

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Allen finally said as his confusion once again began to peak but in exchange all the other emotions began to get more quiet.</span>

The figure continued to tap the keyboard, surveying the footage on the screen in complete silence. Until Allen finally found the voice to speak up.

<strong>”I SAID BE SILENT!”</strong>

The figure slammed a fist down on the desk. Their head turned towards Allen, the purple light shining upon him.

<strong>”You were doing so well. But then you had to go and say that. To think that! Those irritating thoughts that go through my mind like razor wire.”</strong>

The figure clawed at their helmet for emphasis, before turning back towards the computer and resuming their task.

<strong>”Even my saintly patience has reached its limit with this miasmic madness that grips the minds of the inhabitants of this land. Consider yourself fortunate that I have the perspective to see such things.”</strong>

The figure continued to rhythmically tap at the keyboard like before.

<strong>”I’m close now, I can feel it. The one piece of this puzzle I’m missing. Then, I can get my answer. Was it really me? I need to know. I HAVE to know!”</strong> The figure muttered to themself.

Allen and Graf could feel the maddening obsession in the figure’s voice. Even though they had yet to take any hostile action against them, this figure was no less deranged than any other inhabitant of Nirvana. They were just focused on something other than them…for the moment.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It took all of Alex&#39;s restraint to not throw himself at Graf and Allen in a blind rage. Those invasive thoughts were perforating his brain like needles, making it hard to even breath. In general, his time on the island seemed to be reaching its limit: Not only were the outsiders a thorn on his side, but Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants themselves were radiating far louder thoughts than usual, not to mention Ruth&#39;s own wariness of him.

That&#39;s why, before he succumbed to the noise, he wanted to know. The truth. What exactly happened on that day.

It took him a few key presses and meticulous file selecting, but eventually, he found it: A clip of William entering the labs late at night, just a few days after the first successful drilling operation. The researchers were out cold, most likely celebrating at their own homes with wine and prosecco. The bard, on the other hand, was working rather hard, sifting through files and grabbing keycards that gave access to deeper facilities within the lab.

Eventually, he found it. Something at the site of the drilling operation. Something that could not be seen by the cameras, since it lurked off screen. All Alex and Allen noticed was William remaining still next to the massive drill. Then, he started fiddling around with the drilling tools, causing them to emit beeping lights and deliver warning messages. Then, the clip ended.

Of course, Alex proceeded to watch the next clip. It was far more enlightening, with William luring an annoyed looking researcher to the drilling site, most likely having convinced them with some pointless drivel. Coincidentally, the drilling site was now filled with various tree specimens, as if the researchers had started to analyze the soil lurking underneath Nirvana.</span>

It was then that it happened, William shoving the researcher into a lone tree. The researcher screaming in pain as the tree wrapped itself around them, slowly assimilating their flesh and nutrients into their very being. A corruptive ooze secreted from the plant, one not too dissimilar from the goop that surrounded the island right now.

William just stared at the plant, awestruck. He looked giddy and excited, as if this were his plan all along.

The following clips were more of the same. More researchers being devoured. The number of trees growing. Eventually, the recordings stopped altogether, as if there was no one left to see them anymore. Alex had found his answer, but he still wondered on how to feel about it.

Especially when he started to sense someone else&#39;s presence in the labs. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span></span>

Although it didn’t answer the question burning in their mind, it did give Alex an idea as to what would be found at the dig site itself. Perhaps there Alex would find out if any of their frustration, their irritation, their wants, desires, and obsessions. If any of it was truly Alex’s own.

But before that, a small prick in the back of Alex’s mind hummed. Alex tilted their head.

<strong>“You.”</strong> Alex finally addressed Allen directly. <strong>”Did anyone else come with you?”</strong>

Alex started switching through the cameras of the main lab trying to find this new intruder.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Madness, Alex words struck hard on Allen&#39;s mind seeing the man in front of him succumb to such obsession was disturbing. Yet that wasn&#39;t the worst of it, he had seen that madness before, in Ruth in those islanders that wanted to kill him and even a bit in Ashley. But if Alex words were to be believed then the madness that fueled them wasn&#39;t their fault there was something causing it. That didn&#39;t mean he would forgive Ruth for what she had done to him and Ryn but it really put some things into perspective. 

His own hand moved into his face as he began to realize what that meant, that voice that resounded inside his mind, the one that told him to kill and do thing he normally wouldn&#39;t even consider was that the same madness Alex was talking about? If true then he and the other were in deep danger as if it was the case then it was only matter of time till all of them went mad but at the same time it also meant there was a way for them to be able to save themselves. 

He decided to bet on the later, specially seeing how the man in front of him was looking for the same or at least it seemed that way. As his eyes follow the footage he couldn&#39;t hide his horror about what William was doing, the horror was such that it managed to block his rage as the young man couldn&#39;t believe someone could do something like that. It was a good thing Allen didn&#39;t knew who William was, as during his fight with Ruth he was so focused on the woman to pay attention to the bard&#39;s aid. As he tried to make sense of the situation he could only agree on something, William had began all of this and just like Alex he wanted to see the room directly but Alex words took brought him back to the present.

&quot;Uh? We came on our own.&quot; as he answer as he wondered at the question before looking at Graf. &quot;Graf can you sense anything?&quot;</span>

It wasn’t a brilliant one, maybe more like a theory. But to say Dante had the idea that if William Frequented the tropics labs, he frequented many, then it’d be something rather than nothing. If they found him, it was great, if they didn’t, they’d search it like any other for clues.</em>

“We should start here, it’s just a hunch, and I don’t expect much from it, but I don’t think there are any options but to check the labs first. . .”

<em>And so, he quickly began to head towards the doors of the lab, quietly sliding through them before he began his search, his servant nearby in case of any potential threats or problems. The duo stayed quiet, eyes looking about for anything suspicious and alive, for all they knew, they were alone. Well, maybe. There had been a few out of place things, the large abnormal chunks of ice laying placidly on the floors if the lab. Some were nicely made, shaped of hulking bodies that resembled something almost similar to golems had sat there. Okay, so he was wrong, something had been here. The further the group had ventured down the labs, the more the bodies of ice seemed to pile on, a graveyard of clunky ice golem bodies. On the other hand, it wasn’t simply those that littered the lab, but shells of fired torpedos and shrapnel, holes along the walls. Dante went towards one of the walks and touched it, feeling the still fading warmth in his hands. It wasn’t fresh, but it wasn’t too long either.</em>

“I think there had been a fight here, how long, I don’t know, but we should stay on our guard. Someone else might be here as well.”</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Octavius followed along with Dante to the main labs of Nirvana. The temperature difference annoyed the Roman more than any kind of real bother by the weather. I&#39;m fact he was happy for a change of scenery. They&#39;d only been going from deserts to forests their entire journey on this island, so the soft snow and the cooler temperatures were a fantastic delight to the Emperor. As they entered the labs, however, The Caesar&#39;s disposition would change at the signs of combat and battle. Recent battle. Broken ice, still crumbling architecture, the leftover heat magical fire, and energy; are all the telltale signs of fresh battle debris. He listened to Dante&#39;s words, although he only acknowledged the information with a casual flick of his wrist and summoned Auram Pax to his hand in a twirl in his hand.

&quot;Well this is the most central place in all of Nirvana, so it would make sense that a few people would make this place their destination for a visit. As for all this debris, we can at least count that since there are no bodies and that it seems recent, we may find ourselves some sort of a friendly face.&quot; He said semi-jokingly and also with a bit of hope. If there was another investigator in here, then that would. make their investigation run a lot more smoothly. Even if they didn&#39;t bump into an investigator, they&#39;d still learn some new information. One way or another. Octavius kept his guard up as they went through the labs, although from an outside perceptive, it seems as though he was casually meandering with Dante, spinning Auram Pax in his hand without a care in the world, while in reality, the Saber was prepared to attack or defend depending on what they encountered in this place.</span>

As they passed Allen they briefly stopped.

It was quite obvious he had been the one who send the golems at him and Graf and if his experience in this island was worth anything then Alex was far from being a good guy. But so far he ranked better than Ruth and there were even bigger issues that needed to be addressed right now. He moved closer to the screen following Alex through the cameras  before trying to find Octavius and Dante as leaving Alex aside who knew what they would find down there in the digging site. 

He moved back to the door &quot;Hey Guys!!! Its me Allen, im with Graf come here!!&quot; he yelled as he called at the pair as he didnt wanted to leave Alex on his own for too long. He was willing to kill him but he rather not do it as he seemed to understand what was happening a bit better than them.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The new arrivals were met with little fanfare, or at least Alex seemed intent on keeping it that way. After the revelation of William&#39;s involvement in Nirvana&#39;s past, he doubted that anything else could ever surprise him. He temporarily reduced his urges to kill the outsiders, demonstrating enormous degrees of self awareness and control. For now, he was focused on a singular goal: To find out what exactly happened at Nirvana on that day.

He went deeper into the lab. The investigators followed suit. The environment remained as sterile as ever, but as they got deeper, things started to change. A strange aroma. A larger amount of plant specimens surrounding them. Discarded clothes and items. Things were steadily growing chaotic with each further step.

By the time they reached the heart of the lab, everything was in disarray. Broken devices, misplaced test reports, plants and cracked pots littering the environment. All pointing towards the middle of the room: A gigantic hole lacking a drill. This was the room Alex had seen in those recordings, but the equipment was gone. All that was left was the opening.

Something blinked inside of it. Something conscious. It had a desire to consume. To take over the island, no, the entire world with it.

It was a fleshy, rotten substance. It was like pus and blood mixed with sludge. It was mud. Mud from humanity&#39;s deepest recesses. A curse so vile it could curse an entire bloodline from hell and back. The mana residue was incredibly high, but there was no point in measuring it: No matter how hard you tried to filter or repurpose this disgusting sludge, it would be impossible to turn it into a force of good. It was pure evil in its rawest form.

Something that had remained dormant for ages, that only legends spoke of: <strong>The Grail Mud.</strong>

In that moment, everything was clear.</span>

A master and servant? It didn’t matter, whether it was a person or an enemy servant, he knew Caesar would at least have his guard up and ready to defend. He simply needed to be on the lookout.</em>

<em>They hadn’t made it quite far when Dante heard the specific tone of someone familiar, making his head perk up only to see the cook he had met on the boat. Allen. . . And the same thorny tongued woman he had summoned before. But a new face had seemed to puzzle the doctor, a man who he couldn’t even remember being on the Canopus. Was he an investigator, or an islander? Master or Servant. The Doctor slowed down a bit, wary of the person’s presence, even if they had found another member of the group. It was someone along them they didn’t know. Before he could even get close enough, the doctor had gone into his own guarded stance, slowing down in order to keep his saber before him. A shield from his problems.</em>

“Y—You made it. To think you’d have been here too, I assume it’s good luck. . .”

<em>He said as he acknowledged Allen’s presence. As for the man, he simply looked at him, nervousness in his eyes as he watched the new body.</em>

The lab seemed more expansive the further they went into it, the signs of battle no longer about and yet it looked as if the more they gone through the more ancient the lab became. Nothing but flora had began to bloom around them, and the chaotic signs of abandonment simply festered in the labs. Dante was about to speak, when he had stopped to see the hole in the ground.</em>

That it used to be a clan which defied the rules of how a mage household were supposed to work like. That was almost all what her mother and the generations that came after the flood had from the past. His mother would never say anything but she felt really conflicted at times about the stories she told him, she was afraid she was giving him some sort of hope or expectations due what others have achieved in the past but she didn&#39;t wanted to let the story of their clan died either. 

Allen never really cared about their veracity, it was nice and it gave it a connection he could be proud and admire and as he grew he felt that even if it wasn&#39;t as exactly as he was told it was okay. That wasn&#39;t a lie it was just a mistake when remembering so no problem for him.

&quot;He isn&#39;t really with us, be careful Dante&quot; he whisper to the doctor as he didn&#39;t want to appear rude to Alex but also didn&#39;t wanted to have Dante&#39;s death in his conscience.

As soon as he entered the room his froze, unlike Dante, he had a bit more knowledge due seeing the footage so the whole room appeared unsettling to him. As he moved closer his memory began to pick something, his mind went back to his childhood to one of his mother stories about the flood. It was said that the Ignis clan fought to delay the black mud and many members died at it, it was also how she had been told the elemental they worshipped had been lost as well. 

He had never seen it before, but the feeling it gave it give Allen only 1 possible answer to what they had found. 

&quot;Dont get near it anymore Dante!!&quot; he yelled as he fight the urge to just run away.</span>

He continued to wonder about the identities of the mysterious combatants, eyeing the cameras as they passed. Of course, he was put at ease somewhat when they rounded a turn and saw a familiar sight indeed. Allen and Archer. The first people Octavius had laid his eyes on in this adventure beyond Dante. This calmed a few the Roman&#39;s worries, despite the memory of his rough introduction back then. The memory nonetheless, made the Roman chuckle as he walked by them. He however eyed the additional figure with both suspicion and curiosity, especially after Allen&#39;s warning. The Emperor shrugged and guessed this was a like-minded goals sort of deal. Temporary allies faced with a common problem, Octavius understood the sentiment. Although now with an extra pair of hands, he doubted any possible return to hostilities anytime soon. 

&quot;Pleasure to see you both alive and well. Seems you found a friend.&quot; The Saber said jokingly as they walked into the room, the contents making the Roman&#39;s smile drop into a frown as he immediately made his way to Dante&#39;s side, hand on shoulder, pulling his master behind himself. He was repulsed, from the information added to his head upon being summoned, the servant knew what they were looking at. How had <em>it</em> made its way to the surface. Well, he supposed not surface, but close enough to it. Although this would explain a few things about the island. The all corrupting destructive mud of the Grail is present in the central primary labs of this island. The animals acting out of nature&#39;s intent, the people becoming beasts, and the environment itself becoming a desolate apocalypse-style wasteland. It could only have been the murk. The look in the Saber&#39;s eyes was one of contempt and vitriol, yet also contained excitement.

They had stumbled upon the corruption of the island. The Roman couldn&#39;t help but give a slightly manic grin. They had found the cause of the disaster. He had found the enemy that he had been waiting oh so long to destroy. He gripped Auram Pax tightly as he spoke.

&quot;It seems we&#39;ve stumbled upon the true enemy. Now we figure out how and why it has come to this level of corruption and destroy it.&quot; He said simply as if it was the easiest thing in the world to do.</span>

Alex did not need to be an empath to feel the desire to consume, corrupt, and the pure evil that radiated from that mud.

Starring at it, Alex was reminded of Ruth, Ashley, and so many of the other Nirvanians and their rancorous minds.

The cause for Earth&#39;s destruction and the reason the entire world had been flooded in the first place. That breed of evil was now staring them in the face, gleefully so. It seemed sentient, fully aware of the destruction it caused, which made it all the more horrifying. It squirmed around, threatening to leak from its own opening and indulge in corruption and defilement.

It had to be slain, but therein lied the problem: How could you slay something as formless as the Grail Mud? Even the ancestors of old could not stop it. Instead, they were forced to seal it, through the great flood. Unfortunately, none of the Servants on the island were capable of such an amazing feat.

Was it all pointless then?

As they dwelled on that, footsteps could be heard. A shadow emerged from the heart of the lab, standing right next to the mud&#39;s opening. Their attire was unfamiliar, but their face was easy to remember for those who had seen it. It was none other than William himself.</span>

&quot;Good to see all of you, fine and healthy.&quot; He grinned, wiping blood off his boots from his previous encounter with Verga. &quot;I thought I wouldn&#39;t make it in him. I really did. Seems like Lady Luck was on my side for once, thankfully.&quot; He chuckled, pointing to Alex and Allen. It wasn&#39;t implausible to theorize that the scuffle between them two had given him enough time to make a hasty getaway for the main lab.

&quot;So, why such the long faces?&quot; He asked, shrugging as he noticed the scowls of terror in the group&#39;s faces. &quot;Look, I hate shocking twists as much as anybody else, but they definitely do add drama to a story.&quot; He pointed out. casually tapping around the edge of the hole where the mud was lurking.

&quot;Are you not entertained? Is this not motivation enough for you all to keep going? What were you looking for when you came to Nirvana, hmmm?&quot; He asked, both amused and annoyed at the same time. He then turned to Alex.

&quot;You even got a bonafide Nirvanan to go snooping around. How&#39;s it going, pal? You starting to put two and two together?&quot; He chuckled, causing Alex to wonder whatever the Servant meant, until he felt it. He <em>sensed</em> it. The Grail Mud&#39;s very own thoughts. It was impossible to ignore, like nails on chalkboard. It sent shivers down his spine, causing him to wallow in fear of the implications. The more he read the mud&#39;s thoughts, the more he could notice similarities between Ruth, Ashley, Koji...

He came looking for answers, and he had found the solution to the final mystery: Alex&#39;s distaste for outsiders was nothing more than the mud&#39;s own thoughts. It was sentient, biding its time and rejecting outsiders for it knew that it was weak. It knew that it needed time to spread out its corruption. That is why it slowly infiltrated Nirvana&#39;s surroundings, controlling the inhabitants with thoughts that were so real that they felt like their own.

Alex felt insignificant almost. He grew frustrated at other people&#39;s thoughts since birth, but now, in front of him, was an entity capable of handling thousands of thoughts at <strong>once.</strong>

As if understanding that, he felt something else prod his brain.

<em>&quot;...What is a drop of rain compared to a storm...?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;...What is a thought, compared to a mind...?&quot;</em>

The mud squirmed, affirming its presence in the innards of his cranium.

<em>&quot;...Your suffering is a result of your individualism. At all times, you are fed the thoughts of countless outsiders...&quot;</em>

<em><strong>&quot;It&#39;s hard, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</strong></em>

His parents had taught him this long ago. Mental interference. Mental corruption. Spells designated to assault the mind. They were easy to counter, but incredibly hard to be rid of if left unchecked.

Alex had ignored the mud&#39;s presence for years. And now, the seeds were ready to sprout.

<em>&quot;Remove them of their individuality. Assimilate them into you. They should be outsiders no longer, be it in life or death.&quot;</em>

Who knew how much longer he would last. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span></span>

The servant appeared to be hugely confused with this whole thing in general and then more people kept showing up, which just further amplified her confusion. Defaulting back to her usual state of constant vigilance she just watched for anything hostile.

And hostile did the find... A weird hole that lead to god knows where filled with malice so thick one could lick it from the air near the hole. One of the people though seemed to be getting affected by the mud hole so she grabbed one of her own torpedoes and looked to Allen. &quot;Should i try sealing the hole with one of these?&quot; She asked, just in case he decided to say no. Explosions weren&#39;t always the best indoors after all. Pretty much everyone present had likely seen a few of these go off in their opening day and fight when first arriving on this accursed island.</span>

Even the prized heirloom of the Bondre family, the Helmet of Mental Preservation, a Mystic Code that protected one against Mental Corruption and Mental Interference magics of the highest caliber, had been circumvented through countless years of the slow and methodical poisoning of Alex&#39;s mind.

Alex gripped their helmet in terror as the corruption spread through their mind like a mass of wriggling insects. Heavy labor breathing with pulses of static could be heard from Alex as they tangled with their new vision of reality. Desperately wrangling through their thoughts, trying to find where Alex&#39;s thoughts ended and the Mud&#39;s thoughts began.</span>

Noticing that, William spread his lips, looking bemused. &quot;Just like I thought, you can no longer keep it in. No different than a stage actor reading off a script, really.&quot; He laughed before turning to the strange looking Servant with ship parts emerging from their body.

&quot;Try it if you want. I&#39;m sure your cannon fire is mightier than Nirvana&#39;s mightiest drill, or the world&#39;s flood.&quot; He mocked, before pointing back to Alex. &quot;But I wonder if you will even get the chance to do so.&quot;

As he predicted, Alex&#39;s mind had finally gave in. His mind wasn&#39;t broken, nor was it destroyed. Instead, it was as if a single directive had suddenly taken priority over the rest: Kill all non Nirvanans. Nothing else mattered. Not his family, nor his condition, nor people&#39;s voices. Just their deaths would give him peace. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span></span>

Some of him wanted to vomit there on the spot, how it’s mass moved so lethargically, aimlessly going about.</em>

<em>Footsteps grasped the attention of the doctor first, making him turn towards the opening where a familiar face had appeared, though adorned with new clothing. William. The bard’s mocking tone made Dante clench his fist for a bit. It seemed his theory was right. Wherever a lab had been, William was soon to follow it. So, was it safe to assume that William was a close associate to this. . . Goo? Clearly. His unsurprised look, his enjoyment of them finding it, clear indicators. The doctor didn’t bother answering or giving into his games, he would ask his questions. Get straight to the point.</em>

“So, since you’re so excited, I assume you’re knowledgeable about the source here. The thing here, it’s a problem for Nirvana, the same  problem that supposedly led to the flooded the world. . ?”

<em>Dante looked back at it, how it’s sludge lived and breathed the same, it’s body of viscous black substance rising and falling all the same. This same thing had to have been the Grail Mud. Soon the sound of Alex nearly collapsing to his knees sent the doctor back into reality. What was wrong with him? He couldn’t exactly “feel” what was happening, but that wasn’t to be normal, no? The doctor went towards the Nirvanan, seeing how he seemed to lose himself in the presence of the mud.</em>

Whatever it had done to him, it definitely was unwelcome. As for the girls comment of trying to “seal” the hole, the doctor shook his head as well, surprisingly along with William. Though, he did mask his own disliking of her idea with his kind words.</em>

“No, just doing that would likely not even budge it. I—It’s like he says, this thing is clearly enough to cause the world to need to be flooded, I’m sure a torpedo or a blast from you won’t budge it. And let’s not cause anymore problems here.”

<em>He looked back to William, his tone slowly becoming a bit less entertained.</em>

“So, I assume you are just here to allow it to cover Nirvana? Is that the end goal, William? And where is Vortigern? Wouldn’t he also have to deal with the mud? Yourself?”</span>

He wouldn&#39;t forgive Ruth but still he felt he understand her and Ashley a bit more now and if he was understanding things correctly then that man was the reason for all of this. 

&quot;You...&quot; he glared at William. &quot;... hurting so many people and destroying so many lives.... you really don&#39;t feel anything about that?&quot; 

Allen didn&#39;t knew why he asked the question, the answer didn&#39;t matter in the least as from the looks of it the man wouldn&#39;t just let them leave and whatever he had started needed to end right here and now but still Allen wanted to know. Not to try and sympathize with such a man, but because he really couldn&#39;t understand his logic. He had meet evil people before, but to all of them there was a reason, be it selfishness, greed or just anger but from what he had seen of William he didn&#39;t seem motivated for neither of them. 

&quot;Graf, if he moves kill him&quot; he gave his servants hisr order as he moved closer to Alex.  &quot;We will need to come up with a plan to deal with this mud  so lets try it later.&quot; he gave her a small smile before he looked back at Alex. 

Options began to mix and argue inside his head, what to do about Alex? He seemed harmless now but due his words and Williams Allen could see it was only a matter of time before he lunged at them with the worst possible intent. 

&quot;Dante I dont think we can help him...&quot; he said as he put his knife in front of himself and wrapped flames around its short blade getting ready for when Alex finally decided to move.</span>

<strong>&quot;Where is the boundary?&quot;</strong> The emotionless static filled voice called out. <strong>&quot;Who&#39;s thoughts are mine and who&#39;s thoughts are its?&quot;</strong>

Alex was lost in the darkness of their own mind. Mentally flailing, trying to find some semblance of self.

Without warning the figure of Alex lunged at Allen, knife diving towards him. There was no malice, no emotion behind the action. It was completely robotic.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Octavius turned to face William. As he listened to his mental harassment of Alex, the servant couldn&#39;t help but scoff. Basic tactic, break down the already fragile barriers in a temporary truce and watch them tear each other apart. Classic and reliable however as the writer managed to break their friendly neighbor. The scenario held still for a moment for the Caesar. On one hand, he could help Allen at the moment with the Nirvanan, on the other end, William was right there and who knew where Vortigern was. He remembered the end of their previous battle with the fleeing crazed Vortigern. It would be a blessing and a curse to fight Vortigern in that state. The Roman was also reminded of his first encounter. A closed-off space, a manic Berserker, and a new tricked-out William. The odds weren&#39;t stellar, but he knew what he should focus on in this engagement.

Octavius looked over to Dante and nodded. &quot;I&#39;m going for the writer, I&#39;ll deal with Vortigern if he emerges the best I can, as for you Dante-&quot; The Saber was about to utter an order for Dante and gave a small smile, stopping himself before continuing. &quot;You know what to do.&quot; 

Octavius stated before turning back to William, stepping filling into the hallway to face him, sword in hand as he casually began to walk over towards the servant. 

&quot;You have such a way with words friend. That&#39;s a skill I can appreciate as a wordsmith such as myself. However-&quot; The Emperor suddenly ducked and launched off of the ground towards William. &quot;By playing your cards you&#39;ve put a target on your back you foul creature!&quot; He finished as he spun in the air, sending a diagonal, downward swing of his sword to William&#39;s right side. While he didn&#39;t expect to destroy the servant immediately, he did want to put pressure on him enough to allow the masters to deal with their issues amongst themselves.</span>

Alex blade was stopped by a black gloved hand, Allen had no issue catching him and momentarily stopping it with one of his arms as he looked at the man in front of him. Pity, that was all he could feel for Alex to see him reduced to this state it was something so disturbing that Allen could only grit his teeth in frustration. 

Even as he stopped the knife he could feel Alex pushing forward, it was just like the citizens trying to kill them before. Even if one were to die the other wouldn&#39;t care they would trample over their allies corpses in an attempt to try and murder them. So he was sure that no matter what they tried Alex would not stop no matter what. 

&quot;Sorry....&quot; he said as he moved forward aiming to slash Alex&#39;s neck if he couldn&#39;t stop him he would at least take him down as fast and painless as possible.</span>

He moved a bit, away from the fray between the two. He’d provide backup if needed, but there wouldn’t be much he could to to overpower the man and his knife.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">William watched as Alex clutched at their skull, overwhelmed by revelations and conflicting thoughts. He observed with glee, satisfied with the Grail mud&#39;s demonstration, as if interested to see whether it was strong enough to affect the minds of the island&#39;s inhabitants yet. Judging by Alex&#39;s reaction, it was more than mature enough to take care of itself.

Which left only the investigators to deal with.

&quot;Oh? You know what it is? Neat.&quot; William clasped his hands. &quot;Saves me the explanation. It is indeed the Grail mud. The one we all know and love to hear about in urban legends and modern fairy tales. A lot uglier than you would think, too.&quot; He chuckled.

That was when Allen intervened, glaring at William coldly as he lectured him about his sins. The forger replied with an uncaring smirk.

&quot;Yep. Seems like it.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve already hurt people on this island aplenty, so I doubt they will forgive me.&quot; He stated, adjusting his collar as he took a single step forward.

<strong>&quot;And I don&#39;t intend to stop now.&quot;</strong> He declared with a snarl. &quot;I don&#39;t really plan on exterminating humanity, but it might end up that way. I don&#39;t know myself, nor do I really care.&quot; He stated casually, without a single shred of worry.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t care less about what happens to this island, or the world around it. I&#39;ve lived my life after all. If I die, nothing would change.&quot; William explained with a sigh. &quot;But, the show must go on. It is a sign of poor writing to leave a work unfinished or on a cliffhanger. I&#39;m just here to iron out the ending. Every story needs a villain for the finale...&quot;

A giant quill appeared next to him, a rifle emerging at the end of it.

&quot;Let it be <strong>William Henry Ireland.&quot;</strong> He affirmed with a sinister grin. &quot;The Class is Assassin. The objective is to stop whatever it is you all are trying to do.&quot;

He seemed passionate, but his face curled once Dante and Octavius mentioned Vortigern.</span>

&quot;Enough about that gloomy talk now, will you? One of us has to vanish, so let&#39;s make sure to have fun till then!&quot; He cackled, snapping his fingers as Alex suddenly pounced at Allen, keeping him and Dante distracted.

&quot;Good boy, Alex! You make for a fine fido.&quot; He laughed, before Octavius intercepted him and attempted to cut down the man where he stood. All it elicited was an amused growl, as William blocked the blow with the butt end of his rifle.

Of course, he was no Saber. He couldn&#39;t resist the impact, as he was tossed aside and sent flying a fair distance away from Octavius. Bechers and containers fell on the floor as he stumbled around a pile of paperwork. Despite some minor injury to his shoulder, he was laughing.

&quot;Wordsmith? You? Hahahahahah!&quot; He cackled, stifling his laughter with half of his hand. &quot;They do say that you can trace comedy&#39;s origins all the way back to Greece. Yet another thing you Romans copied, I imagine.&quot; He twisted his shoulder around, regaining the use of his arms as he witnessed the scene between Alex, Allen and Dante. A smile curled on his face.

&quot;Hmmmm, say, Mr. Roman. This is just my opinion of things, but you have all the power to fix this, don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t you have a little thing called <strong>Auram Pax</strong> or whatever? Maybe if you tried using it, it would calm everyone down. No one would need to kill each other.&quot; He smirked, staring at Dante while saying that. &quot;Say, why not give it a try? I&#39;m no match for a Saber, after all, so I&#39;m positively harmless!&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span></span>

As the slash from Allen&#39;s blade came down, Alex twisted their head. Causing the blade to bounce off of their helmet. Their other arm which was still in a sling, shot out and grabbed Allen&#39;s sword hand by the wrist.

At William&#39;s taunt, Alex began twisting Allen&#39;s wrist and pressed with their knife with renewed strength. Allen could feel some hint of fury in the figure of Alex, but it wasn&#39;t directed at him in particular.

<strong>&quot;Alone...&quot;</strong> The emotionless static filled voice rang out again. <strong>&quot;Was I always alone? Did I ever want to be alone? Am I alone even now?&quot;</strong></span>

He found himself in a grappling contest with the man who had just moments ago warned that he may end up killing him. 

&quot;Graf support Saber!!&quot; he yelled as he remained mainly focused on Alex. That being said that didn&#39;t meant he hadn&#39;t heard what that man named William had said before and any possible sympathy was already been thrown out of the window but hearing both Dante and Octavius mention this Vortigern make him want to make it sure that Octavius had enough help. William had told that Vortigern was gonna but right off the bat it strike Allen as liar so trusting him was out of the question. 

Alex was stronger than he looked, they seemed quite equal in strength then again he was still a bit drained from using his transformation.  As Alex spoke once again Allen grit his teeth and wrapped flames around his legs. 

&quot;Naa.... I will keep ya company for a while.&quot; he said as he pulled back a bit moved his blazing leg aiming to kick Alex in his left side.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Octavius smirked at William after the attack and listened to his cackling and attempt at an insult on his heritage as a Roman. While he enjoyed the writer assassin&#39;s attempts at riling him up, to goad him, to make him work as he wants him to, Octavius hardly budged. The Saber spun Auram Pax in his hand as he stood his ground against William before scoffing at William. This servant was nothing more than a madman entangled and entranced by a plague. 

&quot;My dear William, do you not understand the eccentricities of an Emperor? Especially of Rome? To garner the 400 years of peace that I created, I had to be good with my words in a way that enthralled the masses. I made myself a god amongst Rome not with a blade, but with my words. Surely a learned gentleman such as yourself would understand that.&quot; 

Octavius was beginning to understand something about this encounter, why the Assassin would arrive himself to split them up, to make them overwhelm themselves with interpersonal conflict. At least with the prior encounters with William and his Vortigern in context, the Emperor came to a hypothesis. Possibly a risky one, but with an individual with the personality like William, he merely wanted to get the reaction to gather the rest, first, however, he would have to continue to act along in William&#39;s charade, especially now that the servant was looking past him and towards the masters.

Especially now that it was clear that it was in the minds of the Nirvanan and William. Could his trump card equal the strength of the corruption of the mud? Could he cancel the effects of the mud&#39;s hold on the islander or even William? The Assassin couldn&#39;t possibly be throwing in the towel so easily after one strike, especially not after coming all this way to face them. Beyond the tactical nature and intelligence that Octavius held, he couldn&#39;t understand the mind of something as twisted as someone under the influence of an all-corrupting force. 

He couldn&#39;t risk simply taking the bait to see what he was planning, especially not on some whim from the enemy himself. William was too dangerous to take lightly. As well it hardly made sense for the servant to give up after saying that he wouldn&#39;t stop then. Which was it? Give up or not stopping no matter the cost? A simple swing from his blade couldn&#39;t possibly make the mad man stop because he was overpowered once. As well, how did William know about his Noble Phantasm, well enough about his second one to make such a guess, although saying the wrong name. There was a trick to this, and Octavius wanted to solve it before it was too late. He made another readied stance as he glared at William. Above all else, his words held a threatening level of malice to them. Malice pointed to those behind him. He could guess that William knew that he couldn&#39;t beat Octavius in a one-on-one, so there was something more to this. While he was still in the dark as ever with William, he couldn&#39;t stand by to wait and see what he will do. The Roman grinned at William. Octavius had to take the bait, but he needed to add one last remark.

<strong>&quot;True Name Release.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble. I have the blood of a tyrant in my veins. The spirit of my ancestors was engraved into my bones. The hearts of my fallen countryman stain my clothes and stain my hair. I carry their burdens willingly. Their sacrifice paved a road of gold for the future of peace. I have turned stone to marble and marble to ash in conquest for that peace! The time for conquering has ended, lay down thine weapons and behold the glory of my great empire! See the peace that has been made at the end of strife! There will be Peace Before Death!&quot;</strong>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The room, hallway, and everything in between were transformed as Octavius unleashed his Noble Phantasm. Everything in the affected range was changed to Roman architecture, the walls, floors, and ceiling was made of marble. Paintings adorned the walls. A large artwork painted on the roof depicting the battle of Issus and various busts of Roman Emperors past lined the walls. As well, a lifelike statue of Octavius stood in front of where the Grail mud sat, as a warding presence.

As for everyone within the effects of Pax Romana, any attempt at aggression was stopped, Allen&#39;s flames disappeared and both Allen and Alex&#39;s strength and intent for combat would be eliminated. The thoughts could still be there, however, any action to cause harm would be nullified. 

All Magecraft within Pax Romana that held any violent intent would be stopped.

Any motion to cause harm would be stopped.

The necessary intent needed to kill would be stopped.

Almost immediately those within the area of effect would see their wounds start to heal and their mana replenish.

Noble Phantasms beyond Pax Romana might as well have been nothing more than a prop. Octavius himself made Auram Pax disappear in his hand as he did not need the blade within the Noble Phantasm.

This was Octavius&#39;s primary Noble Phantasm, The Roman Peace that he created within the Roman Empire for 400 years made manifest as a forced ceasefire right now.

&quot;Satisfied?&quot; The Roman asked with a suspicious look at the writer. Now he simply needed to see what the forger had planned from there.</span>

It was no different than the insults he had received in life, just another stack to add to the pile. No, William was used to being abused and ridiculed. Reviled and demonized. The difference between then and now was that he had something to look forward to past those insults.

Like he expected, Octavius bought into the bait. He didn&#39;t know whether the Roman was gullible or merely playing along, but he didn&#39;t care. All he wanted to do was observe their reaction. A display of strength at their peak.

It made it all the more satisfying to break it down.

In fact, once Octavius was done, he felt rather...plain. Alex was still attacking the others like a beast, but Allen still harbored killing intent. He couldn&#39;t feel the golden presence of his Noble Phantasm either, which left him shocked. He didn&#39;t expect Pax Romana to counter the mud&#39;s effects, but surely it should have been capable of calming down Allen and Dante.

&quot;Hey, Mr. Roman.&quot; William giggled. &quot;Take a look at the ceiling for me, will you?&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Octavius did just that and noticed that the lab was as sterile as ever. No golden glow. No traces of Pax Romana. It was as if he had never activated his Noble Phantasm in the first place.

But he was sure! Absolutely sure that he had activated it! Not only did he declare the chant in full, but he also made sure to keep an eye out for any trickery on William&#39;s part. The forger, however, had kept his word and remained immobile. Then how-

&quot;You see,&quot; William scratched the back of his head. &quot;a bird told me that you had a Noble Phantasm that could heal others, which isn&#39;t good for me. Just like how I hate bloated books, I also hate dragging things out. So, that had to go.&quot; 

He calmly explained, albeit Octavius didn&#39;t quite understand what William meant just yet. As if understanding that, William sighed and tapped his forehead.

<strong>&quot;Pax Romana doesn&#39;t exist anymore.&quot;</strong> He chuckled, shrugging in the face of Octavius&#39; shock. &quot;I removed it from the world. Or, to be more accurate, I removed it from <em>this</em> world.&quot; He tilted his head with a sinister smile, before revealing a book in his hand titled <em>The Characterization of Octavius by J. Leeds Barroll.</em>

&quot;It&#39;s no more than fiction now, as it should be. What, you thought humans could actually fire laser beams out of their eyes?&quot; William snorted. &quot;What a joke. You were born human in the first place. You should know the difference between reality and fiction more than me!&quot;

The Roman Emperor was most likely still befuddled by such a concept. The idea of losing his Noble Phantasm never dawned upon him, much less from someone like William. He had no idea who their true identity was in life, but no writer should be capable of stealing another Servant&#39;s Noble Phantasm. It must have been a trick, but he couldn&#39;t tell what it was.</span>

It was then that he finally took notice of William&#39;s rifle. Not only was it oddly shaped, being part of a giant quill, but it harbored dangerous amounts of magical energy. His stare was so intense that even William took notice of it.

&quot;And until <strong>This Solemn Mockery</strong> is over,&quot; William slammed his rifle on the wall. &quot;then you will continue being just a normal person, Mr. Roman. Everything fictional about you. Everything fantastical about you. <strong>I can erase with a single bullet.&quot;</strong> He pointed a finger at his own head and mimicked the act of firing.

&quot;That&#39;s my Noble Phantasm. My purpose for existing. An Assassin of Fiction.&quot; He smirked as he admired the lab&#39;s ceiling.

&quot;No one will feel your Roman peace ever again. No one will embrace Pax Romana&#39;s aura. It belongs to the history books.&quot; He stated, tossing the book on Octavius&#39; life aside before staring at the Saber&#39;s blade.

&quot;And...I&#39;m not stopping at just that.&quot;

He blinked, and so did Saber.

When their eyes opened, Auram Pax was gone, replaced by a humble gladius.

<strong>&quot;Meaning that Auram Pax never existed either.&quot;</strong> William shrugged. &quot;Man, is there anything special about you in the first place? Or was it all fantasy?&quot; He chuckled, watching as Octavius&#39; skills and Noble Phantasms were gradually sealed by the effect of <em>This Solemn Mockery.</em> Even their parameters dropped, reducing them down to the level of an average magus almost.

&quot;Now <em>this</em> is what I call poetry, Mr. Roman. It&#39;s like the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, but retold as something new!&quot; He mocked Saber with glee, laughing non stop as he left Octavius with no option to defend himself. The strongest Servant Class was now reduced to a mere laughing stock of a Servant as their Spirit Origin had been entirely compromised.</span>

William&#39;s lips curled into a smug grin. &quot;Now, Mr. Roman. How do you plan to even fight me like that? I&#39;m just dying to know.&quot; He leaned on a wall and taunted. &quot;At this point, even an Assassin like me can kick your butt. You killed Vortigern once, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

He started loading bullets into his rifle.

&quot;I&#39;ll make sure to repay the favor.&quot;

<strong>BANG!</strong>

A bullet headed straight towards Octavius. If he were in his prime, he would mock it. Call it slow and weak. But he couldn&#39;t, he could barely see it even. He knew for a fact that his current body could not tank that blow. William never planned on fighting him fairly, but to bring him down to his level instead. Such was the nature of an Assassin&#39;s tricks. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span></span>

Alex didn&#39;t even flinch. In fact, Allen had suddenly found himself in a precarious position with only one foot on the ground. Alex shifted their grip and pulled Allen towards them.

<strong>CLANG</strong>

A loud metallic noise rang out as Allen&#39;s face collided with Alex&#39;s helmet, knocking Allen to the ground. Alex took a step back, dazed but obviously from the mental attack than anything physical done to them so far.

<strong>&quot;Pain.&quot;</strong> The static voice said. <strong>&quot;Hatred. My closest companions...my greatest enemies. So much of it, and its roots run so deep. Like a great and terrible forest. Is this truly it?&quot;</strong>

Alex continued to stand in place, arms hanging, head pointed skyward, as if in deep contemplation. Seemingly uncaring of their smoldering coat.</span>

All of it had been enough to make the doctor flinch a bit. But not to worry about that, Alex had gotten more mad more active, and more unstable. The doctor focused on the magus before him, gripping a wad of sacred text balled up in his pocket and pulled out into the, the chains sprawling forward only to grip around the islander’s ankles. He’d focus on keeping Alex down first, then, he could access the idea of William and his issues. One thing at a time.</em>

<em>The chains around Alex were restrictive enough, had he not been agile enough then they’d pull his joints together, threatening to have to pull forcefully enough in order remove them, they gracefully moved about his arms and legs, and eventually they moved to bind them together as if he were a prisoner. However, even then a free chain was quick to wrap around his neck, keeping it bound to his legs and feet, making it where any movement from him would have attempted to choke him as well.</em>

“I don’t know what your problem is, but I cannot afford to get distracted with it. . .”

<em>He muttered to the man, focusing back at William Henry Ireland. So that was who he was, the fraud. A hack of William Shakespeare himself. And to think he didn’t expect it. No, criticism on his deductions could come later. He had to focus on what William had done, he could erase what was fantastic? What could that have even meant? Negation if his noble phantasm? He couldn’t just do that, and yet he had done it. Dante looked at the other servant, worry prominent on his features. She’d need to protect Octavius, and she’d need to do it now. That was, until he could even figure out what that ability could fully do.</em></span>

It wasn&#39;t an issue of Allen holding back or Alex muscles being hard enough to tank the impact. Allen had been taugh the basics of hand to hand combat and while he was far from being an expert he had kicked many people from that experience and the feeling he got when it impacted Alex&#39;s side he knew he had managed to land a good blow so the lack of reaction was strange even more as not even the flames seemed to bring out a reaction.

His attempt to understand how Alex left his mind in utter shock and even in a worse position, as Alex pulled him forward and smashed his head towards his helmet Allen could do nothing but fell to the ground as his mind became a mess. Pain and confusion mingled as he could only produce a single coherent though as he laid in the ground. 

&#39;No wonder my knife couldn&#39;t pierce that helmet&#39; 

He didn&#39;t knew how long he remained laying on the floor, it may not be more than a few minutes but for him it felt longer as stumble as he tried to stand up he continue to try and make some sense of what had just happened. His head hurt like hell, he couldn&#39;t even see properly nor even get up but in order to be able to withstand all of that he needed to focus. As painful as it was he tried to think, Dante&#39;s actions gave him the chance to recover and understand what had happening. Even now as Dante restrained him the flames continue to kick Alex&#39;s coat but the man seemed to not even notice. 

Was it just insanity? Was his madness such that everything else besides killing them was not worth noticing? It was hard to give a proper veredict but he could understand something, Alex couldn&#39;t feel pain. That was the only thing that make sense to Allen which for some reason actually make him feel slightly better at  this situation.</span>

As he heard Dante talk more  and how desperate he sounded he began to slowly get back up, flames began to once again come together around his arms. He didn&#39;t how long Dante&#39;s restrains would be able to stop Alex and the situation seemed to get worse by the second they needed to put Alex down for good. 

&quot;Blaze!&quot;

The crimson flames transformed into two gigantic arms, he moved his left hand forward and the fiery crimson arm mimic his movements, reaching for Alex, its fingers remained open as the red palm finally reached its target. Even then it didn&#39;t stopped, Allen intent was to use this extra appendage to smash Alex into the wall before he snapped out of whatever his mind was going through at the moment.</span>

Alex had always felt disgust and hatred towards others for their loud and disgusting thoughts. But that didn’t stop at the other inhabitants, not at all.

<strong>”I see now. I have been alone, all this time.”</strong> Alex’s synthesized voice rang out, however it had more conviction in it now.

Ice golems started to rapidly manifest. Throwing themselves at the fire and tearing at the weakened chains.

Alex had not only attacked outsiders, but Nirvanians as well. Even Alex’s own family fell victim to their hand. This made no sense with the Mud’s directive to harm Non-Nirvanians, unless…

<strong>”Of course I’m alone. That’s the only outcome when the world is filled with stupid hateful animals like you.”</strong>

The bindings restricting Alex fell to their feet, in a puddle that was once many Golem familiars, having used their bodies to smother the fire. Alex then moved closer to the drill hole.

<strong>”I am Nirvana. All of you are nothing more than unwelcome pests.”</strong>

Alex thrust their hand into the mud and attempted to absorb it power, using their mental abilities to take it in and seal it in their own head. After all, Alex had the perfect container and the Mud had already invited itself in.</span>

Then he looked to William as Auram Pax became a regular gladius. How annoying this whole thing was. Even when the Assassin was without Vortigern he was still the sharpest thorn in his side. It was fine however, even as the forger was raving on about how he could beat the Emperor, the Roman seemed unfazed by this turn of events. It was true he had been weakened, but he wasn&#39;t going to cower or give William the reaction he wanted from the change in fate. The Roman had already started moving by the time the Assassin fired his weapon. Octavius rolled to his right to just barely dodge the bullet from the Assassin before looking up sharply to William with a smirk. 

&quot;Well done William, you couldn&#39;t beat me using your pet Berserker three times not your power as a servant so you decide to fight me as a man while you stay a Servant. Bravo to you!&quot; Octavius stood up from his roll and dashed to William. &quot;Well done!&quot;

While he wasn&#39;t at his peak of strength, not even close, he still had his skills as a Roman and everything else that made him who he was. It mattered not that Octavius had been weakened, he would fight regardless. When Octavius closed the distance between them, he feinted with his gladius via a downward slash from above while pushing out a punch from underneath, aiming for William, center mass.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Alex&#39;s mind was in disarray. One could not tell whether he had been born broken or if the mud was to blame. Regardless, he was an obstacle in the investigators&#39; path, one that wouldn&#39;t stop attacking them until their minds rung silent. Such was his passion for silence that he even started considering the forbidden fruits of the mud, releasing himself from Alex&#39;s hold as he extended an arm towards the opening of the drill hole, where traces of the Grail mud seeped through.

He made contact.

...

His circuits went ablaze. His mind was further fractured, dissected into unequal pieces with a shoddy knife. Pure evil coursed through his veins, evil born out of humanity and slowly gathered into the Holy Grail. He didn&#39;t know how or why that happened, but it didn&#39;t matter, for he endured the effects of the ultimate corruption on his body. His skin felt itchy and his flesh became bloated, being filled with magical energy that was far beyond what any human being could reasonably handle.

But this painful connection enabled him to see deeper into the Grail mud, as if witnessing it from its own perspective. The hole was a mere entrance. The start of it all. In reality, the mud was never located in the middle of the labs. That was only in the past.

Why were the trees filled with corrupting tree sap? Why was the island going mad, with animals being infected by the mud despite not having entered the labs once? Nirvana was calm just a few days ago. William couldn&#39;t have spread the mud so efficiently in just a few days.

But Alex understood. The drill was never meant to bring the mud to the surface, but to give the mud an opening. The waters had drowned the mud, but by drilling far enough, William managed to let it make contact with the roots of Nirvana&#39;s trees. The trees, believing the mud to be a nutrient, absorbed it with glee. They nurtured it and gave it room to grow. This was something only Nirvana could do, with its gigantic tree species that no other city housed.</span>

It was the perfect storm. The perfect conditions and climate for the mud&#39;s rebirth. Mother nature itself had directly worked against them. How ironic, for a citizen of Nirvana to find out the truth over the investigators.

And Alex&#39;s reward was the knowledge that he was dying, that the mud was far too much energy for him to contain. Malicious thoughts ran through his head, cursing him, his family, his enemies and his allies. A deep curse that eroded his body.

He was now akin to a mana bomb, filled with energy and ready to explode at any time. The only choice he had was on how to use this newfound energy before he burnt out like a dying star.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">William observed Alex lunge for the mud, but he remained still. He knew not to worry, since he had already witnessed the mud&#39;s reactions on humans first hand. If Alex could somehow surprise him, it would simply make this play a lot more entertaining.

Unlike Octavius, who had yet to grasp the full extent of William&#39;s abilities. The forger yawned, letting the Roman yap as they please as a gladius collided straight with William&#39;s head...

...and passed through it.

&quot;I see that your fame as a tactician was a myth as well.&quot; He joked. &quot;No wonder my Noble Phantasm erased that as well.&quot; He proceeded to shove his rifle into Octavius&#39; chest and pull the trigger.

<strong>BANG!</strong>

Blood seeped out of the hole as the bullet emerged from the other side, leaving Dante at a loss. Octavius was one of the most powerful Servants he had ever seen, being of the strongest Class and capable of standing toe to toe with incredible opponent. Yet William seemed to be merely toying with him.

Octavius keeled over, feeling unbearable pain course through his body as the bullet caused him to cough blood. It felt strange, since projectiles from enemy Servants had barely scratched him in the past. This, however, felt terrible. It reminded him of the feeling of being pierced with arrows back during the wars he participated in.

His body felt oddly <em>human.</em> As if any semblance of fiction from his Spirit Origin had been erased. All that was left now was Octavius, the man in the flesh.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t care less about what sort of man you really were.&quot; William remarked, enjoying the sight of Octavius&#39; pained expression. &quot;So, I&#39;m not going to. That&#39;s my personal skill, <strong>Murder of Reality.</strong> Nothing that is real may hurt me, especially someone as well-documented as you.&quot; He grinned.</span>

Dante would be shocked at the revelation. It reminded him of the encounter at the forest, where William seemed to be effortlessly dodging Granel and Ace&#39;s attacks. He attributed it to Shakespeare&#39;s skill, Self-Preservation, but it made much more sense now. William was merely <em>pretending</em> to dodge those attacks. In reality, they never hit him in the first place.

Now that he no longer needed to act, he could flaunt about his immunity as much as he wanted.

&quot;The only thing that can harm me is fiction. Words hurt, you know?&quot; William chuckled, resting his quill rifle on his shoulder. &quot;A Heroic Spirit would be my worst enemy, since they are beings of reality and fiction combined.&quot; He mimicked a hole with one of his hands, before promptly closing it into a fist.

<strong>&quot;So I plugged that hole.</strong> The moment I hit you with my Noble Phantasm, it&#39;s almost as if you stopped being a Heroic Spirit in the first place. You are nothing but a man now, Mr. Roman.&quot; He smirked, before suddenly pointing the barrel of his gun right at Octavius&#39; forehead.

&quot;Who is the pet now?&quot; He narrowed his eyes. He didn&#39;t say it, but one could tell that he never appreciated how Octavius referred to Vortigern as a mere lackey. &quot;Since you&#39;re a man, you might as well die like one.&quot;

He pulled the trigger.

<em>BANG!</em>

William had made his statement of how he had so easily stripped Octavius of everything that had made him special as a heroic spirit, leaving him there to just be a . . . Hero. From what the Doctor could gather, at this point, he was human. As frail as any person in the room save the forger would have been if there was no one to help, before he heard the loud bang from William’s rifle.</em>

<em>The first drops of blood loud enough to sound in his senses as a ceaseless dropping off rain. He could see the hole the bullet came from, the slight gap in Octavius’ frame, from what was thought to be small and what could have seen as inconsequential before, now being large and detrimental currently. Dante looked at his servant in a mixture of horror and awe. It hadn’t been easy, he couldn’t see how being human would have changed him physically, but this wound. . . That in itself changed his entire view of it. And with how quickly William had confirmed his suspicions, it was harder and harder to find himself a way to even defeat the servant. In that moment, he saw the twitch of William getting ready to lift his rifle again, and the doctor was beginning to lift his hand from his pocket. He couldn’t harm william, he likely wouldn’t have been able to due those damn skills he had, but he could do something about Octavius. The moment the rifle had gotten to Octavius’ chest, the chains had already been on their destination wrapping around Octavius chest while the others tethered themselves to a wall only to yank him backwards from the rifle’s gaze. When it had retreated to its other side, they dispersed, keeping him beside Dante and away from harm. He would keep Shakespeare away from him, for as long as this skill continued, it couldn’t have continued on forever, everything has a limit.</em></span>

<em>Meanwhile, while he had focused on his servant, the chains around Alex tightened around the Bondre as he moved towards the grail mud. The golden links decorating him like an accessory tightening into his skin. Had he struggled to continue moving, had he persisted to continue to move about, the chains themselves continued to constrict him like a snake. Soon enough, the air he’d need to breathe would become limited in supply with how a chain had wrapped around windpipe. The owner of those chains however, paid no mind to it. All he could focus on was his servant, William, and these shenanigans the latter continued to play with them. He reached again for another crumpled scripture, trying to ready himself. He couldn’t defeat william, but he could try to protect himself. But just as so easily as he thought that defending would be a way to survive, another instinctual thought whispered and coped him. He could run. They could run. Run and allow Nirvana to have to deal with the issues that this servant had caused, leave the rest to handle the work that Dante and Octavius would have so quickly given up on. It’d take constant reminders that his servant would need to hear they couldn’t beat the odds, but eventually even with the anger, he knew the servant would see the undeniable truth. The doctor’s mind was in a frenzy for it.

A giant sword replaced it as Allen hold his knife in the other hand. He began to understand what was happening again, the pain remained but the clarity had come back. Still his focus was divided in between what was happening with William and Alex at the current moment. He began to swing his crimson blade and his extra arm to keep them at bay as he tried to avoid an even worse case scenario he couldn&#39;t see what Alex was doing with all the golems blocking his sights but due their sheer amount and with Dante going to support his weakened servant Allen tried to avoid them getting overrun by them. 

It worked to a degree, the golems quickly melt as the fire blade and arm cut through them as they were butter. He would leave Graf to deal with William for the time being as he needed to make sure Alex was dealt with before going and helping Dante and Octavius. They needed to stop both of them now of who knows what may happen afterwards even if this place was doomed, who knew what could happen now that the seal on the mud had been broken. 

As he destroy the golems and finally got Alex into his sights he remained still as he saw him touching the black mud. 

&quot;You... you fucking idiot!!!&quot; he yelled at him, at this moment Alex would feel his anger raining at him but mixed with that anger there was sadness and pity for the man. Both had seen it in those monitors, what the mud did to people, Alex was gonna suffer a painful death and even if that man was an enemy Allen believed no one deserved such death. Those emotions would hit Alex mind loud and clear as Allen slowly moved towards him.</span>

Why was she spacing out like this as of late she had no idea. All of these happenings just seemed to overwhelm her for a bit but once Octavius was having issues with Willian the person she thought in the past to be a benevolent benefactor she decided to throw caution to the wind. &quot;Captain Cover!&quot; The warship personified into a little girl shouted and leveled all fourteen of her guns at the man who threatened her ally.

She snapped out of her stupor in the most violent way one could thing of as the room was filled and shook by a deafening KABOOM! each and every single shell had their fuses disabled so they didnt explode within the structure but still would sure as hell hurt and hopefully deal enough damage to interrupt the final blow from Williams quill rifle that threatened to end Octavius right there and then.</span>

They felt the corruption spread throughout their very being. Moreover they saw it, how much and how far this corruption had truly spread. Every inch of Nirvana had been contaminated, spread by the trees and plant like a massive network of evil and corruption. Nirvana and its inhabitants were already too far gone. Dante&#39;s chains were corroded by the Mud&#39;s taint now spreading throughout Alex&#39;s body. Alex gripped it and tore it off as if it were made of paper. An aura of malice enveloped the room.

<strong>&quot;Worthless insects, all of you.&quot;</strong> If Alex had felt any of Allen&#39;s emotions they were completely ignored. Any trace of mercy or restraint had vanished from them.

Alex raised their hand towards Allen and snapped their fingers. A pillar of Mud rose in front of him, taking the form of a towering figure. It looked similar to that of Alex&#39;s Ice Golems but that evil corruption could not be mistaken. The Mud Golem raised a blade and started attacking Allen with a fury of slashes.

Alex then pointed a finger at William. 

<strong>&quot;Die.&quot;</strong>

Immediately, William felt the exact same pain Alex was currently going through. Multiplied and strengthen by the pure hatred Alex felt for every other thinking being and added upon with a multitude of other horrific experiences and injuries that Alex could call on.

<strong>&quot;Die die die die die diediediediediediediedie!&quot;</strong>

William&#39;s mind and body was racked by imaginary pain, backed by a seemingly infinite malice that wanted nothing more than for him to drop dead this instant.

<strong>&quot;DIE&quot;</strong></span>

The malice that filled the room was enough to send shivers through his spine, fear began to invade him as didn&#39;t knew what he was fighting against anymore nor if there was even a chance to win. What stood in front of him was no longer human, Alex has turned into something so monstrous Allen couldn&#39;t even began to understood.  

The desire to run away began to grew inside of him, just like it had go through Dante a few moments before as he saw his own servant be weakened. But before he could even take a step backwards a loud boom brought him back to reality just in the nick of time. As the black monster continue to strike at him Allen did his best to defend. With each strike he was slowly pushed back but at the same time each time his extra arm or blade Allen&#39;s desire to run began to fade. He didn&#39;t need to see it to know, his servant was still fighting even their enemies were different Graf was still at his side and that was all he needed right now. After all he had promised her he would fight, he would fight at her side till the end. 

 He was eventually pushed back, the golem was relentless and it barely gave Allen any time to figure a way to deal with its power and speed. There was always the option of going after Alex itself but the black golem wouldn&#39;t let him get near him so easily. So one way or another he had to defeat this golem. 

He began to move away trying to put some distance between the two as he make he gigantic arm and blade he hold disappear. 

&quot;Diamond dust!!!&quot; he yelled as white flames covered his arm as he shoot a beam of cold air at the golem. 

The cold air began slowly freeze the floor that separated him and the golem as a thin layer of ice began to try and cover it. Allen knew well that he couldn&#39;t be able to freeze something like that but it should slowly him down and let me come up with something</span>

Octavius was a hair&#39;s breadth away from perishing right there, William&#39;s rifle pressed on his forehead. The forger&#39;s fingers were steady on the trigger, about to press down at any second.

Then chains started enveloping the target, wrapped around their chest as Octavius was dragged away before William could pull the trigger. His eyes widened as he noticed Dante moving in the distance.

&quot;You got a death wish?&quot; William asked, but he didn&#39;t expect a reply, since he had already begun to take aim at Dante. It didn&#39;t matter what happened to the Servant, so long as the Master was taken care of.

<em>KA-BOOM!</em>

That was when various shells collided with him, sending him flying backward and causing him to crash into walls. Graf had interfered, tossing shells at her target as the lab&#39;s walls were now filled with dents and openings. Such was the power of a modern battleship.

Which made William incredibly lucky, for Graf&#39;s nature as a modern Servant made her intrinsically rooted in reality more than fiction. Documents pertaining to her were recent, resulting in a lack of mystery. The shells were akin to rocks and pebbles at most.

But sticks and stones could still hurt.

&quot;Ugh.&quot; William grunted, emerging from the pile of shells with slight bruises on his skin along with creases on his clothes. He seemed more annoyed than hurt, but Graf had succeeded in saving Dante&#39;s life with her attack. &quot;You have a ship of all things? If I were you, I&#39;d use it to get the hell out.&quot; He remarked, thinking about whether he wanted Allen or Graf to be his next target, before he witnessed Alex&#39;s metamorphosis in the distance.</span>

It was horrifying, the man fully accepting the traces of the Grail mud despite how destructive it was. It overwhelmed him completely, filling him with pure malice and a decent sum of magical energy. Too much for a human body to handle. Alex was nothing more than a dying star, but a star could still choose on how far it wanted to shine before it collapsed on itself.

Alex chose to spread his hate around him, primarily focusing on William due to the forger being at the root of everything. Hateful, suicidal messages started barraging William&#39;s brain, rattling his consciousness and almost severing his nerves. He was a Servant, but he wasn&#39;t particularly strong. A supercharged Master could affect him.

As blood trickled down from his ears, his limbs moved on their own, as if affected by Alex&#39;s words. His own rifle started pointing at his chin, subtly influenced by the Bondre&#39;s words. It was a struggle to even resist those invasive thoughts.

This was not a battle of skill, but one of mind. William would gracefully accept death, since there was nothing left for him to live in this world. Vortigern was gone, and his objective to create a masterpiece had been ruined. The only reason he was protecting the Grail mud was out of pure spite.

&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m not-&quot;

...No, it wasn&#39;t just that. He knew that the mud was evil, but he also knew that he was the root of it all. As such, he couldn&#39;t let himself die with dignity. He knew that it was his punishment to die as a villain. To be utterly reviled and hated. But most importantly...

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m not dying to some fodder villain!&quot;</strong> He shouted, headbutting his rifle and causing it to now point towards Alex. With all of the strength he could muster, he pulled the trigger.

If Alex still had his wits about him, he might have found William&#39;s last words to be rather insulting. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have the luxury of caring, as the Servant enhanced bullet pierced through his helmet and collided with his forehead. His skull was cracked and the insides of his brain rattled. He was still alive and conscious, but his thoughts were now in chaotic disarray. William had just lit a fuse, turning Alex into a ticking time bomb as the protection of the helmet waned. Alex&#39;s thoughts started to overwhelm him completely, devouring him from the inside as his mind threatened to implode and take down everyone else in the lab with him. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiderrock#5389">@Spiderrock</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Raffia Kiryuin#0467">@Raffia Kiryuin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span></span>

<em>Am I dying? No, I think I died when I touched that Mud.</em>

Alex&#39;s life flashed before their eyes. They were assaulted by memories of hate and cruelty. The way Alex&#39;s family slowly disowned them after their abilities awakened. The savagery of the inhabitants towards the outsiders. The hateful retaliation of the outsiders towards the inhabitants. The sad, stupid little drama queen behind it all. Why had Alex tolerated these &quot;people&quot;, these savages for all this time, Alex couldn&#39;t even remember.

Alex took off their helmet and threw it to the ground. Their face had thin features with dark circles under their eyes. Their hair dropped down to just above their neck and was stark white. Their eyes burned with the corrupt power and malice of the Grail Mud but there was a tiredness in them as well.

&quot;Mankind should&#39;ve drowned that day over a century ago.&quot; Alex starkly stated before their head was enveloped in a massive star of dark psychic energy.

The dying star that was Alex started to reach out mentally as far as their untapped abilities could reach. At the same time they began to draw in as much of that evil and corruptive power as possible, trying to tap into that vast network of corrupted roots to reach out even further towards Nirvana&#39;s edges. Everyone in the room felt a malevolent pressure in their minds, like the jaws of some great beast slowly biting down on their heads.

Two more pillars of Grail Mud shot up from the ground, forming into Golems that maneuvered themselves between the others and Alex. Their final orders to defend Alex until the end.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">To say that the Roman was surprised would be an understatement. The events ran through his mind like a slide show. His failed attack against William. The gunshot. The counterattack from the others against William. His bleeding chest. Dante pulling him to safety using his bindings. The very human feeling of... what was it... shock? Yes, that was it, or something of the sort. Breathing had become difficult momentarily, a hole in the chest would do that to a man. That was a funny thought to the Saber. A man? He was a man yes. Although he had been made into a human once again, no longer servant. That had been a fun source of well-regulated panic in the emperor, although he hadn&#39;t shown it outright, especially as he was pulled away from the Assassin. Although despite his state, the Emperor couldn&#39;t help but give a sly smile to William. Try as he might, the forger still couldn&#39;t kill the man. 

<em>Bang!</em>

At first, the Roman thought that he had been killed right there on the spot. However as his senses became clearer once again as he shook himself out of his stupor, the Saber looked back to William who was being torn asunder mentally by Alex. Then the Saber looked to Alex, now without his helmet and now fully consumed by the mud. Then came the new, different pain. He felt the caving pressure on his head, the terrible energy that engulfed the inside of his mind like a plague. The saber began to stand from where he had been pulled to safety and began to slowly move towards Alex. Truth be told, the Saber was still in pain, immense pain. Pain from the bullet wound, pain from Alex, pain from knowing the fate of the living things on this island. He wanted to bring peace to these people. Even if that peace was in death. 

&quot;Be still.&quot;

Octavius held his gladius in his hand as he turned back, holding his sword like a spear before quickly spinning back and throwing the blade straight toward Alex&#39;s head.</span>

No his gun quickly shifted over to face Alex and with a bang the shot had yeeted itself across the room and right into the forehead of the possessed man.

Her captain also wasnt fairing all that hot so she leveled three guns his way and shot the smaller ones that had managed to reload by now at the mud golem before running towards Allen. &quot;Its bout time we dip... there is nothing we can do here.&quot; she spoke over the others as she went to grab her master and just run away. It was something she was famous for after all. she could show up hit hard and then run away before things got out of hand. She could feel the malevolent pressure digging at her mind and invoking memories of her previous capatain abandoning her. Looking out onto the shore as he pulled the trigger that caused her almost a centurys worth of sadness as she laid just beneath the surface of the waves. She remembered those long years of cold dark loneliness but then the memory of first meeting Allen showed up and how they struck a deal. Fight to the very end together so that they may grasp victory. But what did victory really mean to her now? Things had gotten muddled in these long dangerous nights upon nirvana that she could no longer figure that out. Shaking her head to get back on track and push past the pressure she fired backwards at Alex and his mud golems to slow them down so at least she and Allen could get out but she was trying to stall for time so that Octavius and dante had a chance of getting out of this mess too. Thus far she was only firing from her small guns while the bigger ones were still reloading and of course still had their fuses disabled as to not bring down the labs upon thei</span>

As he continue to shoot cold air to the Golem in a futile attempt to stop him he began to think there was no options for them at this point. He was beginning to feel tired and without his transformation their options to stop Alex were not many. 

&quot;Who gave ya the right to decide that you moron!!!&quot; he yelled at Alex as he heard him speak. His words about how humanity should have perished 100 years ago make Allen&#39;s blood boil. 

But as angry as he was he really couldn&#39;t come with any solutions, this golem was proving to be a moving fortress which honestly needed to land a good hit to put him down for good. It was then that Graf&#39;s shoot give him a respite he so much needed as they collided with the golem momentarily stopping his advance as he moved closer to her 

He allowed himself to take a few deep breaths as he moved through the pain and try make a decision. Should they retreat or not? The issue was Alex, his word and how he keep summoning those black things gave Allen a bad feeling but what else to do. It was as he began to think that notice Graf being careful with her weapons. He looked at Dante and Octavius. 

&quot;She is right guys we need to retreat&quot; he yelled before adding. &quot;At least enough so Graf and just bring the whole place down over without us getting buried as well.&quot;</span>

The master had what he needed, and he knew when to retreat, this had been one of those moments. The cowardice was just enough to mask as a strategic plan, so. . . Why wouldn’t he? Once William had taken his shots from Graf, and Alex had began his assault on Allen, it would have been the perfect time to simply run from the commotion. Could it have been the imaginary pain that shot up his spine? How he could feel each synapse shoot it’s painful jolt of electricity every time he blinked?</em>

<em>Dante could feel his entire being lurch forward, almost as if to bring up everything that he’d eaten before the journey, and yet nothing came out. His mind felt ablaze, his nose slowly clogging up in a crimson liquid as he felt his legs give out for a second, only a hand gripping onto the Roman’s shoulder for support, but once he had left to stop the source of it. The direction that Graf had ordered, had to be logical. Knowing that Octavius was no longer much of a heroic spirit, the best they had were to follow.</em>

<em>Dante had stood up, trying to right himself correctly before he began to look towards an exit himself. Though there was still one issue, that being William, even if he had tried to escape, what would have stopped William from preventing such a thing. Each second they stood about, Alex’s psychotic breakdown had gotten worse, the worse their minds began to threaten to break lose with it. However, with how Graf continued to bombard the golems with her shells, the doctor took his gambit and once he found an exit, tried to stand and gather himself before he bolted towards it, hoping soon that Octavius would follow him.</em></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Alex&#39;s mind was completely fractured, their skull leaking blood and brain matter as they released all of their pent up thoughts in one gigantic blast of mental energy. It took time to charge up, but it was looking to be the last time he would need to think about such pointless things. No longer would he have to sense others&#39; thoughts. No longer would he have to think.

An existence of nothing. One that he had been craving ever since the incident. One where his mind was no longer assaulted in all directions. Just total silence.

Unfortunately, someone didn&#39;t share his dream.

He could sense it. The golems slowly melting into molasses as the grail mud refused to conform to his orders. Instead, it seemed to be mocking him, removing his control over the corruption, one by one. It had no intention of assisting him, but to make him suffer. What better way of doing so than by giving him the illusion of power, and then slowly taking it away?

This erased any doubt in Alex&#39;s mind: The mud was pure evil. If he despised humanity, then the mud was merely the result of how terrible humans were. It had no dreams nor passions, simply the never-ending urge to spread and devour. Alex had outlived his purpose as a distraction.

But he was an enjoyable distraction. Therefore, the mud rewarded him, corrupting his body and magical circuits enough to turn him into a ticking, mental timebomb. He would explode in a blast of magical and mental energy, enough to destroy the main lab and anyone inside of it. Nirvana would remain, as a lone island attracting others and corrupting them.

Once the mud caught wind of everyone attempting to leave the labs, it simply accelerated the process it was undergoing on Alex&#39;s body.</span>

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

The main lab exploded, debris and mud jettisoning themselves around the area. Servants, Masters, and even Alex himself were tossed out of the crumbling building. They were all heavily injured, treading the realm between life and death. Pieces of concrete had crushed some of Dante&#39;s limbs, causing him to limp and crawl his way out. Octavius could barely keep up due to his powerless form, being forced to help his Master up and escape before the building crashed on them.

Likewise, Allen felt his eardrums rupture and his brain leak, feeling the full brunt of Alex&#39;s mental attack due to how close he and Graf were to him. His mind was jittery and he could barely think straight. It was only thanks to Graf&#39;s quick intervention that he had made it outside in one piece, at the cost of Graf&#39;s arms being injured as she shielded her Master from a sizable portion of the blast.

The main lab was completely demolished. Its ceiling had collapsed on itself due to the explosion, causing reinforced steel and concrete to fall down and trap anyone unfortunate enough to remain inside of it. Thankfully, the investigators and Alex had been catapulted outside thanks to the latter&#39;s own explosive force.

All but one person.

&quot;Ngh...&quot; William grunted, limping aimlessly around floors layered in dust and blood. The once pristine lab was now nothing more than a wreck. To make matters even worse, much of that blood was his. He only noticed a few minutes later, wondering why a trail of red followed every step he took, before realizing that he had become his own brush.

&quot;God...damnit...&quot; He cursed, stabilizing himself on a wall. The rubble had barely hurt him, but he had sustained Alex&#39;s magical impact point blank. Unlike Graf, he wasn&#39;t the type of Servant who could take direct blows easily. A gust of wind could blow him away when it came to attacks that went past his evasive skills.

He felt very human in that moment. He felt pain and he was tired. It was obvious from the gaping hole in his body that he would not survive his injuries. Not without healing, at least. Grafting was useless when his own ability didn&#39;t work on his own skin, since he never once viewed himself as a book to be edited.

His knees collapsed, forcing him to lay on a wall as he stared at the ceiling. Blood trickled down from his lips, a sign that his blood could no longer be stored in his spirit container. He was dying, that was a fact. He had never felt the thrill of a violent death in life, but now that he had finally felt it, he certainly didn&#39;t envy it.

William remained still. He pondered on the last few events that had happened in his life. On what he could have done differently. On what the investigators and Nirvanans were doing now. It didn&#39;t matter to him, but his curiosity also knew no bounds. He wanted to know...</span>

&quot;...Have I succeeded?&quot; He asked himself, his voice too weak to be heard amidst the pile of cracking rubble. He stared at the pile of blood next to his knees. It reminded him of Verga&#39;s bloodied corpse.

That gave him an idea.

&quot;Never thought I&#39;d see the day where I copy him.&quot; William spat in disgust, placing his finger on the pool of blood and getting to work. Within seconds, a crude summoning sign had been created. There was no SERVANT frame to work with, but that was fine. William didn&#39;t plan on summoning a Servant to help him. He merely wanted to see a small glimpse.

Using up all of his mana, he conducted the summon. His own body was the catalyst.

<em>flash!</em>

A poof of red smoke surrounded the lab, before a figure emerged from it. Slightly red hair with a green outfit that reminded one of times long gone. A book was in their hand, along with a charismatic smile that exuded wit.</span>

&quot;What...What is this? I can barely see my own legs. Plus, my own Master seems to be bleeding.

Normally, it would take a lot to attract Shakespeare&#39;s attention. He was a free spirit, after all, and being a Servant changed none of that. However, the peculiar conditions of his summon, along with the maddening glint in William&#39;s eyes, were more than enough to bait him into staying. There was promise in the boy. Promise of a good story. One that would leave him entertained, and perhaps even give him more ideas for a manuscript.

&quot;Mhmmm.&quot; The playwright rubbed his own chin. &quot;You seem to have experienced your fair share of trials and struggles, mister-&quot;</span>

...

And he did. The entire story. William&#39;s life. His past. His existence as a Servant. His summon to Nirvana. The terrible actions he did on the island. The creation of Vortigern. The death of his masterpiece.

The death of William Henry Ireland.

To describe all of that would have taken days. But Shakespeare was a talented writer. He understood exactly what type of person William was just by the way he spoke. The conversation was over in a matter of minutes instead.</span>

He curled into a smile. Eventually, a chuckle. Then, full blown laughter.

&quot;Hahahahahahah! What a joke! An absolute scoundrel, you are.&quot; He winked, writing down details on his book at the same time. His expectations had been met: This was great material for a future play.</span>

&quot;After all, you&#39;re the one who made me. If my writing is garbage, then so is yours by extension.&quot; He replied, wanting to one up the playwright, but relaxing his temper once he remembered how much time he had left.

&quot;...So, what did you think about it? Do you think this story too, was just a solemn mockery?&quot; His tone changed. His face morphed. One could feel grief and anxiousness behind him, as if he were awaiting the guillotine of an executioner. The judgment of the playwright that had inspired him and countless others in the past.</span>

Even when Rowena was never summoned to this island, he kept searching for her regardless. He did so with every fiber of his being.&quot; William explained calmly. &quot;He even managed to connect with the real, historical Rowena. That was when I realized he had grown on his own, two legs. He was no longer my personal creation. It was like he was...&quot;

His chest boomed with pride.

Shakespeare was right. Even William could admit it, begrudgingly. He lowered his head, his body feeling weak and powerless.</span>

Your passion for your work. Your dedication for a proper story. The countless works you have read and absorbed, to the point that you were no longer satisfied with simply reading. No, you wanted the joy of <em>creating</em>. Something that rests in the heart of every man.&quot;

He gestured with his arms, forming an arc over his shoulders as he stared at the starry sky above, one that could be seen through the cracks in the ceiling.

<strong>&quot;We are the stuff that dreams are made of.</strong> Writers even more so, as we clutch to the idea of creation itself.&quot; Shakespeare extended his arm, as if trying to grasp a star, only to fail.

&quot;...But of course, that is foolish. All we do is simply write words. We are nothing compared to gods.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Alas, those failures are what keep us living. Those attempts are what prove that we are alive. For what is writing, but to share one&#39;s joy with a reader? To write without sharing is not to write at all.&quot;

He gave William a wink and a nod. That was all the confirmation William needed to understand what Shakespeare meant.</span>

But he had found the courage to live with that fear. His sins would scar him for all eternity, both those that he did in life and on Nirvana. Yet he would wear them with pride, because they embodied who he was. There was no need for him to be a William Shakespeare or any other prestigious writer in the world.

After all, he was already himself. What greater honor was there than to finally accept yourself?

&quot;...Let&#39;s go.&quot; He extended his hand, grabbing Shakespeare&#39;s as he felt his consciousness fade. His mana supply finally ran out dry, causing his body to go limp. Spiritron particles started to leave the air, like beautiful fireflies dancing in the moonlight.</span>

Whatever he had done in Nirvana, it had caused a ripple. One large enough to affect things beyond his understanding.

&quot;Before we go, one more thing.&quot; The playwright asked. This question had been brewing in their head all along, but they relented from asking due to its nosiness. Of course, since William was now a fellow writer, he left behind all semblance of decency.

&quot;Why did you create Vortigern? He was a failure in the past, wasn&#39;t he? Why stick with a failure? Why not create something new? Better yet, why not make yourself the hero of your story?&quot; Shakespeare asked, though judging by his expression, he could already tell the answer to the latter.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">William remained silent. It was a struggle to even speak right now. While he could refuse to answer out of spite, he decided to oblige.

&quot;You&#39;re a nosy old codger, aren&#39;t you? Well, no use in me overexplaining it: <em>I got lonely.&quot;</em> William replied casually. &quot;I hate being alone, so having someone else do the work for me seemed like the best option.

&quot;So stupid.&quot; He reflected on his actions. &quot;Vortigern was nothing more than a failure that I never got past. A tiny gear in my grand master plan. By all means, I could have scrapped him.&quot;

Tears swelled up in his eyes as he remembered his past as a child. When he first wrote the character of Vortigern. When he thought people would love his adaptation. When that love turned to hate. A failure that marked him forever.

<em>&quot;But you know what?&quot;</em>

Despite all those issues, he still stuck with Vortigern. And because of that, his creation had grown legs. He finally felt part of the world. Despite all of his failures, he had still created a masterpiece.

<strong>&quot;What sort of author abandons their creation?&quot;</strong>

He smiled. Tears streamed out of his eyes. No matter how many writing techniques he adapted, or how much he copied from others, the reality was that he loved his creation too much to discard it. That was what separated William Henry Ireland from the rest of his peers.

...

All that remained was the husk of a SERVANT frame. Their hand was still raised. Reaching out to a better future. Shakespeare had departed as well, leaving only an empty lab with a narrow opening.</span>
