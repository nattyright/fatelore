Tourists will usually reach the natural paradise here, albeit it seems like the docks haven’t been looked after for quite a while. The docks are littered with abandoned ships that have traces of rust to them. Flora has started to inhabit the surface as well, with algae covering the various ship vessels that surround Nirvana. Seems like the city hasn’t received any proper tourists in a while.</div>

Only an hour earlier, they had been silent, all but abandoned, not a single soul present save for the rats in the gutters and the gulls perched on rusting roof tiles. One might even dare to call it peaceful.

But word had gotten out among the inhabitants of the island. Rumours of a vessel that could carry these hated invaders away from their home, let them escape from their grasp. Such a thing would be utterly and absolutely intolerable. The mere thought of it was sickening beyond words! No, these trespassers must die, here and now, lest they get away with their most heinous of crimes!

As great mounds of filth surged out from the earth, the Islanders bore only thoughts of the living filth that infested their home, like fleas within their hair. If they would not die here, they would live here. So spoke the voices in the back of their heads.

Now, the docks had become a site of pure chaos. Wild beasts ran amok, madmen cried out as they damaged whatever they could get their hands on, and the birds circling overhead cawed and crowed at the bedlam beneath them. All the while, the vandals eyed their true target out at sea - the Canopus.

If the Investigators truly sought to escape, then they had best come protect their only means of it, lest they find themselves trapped for an eternity.</span>

No... At least tourists used the gift shop.

Which is why a Nirvanan fisherman was casting his line next to the Canopus. Maybe he was a nicer man, who simply wanted to enjoy the luxuries of fishing with a bit of shade. He wasn&#39;t like the other Nirvanans, who kicked and bit at the hull of the ship without as much as denting it.

Maybe he was sound of mind?

The fishing line went taut, the fisherman grinned. He pulled.

<strong>SPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!</strong>

A massive whale, made entirely of water, appeared as the line was pulled. It made a great, piercing cry, before slamming into the Canopus&#39;s hull, causing it to tilt slightly.

&quot;Haha, yeah! That&#39;s the power of the unknown depths, courtesy of the Nirvana Fishing Association!&quot; The man yelled, placing his fishing rod aside as water rained down on him. He did a cheery dance.

&quot;Shucks, but it was too small! The game wardens make me release the little ones.&quot; He grumbled, cutting the line, and causing the massive whale to disappear.

The man took another seat, and cast out his line.

It was indeed fortunate that Allen pulled the girl aside to lead repairs on the vessel for if she hadn&#39;t the Canapus might not have sustained yet another massive assualt like it did when they first arrived. Throughout the ship over the last week or so she had placed several different enchantments of strengthening as well as minute magical resistances. It was nothing major, nor did it even come close to covering the entirety of the ship, but it was certainly enough to give them a fighting chance. 

During these proceeding with the mass of islanders now attacking in anyway they could, the fiery engineer flew high upon the air riding her trusted brromstick. As she saw another rising assulat she&#39;d zoom past enacting an enchantment of shielding against these madmen blocking them from reaching the metal of the hull let alone damaging it. Here responsibilty was defense, be the proverbial shield while otheres were the sword.</span>

Her master had been touched with rage and sadness from the news of his mentor. There was not much more that she could for him aside from finish the endeavor ahead of them and eventually get home. However, Boogie had made promises to others. A term of allies to assist in their mission to uncover the truth and rescue  their people, including themselves. Assassin acted as the transport for Ronda and it was she too who had given a brief heads up on the mounting forces heading for their location.

Up to this point she had acted the role of a true Assassin class servant, hiding in the shadows, only being seen right before the strike. Now circumstances had changed and they were facing a psuedo army of islanders, all with the same unifying fear of losing their island. It was clear they were all brainswashed by this one fact alone. Sheep raised and lead to slaughter. Is that how the mastermind behind all this madness wanted to treat their people. One track mind zombies. They retained concsioness, but any humanity that was left within their hearts was now gone. The sight was ugly, as if an ocean sewage had washed up against the hull. Her role role had been escort and infiltrator, now at this moment the Boogieman could not resist any further. Their true nature would not allow them to ignor what was before them.</span>

Their drive was conected to the desire to protect what they deemed was theirs, there was no strict being that represented this just a longing self preservation. In their mind they were doing the right thing, driving away the monsters. The only way to deal with sort of ideology was to hold them all up to a mirror. The massive trench coat faded away as Boogie&#39;s form began to shift and meld together into a flowing fluid like substance, the only thing visible now being her a white porcelain shaded face and a tar like body that seemed to be ever changing and shifting. A bright blue glow surrounded almost like a ever present aura. Out of the few forms she has taken up to this point this could be best described as frightening yet beautiful. She rose several feet standing now at least 10 feet tall.</span>

Sinners, vulgar creatures of depravity, I have come for you all. Your actions have reached the farthest parts of the heavens, and judgement has been now called upon you. Your Isalnd was pure and sacred until you turned on your fellow man. Butchery, cannablism, and destruction. These are the legacies you have raised for your home, and it is now time to collect. Your island of Nirvana has been deemed broken by the gods themselves, and you are the one&#39;s who perpetrated this. The men and women standing at your shoulders, though they not speak they are the ones who brought the invaders her. They are the one&#39;s who actions disturbed your peace. Nirvana has been set for destruction, but it is not too late to change its fate from the will of the divine retribution. If you turn and find the sinners amongst you and purge them, then just may your home as well as your lives be spared. This is the will of the angered gods you have wrought. I do not wish for innocent lives to be snuffed out, so see this as your chance to save your island from destruction.

As her words concluded the flowing makeup of her body turned to shape massive clawed tentacles that immediatly shot forth into the crowd slashing across torsos, smashing heads, and ripping out hearts. For primarly non combatant folk it was akin to tearing through paper for Assassin. Though she did not like having to take this action, it is what needed to be done. Her speech, although mostly a ploy to play upon their collective fear, she still spoke truly that the islanders brought this upon themselves and only by their own action will their home be spared. What comes next was up to them.</span>

His eyes rhythmically darted left and right, similar to how a pendulum would, surveying the ever-increasing goop that emerged from the ground and the plants alike. More than a way of keeping himself safe, his alertness helped keep his mind focused, for if he was left to his own thoughts, his head would most likely boil away from anger. 

Ace had plenty of rest, enough to recover most of the energy carelessly spent by his fool of a Servant. While he respected the beast for fighting until the bitter end, the hindsight of this whole debacle made it difficult not to get mad at <em>Wendigo</em>. Unleashing a Noble Phantasm in a last ditch effort only to be defeated by Vortigern shortly after...

Disappointing. <em>Infuriating</em>. 

In the veteran&#39;s experience, working with Berserkers was always a chore. They were strong, sure, but they often lacked a mind of their own. Unable to follow rules, likely to disobey orders. <em>Everything the man hated</em>. A nasty bunch, that Servant class was. The man could remember <em>specifically</em> asking Geneva&#39;s HQ not to provide him with one during this mission, and yet... Wendigo happened.

He&#39;d be sure to <em>shake to death</em> whoever was responsible for giving him a faulty summoning catalyst once he&#39;d get back to Geneva.

...but while a defeat on the battlefield was sure to spoil his mood for a while, it was no excuse to slack off and sulk. Moving on, the man did his best to direct his thoughts towards his current task: making sure the Canopus was safe.

Back at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deserted-cottage</span>, none of the reports talked about the ship either. The man felt uneasy, being in the dark about it.

Initially, Ace stepped onto the island with some expectations. Namely, that the more cowardly and paranoid investigators would stay near the ship, unwilling to push deeper into Nirvana by fear of having their only way out of Nirvana engulfed by its residents. But, having spent close to three weeks without any news about the Canopus, Ace&#39;s reasoning felt less and less reliable.

As such, he had to make sure it was still there. He had to quench his curiosity, had to squash those doubts that dwelled in the back of his head. Now, having made the trip all the way to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span>, he could finally see the silhouette of the Canopus from afar. It looked tiny from his position, but there were no doubts about it. This was definitely their ship.

At first, the man felt relieved. The ship hadn&#39;t gone anywhere, and it was looking... alright-ish? The man couldn&#39;t exactly tell from afar, but if he could recognize it, then it surely wasn&#39;t damaged too much.

<strong>SPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!</strong>

The relief quickly gave way to surprise.

The silhouette of an enormous whale completely made of water crashed onto the Canopus&#39; hull, the resulting thunderous clap making its way all the way to the veteran&#39;s ears. His brow knitted, and his steps hurried a notch.

<strong>Be still, for an Angel beckons your attention...</strong>

Then the words of Boogie reached the veteran&#39;s ears, followed by the sight of dozens of enraged men clawing away at the ship&#39;s hull. A nasty brawl was currently happening on the docks, a tad too close to the Canopus. The sight of a woman drafting through the air came to catch him off-guard once again, succeeding in creasing his brow even further.

&quot;What,&quot; He started, completely dumbfounded. &quot;The hell.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The Boogeyman&#39;s grotesque form towered above the islanders, looming over them as she delivered her grim sermon. The reason for the corruption of their home hadn&#39;t been the outsiders, but all this time, it had been their own brother and sisters who sought to undermine their paradise? That their ire would be better served culling their own weakness instead?

Some rejected this idea. Knew the truth. Knew it was the invader&#39;s fault that everything was going wrong. Knew there was only one way to wash their hands of this filth. Knew what must be done.

Others were not so hasty. They pondered all the evils their neighbours had inflicted on them. Theft, abduction, murder, vandalism, all of it and more, perpetrated by the many and the fews, the cults and gangs, the hermits and wanderers. The trespassers were not free of guilt, no, but if they had a greater threat to their way of life, then surely, that must be purged first and foremost...?

No conclusion was reached, no consensus found. The mob did not even have an opportunity to turn on one another before the Boogeyman descended upon them, rending claws ripping apart those unsuspecting bystanders who happened to be closest to her. But, at the end, it was all but inevitable. How could mere men and women stand against an avenging angel?</span>

But, had they come from nowhere? No, far from it. They were a servant, that much was certain, so it was not much of a stretch to assume they were an Assassin, too.

That was surprise number one. Surprise number two...

He shuddered. The hell WAS this? His fellow Nirvanans shuddered as well, muttering amongst themselves.

Then Boogeyman appeared, and all hell broke loose.

<strong>Splatter.</strong> <strong>SLASH!</strong> Screams. Leo&#39;s fellow townsfolk were struck down by this monster. Leo dropped his fishing rod and shuddered.

&quot;Ah... Ahhhhhh... Oh my fishsticks...&quot; The man shivered, before feeling himself back up against a familiar boot.

Peter shot the monster, causing Leo to whoop and get to his feet, before striking a pose and sneering at Boogeyman and the squad of outsiders that showed up. Was it the island&#39;s corrupting influence that made his personality change like the wind, or was he that full of himself?

&quot;Yeah! Get fucking <em>swamped</em> by the most kickass Servant on Nirvana, he&#39;ll own you pieces of shit!&quot; Leo sneered as he quickly gathered his fishing line and running over to a body freshly downed by Boogeyman.

&quot;Hold on, I need to borrow this. Come swing by the NFA&#39;s headquarters for compensation whenever you can,&quot; Leo told the corpse before cutting off the arm with a knife. He waved his hand, attaching the body part to the fishing line.

&quot;This is some good bait! Pete, check <strong>THIS</strong> out!&quot; Leo yelled towards his Assassin. Clearly, the two were in kahoots.

Leo cast his line, and the water began to bubble...

The dock began to crack, causing Ace to stumble. Whatever this fisherman was doing, whatever he was about to bring up would NOT be pretty.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The tall figure that had appeared on the docks lashed out. It began shattering through the enemy forces, indiscriminately hitting everyone around it with gigantic tentacles. This was the work of a Servant no doubt, and a second Servant quickly joined the fray by shooting the tall figure in the back. A question lingered, was this some sort of inside strife or the work of an investigator? Was the flying woman that thing&#39;s Master?

&quot;...&quot;

...the man&#39;s introspection abbruply halted. Just <em>thinking</em> about Servants was enough to throw the veteran off, reminding him of yesterday&#39;s blunder. How maddening, <em>how maddening</em>. The built-up anger instantly left his body as the magnum on his belt glowed red, a spark in the distance that made more than a few heads turn on the docks.

The earth shook right as the fisherman&#39;s hook hit the waters. Ace briefly stumbled, powered his way into finding his balance, then began running full-speed towards the docks. If bringing forth a whale hadn&#39;t shaken the earth as such, one could only wonder what kind of monstrosity would appear now. No matter if those things on the docks were allies or foes, Ace just couldn&#39;t ignore that fisherman&#39;s next attack.

Arriving to the dock&#39;s periphery, the veteran was greeted by the reckless charge of a few crazed Nirvanans, the ones that had caught whiff of the previous flash of red light. Without hesitation, the man cocked his gun—

<strong>BAMBAMBAMBAM!!</strong>

A flurry of bullets exited the gun, hitting each Nirvanan square in the head. The magnum now reinforced, it shot similarly to how a gatling gun mixed with a sniper rifle would—very quickly, and very <em>accurately</em>.

The man fished in his inner pockets, reloading the empty chambers of his magnum with fresh rounds, then took careful aim. His target? <em>The fisherman&#39;s hands</em>.</span>

They had little communication aside from a few musing about Ryn. Yet somehow she understood the creature in a way that the boy never could. Even more so he still doesn’t get why he summoned her of all servants, 

Regardless, this was not the time for philosophical insight. There was still a mess of people that needed to be dealt. Flowing low to the ground Ronda whipped out her universal multi tool and with the click of a switch it turned into a welder’s blow torch. She’d begin yet another abjuration ritual before placing her palm against the ground and igniting the tool. Using the flame from the torch as the starting catalyst of her incantation, it soon bloomed outwards and exploded into a massive wall of fire that bursted upwards cutting off the group from reaching a large section of the hull as well serving as a deterrent for further movement. The mechanic continued to do what she could to fortify defenses.</span>

One factor that might be difficult to take notice amongst the mayhem was that certain individuals, just before being slain found themselves almost unable to move as swiftly as they normally would. It was almost as if their legs were made of heavy lead. Though the assault briefly paused as Assassin was struck in the side of what should have been the shoulder. He hit directly upon his target yet it could not be clear if any damage was had based on the rather lucid form of their body. Peering their head around, Assassin noticed a wretched man had approached and offered words of…beguilement for her. He put on such a brave face, but deep down he couldn’t hide what truly made him shake. His heart and the shadows of his mind were open entirely to her. “Oh <strong>Peter</strong>, it only figures a spirit such as yours would be involved in this cavalcade of depravity.” She knew his name, how did she know his name?</span>

For this fight they needed help. There was a bright glow of her eyes that seemed to shine brightly in her approach. “You speak so boldly yet I imagine you would feel a measure of confidence, believing no one in this era might recognize you. However I do. I see you Peter Niers and so does God, we both know the sins you’ve committed. You are no different than this rabble, a vile being that knows that they shall be punished. Not because they feel guilty, but because they know karma shall always catch up tothem.” Her body began to shift once more, the face tanning, the tar body primarily fading save for a small section on her back that continued to ravage the crowd behind her. Assassin’s voice to that of a grown man. The state of dress was changed to that of metallic plated grieves, a green tunic, and a feathered cap. Niers would recognize this as a figure that haunted the deepest reaches of his mind, a Holy Roman Police that was present the day he was captured then subsequently tortured.and broken on the wheel. Why was he here? Did he come all this way just to punish him yet again. It was now Niers who felt a heavy weight fall upon and their speed essentially be split in half. “You have been found not fully paid in reparations for your crimes, and mark these words Peter. “You will answer for all 544 souls.”</span>

The creature seemed to zag back and forth in an erratic behavior, the tentacles at this point reverting back into their body.. Massive clawed hands formed like a monstrous beast, ready to shred into their prey. As they neared it seemed as if Boogie was going to lunge straight ahead at her target, but a few meters short of Peter Assassin seemed to run and fall into the earth itself, out of sight from everyone including the other Assassin. Her presence was no longer felt at all, almost as if she disappeared entirely. Perhaps Peter was lucky and this phantom could only stay for so long before it got sent away again. However, this feeling would be short lived for Peter then felt a sudden ping from the side right as an elongated claw struck out and slashed right across their hip. They teleported. A distance away and attacked from afar. This fight may turn out to be far more complicated then initially considered. Not only was Niers facing a demon from their past but it seemed they could appear anywhere.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Even in the face of the Boogeyman and her monstrously seraphic form, Niers was utterly unfazed. Indeed, given the rumours about the man, one who cannibalised his fellow man and consorted with the devil, a simple horror wouldn&#39;t cause him to stir. He was not afraid of judgement, especially not one he had already received.

So, a change of tactics was in order. The form of an avenging angel morphed and changed, becoming less grand, more human. Even under their iron mask, Assassin could sense a change in expression. But instead of going from anger to fear, it was more akin to a brow furrowing, a deepening rage.

<strong>&quot;You think your fuck-ugly cosplay is going to spook me, cunt? Sorry to break it to you, but I DON&#39;T GIVE A SHIT. Back then, I was a pussy-ass wimp compared to the GOD I am now! I ain&#39;t getting snagged EVER AGAIN! THIS KILLSTREAK IS GOING INFINITE!&quot;</strong>

As Boogey rushed forth, Niers hammed the trigger of their gun, only for their bullets to whizz through thin air, his target having already moved. But as Assassin&#39;s claw swiped out to strike, her opponent was quick to react, shifting his hefty wheel into the path of the strike to block the blow.

<strong>CRACK!</strong> A sharp jolt of pain, as the attacking appendage would suddenly fall limp, as though it had been broken. But, how could that be? Niers hadn&#39;t even moved an inch!

<strong>&quot;NOW STAY STILL AND SUCK MY DICK!&quot;</strong> The murderer howled, swivelling their rifle back towards Boogeyman, and letting loose another barrage of bullets.

Not unlike the barrage of bullets currently being fired at Ace. But Peter didn&#39;t seem too worried about that. Leo could handle himself. Probably.</span>

Seeing the a red head fly around on a broom, he squinted in the figure out what it was before large wall of flames appeared he shielded his face with his hand, &quot;Whatever the hell is going on out there&#39;s gonna have to wait, I need to make sure the ship isn&#39;t trashed, Ankou go ahead without me I&#39;ll catch up soon!&quot; he called out to his servant, looking behind over his shoulder, before jumping over the side below, seeing the damaged hull filled him with reassurance, mostly due to the fact it wasn&#39;t currently set ablaze and in need of dousing. Still though he couldn&#39;t just chance any Nirvanan&#39;s sneaking passed so he inspected a little further before spotting the mechanic hard at work, &quot;Ronda?! Glad you&#39;re still alive! Wanna give me a quick update as to what the hell is going on now that I just got back?&quot; he called out as he moved to catch up, using water from his gourd like a rail, he created a path that allowed him to at least try and keep up, looking around for anymore damage the explosion caused.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Ankou leaned over the Canopus railing watching the commotion. The bastard who shook the ship was bound to be down there. The thought of his jawbreaker rolling across the rotting gym floor still echoed in his mind. Wait... Did Galvin say to go in without him? Ankou did a double take in his head. Was his master really going to recklessly hop down without him. Had Galvin forgot that the direction of the hit on the hull was pointing towards the docks? No, Rider understood... Galvin didn&#39;t care who ruined Ankou&#39;s food. Maybe if he starved Galvin for thousands of years he&#39;d understand &quot;<em>No!</em>&quot; Ankou proclaimed to himself shaking his head. Since he had been here his head became full with the delicacies of life. That was not his mission. Ankou needed to focus on the Canapous that was his true mission.

Rider materialized his Scythe in his hand and his carriage beneath him. Snapping the reins of his steeds the carriage fell from the top of the Canopus the horses catching themselves on a trail of Ice created on the waters surface by Ankou. Rider gripped his Scythe tightly causing it&#39;s blade to extend with a blue glow similar to the flames in his eyes. He swung the weapon with his off hand catching unaware Islanders. 

Ankou&#39;s target however, was not the Islanders, it was the servants battling just a bit further on the docks. There was only one problem which one was his enemy? He did not recognize either of them. A servant dressed in Roman attire and another wielding a firearm. Ankou parked his carriage on the water just next to the docks. He hopped out, the water freezing under his feet to keep him afloat. 

&quot;Excuse me!&quot; Rider called out to the battling servants. &quot;I seem to be at a loss. Which of you is trying to destroy the boat over there. It&#39;d be a shame to have to kill both of you just because I don&#39;t know who&#39;s on my side.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t fuck with Pete! He&#39;s bodied dozens of you chumps all on his own! He even scored me this kickass cap!&quot; Leo said, tipping his cap as he pulled up the line.

It was a captain&#39;s hat, and one that Ace had seen before while on the Canopus. These punks had gone looting after wrecking the Canopus! Even as the sky was falling, they were going pillaging! Leo was fishing without a care in the world!

&quot;<strong>HERE IT COMES! THE BIG ON—EEEK!</strong>&quot; Leo shrieked shrilly as Ace pulled out his gun and blasted at him. Without a moment to lose, Leo hopped into the water, rod and all, dodging Ace&#39;s gunshots by the width of a fishing line.

Then the docks erupted.

&quot;YEEEEE HAW!&quot; Leo shouted as a massive snake made entirely of water erupted out of the water. A human limb could be seen poking out of its mouth, still attached to the line that Leo was holding.

He flicked the fishing rod like it was a reign, causing water to splash and freeze thanks to Ankou&#39;s interference, dampening Ronda&#39;s explosion. The massive snake changed course, before slithering back towards Ace and Galvin.

&quot;Nirvana Fishing Association REPRESENT, dorks! Nobody wants you here! Your ship <strong>ruined</strong> my fishing spot! No matter how many of you we squash, you keep crawling back! So with all due respect:&quot;

&quot;<strong>BEAT IT AND FUCK OFF!</strong>&quot; The snake opened its mouth as it barreled towards the two male investigators.

With a heavy sigh Ronda flew over and began to reinforce it back up again with a continuous chants. At this point now that the barrier was somewhat established, the abjurationist began to shift its arcane nature, adding to its effect. 

Randomly at different intervals, small bursts of flame would shoot out from the wall like streaks of fire bolts directly hitting members of the crowd. It was only one or two at a time, but it was serving its purpose as a defense of the ship from the crowd.</span>

As her claw bounced off the wheel it seemed to spiral and enwrap itself around the inside bars of the contraption ensuring a tight and firm tar like hold. Four other tentacle-like appendages appeared from off her back and shot out towards him. It did not matter if he blocked these as well for to do damages was not there purpose. As they made any form of contact they too wrapped around his arms and legs, firming a tight grip upon his extremities. From that point Niers would notice that his boots, followed by his calfs, and then his whole legs were sinking into the earth. As noted before when this fight began she was fighting amongst the shadow of the ship and Peter found himself caught in the center of it. In response to the query on who is the enemy from the rider on the sea, Boogie called out as she sunk with her opponent. “This one is trying to sink the ship, any assistance in his removal will be appreciated.” 

Of course Niers reaction is likely to fight out of her grip, shoot her maybe, don’t get caught in some stupid trap. However, as those thoughts would come to mind, the other Assassin would sense the appearance of another presence. Something not terribly powerful, but one comparable to a servant</span>

There was an aura about them that was almost comforting, as if one would be willing to follow them home. She only stared at him for a moment before calling out in what seemed like a soft tone, but was loud enough for the assassin to hear. “<em><strong>Don’t hurt Mommy</strong></em>”.

In a flash she dashed forward like a small pin missile, zig zagging back and forth. Until she was upon the grappled opponent. In a forceful leap at the end of her she dropkicked the man in the center of the chest to assist In preventing him from resisting before landing a short distance away back on her feet. The strength blow was nothing kind a child’s with a force equaling C rank strength and agility.</span>

One way or another, a wide-faced man, wearing a green hat, with nothing but a fishing pole on himself, had managed to jump into the waters just in time, to save himself from the veteran&#39;s rounds. If the fisherman had been even a split-second late, he would&#39;ve most likely lost the usage of both his hands.

<strong>How freakish.</strong>

Nirvanans were scary. Scary, volatile and <em>unpredictable</em>. Even the simplest of men from the local fishing association could pose a threat. The man disliked that. First with William, and now this stupid fisherman...

<em>One too many people had evaded his shots on this island</em>. What was even the point of owning a firearm if people kept evading your rounds? There was no point, it was useless!

As such, the man pocketed his magnum. At the same time, the young Galvin dropped onto the docs, much to his Servant’s displeasure. The veteran vaguely recalled his face, he was definitely at the Canopus. The kid that always hung out at the gym.

The docks rumbled shortly as the fisherman&#39;s snake creature started to form. Ace gritted his teeth, then opened his mouth.

&quot;White haired kid!&quot; He called out, sprinting at full-speed towards Galvin. “I need your help!&quot;</span>

He cocked his head to the side as he heard a voice all out to him, as White haired kid, bit his name, but certainly there weren&#39;t many people with his haircut walking around. Suppressing the annoyance at the nickname he saw a vaguely familiar face from the ship, good with names he placed the man as...

A man with a fishing pole summoning huge water creatures to bring the Canopus down. A horde of Nirvanans tirelessly wearing the ship&#39;s hull with their assaults. A three-way Servant battle on the deck: the situation was pretty self-explanatory, all things considered.

This out-of-place cluelessness only served to reinforce Ace&#39;s frustration, turning it into full-blown <em>anger</em>. The veteran showed no signs of stopping in his run as he reached Galvin, grabbing the young man by his collar and spinning around himself like an Olympic shot putter using his momentum.

&quot;GET THAT FUCKER&#39;S—&quot;

The man&#39;s words escaped his gritted teeth as he violently rotated, drawing power from one of his <em>Enchanted Gloves</em> as he did so. When Galvin expected his shirt to be torn from the amount of force exerted into it, it suddenly glowed a bright <em>red</em>, now effortlessly withstanding the man&#39;s strength.

&quot;—FISHING POLE, KIIID!!&quot;

Ace violently released his hold on Galvin as he spoke those words, hurling him head-first towards Leo with immense power and speed.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">At least he knew who to punch in this fight.
Without much time to register what was going on Galvin could only stand stunned as Ace grabbed him by the shirt and began to bark a command in his face which paled over as he felt the pull, &quot;You crazy motherfu-!&quot; he began, before in the next moment he felt the wind rushing through his hair as he was pulled off his feet and thrown across the dock. He flew threw the air like a missile, locked directly onto the fisherman riding atop the serpent&#39;s back, <em>I&#39;m gonna kill him later I swear to God!</em>. With the snake coming in for the attack, he needed to act fast, moving his weight to the side he let his calabash slide off his back and grabbed it by the straps, rolling over as he did so, he flew almost like a corkscrew spinning as he used raw strength and his hydrokinetic spell to swing the calabash around, preserving momentum to utilize for the grand slam to come, as he pulled it around in front to hit Leo obscuring his body a bit.

Looking to crash into Leo head on and swat him right off into the waters below where he could take advantage, though anticipating a dodge, he kept his other hand free holding it out, ready to grab at the first thing he could reach, be it the rod, Leo himself, or even the snake if he could use its body against itself.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The Boogeyman would once again attack, sending out a series of inky black tendrils to try and grapple and constrain her foe. However, Niers remained undaunted. As the first tendril grasped the hefty wheel he held, another sickening <strong>CRACK</strong> would fill the air as it fell down, broken. Likewise, as tentacles surged out to grasp him, he swung the hefty wheel about, knocking away the offending appendages, each time met with yet more bone-crunching <strong>CRACK</strong>s. Even the most grazing blow was enough to completely cripple a tendril. Hell, it seemed that even <em>touching</em> the wheel was enough! Just what was that wheel...?

Fortunately, Boogeyman would not be alone in her fight for much longer. Upon their grim carriage, coming out from the Canopus and onto the docks, Ankou would make their arrival. Finally, it seemed the tides were turning in her favour.

<strong>&quot;OI! FUCKFACE!&quot;</strong> Niers screamed at Rider, pointing his gun at the deadman. <strong>&quot;You trying to fuckin&#39; 1v2, cheap noob bitch? FUCK OFF. FUCK RIGHT OFF. UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE RIGHT THE FUCK NOW, THEN YOU CAN-&quot;</strong>

<em>SLAM!</em> Niers threats would be interrupted as the grotesque child kicked him in the chest, catching him entirely off-guard as he was sent tumbling down to the ground. But of course, he did not go down easily. No, in fact, it did not take long for him to scramble back to his feet, now turning his ire to the child.

<strong>&quot;I FUCKED your mommy last night.&quot;</strong>

With the matter-of-fact statement, Assassin stomped forward, bringing down their wheel with all their might, aiming to break the child in two.</span>

He had no reason to suspect Boogeyman was lying since Niers didn&#39;t seem to object. &quot;I understand&quot; Ankou replied readying his scythe a breeze falling over the other two servants. Ankou stepped forward on the Icy water preparing himself to strike at Niers. 

Ankou would stop for a moment as Niers acknowledged his presence. <strong>&quot;Fuckface, cheap noob bitch.&quot;</strong> The words this servant could string together in a sentence evoked a strange emotion Ankou had not felt before. How could someone be so irritating, Ankou would be doing a favor the the Islanders if he killed this servant.&#160; 

As Niers brought his wheel down towards the child Ankou sprung into to action dashing to Niers side, catching the wheel on the blade of his scythe. A killing intent would bleed from Ankou&#39;s position, even his own teammates might feel threatened from presence he carried. The water beneath the docks would grow cold now freezing just from being near Ankou, everyone near him would be able to see thir breath in front of their face.&#160; Such was the result of Ankou&#39;s killing intent, a blistering cold that would make a tropical paradise feel like a tundra. 

After catching the wheel on his scythe Ankou would drag the blade forwards swiping at Niers midsection.

No matter how many appendages were sent their way, Niers simply knocked them away. It would be untruthful to say it wasn’t frustrating, however by simple observation it was clear the wheel was a driving force of Assassin’s defense. With the simplest touch her tentacles would snap like twigs. Any future attacks will have to be taken with the caveat in mind. Knowing full well this fight was no longer all her own she took notice that the rider who spoke in a similar manner to her enemy jumped irp the fray. Her eyes shined brightly once more, seeing this intervention as an opportunity to take advantage of his split attention. Boogie slipped into the earth once more, their presence concealment automatically activating alongside her movement. The only question now was when and where would she reappear.</span>

Although they did have a remark for Assassin’s previous comment. “I don’t know how you can procreate in your condition.” Yet another burst of speed from the small gothic adolescent. They would attack once again against Nier’s body, though not in a typical location. With a swift uppercut the Black Eyed Child struck directly at Nier’s groin for the comments he made about their mother, however, this was not all 16th century Assassin had to deal with.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Despite his attempt to put down the familiar, Niers would soon find it easier said than done. The crushing blow of his wheel was intercepted by Ankou&#39;s scythe, the blade catching it by the spokes, stopping it in its tracks. Notably, unlike the organic claws, the artificial scythe did not crack and break, staying intact. Another piece of the puzzle had fallen into place.

<strong>&quot;BITCH BITCH NOOB BITCH ASSHOLE CUNT WHAT DID I FUCKING SAY YOU- NGAH!&quot;</strong>

His efforts were interrupted as the many children, the low blow diverting his attention away, and allowing Ankou to land a cutting blow across her chest. It seemed as though this diversion of attention was paying off.

<strong>&quot;FINE! If you want to play dirty, then I&#39;m just going to LEVEL UP!&quot;</strong>

With a snarl, Assassin returned their gun to their holster, outstretching their arm, down directly blow them.

<em><strong>&quot;IGNIS!&quot;</strong></em>

<em>FWOOSH!</em> From their palm, a great stream of fire rushed forth, directly down into the children, and quickly spreading out towards Ankou. A startling development, but hardly a surprising one. After all, Niers was famed for using the remains of his victims in acts of black magic...

<em><strong>&quot;VENTUS!&quot;</strong></em>

With another word, a rushing blast of wind added literal fuel to the fire, oxygen feeding the flame, like tossing logs into an inferno, making it deadlier and deadlier. All the while, it sent Niers flying up, up away from the docks and towards the Canopus...</span>

Even worse, both him and Peter were getting double-teamed. Unfair! Unjust! Leo and Peter would never hurt a fly! Physically, anyway. Peter had a flair for moving everyone else to tears through verbal abuse alone. Verbal Assassination. Verbal Bassassination.

Bass...

However, Galvin was coming right for him! The investigator lunging at him, all while Leo was riding around in his snake familiar. That was no good. Especially since he was eyeing the fisherman&#39;s fishing pole with such intent.

&quot;Hey, back off! This fishing pole is mine. It was my father&#39;s! It was my father&#39;s father&#39;s! It&#39;s been in the family since they founded this island! You aren&#39;t worthy to even <em>think</em> about it!&quot;

Leo yelled angrily as Galvin lunged, attempting to take the rod. Galvin got lucky, hitting the fisherman in the shoulder, causing him to drop the rod.

The snake glared at Ace, hitting him with the force of a train. All the Genevan could think was &quot;<strong>Glub glub?</strong>&quot;.

However, the snake began to evaporate as quickly as it had hit Ace. It vanished, leaving the Genevan hacking and spitting up seawater. All while Galvin and Leo ended up in a pile. The fishing rod lie dormant on the remains of the docks.

Leo lunged towards it.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Leo&#39;s giant snake pursued his target, slithering its way through the docs with astounding agility. Ace caught a glimpse of it prior to throwing Galvin, but unfortunately, it seemed the veteran had underestimated the creature&#39;s speed.

He had no time to brace for the impact.

<strong>SPLAAAAAAAASH!</strong>

The water serpent came crashing down, blasting the veteran away with a force worthy of its size. The wind knocked out of him, Ace&#39;s still breath was broken, and a heap of sea water entered his lungs.

Fortunately, the snake evaporated before causing further damage, leaving a disheveled Ace to gasp and cough his lungs out on the ground, standing on all fours. His little maneuver had worked, judging from the sudden disappearance of the sea-snake. The hunch that the fishing rod was what allowed the fisherman to control water fortunately proved to be correct. Damn that fisherman, how had he gotten his hands on such an artifact?

His eyes stung heavily due to the salt, yet he kept them peeled open, maniacally scanning his surroundings for Galvin and Leo&#39;s whereabouts. Ace found that the latter was standing atop the former, lunging for what the veteran guessed to be his <em>fishing rod</em>.

&quot;No,&quot;--cough--&quot;No, you fucking don&#39;t!&quot; Roared the veteran between two ragged breaths, grabbing and folding his water-sprayed sunglasses from the bridge of his nose between his fingers.

The sunglasses glowed <em>orange</em>, their hardness noticeably changing—<em>hardening</em>. Between his fingers no longer sat a pair of sunglasses, but rather a razor-sharp, deadly piece of plastic and glass.

Ace flicked the sunglasses with an additional boost from his only remaining <em>Enchanted Glove</em>, flinging them at high-speed towards the fisherman&#39;s reaching arm.</span>

Boogeyman’s tendrils were no match for Niers’ wheel; however, Ankou was glad to see that death’s scythe had yet to fail him. The fire that Niers produced didn&#39;t bother the reaper. Despite this, Ankou would halt his swing as he noticed the flames spreading to the children. Rider gritted his teeth rushing to guard the children with his legs. 

Ankou’s skill Max Entropy allowed him to put out flames that touched his body while sustaining minimal damage. Using this skill, he was able to extinguish the fire surrounding the fake children. Perhaps the children served as a distraction to Ankou just as much to Nier. If Ankou hated one thing in the world, it was children dying.

“Do not think you can escape death!” Ankou called to the fleeing Niers. If Niers reached the Canapous with his flames it could be disastrous. Ankou would hold his scythe to his side a blue flame covering and extending the weapon until it was long enough to reach the enemy Assassin. Ankou would then hook his blade in front of Niers and pull it back to knock the servant back to the ground.

Assassin had identified at least 3 other allies aside from Ronda who were contributing to the defense. Each were putting up a good bout, one of which identified a helpful trait of the wheel that Boogie might be able to replicate later. Yet despite being able to move across the field in quick succession, she couldn’t be everywhere at once. In this place of existence she was akin to a specter lurking in any dark corner she could find, making the most out of being a stranger in a foreign land. Though there was a remedy for this. Hopefully it did not impede on anyone else.

Clasping her hands together, the Boogeyman&#39;s eyes glowed a deep shade of Blue. She peered over the entire field and all souls dancing across it; this was to be her big blow against the enemy, something that may well turn the tide against the enemy. Although it may paint a large target on Assassin’s back, she in turn will have the ultimate advantage. No longer will she be playing by their rules, their ideologies, or their world. 

A massive shadow exhumed from Assassin’s body spreading across the entire dock area. All present individuals were covered from Leo, to Niers, to Ronda, to the entire remaining islanders. Every single soul felt swallowed in a pit of darkness that seemed to hold forever, a cast nothingness that was cold and unwavering to their own desires and passions. They chose this endeavor of their own will, and now that choice will lead them to their grave.</span>

Around them was no longer the city docks of Nirvana but the edge of a desolate cityscape full of broken gothic buildings, petrified trees, and a handful of murky water pools no bigger than a small pond each. The sky was a bright gray giving a artificial luminescent effect so that one can visualize their surroundings, however, there was no moon in sight. From foot to horizon was covered in shadow. 

At first, it appeared that Assassin had merely transported everyone to a separate location at night time, however, that theory was quickly found unlikely as Leo, Niers, and every single island felt a steady depletion of their mana that only seemed to be sapping more and more away the longer they stood in this place, almost as if any form of joy or energy was being drained away. It was clear that they were not just gone from Nirvana, but instead within a different world entirely, one of the Boogieman’s own making. Worse yet, the Canopus was no longer around for them to threaten.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Trout: The thud of Galvin&#39;s feet dug into Leo&#39;s back. It didn&#39;t break anything, but it stunned the poor Nirvanan, and prevented him from moving further down the docks towards his beloved fishing rod.

As Leo desperately reached for the fishing rod with mad intent, he felt the tip of two fingers tap the familiar handle. Immediately, he felt a gust of wind, and then an eruption of pain in his fingers. He blinked, before squealing in pain as a ring and index finger went flying several meters, before landing on the pavement.

The fisherman squealed in pain, but at the same moment that he had tapped the rod...

The docks were gone.

Nirvana was gone.

Gone.

Gone.

GONE!

Leo&#39;s breathing became frenzied and heavy. He didn&#39;t even seem to notice that his fingers were currently sitting in a puddle of water. He shuddered. To Galvin, it was like he was having a fit.

And then suddenly: &quot;<strong>WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?</strong>&quot; He screamed, spittle flying from his mouth in a fit of rage. &quot;<strong>WHERE IS NIRVANA? TAKE US BACK. TAKE US BACK RIGHT NOW!</strong>&quot;

With a fit of herculean strength, Leo scrambled despite Galvin&#39;s extra weight, grasping his hands around his trusty rod. Immediately, he seemed to calm down, but only for a moment.

He had to get back home.

Thunk! The butt of the fishing rod hit Galvin square in the belly, knocking the wind out of him as Leo squirmed out from under the investigator&#39;s weight.

Getting to his feet, breathing heavily, Leo surveyed the situation. There was a great big floating ghost lady that Peter had been fighting. Leo disliked her immediately.

&quot;Fuck her up, Pete!&quot; Leo roared as water erupted from the puddles. However, Leo felt like he was benching a seventy-ton megalodon. This was hard! Even if he wasn&#39;t using his fishing rod, it shouldn&#39;t have been this difficult.

Despite this, several little pirannas erupted from the water, before swimming through the air towards Galvin and Ace, teeth bared.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Alas, Niers&#39; escape was cut off before it could get very far. As he soared towards the Canopus, he was beat to his destination by the wall of shadow, expanding and stretching forth, trapping him within it as the Reality Marble took effect. As his surroundings changed, Assassin could only watch as the deck of the Canopus became dirt, and the red skies over Nirvana became gloomy and gray.

<strong>&quot;Ngh?! World Egg? The fuck!&quot;</strong> The killer spat, venom dripping from his voice. <strong>&quot;Just my fucking luck that some bitch noob gets a busted broken OP Noble Phantasm while all I get is this stupid fucking wheel and my fucking sacrifice-&quot;</strong>

<em>SLASH!</em> Ankou&#39;s scythe caught Niers off guard, the slicing blade catching him the second before he hit the ground, cutting a massive gash into his chest. A well-placed blow, especially given the draining atmosphere of Fear Breaker. Indeed, under current conditions, using his Magecraft would essentially be suicidal, accelerating his own starving.

<strong>&quot;GAH! FUCKER! EAT MY SHIT EAT MY SHIT EATMYSHITEATMYSHITEATMYSHIT-&quot;</strong> Assassin roared with rage, scrambling back to his feet once more. With a heave, he pulled his wheel back, and with a ho, he tossed it forth, the whirling wheel thrown directly at Ankou, and approaching with surprising speed. If he didn&#39;t act soon, the reaper would find himself hit directly!

But of course, that wasn&#39;t Niers only concern. No, as his wheel went about its work, one hand reached for his gun once more, while the other pressed against his wound.

<strong>&quot;WHERE ARE YOU, GUTTER SLUT? I&#39;M GOING TO BEAT YOU LIKE YOUR DADDY NEVER DID, SO SHOW YOUR FUCK-UGLY FACE.&quot;</strong></span>

Letting out a grunt he fell to a knee holding his gut from the strike.

Baring his teeth his hands flew out and waved in front of him, causing the water in his calabash to flow out and form a shield in front of him to absorb the water piranha&#39;s and direct them away, though one managed to break through quickly latching onto his bicep, sinking it&#39;s teeth into his flesh and earning a yelp before he smashed it with his fist. &quot;That&#39;s it, time to die.&quot; he said through bared teeth as he stood up and shifted the waters around him, forming around his fists in small balls, he would punch the air at the other piranha&#39;s water bullets shooting off his fists to shoot them out of the air rapidly.

When he had an opening to strike, he gathered a large ball together in his hands, packing it full of mana, before throwing it forwards and a barrage of water shots all fired out at the Nirvanan.

No. His aim was not the issue. <em>It was that damn fisherman</em>, whoever he was, that had managed to save his paws from disability twice now. Fucking Nirvanans. Ace coughed and hacked the remaining water out of his lungs, slowly getting up from the dampened ground.

As he did so, deep shades of blue invaded his vision, briefly reminding him of the <em>thing</em> which he had summoned prior to this. Feeling of fear, anger and anxiety all bundled in the man&#39;s stomach, and they only grew in intensity as his surroundings changed. Gothic edifices, a dusky ambiance. <strong>This was no longer the docks</strong>. His eyes tracked the source of the sudden change, pinning it down to the thing which had transformed time and time again against this... &#39;Pete&#39; fellow.

This battle was going to turn chaotic. Leo&#39;s anger-filled voice was carried throughout the new landscape, echoing multiple times in the distance. His Servant&#39;s vulgar bravado did the same, filling the mostly silent landscape with both of their voices. Like Master, like Servant. They made a good pair, if by good you meant incredibly obnoxious and unnecessarily noisy.

Noisy enough to feed the veteran&#39;s irritation, once again. Watching the fisherman reel yet another monster from the water, Ace reached for the inside of his pocket, but stopped right in his tracks as he spotted the water piranhas. Little fishies with razor-sharp teeth? Only a Nirvanan could think of such atrocious monsters to summon!

The man quickly took his blue vest in his hands, whipping it once and casting <em>Emotion Bullets</em> at the same time. The vest glowed reddish-brown, hardening and straightening in the form of a plank. A light, steel-like plate made of fabric. As the piranhas made their advance on him, the man grabbed his plank-vest with one arm, holding it as a riot-shield and running full-speed towards Galvin and Leo.</span>

As long as I&#39;m with Pete and have a home waiting for me, <strong>I&#39;M FUCKING INVINCIBLE!</strong>&quot; Leo screamed, captain hat askew. Ace&#39;s observation was correct. Leo and Peter were made for one another.

Or maybe one had rubbed off on the other. The implications were terrifying.

As Galvin countered Leo&#39;s barrage, the fisherman took no time sprinting away. Despite being encumbered by his fishing rod and bleeding hand, the fisherman was fast!

Not as fast as Ace or Galvin, however. Galvin&#39;s mana-fueled ball of death scattered and hit Leo in the back, putting a few holes through his captain&#39;s hat and pushing him forward and launching the fisherman onto his back. He grunted in pain, only to feel his soul leave his body as Ace sprinted down on him.

&quot;Are you kidding me? What is that? Magic clothes armor? What sort of black-magic bullshit is this!&quot; As if Leo wasn&#39;t holding his own against two investigators with a <em>fishing rod</em>.

Leo twirled his fishing rod as he backed up, with its hook finding the hem of Galvin&#39;s shirt, sending him flying towards Ace.

Despite that, Ace&#39;s makeshift shield continued to barrel down on him. Leo hissed, before pulling his final trick out of his pocket: a pufferfish.</span>

The pufferfish inflated, before blowing out a blast of water that sent the fisherman flying towards his Servant. The two ended up back to back.

&quot;This ain&#39;t going too well, Pete. They broke my fishing streak, and now they&#39;re using shield clothes and Hydromancy Magecraft? Can you believe it? That&#39;s <em>my</em> shtick!&quot; Leo hissed, breathing heavily. He was running out of magical energy thanks to this weird not-Nirvana place. Peter had called it a World Egg?

Despite that, he reeled his line into a puddle, causing a slew of crabs to erupt and start scuttling towards Ace and Galvin.

As they fell through the gothic ashy landscape was something describable to a nightmare. Ronda’s flame wall had dispersed due to the mana flow being interrupted due to being transported to a different world. Yet she wasn’t going to let that slow her down, there was still more to be done. 

Ryn was no longer there, Boogie was all by herself in a way. Although they had supposed allies around them, none who truly understood her. At this point it was unclear if anyone would. 

In front of her stood the remaining islanders that were attacking the Canopus. For any that hadn’t already been torn apart by Assassin or burned by her fire bolts they found themselves rapidly losing mana and energy. If their mana capacity was already low to begin with they’d find themselves faint, weak, and on the verge of expiring. Continuing her purpose of being support, Ronda began another ritual incantation that started to form a translucent dome barrier that slowly enclosed around the crowd. Her eyes kept on the field at large as well as the large battle that was occurring in the center. Hopefully, they could pull this off quickly for this may be their last push.</span>

The reaper had valiantly stepped up to not only defend the ship, but the children as well. Acts of sincerity and good will are what keep the world pure and moving forward in the right direction, and such benevolent behavior begets reward. As the wheel violently spun directly at Rider, he’d feel a sharp tug at the back of his waist pulling him down into the earth out of sight and leaving nothing for the wheel to impact upon as skid across the ground in the distance.</span>

Those same children from before were now gathering up in a circle around them, however, instead of three there were now eight of them. Each with the deep black absent shade over their eyes each of them chanting as they approached. “<strong>You are wrong. Your island is broken. It is all your fault. You will hurt, like you hurt mommy. Then you will join us in her collection. You must perish for your sins.</strong>” Suddenly each one of them lunged forward from different directions. Some going high, others going low. They had already experienced Niers flames before, and were likely to be on guard for such a manuvver again. Although it was curious if he’d flame up so close to his own master. 

As they struck out at them, certain things would become clear. One was that their blows would come across trying to hinder and or incapacitate their movement such as hitting across their arms, legs, hips, etc. Any sort of damage or breakage upon the body they could inflict. The second factor which was not so new to Peter, but swiftly realized by Leo was that although small each one of these child held the speed and strength of a C-Rank servant, none of which pulling their punches upon him, Then at once they’d each attempt to jump backwards away from the enemy after they had inflicted as much damage as they could in such a short burst, but why?</span>

One was Ankou, with no sign of injury upon their body, ready for whatever maneuver they had in mind. The other could only be assumed to be the master of this realm, the other Assassin. Her new visage was no longer that of an angel or a roman soldier, and little known to them resembled her preferred form rather closely. There was a dark hood over their form and their face was female with what appeared to be a large upon their head. Their eyes and cheekbones were sunken in almost devoid of any sort of indication of eyes save for two small bluish dots at the center that appeared to be on fire.</span>

At the very least, it was a teammate’s. Ankou&#39;s sudden bewilderment by the reality marble caused him to temporarily lose track of his goal. He looked forward to see Niers’ wheel headed straight for his chest. Rider lifted his scythe to offer some protection bracing for a painful blow, and then… nothing? There was another change of scenery, this time complete darkness. Before Ankou could get his bearings, yet again, he was in a different spot! Ejected from a wall, Ankou could see Niers below him. Boogeyman had also accompanied Rider out of the wall. 

“You’re interfering more than helping!” Ankou protested. In some sense, it was true. The confusion created by Boogeyman’s noble phantasm had thrown Ankou for a spin multiple times. Unwilling to coordinate with Boogeyman, Ankou pushed off the wall breaking their double formation,  speeding his way down to Niers with a swing of his scythe from above.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Frustration rising as Leo continued to just skirt by their attacks, Galvin at the very least had a brief moment to finally notice the area around him. At first it was a chill up his spine, wherever they were this place was just wrong. It felt as though he was being watched, and not just by the man trying to kill him currently, no it was if the cardinal directions themselves were trying to bore a hole into each side of his body. Like the ground was hiding eyes, any blade of dull grass was looking, each window in any building had a gaze, the hairs on the back of his neck stood as he felt his will start to dwindle. Galvin wasn&#39;t usually one to take to fear like a little boy, but he&#39;d be lying if he didn&#39;t admit he had to fight to keep himself focused, if only thanks in large part to the stale heavy air, &quot;B-been a long time, s-s-since I had a nightmare.&quot; he involuntarily mumbled out.

It was all so... Suffocating...

This small dance with fright is what lead to Leo getting a hook into the Investigators shirt, what would have been a simple thing to dodge had no issue snagging a catch and ripping the young man out of his thoughts and right off his feet no less. With his awareness brought back as his mind focused on the immediate danger again he saw himself on a collision course with Ace, pulling his hands around he tried to pull some of his water along side him so he could try and stop himself, but only succeeded in drenching the fisherman with it.

Suddenly, Galvin was violently flung onto Ace&#39;s shield! The young boxer hugely outpacing the veteran in his initial goal of closing the distance as he flew once again through the air, a perfect mirror of the previous action the two investigators underwent. The man stopped dead in his tracks, throwing his shield aside to catch the young boxer in his arms. Ace&#39;s momentum worked in his favor, allowing him to barely catch Galvin and keep his balance at the same time.

&quot;Don&#39;t you use my own tactics against me, punk!&quot; The man barked at Leo, clenching Galvin&#39;s shirt tighter as he began spinning in a fashion the boxer recognized...

But the motion quickly faded out as the fisherman jumped back to his Servant&#39;s side by way of water spray, out of reach of the man&#39;s mighty throw. Ace finally put Galvin on the ground, a hand reaching inside his inner jacket.

&quot;Since you&#39;re the water guy,&quot; He spoke to Galvin, pointing to the countless crab creatures the fisherman invoked. &quot;Do something about these things, will you?&quot;

Meanwhile, Ace fished out his magnum, closing his eyes and focusing on the rounds inside the barrel. If the fisherman had what it took to dodge regular bullets, then these next rounds would have to be harder, stronger, and most importantly, <em>faster</em>. It seemed the man wasn’t about to let Leo dodge twice.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Just as the wheel was about to hit Ankou dead-on, they were whisked away, pulled into the dirt and out of sight, and the weapon went whirling on through thin air. At least, it did for a few metres, before it would suddenly swerve, performing a 180-degree turn and flying back towards Niers! It was definitely a curveball, but hardly a surprising one. After all, the idea of Assassin carelessly tossing his Noble Phantasm without a means of reclaiming was reckless, even for one such as him. 

Still, even though both servants were out of sight, that didn’t mean they were off the hook. Before the servant even had a chance to respond to his master, they were set upon by the ghoulish children encircling them, clawing at them like common beasts. Assassins were not classes well known for their durability, and the assault was only worsened by the presence of Leo, a mere human, even frailer than the weakest of servants! It was all made even worse by Ankou’s rapid approach, giving them only seconds before Niers found himself cleaved in twain.

Fortunately, he had a plan, a plan that would get both of them out of trouble. Not an elegant plan, not a delicate plan, not even a particularly good plan, but still a plan. Step one, he reached out and grabbed Leo by the scruff of his shirt. Step two…

<em>SMASH!</em> In the blink of an eye, Niers’ own wheel would slam into his chest, sending him flying backwards, and dragging Leo along with him. The two of them would be sent a great distance away from the investigators, and amid their fellow islanders, with just barely enough speed to make it past Ronda’s barrier before it finished. They’d gained some distance, but it was nevertheless a costly retreat. Assassin could already feel himself being pressed to his limits, and he doubted Leo was faring much better. And worst of all…</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><strong>”Useless, useless, useless!”</strong> Assassin spat. Even as his peers wasted away, beaten and broken and drained of everything they had, he could spare not even a single drop of sympathy for their suffering. In fact, their helplessness inspired only greater and greater disgust. <strong>”You’re all worthless braindead scumfuck bastard piles of trash that should be gunned down like the degenerates you are! You serve ZERO purpose! You should all kill yourselves NOW!”</strong>

But in that moment of sheer rage, there was opportunity. All these lives, teetering on the edge, barely able to protect their precious souls? If they could not make themselves useful, then Niers would simply force the matter.

<em><strong>”██ ████ █████, ████ ██ ████!”</strong></em> Began Niers’ chant. No matter how hard one tried to listen to it, they could not make heads or tails of what was said. Much the opposite - the harder one tried to find meaning within his speech, the more like nothing it began to sound like. Perhaps it was for the best that it couldn&#39;t be understood. Just hearing it was enough to cause one’s head to feel heavy, as though a great weight was pressing down upon it. <em><strong>”██ ████ ██████, █ ████ ████ ████! ██ ████████ ███ █████ ████, █████ ██ ████ █████!”</strong></em>

The air in the Reality Marble grew hot, hot enough to make the mere act of breathing painful to do. But if the investigators were to turn their attention away from Assassin and to the Islanders around him, they would see that their own discomfort was a drop in the ocean to what they were experiencing.</span>

The words that escaped their lips were smoke. With their nerves reduced to nothingness, could they even feel pain anymore? It did not matter. <em>They</em> did not matter. All that remained of them was a shimmering light, a silhouette in place of a skeleton. Their personhood was carved away, their life torn apart, solely to get to the centre of their existence - the human soul. A precious, valuable thing, the territory of an enlightenment long since lost to the world. To manipulate the soul was an impossibility. But Niers had no such ambition to do such a thing.

No, this was more akin to adding kindling to a flame.

<strong>”AVE DOMINUS DIABOLUS; DEAL WITH THE DEVIL! FOR THESE SOULS, GRANT ME THE POWER TO BREAK FREE OF THIS PRISON!”</strong>

With his Noble Phantasm released, the light of those souls were from brilliant white to burning red, each of them flowing towards Assassin, pooling in the palm of his hand. When all of them had gathered, the resulting conflux of magical energy was no larger than a tennis ball, but the sheer energy radiating off it was like that of a reactor, so much so that the air around it crackled and warped. With his “key” in hand, all that was left was to unlock the door out of Fear Breaker. So, he outstretched his arm, and spoke one word.

<strong>”Liber.”</strong></span>

All that could be experienced was the blistering feeling of overwhelming heat, the sickening stench of sulphur, and the taste of iron on their tongues. But as it all faded away, and their senses recovered from the assault upon them, they would find a distinct change in their surroundings - the gothic, dreary realm of Fear Breaker had a hole punched through it, revealing the vivid madness of the real world, and most importantly of all, the Canopus. The structural integrity of the Reality Marble was compromised, and it wouldn’t last much longer, but that was never the point of this exercise.

The intention of this assault? It was never to secure victory for Nirvana. <strong>It was to ensure the outsiders lost.</strong>

It was clear that releasing his Noble Phantasm in such a manner had cost Niers much. Calling forth his Noble Phantasm was exhausting enough, to say nothing of his wounds nor the mana drain he had been experiencing. But nevertheless, he turned to address Leo.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">“Fishsticks…” Leo swore as he looked over his fallen comrades. They all looked terrible. A mixture of being mauled by demonic children, Servants, and their own fears. Leo wanted to crawl down next to them and cry as Fear Breaker stripped his individuality away. However, that pity was squashed by something else. Something darker, more corrupt.

“Traitors. <strong>YOU ALL ARE TRAITORS! GUPPIES WAITING AROUND FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO SAVE YOU!</strong>” Leo snarled, anger erupting. These people weren’t even <em>trying</em> to get back home. Did they hate their island? Their home? If that were the case…

<em><strong>Then Peter could do what he wanted.</strong></em>

And so he did.

And reality bent.

As Peter punched a hole in Fear Breaker, Leo scrambled through the opening, cackling giddily. He looked around the docks as if it were a loved one he had not seen in years. He wanted to hug the ground and never let go.

Despite that, the fisherman turned towards his Servant and shivered. Peter looked terrible. Death’s door hadn’t come knocking yet, but in his current condition, Peter couldn’t win a fight against a goldfish, let alone two Servants. His days were numbered. Leo’s Servant was going to die.

Yet the feelings of grief and loss were minimal. The emotions were detached and fragmented, muddied by mud and corrupted expression. Leo took his fishing rod, and hoisted it, facing his Servant. Despite the lack of feeling, Leo’s face was a wreck, dribbling snot and tears. Another contradiction.

“You never stop playing the objective. You’ve got it.” Leo said, wiping his face. Using the motion as a start, Leo waved his fishing rod. A hook imbedded itself in the base of Peter’s neck, digging into the murderer’s flesh. The fishing rod and line went taut. The Assassin went soaring over the pier, garments flying, and fell into the ocean with a thunderous splash.</span>

Leo worked frantically, knowing that the other Servants, Masters, and who knew what else were about to burst through Fear Breaker’s breach. If that skeletal Servant froze the water now… That was it. Game over. Peter’s several year streak would end.

The magical strain on using such a massive piece of bait was beginning to take a strain on the fisherman. His vision wavered, his legs threatened to buckle, and his body felt like it had gotten dropped in an ice fishing hole. Yet despite that, Leo soldiered on, manuevering the line into the ideal location: <strong>The Canopus</strong>.

“<strong>You always were…</strong>” The line snagged.

“<strong>My best…</strong>” The line ran out.

“<strong>Friend..</strong>” The line burned with magical energy.

There was a monstrous roar as the Nirvanan harbor erupted, and a slew of tentacles appeared around the Canopus. They wrapped around the ship, the propellers, and the stern. Using a Servant for powerful Magecraft, even a dying one, had created a monster.

“<strong>YES! GO PETER! SQUASH THEIR HOPE! RUIN THEM! MAKE THEM FEA—</strong>”</span>

A swift movement ripped right through Leo’s back, emerging from the other end as he felt blood spill out of his lips and nose. A look down would introduce him to the culprit, as he saw a long, black blade emerge from his chest. Bone matter, blood and residues of organ tissue lay around the tip of the knife, before it retracted itself and disappeared, letting more blood spill over and touch the ground.

Then it was followed by another stab. At his ankle. And another, at his shoulder. More and more knives impaled him from all sides, treating him like a pincushion.</span>

<em>”May you feel the most mournful of betrayals, you wretch.”</em> A feminine, ladylike voice emerged from the shadows, exuding elegance and authority. Another knife then appeared, lunging forward as it stabbed at the fishing line and cut it in half, severing the connection to the monstrous creature assaulting the canopus.

With its source of mana gone, it was swiftly fading. Damage had been done, resulting in the canopus’ hull being cracked and parts of his engine failing, but it was far better than having no ship at all.

The last knife stabbed Leo right under his sole. A grim reminder of where it all started, where the knives emerged from the black of night and executed all of the members of the British council, allowing the Saxons to reign supreme. A plan by the wicked Hengist, executed by a certain woman.

The lady appeared at sea, teetering near the edge of the ocean as she observed the canopus. She seemed displeased, annoyed that the ship had sustained even the slightest of damages. However, it would be hard to discern such disappointment, due to her cold and immaculate visage. She felt robotic and prickly, like a shard of coloured glass. Something you would never touch, but couldn’t help but admire.</span>

<em>”That imbecile couldn’t die in peace. He had to drag me alongside him. Using his own corpse as a catalyst for a summon…”</em> Her face remained static, but her voice was furious. <em>”How laughable indeed. Not to mention, I could barely recognize him. My husband never looked that way, at least.”</em> She affirmed, dwelling on that thought a bit longer before turning back to the group.

<em>”Did you know him? Who was he? The beast calling itself Vortigern.”</em> She asked. The more she talked, the more her body felt faint. If the investigators were to take a closer look, they noticed that underneath her beautiful gown was the faint trace of a damaged Servant frame. Whoever had summoned Rowena had done so with the roughest of materials, using a half destroyed Servant frame that could crumble at any minute. It was clear that Rowena wasn’t long for this world. Instead, she wanted to know exactly why she had been summoned. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnugget</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="DrakinGP#2895">@DrakinGP</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span></span>

How she hated this whole ordeal. Ronda expected adventure and mystery, but instead she was cooped up in a murky swamp for nearly months and once she got the opportunity to spread her legs. The individuals she encountered along the way, for the lack of a better word, were morons. The fact that a rudimentary fisherman gave them so much trouble was infuriating, but nothing upon this island had truly been normal had it. 

As their opponents unleashed their hail mary attempt to destroy the canopus, Ronda tried to rack her brain for a spell that could protect such a vast area in so little time. However, her worries quickly subsided and her anxiety waned as an ally appeared out of nowhere and struck Leo from behind. A Deus Ex Machina if there ever was one. Though the mechanic did not question their appearance, she knew her duty and the fact that there was little time to waste. Flying across the hull of the ship, she’d pull out her trusty universal multi tool and produced a heavy sigh. “I guess we are going back to the drawing board for you. Can you please try to stay in one piece this time?” Ronda swept around the area of the ship to analyze if the ship was still viable for transport and if it could be repaired in time for escape. If not then whatever Investigators are left will have to find a way to cram into that plane she had been working on all this time.</span>

When she witnessed the actions taken by them to get stronger, the blatant sacrifice of their own people, Boogie knew their soul was already lost. There was no hope for them. It did not matter that they broke the veil she created for the damage had already been done. To use the amount of mana they did just to escape while already being drained was enough to put them on shaky ground. Assassin was fully prepared to continue the fight, to defend her people and the ship, just as she had promised. However, same as Ronda the specter found that her effort was no longer necessary. 

From the shadows appeared yet another dangerous femme fatale. She had scurred and tore apart the blubbering fool of a fisherman. She said her name was Rowena and mentioned her husband, Vortigern. “I see…How curious. I personally have not met your husband. My stay upon the island has been a series of investigations into the whereabouts of a man that I now believe to be dead. A former Investigator by the name of Dorian. Although I had heard whispers of a monster trampling through the lands, my master never took enough interest to go see them. However, I have existed in many forms with many different faces through multiple millenia, so I am certain I have seen him in passing in some past life. Though I shall admit it is serendipitous that you and your husband were one to appear on this island.” 

Assassin’s gaze shifted over to the frantic red head who was flying around analyzing the damage of the ship. “Mechanic, why don’t you read them a passage from that journal you were showing master and myself the other day, preferably the one about a rainy night.”</span>

I feel like there are more important things to worry about right now, but if you insist. You are the boss after all.” Reaching into her side satchel, Ronda pulled out a red leather notebook, one she had lifted from the body of her former employer Homer Harold Hathoway, when they first arrived on the island. Turning to a page somewhat toward the latter half of the booklet, she began to read. “And so upon a stormy night the King shot forth with his mighty lance to impale his opponent. His speed was great, but the resourcefulness of his opponent and their servant was too great for him to fully mitigate entirely. The slippery used Lancer’s own master as a shield to soften the impact and slow the assault. Both felt the point of his weapon, yet the foolish bartender received the brunt of it. The king did not retaliate further, simply making remarks that seemed to only infuriate the CEO. Even in defeat, he was able to keep his head high. Lancer rose with his deceased master in his arms, and walked away into the misty night. A proper showing in the competition, cut down too soon. Though for all that had the pleasure of witnessing him, we will all remember the time we basked in the Glory of King Uther Pendragon.” Ronda then started flipping haphazardly through pages. “From that point it’s just notes on future fights and musings on how he could take credit as victor of this competition without anyone noticing. I believe at the back there is a recipe list on how to poison an elderly person…I don’t know why he’d want to know that.”</span>

Ankou had seen many thousands of men die for the worst of reasons but at least he understood the motives behind them, no matter how twisted they were. The Islanders on the other hand... What did they die for? For just a moment Ankou missed the ability to observe every little detail of human conflict. Perhaps having a corporeal form did come with it&#39;s downsides.

The cold aura surrounding Ankou would quickly subside as he realized the threat was neutralized. Before the investigators stood a new servant who seemed to be on their last leg. &quot;I&#39;m sad to say my knowledge of &#39;vortigern&#39; on this island is just as limited as my comrade.&quot; Ankou tipped his hat down as if he where ashamed at his lack of knowledge. &quot;I am more curious as to your appearance.&quot; He stated, addressing Rowena

This wasn&#39;t happening. No, this <em>couldn&#39;t</em> be happening. As Leo collapsed into a heap, he couldn&#39;t help but revel in the unfairness of all this. The moment he and Peter had gotten the upper hand against impossible odds, some woman came out of nowhere, babbling about <em>Vortigern</em> of all things.

Who gave a bucket of fish paste about Vortigern? He didn&#39;t matter! Just another monster roaming the woods. Just another leviathan to drag sailors to their dooms.

This wasn&#39;t fair.

They had done everything right. They had done nothing wrong. These investigators were the cancer here. So why...

<strong>Why was Vortigern&#39;s ghost helping them? Why was the island forsaking them?</strong>

No, that was wrong. Nirvana would never betray them. It was their home. It didn&#39;t want these outsiders disgracing it. The island was enraged with their existence, and even the fish were changing their behavior.

&quot;Ergh... You all...&quot; Leo slurred as he got to his feet. He was covered in Rowena&#39;s stab wounds, oozing blood. The wisest decision would be to retreat and escape to fight another day. Leo didn&#39;t want to lose their island, and yet...

He was sure that these investigators would take it from him. Besides, Peter&#39;s death would not be in vain.

&quot;You&#39;re all a bunch of snakeheads. Invasive fish razing the sea as you come and go... You won&#39;t ruin this island. I won&#39;t let you take it. <strong>It&#39;s ours. Ours. LEAVE!</strong>&quot; 

Leo took a knife used for cutting line from his belt, and lunged in a final desperate charge towards the investigators, but it was barely even an attack. It was like the last flop of a fish before it ran out of air and died.

Pitiful.

Before he could even work up a proper attack to counter the crabs, only pulling up water and blasting a few of them away with water bullets, only to be taken back in shock as a half living servant came up and ran Leo through as he was mounting up for his next big attack, and yet it seemed like it wouldn&#39;t even get to be his final one as it was stopped cold by the sneak attack.

Looking at the crumbling frame underneath the visage of a person, Galvin let out a bit of a sigh as it seemed to never truly end with this place, it was one thing after another non stop. He kept on his toes not sure if this Rowena person was at all trust worthy, upon hearing her question he thought back to the people he&#39;d seen, and he severely doubted the eccentric man in pitch black sunglasses he met in the snow was the person she was after, and Ankou did all the talking needed. Placing a hand on the side of his head the investigator was starting to calm down a bit.

Until he heard the desperate jeers of the fisherman. Seemingly still alive and unfortunately just as stubborn as the beat down didn&#39;t bring him back to his senses, getting sick of him and this islands antics, Galvin tightened his fist wound it back ready to try and put Leo down for good. Letting the fisherman get in close, his free hand grabbed the wrist with the knife and pushed it to the side before he stepped in and crashed his fore head into the man&#39;s nose so he could grab the knife. With his other first already pulled back, let it fly forwards to knock the man off his feet, hoping to pull the blade from his hand.

Pocketing one hand he surrounded the other with water, filling it with some mana for quick and hopefully painless shot. Standing over where Leo would be laying, he pulled his fist back, &quot;Seeing as it&#39;s your dying wish, feel glad to know we&#39;ll be leaving pretty soon.&quot;</span>

The one boy was quick to action and swiftly subdued him, striking him with a form of water manipulation to the temple. A rather humane way of taking out an enemy, however, stranger things have happened upon this island so far and they couldn’t afford to be too cautious.

Both arms of Assassin shot forth in the direction of Leo, one grabbed the fallen fishing rod and snapped it in half between the servant’s strong grip, the other flew directly at the man, claws drawn out. Her palm broke through the man’s rib cage, grasped upon the beating organ hidden within his left breast and in systematic motion ripped his heart straight from the body. For the briefest moment she examined the innard, surmising if there was anything peculiar to be seen in its makeup. Although she didn’t expect it to be blackened, Boogie was mildly curious if the effects of the island carried any sort of reflection in this part of them. This abject pondering only lasted a moment or so, just long enough to get a decent gleam of it before squeezing down in her grasp and crushing the heart between her clawed fingers.</span>

The fisherman’s demise was assured at this point, Gavin with the killing stroke and Assassin to lightly ensure there were no further supernatural elements at play. Her gaze shifted once more to the floating Queen. A savior to the lot of them, there was a sense of disappointment in Assassin for she felt that there wasn’t much more she could offer for Lady in White’s inquiries. “If it is no disrespect to your majesty. I recently promised to get my master and the other visitors off of this island. Though with today serving as a prime example the denizens of Nirvana are attempting to keep them from leaving. There is an evil here, a darkness invisible to the naked eye. Is there anything you know about the current state of this place and its people that I need to be aware of in order to ensure my own people retreat safely? I notice you are injured and are only hanging on by a thread…Is there anything I can do to give you more time? You were a godsend, you effortlessly ended a foe that I struggled to even touch. Perhaps you are more suited to be their guardian than I.” There was no visible emotion upon Assassin’s face, though it was clear that she was genuine about her words. Something Ryn never truly grasped about her. The boogieman was capable of so much destruction and horror, but removed from the task hand, the battle, and the evil that surrounded them, all she truly was at her core was a mother looking out with her children.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Rowena remained expressionless, but a fidget in her hand hinted at disappointment. Ankou seemed to know nothing about the &#39;Vortigern&#39; that had been summoned on the island. The enigmatic Assassin and their apparent Master had nothing to offer as well. The only thing they could tell her was a tale, one about a king from the same period as her.

<em>&quot;...That is not who I am interested in.&quot;</em> Rowena whispered, crossing her fingers. <em>&quot;The king I served was never noble, nor heroic. Nothing about them was remembered fondly.&quot;</em> She said with narrowed eyes. Before she could continue, however, Leo rose back up. His injuries were fatal. There was no chance of him surviving Rowena&#39;s Noble Phantasm, so he tried to drag others down to his level. 

A foolish mistake, as Galvin and Boogie intercepted the fisherman quickly, incapacitating their foe for the last time as Rowena stared at the emotionless Leo with mild curiosity. She then turned to Boogie, who had attempted to gain answers of their own.

<em>&quot;I do not care for the problems on this island. I am in no state to remain, after all.&quot;</em> She muttered, staring at her damaged frame. <em>&quot;I simply came here because of a promise. I was given it when summoned. A simple order by a dead beast.&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;Let the world know that I once lived.&quot;</strong>

Things were coming together as the more perceptive individuals in the group started to grasp the meaning behind Rowena&#39;s message. She hadn&#39;t saved their lives out of goodwill, but out of pragmatism. Whoever Vortigern was, they had ordered Rowena to spread the word of him around the world.

What better way of doing so than by letting people leave the island?

<em>&quot;When they gave me that order, I finally understood.&quot;</em> Rowena nodded. <em>&quot;That they were indeed Vortigern. Perhaps not in body, nor in mind. Despite that, they were most definitely my beloved.&quot;</em> She said with a tone that felt both mocking and endearing.</span>

<em>&quot;I apologize for any issues my pathetic husband has caused.&quot;</em> She gave a light bow, her body starting to vanish into pure white ash. <em>&quot;And I cannot assist you in whatever it is you seek to accomplish,&quot;</em> She looked back to Boogie. <em>&quot;but promise me this, strangers,&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;through life and death, keep the memory of Vortigern in your hearts. Be it one of love or hate.&quot;</strong>

And with that, Rowena vanished, her Servant frame disappearing alongside her, completely spent and used. Whatever had happened to Vortigern, it had most likely ended in his demise. Despite that, he used the last moments of his life to summon the existence of Rowena through his own corpse. The investigators had no idea why the mad tyrant had done such an irrational action. All they knew was that his actions had saved them. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnugget</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="DrakinGP#2895">@DrakinGP</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>
