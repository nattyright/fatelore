It was clear that Donald was slowing himself so that Granel could keep up with him. The massive investigator&#39;s footsteps splashed against the ocean&#39;s surf. Despite his size, his stride was barely longer than Donald&#39;s. Combine that with the Servant&#39;s enhanced physique and he could probably lap Granel along Nirvana.

<em>Splash. Splash. Splash.</em>

After running through a slew of differing terrains, Granel slowly jogged to a stop. He put up a finger. &quot;<strong>Sorry. I can march for a long time, but I&#39;m no marathon runner. I feel like we&#39;ve just ran from Nirvana to Alexandria.</strong>&quot;

Granel stood there, catching his breath, before standing straight. He nodded to Donald, before looking around.

&quot;<strong>Wow. Hey, Donald. Look...</strong>&quot;

Wasn&#39;t this strip of beach familiar? It took a moment for it to click in both Donald&#39;s and Granel&#39;s heads:

This was where they first washed up on Nirvana.

All that water he had drunk before had dried up the further they went, siphoned from the very air around them. If he were a normal man in his shape, he wouldn’t have even made it to the ocean in the first place.

Yet even a ‘super-man’ had his limits. Donald turned to see Granel finally wave the white flag and slowly stop his pace altogether. Unfortunate, but necessary. 

“I feel ya. Must feel close to what I had when I came back from the mountains,” He said once the distance had been closed. Both of his lungs ached at the slightest thought of that trek. Despite the warm temperature, he shivered in his boots.

Never again.

He instead turned his attention to their rest spot. Debris still littered the beach, albeit in a much smaller quantity. Scavengers or Mother Nature, this golden strip would eventually return to its unblemished state.

Granel noticed it first, though. Donald took a closer look at the spot they were in, and clicked. He pointed at a spot just down the way, “Aye. That looks close t’where I washed up. Looks a lot different in the sun, but it’s too… familiar. Fer lack of better term.”

A lot of time had passed, since that night. Survivor of a near-drowning experience, his search for his previous Master fueled by a desire for booze. Man, was he pissed at the circumstances!

Even the Canopus was close by. Not as close as that time, but in vision all the same. Sure enough, there were the looks of a battle. People were gathered, and other Servants fought. His fingers twitched, eager to grip the two hilts at his hips.

“Oooh, good times! Great times, even! But…” he motioned to the multitude of people further down the beach.

“Mayhaps not the time.”

Even the Scot had his time and place, it seemed.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">As the blood of man and beasts seeped into the earth, so did Nirvana awaken from its slumber.

The sun rose, red and shining over the accursed land. The rot continued to ravage the forests, corrupting the minds of Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants and gobbling them up like a famished beast. Nirvana was changing. It had always been changing. Months. Years. Decades. Bit by bit, it eroded the city with a sickening persistence, hollowed it from the inside out, then wore it like a second skin. It fit snugly, like a glove. 

Until the outsiders punctured it like a thorn at its side. Nirvana bled. Wept. Cried for help as the corruption underneath reared its ugly head.

And Koji awoke with a monumental headache. 

Rest assured, it wasn&#39;t his first rodeo. His sleep had often been fitful, though it had decidedly worsened over the past few days. Drugs could no longer suppress the throbbing pain, and as the hours went on, a sense of dread would start trickling into his heart. It made him feel as if his heart had been caught in a vice, one that was lined with many sharp needles. And the pain only eased when Scylla was near. 

He should&#39;ve suspected that something was amiss. Scylla, despite being summoned as a Rider, possessed excellent Magic Resistance. Whether it was a conscious act or a byproduct of their unique bond, there was indisputable fact in how only her presence - not drugs, not diet, and most certainly not rest - could alleviate his symptoms. Without a doubt, he had been cast under some type of spell.

Yet the doctor would not suspect a thing. After all, Nirvana, his <em>home</em>, was currently being trampled by the very outsiders he had failed to kill. They had laid waste to much of Nirvana&#39;s beautiful features, forcing it to vomit and bleed. The black substance that had oozed out of trees like sap - were it not the island&#39;s plea for help?

Now he regretted his momentary lapse of judgement back when he sought out petty vengeance from William. He should have used more of his precious time on his actual prey...

<em>Splat.</em>

A water bird fell next to him, twitching and leaking a pungent juice from its barely functional body. It was one of his familiars. An old one, judging by its unsightly state. Most of the meat on its brittle bones was gone, eaten clean off by all the microorganisms that had bred over its long-dead body over time. The flight it took to get here might as well be its last. In a few days&#39; time, the rest of its body would have eroded away and become one with the earth.

Nevertheless, the familiar had come to him in its final moments, which meant that it had something of interest to report. Its species was telling enough.

&#39;It&#39;s always the lake reserves.&#39; Koji prodded the bird with his cane, rolling it away from him as he severed the binding he had placed on the creature, freeing it from its curse. 

He straightened up from his sitting spot, the railings on the remains of a decommissioned cruise ship, which had once served as one of Nirvana&#39;s many venues. The view up here was excellent, providing him with an unobstructed view of the fight occurring at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span> while simultaneously keeping him from stepping into the occasional mud puddle that pooled around the trees. 

<em>&#39;You&#39;d think the outsiders would have two brain cells to rub together and pick somewhere more discreet to hide in,&#39;</em> he let his unfiltered thoughts run rampant between the telepathic link between him and Scylla.

And that was his downfall. It seemed that this ragtag team had never made it further past their fabled safehouse at the lakes.

The battle at the docks only further drove that point home. With their lifeline exposed and stranded on the beach, why would the outsiders ever leave this spot unguarded?

As the giant whale rammed itself into the Canopus, Koji began to gather more birds to his side, surrounding him and his Servant like a halo as he instructed them to survey the nearby area instead. Granel seemed like a dutiful man. Even called himself a security guard. With the ship they had arrived in under attack from the collective effort of animals and Nirvanans alike, how long would it take for him and his Servant to come running to help?</span>

It was still decently far away, though not as far as before. To someone like Donald, who could sprint most of the way there, it was a quick walk, skip, and a jump. For Granel, it was another few dozen minutes of running.

He sighed. Even if he didn&#39;t know how close they were to the end of the journey, this felt <em>fitting</em>. Here they were, standing at the start of their journey, and so much had changed since then.

There was no hate in his heart for the people of this island. He still despised Vortigern and William, but the people were byproducts of a disaster that stretched beyond Granel&#39;s understanding. He was a protector, but not a magical one. Still, it felt like the Investigation Team had fought a battle they were destined to lose, and were still thrashing, all these weeks in.

&quot;<strong>We have come far.</strong>&quot;

The spike impaled in his body, the same on that sapped the heat from his bones, felt strangely warm, as if Granel&#39;s heart were still beating. It was a strange feeling. He was proud of himself, of Donald, of his comrades in arms.</span>

He stopped.

There was a figure between Granel and the Canopus. A figure that he had just pondered earlier that day. He sat on a ship, coat fluttering slightly in the sea breeze. Highlighted by the red sky and the darkened water, he looked like an angel of death.

Naoharu Koji.

&quot;<strong>Hey, doc. Long time no see.</strong>&quot; Granel said, hand in his pockets as the billowing sections of his suit fluttered slightly. The security guard looked surprisingly relaxed despite the severity of the situation. As he removed a hand in greeting—to Koji&#39;s delight—he looked as woundless as he ever did. Nobody could survive on Nirvana for weeks looking so immaculate.

Healing. Immortality. As perfect as when Koji first met him.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re not here to simply watch the fireworks display, eh?</strong>&quot; Granel jerked his chin towards the Canopus, where a massive snake was now attempting to throttle somebody. &quot;<strong>Though to be fair, it wouldn&#39;t shock me. Your constitution was never the best. I&#39;ve throttled enough people to know the difference. Where&#39;s that Servant of yours?</strong>&quot;

Granel looked around, eyeing the surf. Between the ocean and Donald&#39;s mustache, he would bet half of his contract payment that Koji&#39;s leviathan was hiding in there.

It took him a few moments to even spot the person, but there he was. Atop another shipwrecked vessel stood a figure that was oddly familiar. Looks like Granel&#39;s idea of a doctor varied greatly from his own. Not too many had a small army of fowl at their fingertips. 

Saber took a few steps away from the deep ocean, and his vision swept the dark blue for any big masses. 

<em>Granel</em>, he thought to his brother, <em>don’t get too comfortable. All it’ll take is a moment and you’ll be gone t’the bottom of the sea.</em>

Eager fingers found their home at his sides. It did not take a Caster to remember the dangers that a Sea Serpent could pose on their home turf. That one was a menace on dry land well enough, yet that made her all the more terrifying.

“I doubt the good Doctor ‘ere would tell us somethin’ like that, Granel,” Donald said. “An’ I doubt ye came all this way to give us a wave goodbye and wishes fer safe travels.”

There was no point to hide his blatant staring contest with the great blue. He didn’t even spare a glance for Koji, too eager to get things on the road. The chance to go two-zero was not an opportunity that washed up at one&#39;s feet every day.

“Looks like yer friend is a little scared,” he called out. “Afraid to see me dish out another wallopin’?”</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">From within the sprawling sea of blue, Scylla was watching.

The island was furious with those that had defiled it. These outsiders had invaded it, trampled its customs and its ways underfoot, disrupted the natural order. Now, like one of the divinities of old, the land of Nirvana was punishing those who had wronged her. Like a plague, the dirt bled and the beasts went rabid, and fuelled by the ire of their Goddess, her worshippers went forth to purge the investigators and their sins from their homeland.

The noose was tightening. Even now, from underneath the waves, Rider could see a frantic struggle taking place at the Canopus, the wayward intruders doing their very best to protect the means of their escape. But, the Canopus was not her quarry. Nay, it was but bait for her true target.

<em>&quot;I won&#39;t complain about the foolishness of an enemy. It will make this a much simpler affair for the both of us.&quot;</em>

Sure enough, the lambs came to the slaughter. At the arrival of Granel Mason and his Saber, the hunter looked towards the blurry silhouette of Koji, up high upon the husk of a cruise, before turning her focus upon her opponent. Her prey. Her <em>loose end</em>.

There was still much that Rider did not know of the man called Donald McBane. But much the same could also be said of what Saber knew of the woman called Scylla. Many upon the island had seen much of her, of who she was on the surface, of who she once was, of who she wished to be, of her true and false selves. But there was one aspect of Scylla that had only been glimpsed in passing, a story only briefly skimmed, the tip of a towering iceberg.

Now, it was time to let all be revealed.</span>

It was a most familiar sound, like the noises made by the Canopus when it was first attacked, when it first began to sink. Had it actually...? No, fortunately, a glance over to the liner would reveal it still intact, at least for the time being.

Thousands of ripples began to appear on the surface of the sea, kicking up frenzied waves that slammed against the pale sand of the beach. It all began to click together. Something wasn&#39;t sinking. It was <em>rising</em>.

<em><strong>SPLASH!</strong></em> In an instant, a great eruption of water burst forth, and from the sea emerged a vessel, if one were generous enough to call it that. It was a patchwork, the wreckage of dozens upon dozens of ancient ships forcibly merged together, the rusted iron of warships bolstered by the rotting wood of rowboats, and all the gaps filled in by a pallid, slimy material that was undeniably organic in nature. 

As the mist and seafoam began to clear around the amalgamation of a ship, the “captain” of the vessel became clear to see, standing upon the prow, looking down at Granel and Donald. If there was ever any doubt, it had been dispelled. It seemed that her class container of Scylla was not a fluke after all. This was the full might of a Rider brought to bear.</span>

With that declaration of disdain, the ship began to shift, hatches upon the hull forcibly dragging themselves open, and gigantic cannons emerging outward. They were no different than those cannons that Scylla originally called forth during their initial confrontation. But instead of two, there were six guns pointing towards the pair of investigators, a half-dozen barrels of destruction aimed where they stood.

But, they did not fire.

<strong>”I have no fear of you, Saber. I have faced my fears, and felt the jugular of Phobos burst underneath my fang.”</strong> Rider declared, looking down at Donald and Granel as though they were naught but krill before a whale. <strong>”Standing where you are, can you say the same?”</strong></span>

Koji smiled. He looked as happy to see Granel as Granel was to see him. His hawk-like sight never missed a thing, seeing the security guard arrive in such pristine condition - barring the somewhat disheveled suit from all that running - pleased him greatly.

&#39;You&#39;ve been taking good care of yourself,&#39; he observed, overlooking Granel&#39;s first question for the man himself. Why care about the Canopus at all? His target had shown up and was almost within his grasp. His heart lifted with relief.

&#39;The cottage, the labs, Vortigern.&#39; Koji counted off on his fingers all the songs his birds had been singing to him, diligently, as they spied over the lake reserves. &#39;You&#39;ve certainly kept yourself busy, and your regenerative ability has served you well. How many times have you died since? Your curse has vastly exceeded my expectations..&#39;

He raised his voice a notch, eyes gleaming with anticipation. &#39;Would you stay here a bit longer and let me study you?&#39;

Donald&#39;s suspicion was well-founded. The good doctor had come here to extend a personal invitation to his Master. It wasn&#39;t unlike the ones he used to issue to his research buddies. Granel had moved up on the ladder from a lab rat to a slightly more dignified lab rat! How inspiring.

Koji felt a tug on his mana reserves. An enormous vessel rose from the ocean&#39;s depths, shrouding the beachside in shadows and mist. Granel&#39;s second question would be answered by none other than the Servant herself. It seemed that they would have to help themselves first before they could even start thinking about helping their comrades in the distance.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Koji&#39;s skirting over Granel&#39;s question was slightly annoying, but it was also answered when Scylla appeared in the ocean. Granel&#39;s jaw threatened to drop as a massive ship appeared behind Koji&#39;s. Granel&#39;s first idiotic thought was that it looked similar to the Titanic. That quickly vanished as it revealed cannons.

The Titanic did <em>not</em> have cannons. Thankfully. Granel might&#39;ve had a mental collapse if Koji&#39;s Servant had the Titanic as a Noble Phantasm.

<em>So this is the bond between Servant and Master... Huh. This is pretty useful. If only we had it when we split up.</em> Could Donald hear every thought Granel was cranking out? It was surprisingly quiet, with a lack of Donald internal monologue.

Either Donald was a vegetable, or he was safe.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;ve been busy, doc.</strong>&quot; Granel admitted, shrugging casually. &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t like to think about how many times I&#39;ve died, but I&#39;ve had a few memorable ones. Someone tried to poison me with ricin by spiking my whiskey, once.</strong>&quot;

Koji didn&#39;t know if he was joking. The security guard seemed serious.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re serious about experimenting on me? What&#39;s with this obsessive nonsense? I&#39;m trying to leave. Isn&#39;t that what you people want?</strong>&quot; He squinted, before shaking his head. &quot;<strong>No. You&#39;re a doctor, and you aren&#39;t actively mauling my men. You just want me. Why?</strong>&quot;

The ocean breeze blew through the strip of beach, and Granel took a few steps forward towards Koji&#39;s boat. 

&quot;<strong>Trust me, immortality isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. I doubt you could recreate it, anyways.</strong>&quot;

Could Koji? A doctor with a bunch of rotting, immortal birds? A magus fueled by Nirvanan obsessiveness?  Granel shivered.

If Koji put his mind to it, he might actually be capable of it. 

That was unacceptable.

&quot;<strong>Let me pass, bird boy. My men are in trouble.</strong>&quot;

A disturbance in the ocean had birthed a great vessel, seemingly a mish-mash of the other ones that surrounded them combined into one. It stood tall and proud, much like the owner positioned on the prow. 

And like almost every other ship, cannons made themselves present and aimed directly at the pair on the beach. Bollocks. 

“Aha, well haven’t ye grown into yer own! Even yer funny talk is better! Though that smug look on yer face needs a good cleanin’ of. Make no mistake: I’ve no fear of whatever ye got planned fer yer surprise excursion!” he said. The sabre was drawn from its holster and pointed at Scylla for good measure.

<em>Granel, we might be a little fucked.</em> 

No way in hell they let them pass, not after the reveal of the vessel that Sea Serpent would use to blow them sky-high. If but one weapon of unadulterated destruction had been enough to nearly kill him back then, another five would do the job a few times over. How to dodge it?

He’d have to get on the ship and hope there wasn’t any misfortune with the action alone. That, or get Scylla to join him down on the beach. 

What Rider would leave a position of advantage?

The air grew tense with momentary silence, thick enough to cut with a knife. One of them would have to make the first move, and the lady with numerous cannons seemed the candidate. Donald bored daggers into her, ready for the first sign of trouble.</span>

In fact, had they done so, she would have been sorely disappointed. No, this was a fight that she craved dearly, a chance to redeem herself, to wash the muck of failure off her face with the waters of success. Anything less would be insufficient.

Was it obsessive? Perhaps. But so long as she won the fight, did that matter? History was penned by the victors. That was a fact she knew well. She&#39;d often ended up on the wrong end of the critical pen, but with this, she had an opportunity to be on the right side of the tale.

<strong>&quot;So be it!&quot;</strong> With a defiant cry, Rider pointed outward, the tip of her finger aimed directly at Saber. <strong>&quot;If your wish is a glorious death, then I shall grant it to you! DREADNOUGHT, FIRE!&quot;</strong>

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong> Six blasts of fire and gouts of smoke billowed out of the barrels, and with a skull-rattling boom, six cannonballs rushed towards Granel and Donald, threatening to reduce them into naught but a red splatter against the sands!

Meanwhile, elsewhere on the ship, the hull would begin to stir. Out from a gap in the metal casing, a massive, hulking tendril would emerge forth, reaching out before planting itself on the railing of the nearby cruise, next to Naoharu Koji.

Curing physical injuries is one thing, but your generation can even neutralize prolonged chemical reactions?&#39;

Death was a chemical process. Rot and decay was simply the result of the termination of biological functions that sustained a living being, before nature reclaimed it as its own. There was nothing romantic or mystical about it. It was a purely scientific process, one that was unavoidable and irreversible. His ever-deteriorating familiars served as the perfect demonstration of the futility of attempting to revert death.

But Granel&#39;s ability defied nature. A curse. Why had the man insisted on calling it a curse?

&#39;...Did someone bestow it on you?&#39; Koji contemplated further. &#39;Did someone use their own magecraft on you then? A binding - a curse, if you will - of immortality?&#39; 

If that were the case, then it&#39;d make things a tad easier. After all...

&#39;I can&#39;t recreate it.&#39; Koji admitted calmly. &#39;I&#39;m a doctor, I have my limits. Besides, immortality is meaningless if your subject is already dead.&#39;

He steadied himself against the railings as Scylla opened fire upon the beach and aimed to seal the fate of the outsiders in one fell swoop. Of course, Koji had high expectations of Granel&#39;s endurance, but the Saber must go. 

He climbed onto the tentacle that bridged the gap between him and the Dreadnought, letting it take him back to the bigger vessel. <em>&#39;I won&#39;t make the same mistake a second time,&#39;</em> he flexed his artificial circuits, opening up the channel between him and Scylla and allowing her to tap into an unrestricted pool of his mana. <em>&#39;Do as you wish, I won&#39;t hold you back this time.&#39;</em></span>

<em>You are NOT fucked. Don&#39;t say that. Don&#39;t you have a Noble Phantasm or something? Use it! They may be bigger and better, but you are small and hard to hit.</em>

To be fair, Granel was slightly miffed, and through their connection, Granel could feel this. Why did the doctor with a penchant for making bird zombies get to summon a literal sea monster, while Granel got a hairy Scotsman who drank all his liquor?

This was a truly unjust system.

Yet Donald could feel that Granel had absolute faith in his blood-brother—his Servant—and his ability to destroy Koji&#39;s Servant. Granel saw his Servant rush Scylla, and the Master clenched his fist.

Then the beach erupted.

Granel rushed forward as cannonballs exploded all around him. He was extremely fortunate. Maybe Koji&#39;s order had caused Scylla to focus on Donald, but Granel only had to dodge two cannonballs, which exploded on impact, searing and singing Granel&#39;s skin and haircut, which automatically began to heal itself.

&quot;<strong>Koji...! Are you seriously closing our discussion so easily? Striking at my Servant? What a terrible decision. As a doctor, I figured you&#39;d recognize a terrible loss of life when you...</strong>&quot;

Granel picked up a smoking bit of cannonball, which burned and scalded his fingers, causing the flesh to blacken beyond Granel&#39;s pigmentation.

&quot;<strong>...see it!</strong>&quot;

He flung the piece towards Koji as he rushed onto Koji&#39;s smaller ship. With a grunt, he ripped off part of the guardrail, and swung it like a baton.

Like Koji, Granel gave his Servant access to his mana reserve. Much to Donald&#39;s dismay, there was next to none. His Master was a third-rate mage, and he was a third-rate Servant.

They were going to die.

By the time the cannonballs had left for their mark, the target blurred to the right. Balls of iron were fast, but he was <em>barely</em> faster. When they had landed, the most he felt was the impact a few feet away.

He stumbled, but only for a moment. Scylla and Koji would watch him approach the vessel the Doctor had first claimed as his own. It’s distance from the shore was less than Scylla’s own, but still required a little wading. There was no way he could–

<em>Can’t believe the wool’s in the cracks of yer brain! I said we!</em>

Boots left the ground.

Previous speed gave him the incredible distance. A ladder hung on the side, and a rusty hole sat right next door. Metal shook as his weight collided with the hull, and the ladder quivered. It gave way almost immediately, but it had clung long enough to give him the opening. 

<em>If I go down, I expect to see yer eyes cloud over before I fade to nothin’! *

The Scot crawled through the guts and innards of the sunken ship, almost to the top. Light poured through a hole in the floorboards. His ticket to the Noble Phantasm.

*Furthermore, me Noble Phantasm needs some personal space violated. With our Mana Reserves combined, I might live past usin’ it.</em>

Scylla would see Donald emerge from the ground of the ship her Master had just left, with Granel on his way. Looks were certainly deceiving; Saber had reached a vantage point in record time. 

And his next jump was all but telegraphed.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The dog had been let loose of her leash. She&#39;d been given full authority to go all out, to do whatever it takes. She wouldn&#39;t make the mistake a second time. She wouldn&#39;t take this fool lightly, foolish though he was. She wouldn&#39;t <em>lose</em>.

Immediately, both Granel and Donald managed to avoid the first barrage. That was to be expected. She&#39;d given them plenty of time to register the threat in front of them, and plenty more time to plan a way to dodge. No, the first strike was never going to be the decider. She&#39;d claw her way to advantage after two, three, four, five thousand barrages. However many it took to grind them down into dust, she would do it.

<em>Them</em>. Not quite the correct term. In truth, she cared little for Granel. He was Koji&#39;s hunt, and she trusted him to see it through. Even should he fail, that mindless brute posed little threat to her, not by a long shot. She turned a blind eye to him. All the better to focus her attention solely towards the Saber.

He was fast. Before her cannons even started loading their second wave of shots, he was already moving. By the time they&#39;d finished, he was already up on that rusting cruise, a second away from crossing the distance. At this range, a flurry of cannon shots would certainly do some damage, but it would be a double edged sword. After all, if it had any fuel left in it, even trace amounts, it could explode and shake up the entire battlefield. No, that wasn&#39;t worth doing. Risk was worth avoiding at all cost, especially when the reward was not guaranteed. 

So, instead of using her cannons to attack Donald, she used the next best thing. The tendril that had rescued Koji would turn its attention back towards the boat, and like a speargun fired forth, it launched forward, seeking to skewer the scot. All the while, the cannons waited, aimed like vultures, waiting for their opportunity to wreak havoc.

<strong>&quot;If you truly wish to step foot upon this ship, then so be it! Come, and stand upon your grave, Saber!&quot;</strong></span>

Seeing Granel emerge from the cannon fire completely unscathed no longer surprised him. How many times had he witnessed the spectacle already? The time to be impressed had passed long ago. Now he was only interested in its methods. He wanted to learn the science behind it, which Granel was careful to deliberately keep under wraps.

&#39;You would repay your benefactor&#39;s generosity by killing him,&#39; he commented brutally, though there was little in the way of disapproval in his voice. A magus wasn&#39;t above killing another to keep a secret. Though-

&#39;A pity. You don&#39;t seem like the type to dabble heavily in magecraft. Even if I managed to take this &quot;curse&quot; off your hands, it&#39;d be akin to reverse engineering a product without an instruction manual.&#39; It&#39;d taken him years to make his grafting magecraft work on birds. He couldn&#39;t even begin to imagine the amount of work he&#39;d need to put in to decipher something a whole order of magnitude more complex. 

But, like he said, time was the one thing that neither he nor Granel had lacked. As the latter focused on the instant gratification of shattering the doctor&#39;s skull, Koji slid down behind the port railing of the Dreadnaught to avoid the searing pieces of shrapnel that soared past his head. 

<em>&#39;The Saber is fast.&#39;</em> He cautioned his Servant as he pulled a stoppered tube out of his coat. <em>&#39;Birds will engage in mobbing when they feel challenged. There is strength to speak in numbers. Overwhelm him if you must.&#39;</em>

Birds. Tiny, miniscule birds, each barely the size of Granel&#39;s pinky. Did creatures like this use to exist in the world?

Granel would be given little time to marvel at the wonders of nature. The next time he blinked, the birds would be gone, leaving behind naught but a faint blur and a buzzing around his head not unlike that of a bumblebee. Surely the doctor wasn&#39;t going to annoy him to death, now.</span>

Scylla was no fool, and it’s not like the plan he had was super hard to guess. However, he still had to make the jump. The odds of that not being—

“GAH!”

—interrupted by a tentacle that sliced into his side were next to none. Clever girl! Might’ve taken a page out of his book, for how sneaky it was. 

Unfortunately for her, sneaky was his middle name.

That tentacle got no further hits on him, as it ate the pointy of his sabre. While that would certainly not stop it, it gave a much needed period of free time. Slimy appendage recoiled and recouped, and dashed forward again.

It stabbed into the spot he had been moments before, the side furthest from the Noble Phantasm. A half second past, and a leather boot planted itself onto the metal rail. 

Three more seconds, and the other boot touched the wooden side. If the cannons had been fired, they shot past him with only inches to spare.

“Ready fer round two?”

Now Scylla, Donald, and Koji were all on the same vessel. Saber wasted no time in his assault, pistol and sabre drawn and on their way to cut-slash-gun down Rider where she stood!</span>

However, I&#39;m willing to dance with you.</strong>&quot; As Granel attempted to swing his handrail towards Koji, the doctor responded with a mysterious vial.

What was this doctor&#39;s deal with birds? Why could he make so many? How? Where did he get the materials to capture so many of them, and when would he run out? It was good to know that the magi of Nirvana had access to magical thought helmets and immortal avian entities, whereas Granel had a hairy Scotsman and his fists.

This wasn&#39;t fair.

Granel lunged into the smaller ship&#39;s cabin and locked the door. Almost immediately, Koji&#39;s familiars began to crawl through the crack in the door. Scanning the room, Granel saw what he was looking for:

A fire extinguisher and a signal flare gun. 

Lunging across the cramped cabin, the guard picked up the equipment and kicked open the door, allowing Koji&#39;s birds to fly in and attempt to tear at his various arteries and tendons. Raising his grand weapon, the security guard buried the birds under a mound of suppressive foam.

A few of the birds began lunging into the various arteries on Granel&#39;s neck. He plucked them like ticks, and crushed their skeletons under his might.

Exiting the ship, he saw Koji now reclining on Scylla&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Hopefully Donald would be able to fight Scylla without sinking them all.

<em>It&#39;s all yours. Try not to kill me.</em> Granel responded to his Servant, anticipating the drop in mana.</span>

No, it made sense, beyond Koji&#39;s freakish obsession with birdwatching. They were cheap. They could fly. They could recon. That was good enough.

It was ingenious, even if Granel disagreed with it.

&quot;<strong>Why not experiment with outsiders? It seems to be fairly common to you research-types. Magi love working with humans.</strong>&quot; Granel said bitterly. There was a story there.

He sped up the dreadnought and raised a colossal fist. With Granel&#39;s physical ability, he could possibly shatter Koji&#39;s ribcage.

Alas, her assaulting appendage was reduced to mincemeat, and her attempts to blast Donald out of the air with her cannons failed utterly, the screaming bullets shooting high into the air before exploding in the sky, leaving a cloud of fire, smoke and shrapnel behind. How unfortunate, but it had never been unexpected. 

No, in the end, this war was always going to be waged upon the deck of her dreadnought. Nowhere else.

<em><strong>&quot;Die.&quot;</strong></em>

Her rebuke was harsh, but that was to be expected. This was a grudge carried for weeks, finally unleashed. To commit anything less than her absolute to the destruction of a Saber would be a disgrace, to herself, to her master, to her past, to her present, and to her future. No, they WOULD die, here and now!

Donald rushed in, but Rider was prepared. Instantly, a half-dozen tendrils shot out of her flesh, three of which dedicated themselves to deflecting bullets, while the other three shot forth like spears, all of them with the same destination - the head.</span>

A happy little accident.&#39; Koji remained unfazed of Granel&#39;s accusation. &#39;Zombifying them wasn&#39;t my intention, at first. But my fianc&#233;e loved birds. So I thought I&#39;d pitch in where I can.&#39; 

<em>squish splat</em>

&#39;I will admit, the result leaves much to be desired.&#39; He watched as Granel continued to squash the little birds around him like fleas, a stern look settling on his features. &#39;You misunderstand me. I&#39;m not interested in creating zombies out of humans. No, I want the full package. Why not experiment on the outsiders, you ask?&#39;

He made an offhand gesture towards the Canopus. &#39;Why don&#39;t you ship me a bigger batch? You can barely scrounge up enough men to guard your vessel.&#39; He widened his eyes in jest and kicked his voice up a notch. &#39;It&#39;s not about the numbers, you fool. Practice does not make perfect if you don&#39;t have the necessary knowledge to make it work.&#39;

Though he <em>had</em> achieved near perfection in the case of the zombie birds. Even as the bones in their body turned into mince between Granel&#39;s fingers, the birds pulled themselves together in piles of goop. They struggled in earnest to free themselves from the fire extinguisher&#39;s foam, but their minuscule bodies lacked the strength to pull free. Size wasn&#39;t everything, but it really couldn&#39;t have helped right now. 

If only they could have gotten a little growth spurt.

...

&#39;I&#39;m not going to fight you.&#39; Koji said truthfully as Granel scaled the Dreadnought, placing the doctor within striking distance. What was Koji going to do? Fight back with his untrained fists and sluggish movements? Mages were weak, and he was weaker than most due to his circumstances. All Granel needed was to get a firm hold on him, and it&#39;d be game over.

Plants versus fists. The same old tricks, take two. Was Granel ready to tangle?

<em>SCREEEEECH!</em>

The bodyguard felt wind against his back, before receiving a sputter of foam on his neatly shaven head. A creature landed on his back, wings spanning the length of his shoulder and resting against the side of his head. Turning his head would bring him face to face with the biggest, ugliest, and most malformed hummingbird the world had to offer.

Two sets of wings. Five talons per foot. And it continued to grow. As another cluster of vine split itself from Koji&#39;s cane, a bulbous growth protruded from the creature&#39;s body, forming a second head with an elongated beak that could no longer be attributed to any species in particular. The creature was quickly morphing into a monster of its own. 

What a sight to behold. But not for long, apparently, as the first head of the creature turned towards Granel and aimed to peck at his eyes.

Granel was right. The game <em>was</em> unfair. Though he was hardly the one to talk now, was he?</span>

One ate lead almost immediately, and another followed a few seconds later. The last one would survive as the other three closed for the kill.

What a pincer attack! Donald considered every possible action and movement forward as they converged on his head, and realized that the options left something to be desired. His smile turned upside-down as quick as the spears that were about to skewer him. 

He went down at the last second, as his legs joined his boots on the ground. Steel flashed, and the first tentacle faded into dust and mana. The second one exploded right before it could alter its trajectory, blown into two separate noodles by the end of his smoking gun.

The last was able to slide past his defenses but missed its original mark. Another spurt of blood erupted from his skin, this time on his shoulder. It would not get a second chance, as another swing left it dead and gone.

Donald slid nearly the entire distance to Scylla, slowing down a couple feet short of the opponent herself. What a terrible idea! Didn’t he learn his lesson the first time? Arms and legs did just as much damage as those makeshift spears, if not more. It would be simple to crush him into bits and pieces.

And that’s when the air grew dense. Mana already made itself present in the atmosphere with the Noble Phantasm the three combatants stood, but it grew even <em>denser</em>.

Saber would finally release his own Noble Phantasm!</span>

Granel would get no further warning as his pathetically small mana pool was nearly all slurped up. Trace amounts remained with the Security Guard, and newfound tiredness washed over his strong bones. 

His feet went flat, and his entire body rose upward. A free palm pointed directly at Rider. 

“Ehe. Let’s make some room, right?”

It released. 

Koji would <em>feel</em> the expansion of space, and the creation of a solid surface a few feet behind. A circle glowed all around the ship, and even over the sides as the Bounded Field took shape. Even more, a faint sound could be heard from the circle <em>itself</em>. Did it sound like… far off cheers?

Donald flew back, to the other end of the makeshift field. A smug grin plastered face as if he had won some grand prize. He had done nothing more than make an enclosed area, and he was proud?

The two would feel the gaze of dozens, hundreds– no, thousands– of invisible eyes that watched their every move. Fake people that cheered for blood, for violence, for a <strong>victor</strong>. The air felt a touch hotter, yet not a single thing had changed about the environment. 

“No outside interlopers,” Donald said. “No interference. A true display of skill, wits, and <em>whatever bloody thing ye could sneak into this Arena!</em>”

“This’ll show who’s <em>truly</em> the better of us! May the best Servant win,” he once again pointed the sabre at Scylla.

“An’ may the loser die a painless death!”

He dashed forward, ready to make ribbons of Rider&#39;s flesh. The Fight began in its earnest!</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Once again, her tendrils fell short, unable to land the lethal strike that would put an end to Saber&#39;s life. But, that was hardly surprising, was it? No, she knew well from their first confrontation just how resourceful her opponent could be, taking every scrap of advantage he could get, finding a way to escape every bad situation, no matter how dire. 

But this time, Scylla intended to push that notion to the limit. How much could the odds be stacked him before the house of cards came crashing down? Like it or not, she was going to find out.

As Donald came rushing into range, Rider was immediately struck by how odd it was. This scrappy brawler, who specialised in weaving in and out of close combat, willingly putting himself in harm&#39;s way? This was not simple folly, no, even a complete and utter fool would learn their lesson after the thrashing she dealt out. This was different.

As the air around them grew denser and denser with magical energy, it became obvious what he was doing. Scylla had revealed her trump card, and now, Donald was revealing his.

Walls had closed in around the pair. Invisible, but undeniably present. Such was the effect of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm - nobody could get in, nor could they get out.

Scylla smiled.

<strong>&quot;You believe you have locked me in here with you?&quot;</strong> Rider spoke, barely able to hold back her incredulity. <strong>&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid it is much the opposite, Saber.</strong> <em><strong>You</strong></em> <strong>are locked in here with</strong> <em><strong>me.</strong></em> <strong>But so be it! If this is your will, then I will honour it!&quot;</strong>

With a stomp, Rider readied herself, and kicking off, she charged forward, aiming to meet Saber&#39;s dash head-on with a lariat. If he wished to slice her to shreds, then she would reduce his bones to a fine dust!</span>

Dangerously heavy blows rained down with improper timing to create a unpredictable dance that Donald played along to. Likewise, his flurry of strikes and movement created a storm that Scylla had to weather to get anywhere.

Without the help of another Caster, though, Donald could only make scritches into his opponents iron-like skin. His own Endurance allowed him small missteps and good callouts from Scylla to not immediately end the fight right then and there. 

But progress continued on both sides. With the rate they battled at, it would be near mutually assured destruction— key word with <em>near</em>.

Donald would eventually lose.

 His fallout from Vortigern had not fully healed. Previous aches were amplified and compounded upon with each smart strike or sneaky tentacle that struck his skin. Scylla would not escape unscathed, but she would escape. 

He’d have to get creative with his own assault to re-tip the scales.

“I must admit, yer not too bad at this sort of thing,” he said in between a dodge. Her fist flew mere centimeters from his face as he nicked her side. “An’ ye don’t even have the gall to say yer True Name. Afraid I’ll find yer Achilles Heel?”

He feinted another slash, only to fire a shot from his flintlock instead, “We’ve all got one, no need to shy back! How ‘bout we trade weaknesses, as a common courtesy? Ladies first!”</span>

There was nothing even vaguely attractive about whatever Granel was fighting. Extra wings, ugly, heads, and ways to kill Granel. Koji had truly gone all out in utilizing the Extra Ugly Deluxe Package™️. This was by <em>far</em> the ugliest thing Granel had ever fought before.

It looked like a stupid Mobzilla™️ monster.

The monster lunged towards Granel, beak boring into Granel&#39;s left shoulder, tearing through flesh and muscle alike. Losing control over his hand, Granel dropped his guard rail-club. Snarling, Granel reached over and crushed the bird&#39;s beak with strength alone, before tossing the remains of the beak into the ocean.

Logically, he figured, it would be better to just get rid of whatever Koji cranked out, instead of attempting to kill it over and over again.

As the bird reeled, Granel felt like he had a good position in this fight. Then tick, second number six went by, and the man was buried under a mass of roots.

&quot;<strong>You did your homework this time.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted in exertion. Until his arm healed up, breaking out of this would be difficult. By then, Koji&#39;s big friend would have torn out his brains, and that would be enough to do the big guy in.</span>

&quot;<strong>A fianc&#233;e? You seem like too much of a tightwad to get out, much. How sweet that I&#39;m going to get mauled to death by a symbol of your affection.</strong>&quot; Granel swore as he shuffled around. Koji had made the roots just thick enough, but Granel was wearing his brass knuckles. If he could just...

There! He began grinding the pointed ends on each knuckle against the plants. Tearing them slightly.

Hummingbird 2.0 reared its head, aiming to peck Granel&#39;s eyes out. The guard&#39;s face went comically red with exertion.

<em><strong>BAM!</strong></em> Hummingbird 2.0 went flying into the wall as Granel smashed its skull in. It was massive, but Granel was strong. Absurdly so. He turned to face Koji, straightening his suit as he kicked at the vines still wrapping around his feet.

&quot;<strong>Apologies. I had to deal with—</strong>&quot; Granel jerked his head towards the wall, &quot;<strong>—that. You have a fianc&#233;e?</strong> Granel gazed across at Koji, before shaking his head. &quot;<strong>No, you said &#39;loved&#39;. You had one. I am sorry. I have lost people, too.</strong>&quot;

Granel clenched a fist. &quot;<strong>If I could bring even one person, I would. I hear the voices of the dead in my dreams, begging for a second chance. Yet...</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s face became strained, and his voice became somber.

&quot;I cannot. I do not have that power. We must let the dead stay dead.&quot;

As Hummingbird 2.0 began to move, Granel took his guardrail off the ground and flung it at the beast, impaling it. The implication was clear: <em>don&#39;t you dare interrupt.</em>

&quot;<strong>You are a doctor. Didn&#39;t you take an oath? Do no harm? Hell, I don&#39;t even know anymore. I&#39;ve found old investigators who have gone mad living here. Who knows what is what, eh?</strong>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Despite the vast differences between the two, the diverging paths that the experiences of their lives had led them down, they were evenly matched. Pure speed against raw power, hard-earned talent against sheer inhuman might. If one was generous, they would call it an unstoppable force against an immovable object. If one was less so, they might liken it to a fight between cockroaches, both too persistently single-minded to back down, and too fierce to die.

With every arcing kick that missed by inches, with every vicious slam that was just a split-second too slow to hit, Scylla&#39;s frustration began to build. But it wasn&#39;t just that she was getting hit - it was that she couldn&#39;t seem to stop herself from being hit. Like a fly buzzing around her, she couldn&#39;t predict Saber&#39;s path, couldn&#39;t get a read on his next move, no matter how hard she tried. One cut might not be enough to put her down, but what of ten cuts? Of a hundred? A thousand?

Even now, she could feel the blood draining from her, trickling out of her body through the dozens of wounds upon her. She could not afford to take this slowly. Decisive action would be necessary, risky though it may be.

<strong>&quot;If you are too idiotic to uncover my True Name, given all that I&#39;ve already revealed, then I&#39;m afraid that isn&#39;t my problem.&quot;</strong> Scylla snarled, twisting her neck to just barely avoid what otherwise would&#39;ve been a bullet to the head. <strong>&quot;Nor do I have any interest in your True Name. No, to me, you are nothing more than corpse to the pile, another body that will drift eternal at the bottom of the sea!&quot;</strong>

With that decree, Rider&#39;s right arm began to shift, the flesh warping and boiling, before bursting into a massive claw, a sickening talon taller than her entire body. Donald had seen plenty of Demonic Mutation before, the tendrils and tentacles, but this was a different level. Altering one&#39;s own limbs to turn them into more lethal weapons? There was something... strange, about it.</span>

With a violent scream, Scylla surged forth once more, her massive claw aiming a sweeping strike directly at Donald. And yet, even in the face of this attack, a blow that would no doubt kill if it landed, there remained an uncertainty, a question to be answered:

Why had she not done this before? If she had access to such improvements, if she could call upon such attacks, why had she not before, during her first confrontation? Why wait until now?

The answer to that question, more than skill or instinct, would be the key to weathering this storm.</span>

Donald did the math, and crunched the numbers– this would certainly kill him. Much like that cannon he narrowly avoided back on the Canopus, to catch that claw spelled near-instant death. 

…Then why hadn’t it been used before? 

This felt… wrong. Nowhere near the mana expenditure of those blasted cannons. Not close enough to an ‘end all be all’ either. No more than a big arm with the massive strength necessary to wield it. Why the bloody hell did it show its face now?

Thoughts raced through his head as his feet moved on their own. Not to beat the arm in a race. He didn’t have the time. Donald <em>let it win</em>. 

He dodged back.

Mis-shaped flesh grazed his nose, and a foot planted onto the very edge of the mast. Every single fiber of energy went into his leg muscles, and the second boot joined its twin. 

“Gotcha.”

Saber launched himself back to Scylla, sabre held longways to the sky. He contorted in the air, moments before the blade connected to the distorted flesh. A boot planted itself firmly on the backside of the weapon, and kicked forward with all his might. 

Scylla might be tough, but his strength still surpassed a normal human. Add a whole lot of weight and momentum behind it and you’d get a sword capable to cut and piece through all but the strongest materials. 

Reaction was nigh impossible with a limb like that, and she swung in the worst way possible. No wonder she only pulled it out now: an animal often fought without restraint when backed into a corner. With any luck, this would make its death throes weaker instead of stronger.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Koji felt the space distort behind him. A cursory glance brought him face to face with a ring of light that cast itself around the Servants, the vines from his cane climbing over and around it as if an invisible wall had been erected in place. It didn&#39;t take him long to put two and two together, as mana ran rampant over the massive Dreadnought: the Saber had just revealed a trick of his own.

Donald had confined Scylla to her own ship and isolated her from her Master, an act that brought Koji a tinge of unease. He realized that he did not particularly enjoy the fact that Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm would actively lock him in with his opponent. If his Servant self possessed such a feat, then he historical self must have achieved something incredible with it that allowed it to be etched into his saint graph as a trump card. 

In other words, what he had just witnessed was an enactment of something illogical. Something unobservable, and thus completely out of his control. 

Koji flexed his artificial circuits and was relieved to find that the bond between him and Scylla had remained intact. Scylla wouldn&#39;t exhaust herself over mana drain, at the very least. If this were a game of attrition between the Masters, then he would win easily. He could afford to, after all. If <em>only</em> it were a simply matter of attrition...

Dearly hoping that Scylla had enough ammunition to match Saber&#39;s wits, Koji focused his attention back on the bodyguard. Granel wouldn&#39;t stay down for long. He had to keep piling on the pressure.

As his cane proliferated further, the body of the monstrous hummingbird - let&#39;s call it that for now - seemed to expand as well, as extra bones, limbs, and all sorts of organic oddities jutted out of its frame. Strings of flesh began to climb onto the guardrail as well, as the creature&#39;s body began to swallow it up whole. There seemed to be a connection between the bird and Koji&#39;s glorified walking stick...

&#39;I&#39;d break my oath a thousand times over if that&#39;s what it takes to bring her back.&#39; Koji said casually, as if his answer was the most logical one in the world. &#39;So don&#39;t be sorry. And don&#39;t proclaim what you cannot predict, because I&#39;m the one working on it, not you, not the one who had cursed you. Just me, my assistant, and my tools.&#39; 

He knew exactly what he&#39;d been doing. He not only broke his oath, he did so with a sound mind. Because he was only human: full of contradictions, hypocrisy, and hope. Obsession was a powerful motivator, and love was full of unpredictable cruelty. Koji was overflowing with desperate warmth, but for Granel he spared nothing but savagery.

&#39;I <em>am</em> a doctor,&#39; he reaffirmed Granel, &#39;and doctors are good at separating the disease from their patients. I&#39;d gladly offer my services and sever you from the source of your misery.&#39; 

For the first time in what felt like ages, after ascertaining that his magecraft was enough to keep Granel&#39;s distracted, Koji approached the bodyguard, the tip of his cane sharpened to a point.

The one location on the human torso that couldn&#39;t be fully covered by muscle mass simply due to how the muscles were laid. Artists regarded the spot as a sensual beauty. Koji eyed it as nothing more than fibers and membranes as he drove his cane into the groove with relative ease, thus beginning his arduous task of pinning the bodyguard to a bed of plants, like a butterfly to a board-

Not quite.

Pain blossomed where the cane had tasted Granel&#39;s blood, starting from where he had been punctured and spreading through his flesh, as if tiny needles were running through his veins. The cane had taken root in Granel&#39;s flesh as tiny vines sprouted from within. Koji was going to incapacitate him by turning him into a flowerbed for his cane!</span>

The nature of her mutations were most curious. Expanding flesh, stretching and growing and sculpting and changing. A simple tendril could be conjured forth with little effort, without the need for support or feeling. But larger creations required foundations to be built upon, bone to support it, nerves to make it more than a cancerous vestigial lump. Even then, it was imperfect...

...The new flesh was always frailer than the old flesh. Weaker. Lacking in that core vitality writ into the soul. So, faced with such a critical counter-attack, there was only one result.

The sword struck true, leaving only scraps of flesh, shards of marrow, and sanguine blood in its wake. The entire grotesque limb was carved to shreds in an instant, all thanks to a well-placed slash.

And yet, when Saber looked into the eyes of Rider, he saw not pain, but contentment, as though this had all somehow gone to plan. 

<strong>FWOOSH!</strong> From the mangled arm came a vibrant spark, an azure flame that quickly consumed the damaged limb. All that was once there, the grievous wounds, faded away, and in one final flash of light, the arm was born anew, hale and whole, as though it had never been destroyed in the first place.

<strong>&quot;No, Saber, it is</strong> <em><strong>me</strong></em> <strong>that has got you.&quot;</strong>

Now, with Donald in range, her counter-attack was nigh. Her newly repaired arm lashed out and grabbed him by the neck, and then, with all the might she could muster, slammed him down towards the deck.

A risky strategy, one that was expensive in mana, and required the expenditure of one of her precious torches. The question is, would it pay off?</span>

Line.

<strong>Sinker</strong>.

The roles reversed. Sea Serpent cast her line, and Saber took it with reckless abandon. Only once he turned to face his foe, very much not in disbelief or in pain, did the outcome become clear. Scylla wasted no time and gripped Donald by the neck.

Cheers for what came next echoed out.

<em><strong>SLAM</strong></em>

A sick thud exploded from the wooden floorboards. An explosion sounded off next to Scylla’s ear, as flintlock flew and smacked against the wooden rail. His sabre reeled back as he prepared for–

<em><strong>CRUNCH</strong></em>

His attempts to fight back dashed against the rocks. He really would end on yet another ill-timed metaphor, for the second slam knocked the sword clean from his hands and inches away. 

It looked all but guaranteed. Open hands twitched towards weapons, and blood tricked onto the floor. Her slams had the effect she wanted. No smart quips escaped his lips, and neither did he rise from the dead in surprise. This had been the foe to give her a run for her money?

Pathetic. 

She rose from the presumed corpse and faced the other surroundings. That ring of light flickered once, twice, then faded from existence. A bell rung out from who knows where as the Noble Phantasm disappeared. They had spoken: Scylla had won the Prize Fight. 

Her spoils spawned specks of yellow dust.</span>

She stepped away and took stock of Koji. Doctor grappled with Security Guard, an attempt to make a living mannequin well underway. Perhaps the brute would settle down now that his Blood Brother slowly evaporated from existence. 

Radio silence sounded from the mental channel the two had only just grown acquainted with. Not even a proper farewell. Instead, he could only watch as light continued to pour from the cracks and bruises sprouted from the body of Donald McBane.

Maybe the next life had something better in store. 

<em>Twitch</em>

Time to–

<em>Ka-thunk!</em>

“...yet.”

Donald McBane coughed up blood, more drops to the bucket already at his feet. His skin glowed with golden light, which lit up his now pale, sickly skin. Even the sabre, gripped and stabbed into the planks, shook with every breath. 

But he breathed nonetheless, his other hand balled around a chain on his neck.

Mana <em>hemorrhaged</em> from the Scot. His body could bleed, and his frame did as well in the shape of yellow dust. As a ship would, energy left his body by the gallon. All in the faint hope that his Saint Graph wouldn’t implode on itself. One last trick up his sleeve, it seemed.

“<em>I’m not done yet,” he said. Strength returned slowly as he rose back to his feet. “Ye think–</em>cough* a little fall like that’ll kill me?!”

“Sickness. Hunger. Heatstroke, Winter’s bite. Execution orders. Stabs, cuts, shots, rains of cannon fire, ragin’ infernos, Death’s Bloody Scythe– I’ve seen ‘em all! By the protection of Lady Luck and God, I’ve survived things that murdered friends and foes alike!”

“If ye won’t share yer True Name, fine,” he gripped his sword in two hands, parallel with his eyes, “But remember this: those who die nameless die <em>twice</em>. A fate worse than death itself. Even if I collapse the final time. After ten years. Twenty. The rest of yer life– I will live on in the minds of hearts of <em>everyone here!</em>”</span>

As the Bounded Field around her faded away and the limp body of Donald fell to the ground, Scylla took a step back, running her hands through her hair. The adrenaline surging through her veins began to slow. Finally, she had done what she had wanted. Her opponent lay dead, defeated by her hand. Her hunt was over.

...So why did she still feel so empty? This was the last of her prey, the only opponent who deserved her ire, the one that had gotten away. She had defeated him, utterly and undeniably. She had no challenge left to conquer, no life left to live as a beast. All that remained was for her to cast off the vestiges of monstrosity and embrace her humanity.

So why? Why did her heart still pound so? Why did her bloody hands still twitch? Why did she still feel like a beast upon the hunt?!

Her answer came in a choke declaration of the will to survive. As she turned around, Scylla saw a ghost, a corpse, a dead man walking. Donald was <em>still alive</em>.

<em><strong>&quot;What--&quot;</strong></em>

As he rushed forward, Rider was caught entirely off guard. Donald&#39;s sword sunk into her chest as she just stood there, utterly aghast. She did not even scream. But finally, that growing frustration would bubble over in a single moment of rage.

<strong>&quot;What... What is this! I killed you! You died, and I killed you! You&#39;re just a common thug, NOTHING MORE! BY WHAT MEANS DO YOU KEEP LIVING, YOU DAMNED FOOL?!&quot;</strong></span>

He stood motionless for only a moment, the imminent threat of death hot on his tail while he backed off yet again.

“Isn’t it obvious?” Donald asked. “Technical answer is Battle Continuation. The actual answer is what I just said: <strong>I refuse.</strong>”

A quick flick of his wrists sent crimson droplets all over, “You wonder why I don’t keel over and die like a good little mutt? Is that what ye would’ve done? Give up and resign to the fate ‘chosen’ fer ye? Us humans don’t do that. Ye should know better.”

“Now, will ye fight to not die, er will you fight to <em>live</em>?”

Fight to live? To not die and to live were two sides of the same coin, perhaps even the same face. To claim something entirely different felt fundamentally wrong. One&#39;s own existence mattered more than anyone else&#39;s, but without others then why live in the first place?

Maybe it was best to agree to disagree. The time for talk had long passed. 

Donald lunged forward yet again, a blur of silver and gold as he continued the final assault. This time, however, <em>Saber knew every move before Rider could even act</em>. Fists whooshed through thin air, spears whizzed past after-images. She had only been able to see inside the head of her foe a single time so far, yet he knew her intentions like the back of his hand.

Would Scylla be overwhelmed from the brink of victory once again?</span>

Scylla sounded absolutely <em>dumbfounded</em>, completely lost for words. That he could just shrug off the cold embrace of death and stand once more, as though it was as simple as believing in yourself, willing yourself to stand. Battle Continuation, the ability to live past certain death, that much she could understand, but to call it a <em>refusal of death?</em>

Then came that word. That ugly, nasty, disgusting, hideous word, that anathema to her existence, those frigid chains forever wrapped around her neck, <em>FATE</em>. That stupid idea that one could simply deny what destiny had planned for them, that one could rewrite a story if they didn&#39;t like the ending. Why not simply fight against fate?

<em>Oops! Looks like someone poisoned your bath! Sorry, Scylla, but this is what you get for getting in the way of romance~</em>

<strong>&quot;Shut up...&quot;</strong>

<em>Die, monster. You are not worthy to draw breath on this Earth.</em>

<strong>&quot;SHUT UP...&quot;</strong>

<em>O&#39; daughter, how pitiful it is, to see you fallen so far from grace...</em>

<strong>&quot;I SAID...&quot;</strong>

<em>It cannot be undone. This is who you are now, who you will be until the day you die. This is your</em> <em><strong>fate.</strong></em>

<strong>&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;</strong>

With a guttural roar of raw emotion, Scylla lurched forward, lashing out with such ferocity it matched even the gods. Every punch, every kick, every thrash and flail, it was all going beyond maximum power, to the point that she was spending mana to bolster her attacks. Yet her rage blinded her, stripped away the critical advantage of her instinct, reduced her to a rabid dog on the rampage.

As slashes and cuts appeared all across her body, the beast would unleash one last guttural howl before launching herself at Donald. However, it was no common attack. Anyone with even a mote of mana sensitivity could feel it radiating from her hand, magical energy pooling in her fist as she swung it at Saber. A form of primitive, ramshackle Mana Burst, a crude means of empowering herself when nothing else was available.</span>

A single hit meant death. Even the deathly gaze she gave the Scot right before her frenzy shook his bones to the very atoms they were composed of. She swung with reckless abandon and with the force of a hundred suns. A single connection would send him into his next life lickety-split.

Yet not a single one landed. 

A rabid dog was a predictable one, and each attempt at his life was met with an empty blow and another streak of red on her skin. Every single sword technique was up for grabs, and he made sure to show off. Jabs at limbs that missed their mark, backhanded slices, reckless swings more akin to a batter for a baseball team than actual skill. 

Their duel kept them on the move. Nearly every part of the ship received the pleasure to watch their dance of death, save the tippy top. Scylla dictated the pace, but Donald controlled the motion. Executed flawlessly, one could’ve mistaken them for souls that understood the sacred ritual of combat.

And then, the final moments approached. With one last howl at the Gods that cursed her so, she leapt forward. Knuckles clenched white, every single cell overloaded with mana. Filled with primal emotions of a destiny set in stone, she set to enforce her sad, misfortunate fate onto Donald.

“With,”

It came close. The outermost hairs on his mustache burnt up and turned to pure dust while the fist raced past. Sabre slid across her gut with wicked precision but did not inflict lethal damage. With the mark made, it would be easy to visualize his actual target.

“Pleasure.”

Scylla stood mere feet away from her Master, faced the wrong way. Whether the Gods willed it, or Donald himself, she had been kicked to the curb yet again. 

Covered in Holy light, with cheers from another lifetime ablaze in his head, Saber closed the distance. Warm, stained steel pointed directly at the Servant&#39;s second heart: her Spirit Core.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Of course the doctor would know anatomy. Granel wasn&#39;t stupid, and he wasn&#39;t underestimating Koji, but he was a fool.

Granel had spent decades fighting, and many years fighting without much care for his own life. He was careful, but only when areas that could end his life were involved. The head, the carotid artery, the groin, and so on.

Something like a chink in two places of armor that did not result in fatality was low on his priority list. Koji&#39;s intellect was his greatest asset, even beyond his ability to summon monstrous hummingbirds and be the bane of well-kept lawns the world over.

As long as he could comfortably leverage that intellect, Granel was at a disadvantage. However, where Koji had intellect, Granel had years of experience over the doctor. He would not back down.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re wrong, Koji.</strong>&quot; Granel grimaced as Koji&#39;s Weepy Willow spread through the veins in his body. &quot;<strong>This is not a curse. I thought it was, once. I was wrong. Wrong about so many things. So many assumptions. So many false accusations... I thought you Nirvanans were all heartless monsters, willfully embracing barbarity. You are people...</strong>&quot; 

Granel gasped as the the roots spread. The guard was massive, even with tasting Granel&#39;s blood, it would take a substantial amount of time before he was turned into a Nirvanan flowerbed.

&quot;<strong>Who lost your integrity against your will...  You all deserve... A second chance...  You are a doctor. I am a security guard. A glorified meat shield. We protect and save people. If I could help you bring your lover back, I would.</strong>

Granel blinked back tears as he grabbed Koji&#39;s cane. It was slick with the doctor&#39;s blood, even as the cane greedily drank the source of fuel. Even as it tasted Granel&#39;s blood.

He was an emotional man, who wept when watching movies. When confronted with a real, bona fide tragedy, Granel could not help but weep. Koji was mad, even in his logical state of mind. Nirvanans were simply human. Koji was human.</span>

So they warranted protection. As did he.

&quot;<strong>So if you people have become barbarians...</strong>&quot;

Even from themselves. Himself.

&quot;<strong>Then call me a motherfucking <em>savage</em>.</strong>&quot;

Granel ripped the cane out of his body, overpowering Koji even in his weakened state. It was hardly a competition. Koji was of weak constitution. Granel looked like he could fight a bear, even when he was wounded.

Plant life trailed behind the cane as it was removed from the veins in Granel&#39;s body. The internal damage was immense—one did not have their veins ruptured and shredded by roots. Even with a healing factor, that would disable Granel from maximum strength for some time.

Yet he was running on adrenaline. As Granel gripped the cane, he smashed his fist into Koji&#39;s face, breaking the doctor&#39;s nose and sending the doctor reeling. There it was, that feeling of durability. Just like from the Canopus.

&quot;<strong>Your goal...</strong>&quot; You are...

<strong>Smash.</strong> The wet sound of fist meeting flesh and blood.

&quot;<strong>Is flawed!</strong>&quot; Corrupted.

<strong>SMASH!</strong> It was unruly, like a fight in the bar. There was no grace to each punch. There was no latent training. Just a man throwing punches with experience and feeling.

And yet...

<strong>SMASH!</strong>

I respect your dedication.

You are a terrible person, under this influence, Koji. Yet, in your own twisted way, your motivation is wonderful.

I respect you, Naoharu Koji.

A final strike in the chest, fracturing the doctor&#39;s ribcage, sent the doctor and his cane flying towards the battle with Scylla and Donald.

Thank you for loving something other than this island.

Granel shuffled towards towards his opponent, unaware of the massive hummingbird behind him.</span>

&quot;<strong>However, you will never stop hounding me. As long as you have a Servant...</strong>&quot; He trailed off.

The hummingbird loomed.

<strong>&#39;Then laugh!&#39;</strong> Koji spat out blood, feeling sick to the pit of his stomach. &#39;Go on, laugh at me! Pity me! Ridicule me for all I care! The world won&#39;t tip over with one more crackpot in the mix.&#39;

His artificial circuits irritated him with a stinging warmth. His bones rattled under the bodyguard&#39;s barrage of blows, stuck in a maddening cycle of breaking and stitching together that almost drove him into a frenzy. &#39;A second chance?&#39; His vision dimmed for a moment as a fist sunk into his stomach. &#39;Don&#39;t you have a conscience?&#39; He half whispered, half croaked, with agonizing effort. &#39;<em>Don&#39;t</em> offer something you cannot afford.&#39;

He clutched Granel&#39;s shirt with desperate strength. It was <em>his</em> will that brought him here. It was <em>his</em> will that drove him to commit sin and toy with death. No one judged him better than himself. And he knew that he was right about this. 

&#39;Know your own worth, for fuck&#39;s sake!&#39; He growled at Granel, livid. &#39;Your potential is wasted on a mere security guard!&#39;

And he felt his ribcage shatter under the force of a battering ram. Granel put everything into his final strike, sending the doctor flying backwards in a heap of injuries. Koji landed on a bed of woody plants and vines his cane had conjured, the impact knocking precious air out of his lungs.

He grimaced. Snarled. Rasped for air. He pulled himself up with a generous helping of plants, glared at Granel, who approached him with an air of finality.

The shadow descended.

The mutant body of the hummingbird rammed into Granel&#39;s back with the combined weight of flesh, bones, and the guardrail that Granel had so graciously fed into its torso. Claws that had grown as big as Granel&#39;s hands and as strong as a harpy&#39;s crunched into him. Wings beat down, threatening to throw him to the ground with a powerful wind.

Pulse after pulse, the latticework in his forearm seared into his flesh, branding him with a sharp wakefulness that forced his unease to resurface. The circuitry was hot against his cool flesh. It hurt with a pain that seemed to ravage his very soul, a pain impossible to forget and difficult to hide. He&#39;d experienced it once. Twice. The memories still fresh on his mind. It was the dying throes of a bond that was on the verge of breaking.

He couldn&#39;t accept it. Turning towards the commotion behind him, Koji yelled with as much strength as someone with several cracked ribs could muster, <strong>&#39;Don&#39;t-&#39;</strong>

<em>-be rash?</em>

His pupils dilated as blood and gore flew like fireworks, showering the length of the Dreadnought in their owner&#39;s vestige.

<em>-let your emotions get ahead of you?</em>

His eyes grew bloodshot as he strained to capture Saber&#39;s flurry of silver with his vision. Koji was no swordsman, but he knew enough about anatomy that he understood, from the destinations of Saber&#39;s strikes, that his Servant&#39;s life was in peril. Every slash was aimed with precision, ensuring that sharp end piece found the most vulnerable parts on its enemy&#39;s body. Scylla had been forced into a corner. Saber&#39;s resourcefulness had bled her dry.

A slash across her body had her guts spilling, revealing the thumping flesh that tethered her to this side of the world. It beat with a frantic rhythm, a rhythm that was reflected in the aching circuitry embedded in Koji&#39;s arm.

It was her heart. Her Core. It was a promise between the two of them, the first and the only one that he had made. 

He&#39;d keep it safe. He&#39;d keep her heart beating for another minute, another day. Until she&#39;d found her calling, until their paths diverged. 

That day was not today.

He reached out, rested his hand on Scylla&#39;s shoulder, and pushed.

It was an easy gesture, not demanding or controlling. It wasn&#39;t even strong enough to make Scylla budge an inch. In fact, it was the bed of vines that had overtaken the Dreadnought&#39;s surface that did all the heavy lifting, as Koji fed enough blood into his cane to stir them all awake. They wrapped around Rider like great snakes and, with one unified motion, threw her into a mast towards the center of the ship. 

Koji faced Saber for a split second. 

&#39;You aren&#39;t long for this world,&#39; he observed with the acuity of someone who had witnessed the end of a Servant far too many times, as steel penetrated his nonexistent defense. &#39;How far-&#39;

Saber&#39;s sword struck true. 

His heart continued to beat, his lungs continued to draw breaths, but it was all a hoax. A glorified illusion. Irreparably, irrevocably, his life had come to an end. Any last words lingering in the back of his throat tasted like morphine injected into his veins: sweet and powerful but unable to save a life. They sang in his ears like an omen of death. 

&#39;-can you go?&#39; He stared into Saber&#39;s eyes as the light in his own began to fade.</span>

Koji shuffled Scylla back and stepped up to the plate. It was not the face of an unlucky monster he would watch fade, but one of a broken man. Donald might not let fate decide his actions, but the similarity between their first encounter and now was too close for comfort.

However, the fight no longer mattered. Even if Scylla turned around and crumpled him to the dust he should’ve been a minute ago, she would join him soon afterward. The score turned to his favor once again.

“As long as I have to, Koji,” he responded. “We both know that.”

Their eyes met for a moment, yet it lasted hours. It could’ve been his imagination, but Saber chose to believe that the two of them weren’t as different as would assume. Besides, Koji reminded him of…

… too many people to count. Another victim of conflict.

His blade slowly withdrew, and he guided the doctor slowly to the ground. A practiced motion, his head gently touched the floorboards. “May The Lord grant ye mercy at the Pearly Gates.”

With silent swiftness, Donald stepped back and entered a defensive stance. The ball was no longer in his court, but he knew the lengths some would go to if it meant to be ‘even’.</span>

The security guard disappeared under a mass of feathers and flesh. His skin was ripped at, but he was running out of steam. Even if his healing was infinite, his stamina most certainly wasn&#39;t. As Hummingbird 3.0 buried Granel, he pondered Koji&#39;s words.

<em>Your dream is childish, but I cannot laugh at it. I could not save my old comrades. I could not save the crew that brought us here. But... But...</em>

<em>I can save my crew. I can save a few Nirvanans of their fate. Just one. I&#39;d be happy with just one. Please.</em>

As his body repaired itself, knitting flesh, veins, and skin together, Granel gathered his remaining might. As his back was torn at, he gripped vaguely at his pocket. He gripped at a holster on his waist. He held it tightly, and pulled it out.

&quot;<strong>I don&#39;t want to be a security guard anymore1 I&#39;d rather be something greater! My comrades will look down at me from heaven with pride!</strong>

The bird squawked in confusion as its prey stood up. It was far heavier than Granel at this point, thanks to Koji&#39;s tampering and splicing. Yet Granel turned on it with rage. There was a bit of skull showing on the back of his head from where the bird had gnawed on his head.

With a herculean feat of strength, he forced one of the beaks open...

And fired the flare gun from the ship.

Whatever Koji had made these birds from, it was extremely flammable. Within a matter of seconds, it began to melt. It lunged at Granel&#39;s neck, and he bellowed with the force of a tidal wave.</span>

The hummingbird buckled under Granel&#39;s might, and after a strong punch, it fell overboard. Whatever Koji&#39;s design philosophy was, it was not intended to fly easily. It entered the ocean with a splash.

&quot;<strong>Hah... Hah...</strong>&quot; Granel collapsed against the railing, and his eyes widened in terror.

&quot;<em><strong>Donald, stop!</strong></em>&quot; Both verbally and mentally, but it was too late. Granel watched as Koji was disemboweled.

&quot;No.&quot; He croaked, attempting to crawl over. He was out of energy. His limbs refused to obey. He crawled like a worm. &quot;Donald, you...&quot; He trailed off, resigned. Donald had his reasons, he had to trust in his Servant.

That didn&#39;t make the sting of failure any worse though.

Again. He had failed <em>again</em>. All of those words. they meant nothing.

Blood poured out from her broken chest, from her mangled arms, from the cuts and gashes all across her face. She could feel her reserves of magical energy begin to empty, her eyelids growing heavy as exhaustion began to set in. She was falling apart at the seams, her Saint Graph beginning to unravel, standing at the edge of a great cliff, staring down at the yawning nothingness below. Every breath was ragged, every movement laboured. With one of her precious torches expended, she would be unable to revive herself from this attack. The moment that Donald’s sword even <em>scraped</em> her Spirit Core, she would die, and it would all be over. 

She had been defeated. Not because she had died, not because she had failed to kill Saber, but because she failed to prove herself right. Donald had managed to free himself from the yoke of his fate, while Rider’s struggles against her chains proved futile. It was that which damned her more than anything else, that which truly sealed her fate.

In the end, the virtuous hero stood over the slain beast, victorious. Such was the role of a monster. Such was her nature. Such was her purpose.

As Donald rushed forth, Scylla closed her eyes, and awaited the inevitable.

The sound of steel tearing through flesh filled her ears, but she felt… nothing. No pain, no gushing blood, no encroaching numbness, nothing save for a hand upon her shoulder and the ground shifting beneath her feet. A horrible, horrible thought entered into her mind. Slowly, reluctantly, she opened her eyes.

In a second that felt like it was hours long, she watched as the spark of vitality vanished from his eyes, unable to do anything to stop it.

Suddenly, the dreadnought beneath their feet would let loose a cacophony of horrid sounds. The groaning of metal buckling under pressure, of the hull bursting and breaking, of water rushing through newfound gaps in the construction. But if one listened intently enough, they might swear that it sounded like a wail of grief, the mournful howl of a beast making its sorrow known to the world.

And then, it fell apart, vanishing into a shimmering cloud of magical energy before their eyes, and leaving them all to fall down into the waters below.

Scylla’s thoughts were racing as she staggered out from the tide and onto dry land, carrying the corpse of Naoharu Koji in her arms. She made it one, two, three steps onto the wet sand of the beach before she collapsed down to the ground. She had officially run out of magical energy. The bond with the master that once fuelled her had been severed, taken along with his life. Even the smallest action felt like a monumental effort. Nevertheless, she dragged herself up to her knees, looking down at the body of Koji.

<strong>”I… I failed.”</strong> Rider whispered, her voice shaky. Slowly, her arms moved, grasping the doctor’s hand, fingers tracing the scars left by his artificial circuit. <strong>”I told you we would walk this path together. You would help me, and I would help you. That was the deal we made. And yet, I couldn’t… I can’t…”</strong>

The world felt so empty, so desolate, so black. It felt as though she was at the bottom of the deepest abyss, where no life could reside, surrounded by the bones of the dead, those who had died all because of her. Whether she had been responsible for killing them, or whether they had died for her sake, it didn’t matter. In the end, all of their deaths had been pointless. No matter how much blood was spilled, she could never escape her fate. No matter what was done, she could never escape the monster in her shadow.

She had little time left. Minutes at best. Once her time was up, it was back to the Throne of Heroes, all memories purged. She would not even remember his face. She would not remember his name. She would not remember his sacrifice.

Tears began to form in the corners of her eyes. 

<strong>”At least… you’ll be with her now. Yes, that… that is for the best. Fate was too cruel to you, Naoharu Koji. But now, you may be together once more.”</strong>

She forced a smile onto her face. Yes, this was--</span>

The maiden crouched down next to Rider, cupping her cheek with her hands, brushing away her tears, a smile on her face. Even now, surrounded on all sides by her own misery, looking at that smile was comforting. It was as though everything was going to be alright. As though no matter how lowly and how miserable she currently felt, everything would be alright, so long as she was around. 

”You have been defeated. But you need not accept loss. So long as you draw breath, you must struggle. Against your enemies. Against the gods. Against death. Against fate. After all, is that not what a hero would do?”

The maiden’s hand rested upon her left shoulder.</span>

There was no hand to accompany this one. This was but an echo of the recent past, words that had been said to her by one who was both an enemy and a friend. For a moment, she allowed herself to wonder where he was now, what had become of the man who said them. For all his lies and deceits, for his betrayals and his backstabbing, his plot holes and his contrivances, he had never been bad with words. Perhaps she owed him. More than he could ever know.

One in her left arm. Her Torches of Phorcys, the fires of divine life, once given to her at her lowest to rescue her from death, and return her to life. She had never truly questioned them, always taken them for granted. Even now, as a servant, she never thought of what power they held beyond the obvious. But now, at her lowest, an idea came to mind. A hopelessly optimistic idea. An impossible idea.

Slowly but surely, she willed the Torches out of her body, each of them dragged away from their rightful place, gathering in her wounded chest. In a sense, it was fortunate that Donald had damaged her so thoroughly. Had he not, she would not have been able to free them from her existence so easily. Reaching out, she grabbed the gathering flame, and looked down at her master.

<strong>”Naoharu Koji. I am sorry, but I am going to do something selfish. Even if it isn’t what is best, I must keep my promise to you...!”</strong>

With that, she pressed her hand down into the doctor’s chest, right where Saber’s rapier had pierced his flesh. The brilliant flames flickered and danced across the wound for a moment, before slowly being dragged inside, as though filling an empty vessel.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The date was February 15, 2105. It was a century since the world had flooded, a decade since a doctor had arrived at Nirvana, and a fortnight since a monster had been roused from her slumber. Humans had long since invented the concept of epochs. They had developed the calendar system, then imposed it on the passage of time. A useful tool it may be, but it would ultimately affect nothing: calling today the 15th of February or a Sunday mattered very little. In the end, the earth would still rotate, and tides would ebb and flow, creeping over the sand and washing away the remnants of horrors lingering on the beach.

Nothing had changed. The sun, the stars, none of them looked any different from the day before. They hung over the dull canopy of the sky, turning in a steady counterclockwise fashion that was imperceptible to the naked eye. The world had not changed in that respect. 

Its inhabitants had, though.

...

He was back in his office.

All his belongings had been packed except for his computer. A colleague had offered to take over his patients, so he found everything there was and organized them into a folder. He left the folder on the top of a box labeled <em>work</em>.

<em>I&#39;ll miss this place,</em> he thought as he ran a hand over his desk for the last time, his mind uncharacteristically clear. He felt surprisingly serene, almost relieved. Not agonized. Not angry the way he thought he might&#39;ve been. Everything felt distant, as though nothing was happening to him at all. 

Light flooded his office. He walked over to the windows to close the blinds. Best to restore the room to its original condition before moving out, he thought. He wasn&#39;t particularly meticulous, but he did as much as he was supposed to. 

As much as he had promised to...

<em>Koji.</em>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">He stared out the window, the world a blinding white in his retina. He raised his hand. Placed it against the window. Something thudded against the glass, again and again, like a fist pounding to gain entrance. But the noise didn&#39;t come from this singular source: all the windows in the room were rattling, sounding as if he was in the middle of a hurricane.

Something howled outside. An anguished, frustrated sound.

&#39;Take care, Scylla,&#39; he said, and the thudding grew louder. &#39;Forget about the Saber. Find another mage immediately and replenish-&#39;

<em><strong>WAKE UP, KOJI!</strong></em>

<em><strong>&#39;Let me finish!&#39;</strong></em> He said urgently as he rapped on the glass. &#39;Listen, not all mages are qualified to be a Master. If you must pick-&#39;

<em><strong>THUD</strong></em>

The glass shattered. A scorching heat engulfed him, scalding him from head to toe.

Koji woke up screaming. 

<strong>&#39;-don&#39;t pick Granel!</strong> <em><strong>GAH!</strong></em> <strong>He doesn&#39;t have the necessary circuits to sustain a Rider class Servant!&#39;</strong>

His vision was filled with azure flames, if only for an instant. Then the flames receded, and he found himself looking into the battered countenance of his Servant. 

Excellent. Just when he desperately needed a face to face.

And so the doctor continued to ramble. &#39;Don&#39;t let your naivete fool you,&#39; he preached, as if talking was all that kept him conscious. &#39;Be smart about your next Master of choice. Ruth may seem like a suitable candidate, but that woman has a fickle disposition. You don&#39;t want to work for someone whose appetite is out of control.&#39;

He ripped a packet of mana batteries out of his coat and pressed it into Scylla&#39;s hands. How curious, that he knew exactly which pocket the batteries were in. How curious, that he could see each strand of crimson hair falling on his face, feel every bruise and cut on Scylla&#39;s hand as he closed her fingers around the mana batteries. He was experiencing a dream so vivid he&#39;d imagined it was actually happening.

The larger man was leaning on his Servant, his wounds still re-knitting themselves. Unfortunately, if Koji elected to look at them, he would get a pretty good look at Donald&#39;s nose hair.

&quot;<strong>Excellent, you can talk, and you seem decently sane for the nutcase you are. Your nerves seem to be in working order. This whole &#39;revive from the dead&#39; thing is beyond me.</strong>&quot; Granel beamed, using a scrap of his suit to dab his eyes for tears. The suit collapsed into a pile of scraps, leaving Granel shirtless with a large spike impaled through his heart exposed. How publicly indecent!

As he looked over Donald, he noticed a slew of wounds. He gently placed a battery in Donald&#39;s hand and closed his grip.

&quot;<strong>That was pretty kickass, brother! It was like a scene from Jason and the Argonauts made real. Riding up the tentacles, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about!</strong>&quot; He gave his Servant a squeeze on the shoulder.

&quot;<strong>...and with all due respect, your Servant would probably rip out my spike and use it as a toothpick. No offense.</strong>&quot; He nodded sheepishly to Scylla, before backing off to give the two some room, though he grunted with pain the whole way through.

He found himself standing at the edge of Scylla&#39;s dreadnought, and immersing himself in the comfort of the bobbing waves. Instead of looking towards Nirvana, he looked out to sea, watching as the water turned from red to sea-blue.

He timed the waves crashing into the ship with the blowing of his nose. This was an emotional moment!

“You probably did fine too, Granel,” Donald said, mana battery swallowed as quickly as it had been given. After a few seconds, the energy slowly jolted his frame back into a somewhat stable position. The golden ash that radiated off his body slowly dissipated, until it was no more. 

“‘Probably’? She could, no doubt ‘bout it! Gave me a real hard time back there, you’d be dead in seconds.”

Saber cleared his throat, “Er, well. Uh. Anyway. Glad t’see yer doctor alive and well, even if he’s slow to catch up. As fer yerself, Rider… well. We can talk it out later. Maybe.”

No, there weren’t any words <em>he</em> should say now. There was something a little more important than his necessity to get a declaration of defeat from Rider. She had fought fate and came back relatively unscathed, and that’s what mattered.

For now, anyway.

He would join Granel by the waves, the gentle lap at the shore a needed change of pace for the Scot. Saltwater coated splashed over the top of his boots and stained his bloody trousers, each droplet a goosebump on his skin.

<em>Ye looked mighty upset back there on that ship,</em> he broke the mental silence. <em>That I had killed a Nirvanan. Not that I mind, but… takes a real man to look inside and fix the broken bits on his own. Good on ya.</em>

His hands reached into his pockets, and Cameran inspected his fingers. Looks like the little roach made it back safely too. The insect would grab hold and slowly climb up his arm, over his clothes until he perched on his shoulder.</span>
