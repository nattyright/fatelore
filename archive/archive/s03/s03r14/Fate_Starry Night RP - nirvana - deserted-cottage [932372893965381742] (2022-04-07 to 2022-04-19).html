His body had suffered good damage, but ‘severe’ implied some form of unrecoverable wounds. His skin would look as well as it did any other day, but it would take time and energy.

And the energy had to come from somewhere.

His eyes cracked open. The sky was now the same dark and gloomy color it had been the day before, glimpses to be seen from around the holes in the ceiling. A foul, dry taste was stuck in the back of his throat, a weird mix of salt and blood from the day before. Water was the first task on the list today… whatever day it was.

Every muscle protested as he pushed himself upward. That backache from a few days prior was naught but a dream in the current circumstances. Now it was multiplied by ten and in nearly every fiber of his body. His head was surprisingly free of these aches, surely due to his glorious facial hair that made everything better.

“Granel,” Donald said. Even if he were around, there was no way in hell he’d understand a single broken syllable of his empty voice. He reached to his neck and felt the familiar cool touch of a chain. It went down to a locket, which he rubbed absentmindedly with a thumb. 

Maybe that’s what drove Berserker over the edge, yesterday. That shredded material had looked like a face. Vaguely. 

His head swiveled like a machine, which scanned the surroundings with cold indifference. Maybe Granel was around, and they could figure out what the hell was to come.</span>

The world was ending. Granel could see it as the trees leaked ooze and animals dissolved in front of him. He heaved a deep breath, before looking up a the sky. Red. Was it red in Alexandria? Why were the people of Nirvana and the Investigation Team doomed to suffer? Maybe it was fate.

Maybe they were the only ones who could stop this.

Granel shook his head. Idiotic. There were a thousand other people who could probably resolve this with a snap of the finger. Instead, it was a ragtag group of investigators and a mob of insane islanders.

Instead, he had a Servant that was more mustache than man. Granel would not have it any other way.

After entering the shack, Granel cracked a grim smile. &quot;<strong>You look like shit.</strong>&quot; Pot calling the kettle back. The wood creaked as Granel took a seat next to his Servant.

&quot;<strong>I don&#39;t think Ace is going to forgive me.</strong>&quot; He remarked drily. &quot;<strong>I got his Servant killed, and we didn&#39;t even bring down Vortigern or William. Tell me what happened. Again.</strong>&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Ah, there he was! “Oho, aren’t you funny.”

Donald tried to laugh, but the jolts of pain that shot through his sides stopped that dead in its tracks. It turned into a few grunts and an overall somber mood as Granel sat down and explained his woes.

Saber sighed, “Whatever ya say, but it won’t change a damn thing. We tried to gang up on Vortigern, but he was simply strong out the arse. The beast used its Noble Phantasm, least I reckon it was that, an’ tried to get him good. Berserker snapped out of it and… well, you know what happened there.”

“I went fer his heart, and got some weird paper-thing on ‘is sword instead. Ya see how that turned out,” he motioned to his entire body, still covered in thin discolored lines and the remnants of crimson.

“An’ then he went away. Jumped to the stars, it seemed. Poof,” he made a <em>pop</em> motion with his hands and mouth, as to signify the event. A compromise for the lack of actually funny jokes.

“Rest is history– one you shouldn’t dwell on, lest ye let it swallow– consume– bah, just don’t get too worried ‘bout it. If anythin’, it’s either me er Octagon that should feel guilt. An’ it certainly ain’t me.”

The stumble over the word for ‘eating’ was certainly odd, but hopefully the core of the message would get across to his Master. No sense to despair when there had to be an end to this all soon.

Yet, anyway.</span>

&quot;<strong>A face? Probably one of William&#39;s tricks. Don&#39;t focus on it. You did well. We failed to defeat William, though in the end...</strong>&quot; Granel heaved another sigh. &quot;<strong>We were Masters. He was a Servant. I should&#39;ve gone all out, but I didn&#39;t. That&#39;s on me. Let&#39;s simply take the blame for our respective parties and truck on. Or you can drop it on that Roman, it matters not.</strong>&quot;

Granel mulled his Servant&#39;s words as the two sat in silence. Donald&#39;s words made sense. Sometimes there were just people you could not save. Anthony was one. Many countless Nirvanans were others. People died. Life went on.

Except for the people close to those who died. A void was left that could never be filled. What happened when one person died? It took years for those living to recover.

What about dozens?

&quot;<strong>I pity that Servant, though. It didn&#39;t deserve to go out like that.</strong>&quot; Granel growled, thinking of Wendigo. Servants constantly revived and died, almost like Granel.

&quot;<strong>Donald, how did you die? What was it like? Seeing as...</strong>&quot; The massive man shuffled awkwardly. &quot;<strong>I can&#39;t.</strong>&quot;

How did he die? Not a common question, that was for damn sure. For some reason, he doubted that this sort of inquiry had been asked often in his previous ‘lives’. Some people just wanted the Servant for what they offered, not who they were.

“I can’t speak fer the beast, but fer me, it was as glorious as ye could expect: in combat, odds a dozen t’ one. Surrounded on all sides. Certainly, no way in hell I was gettin’ out o’ there alive. So, I took as many of those evil bastards with me as I could.”

He slowly pulled his flintlock from its holster and aimed it at random spots in his vision. “Oh, ye should’ve seen me! A blur of steel and crimson, the smell of gunpowder and death, a great last stand! By the time I keeled over the rest of those men were deader than they had hoped me t’be!”

Another few laughs were followed by yet another round of painful coughs. “Er that’s what ye expect. I died just as most others do when ye get old: in a bed. Peaceful. A few loved ones there t’say goodbye.”

“Most importantly, me wife an’ little ones,” he pulled out the locket hidden beneath his shirt, “an’ I wouldn’t ‘ave asked fer more.”

How… nice. Plain, boring even– but nice. A simple death for a simple man, and with not a regret to be had. Many would call it downright lucky, if one considered the way a lot of people went.

“Wouldn’t ‘ave mattered anyway. What we <em>deserve</em> an’ what we got er two different creatures. None of us er entitled a single damn thing when we go, no matter how ye might think.”</span>

However, it quickly faded as the guard remembered William&#39;s monologue. Nobody was entitled to anything, and yet William claimed that he did.

Was it likely that Donald McBane, a random Saber that barely appeared in the annals of history, was more correct than William Shakespeare, famous playwright?

Granel was surprised to genuinely believe that Donald was correct. It probably helped that William was a massive fraud.

&quot;<strong>Heh.</strong>&quot; Granel rumbled. &quot;<strong>HehehehAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</strong>&quot; The cottage rumbled as Granel laughed. His laugh had probably alerted every islander within a five mile radius. Yet Granel didn&#39;t care. He didn&#39;t care! 

&quot;<strong>You&#39;d make a great philosopher! When did you get so wise, you waste of space.</strong>&quot; Granel grinned, talking trash. After a long period of mirth, Granel became serious once again. 

His chest felt cold. The reason was clear: the spike from all those years ago was still there. Always there. It never truly left. He looked at Donald, still mirthful, before coughing &quot;<strong>Donald.</strong>&quot;

The two locked eyes.

&quot;<strong>Did I ever tell you how I became immortal?</strong>&quot;

They both knew the answer was no.

“Certainly not from you, ye thoughtless brute! If it weren’t fer that dolt Vortigern I’d think you the dumbest one ‘ere,” Donald said. 

They remained content with each other for a good amount of time, simply enjoying each other&#39;s presence. A silence slowly started, and yet there was not a single thing either of them would’ve done to change it. There wasn’t any need.

Or at least Donald thought until Granel brought up his own immortality.

“Huh,” he turned to the other man, “that’s what it is? I thought ye were jokin’ this whole time. Ye haven’t, and I wasn’t ‘bout to ask. Seems rather… personal.”

It was damn guaranteed to be a good story, even if it was a painful, horrible experience. He leaned back slowly, a more comfortable position despite the groans from his arms. “If yer sure ye want to share, then go ahead. I’m all ears.”</span>

Death. Decay. Misery. What was it like to be stabbed through the heart, only to be left there to rot, failing to breath as blood fails to be pumped through the body. It runs out of oxygen, shutting down vital systems as it went along.

Bleeding out happened more often, but there had to have been an officer that Granel had survived alongside, who just embraced death, and sat there as life flowed from them.

How many people had died on that fateful day.

&quot;<strong>I used to be a cop in a small city.</strong>&quot; Granel said, as if this was the most unbelievable thing in the world. It was pretty obvious, given Granel&#39;s field experience. &quot;<strong>Part of our job was tracking down stray magi and slaughtering them. It is difficult to imprison a magus. They have a tendency to be... slippery.</strong>&quot;

William flashed to the forefront. Slimy bastard.

&quot;<strong>See, we had a philosophy. Kinda similar to yours. Why waste time and energy on casting a fireball when a bullet will accomplish the same thing to another person? Once they&#39;re dead, they&#39;re dead.</strong>&quot;

When he was young, Granel idolized magi. They were so powerful. So <em>together</em>. They had harnessed the power of the world. They were superheroes! The chosen! Those blessed with astounding and unnatural abilities that placed them above the rest.

But what was a magical explosion compared to a ton of dynamite? A familiar to a drone? The greatness of mages could be overshadowed by technology, and if so, what was there to fear?

That, in its own way, was arrogance. That arrogance got men killed.

&quot;<strong>There was this mass murderer. He stabbed people with these iron spikes, and stole their life. I think he was trying to make himself immortal. Nothing else makes sense. But as you can see...</strong>&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">A cop, eh? Hard to believe that they got stuck with such a hard job like that. It would’ve been a lot smarter to send another magus to deal with a ‘brother’ that had gone rogue. 

But then again, it’s a lot easier to send some random shmucks that don’t ‘hold any importance’ than a talented magus who is supposed to be the next big thing. Lot easier to explain away, in Donald’s mind. 

“Well, in our defense,” Donald quickly interrupted, “it’s not like we had the ability t’do that. If there were mages an’ witches at the time, they were in no hurry to step in an’ tell the rest of us. I get yer point though.”

He did not feel the need to point out the obvious flaw with such an idea: if the magus could get around those more ‘physical’ means, then their opponents were just more fish in a large barrel. Ripe for the pickings.

Terribly timed metaphor, on second thought. 

Saber reached over without a second thought and felt the raised cloth that Granel pointed out. Underneath was certainly something not natural for the normal human. A cold, thick, pointed object was dug into his flesh and did not budge an inch. Why wasn’t it warm?

A few seconds passed, and he realized what he was doing. His hand retreated as fast as it had approached, “My bad. Now isn’t the time to act as a wee one would.”

“A murderer, huh? Looks like ye were ‘the one that got away’, in a sense. Er the one that stopped ‘em dead in their tracks. Whatever tickles yer fancy,” he returned to his previously relaxed position. This Servant and Master pair weren’t as different as he once thought. Not that they had been polar opposites, but the similarities had never been great.

Misery sure did make for some strange bedfellows.</span>

That was not fair. Every life was valuable. Even the maddened Nirvanans corrupted by the island. He wanted to wrap his comrades in his grasp and prevent them from feeling any misery.

Maybe then, and only then, he could forgive himself. His first squad had perished. This one would not. They could not. He would not allow it.

He would keep his friends safe. That was all to his motivation.

Shivering slightly, Granel unbuttoned his shirt enough for the spike to reveal itself. He grimaced. &quot;<strong>Ugly thing. It aches, sometimes. It keeps me alive. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fueled by their life force or what. Hopefully they&#39;re watching over me. Their wishes are mine now.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>So that&#39;s that. I became immortal by mistake. A mad mage stabbed me with a Mystic Code, trying to steal my life, but failed. I should have told you about this earlier. I was scared.</strong>

&quot;<strong>So please...</strong>&quot; Granel swallowed. &quot;<strong>Fight with me. As a friend, a brother. Please, Donald.</strong>&quot;

They were two sides of the same coin. Granel had gladly been willing to throw his life away for his squad, but after seeing Nirvana, it became clear that his life had value. Donald&#39;s life had value. They should cherish the fact that they were alive.

Together.

A nasty, ugly thing that jutted out straight from the center, it looked painful. Just the thought of something similar with him sent a shiver down Donald’s spine. 

“I don’t think ye need to be sorry fer somethin’ as small as that, Granel. Fer better er worse, the past ain’t somethin’ to dig up just fer clarity’s sake. You don’t go to explain nothin’ you don’t want, so long as it isn’t relevant er vital to whatever is at hand.”

And then, the ultimate plea. 

Donald whistled, but stayed silent for a good minute. The thought swooshed around in his head, poked and prodded like a machine with a mechanic. This wasn’t something one could just rush into blindly, as easy and convenient it would be.

“It’s no small thing,” he finally broke the silence, “to ask fer help in such a way. As lax as I might seem, not even I would be as reckless to immediately take ye up on yer offer.”

“Without some warnings.”

What?

“Do ye really mean what you said?”</span>

Saber shifted around, until he was sat on his lower legs. His face had a seriousness that had never been seen before. Any hint of a casual mood had been killed off, replaced with a sense of determination and commitment.

They once again locked eyes.

“Ye were on the right track, but there’s a term for somethin’ like this. <strong>Blood Brothers</strong>. If I agree t’ this, then we’re no longer ‘Master ‘n Servant’. No kill switch, no backstabbing, no nothing. We fight together, travel together, an’ even <em>die</em> together if necessary.”

“Normally, I’d do this a different way,” Donald pulled his sabre from his side, and held the blade to his left palm. It shook as he drew it down hard, and a small river came from the wound. 

“But just this once, I will make an’ exception. I won’t think less of ye if yer not ready for this sort of commitment. This is not fer the bold er weak-hearted.”

Saber held up his blood-stained and and the hilt of the sabre.
“I will only ask this once: Granel. Will you be my Blood Brother?”</span>

That sky cast a red glow over the cottage, over Donald, over Granel. It made Donald&#39;s blood look like a dark mud.

Bathed in a ruddy glow, the two stared at one another.

&quot;<strong>What a stupid question. You know the answer. Ask me a hundred times, and the answer will not—cannot—change.</strong>&quot; Granel replied, voice firm.

This was Donald&#39;s conviction. He cut himself before a man who had known every wound, had felt enough pain to numb the sense to a dull ache, and bore no physical evidence of such miserable pain.

It was something Granel should despise—pain for no reason was meaningless—yet he could not fault Donald&#39;s old-fashioned beliefs. This motivation is what had him cut himself on Donald&#39;s blade, deeper than his Servant&#39;s scratch.

It was already healing when the two wounds met, and the two intertwined their fates.

<strong>Servant: Donald McBane</strong>
<strong>Class: Saber</strong>
<strong>IDENTIFICATION CONFIRMED: SBSC173282</strong>

That was all. There was no celebration. There was no fanfare. It was two men, beaten and bruised to the core, sitting in a cottage as the world around them ended.</span>

People were good and evil. On this island, there was no such thing. There were simply flawed people. Hurt people. Corrupted people. They deserved to live a moderately happy life. The investigators, too.

So as the world ended outside, for two people, all was well, if only for a moment.

<strong>Sniff.</strong>

Oh no, the waterworks were starting up. Granel was going to start bawling. If it was anything like his yells, sneezes, or voice, it was going to shake the island apart.

&quot;<strong>I was gonna save this for our victory, but I think this is a better use for it.</strong>&quot; Granel sniffed, digging through his survival bag, and pulling out a fine vintage bottle.

Whiskey. Old, too.

They were going to celebrate the old-fashioned way.

Even before that, to times when The Holy Grail had just been a flight of fancy that no one could ever hope to find. 

When Donald released Granel’s hand, his hand looked as good as it always had. Unfortunately, his hand would take a little longer to mend. He did not think of this as he took the sabre back, and gave the hilt a blood-red paint job.

“Oh. Uh, well, that wasn’t… hm…” He set the weapon to the side and made a mental note to clean it up later. It had seen better days, with a faint film of dirt and grime built up from lack of care. A spit shine was in order.

For now, he would nod along to the other man’s assessment, “Can’t disagree. Time to figure out– oh, Granel, pal, no need fer the waterworks. Please.”

If not out of the awkwardness of Granel with a stream of tears and snot, Donald hoped that he calm down so that he didn’t have to find out if the suited man did <em>everything</em> at one-hundred-and-ten percent. Brothers they might now be, but that was a side he wanted to not see immediately after their bond started.

Instead, Granel pulled out a surprise: Whiskey.

Donald was quick to snatch it from his hands, and inspected the bottle closely. “<em>Where the hell… nice an’ old too… is it, real?</em>”

The top was yanked off and he took several deep sniffs. Each one sealed the deal, with the fifth one as more of a personal desire than any actual suspicion. The corners of his mouth shot sky-high, “Oh ho, brother, ye really do know how to make a man happy! No idea how I didn’t find it earlier, but that’s not important now!”

The bottle was offered to Granel first, “New plan: celebrate first, figure out a plan later. Deal?”</span>

It was a deal alright.

A pretty good deal, all things considered. Later had come sooner than expected, and the celebration was still underway. Donald was no light-weight, but drinking nearly half a bottle of whiskey would do things to even the heartiest of men.

With a nice buzz that dulled the pain of his terrible defeat, he attempted to snatch the whiskey away from Granel. “Give ‘er here. Someone’s gotta finish this bottle off, an’ it sure as hell can’t be you! Yer long gone!”

In all actuality, Donald just wanted the rest of it to himself. He was no drunkard, yet this was not something he had done… much at all since he had first arrived here. Lost times had to be made up for somehow, and this seemed the best way.

“Besides, yer <em>hic</em> the smarter one ‘ere. You gotta figure out our next steps, and it’s hard to do that <em>drunk</em>,” He leaned over further, almost desperate to snatch the glass from his hand. Just a little more…</span>

The cottage was utterly trashed. The walls were slashed. The tables were smashed. Donald had utterly crashed. It was almost poetic in a way. Granel was fairly certain that Servants couldn&#39;t get drunk. He was almost certain of it. He never stayed drunk enough to describe the sensation before his body automatically healed itself.

A blessing and a curse.

Granel had tossed a sheet over his Saber and given him his own backpack as a pillow. He wasn&#39;t sure how helpful it would be, but he knew the pains of a sore neck.

However, it was now daytime. Sun was leaking through the red sky, and Granel was getting more and more anxious. Where was William? Where was Vortigern? Where was Verga? Normally, something would have <em>happened</em> by now. Even if, admittedly, it had been so very recent.

Granel lounged around outside, looking around with disgust. This place was sickening. If only there was somebody who could heal it. Dante was a doctor, but even he seemed confused about what was going on in Nirvana. Maybe they needed a local professional.

A snicker erupted. As if. Most Nirvanans were certified nutcases. This was not rage speaking, but the truth. Most people here were positively mad. Except one.

The first person Granel had met from this island: Koji. He sighed. He was up in the mountains, right? If only there was more time. It was clear that the island was on its last legs. It didn&#39;t have much more to give.

&quot;<strong>Maybe it&#39;s time to retreat.</strong>&quot; Granel murmured shamefully, before shaking his head. No. He had to have faith in his comrades and the people who lived on Nirvana.</span>

After a ferocious battle, Granel came out, bloody and bruised. As he healed, he kicked the squirrel carcasses into a puddle of mud, where they evaporated.

Sickening.

Yet the view was all the sweeter because of it.

The docks, and by extension, the Canopus, could be seen from the top of this hill. Impressively, the ship was still there. Granel felt a warmth blossom in his heart. The Investigation Team had managed to keep this small pocket of territory from being completely thrashed.

&quot;<strong>I am proud of them.</strong>&quot; He said to nobody in particular. A bird flew off as he said that, and he saw a chunk of flesh fall off. He shook his head, annoyed. This island was disgusting. Yet why was that bird so familiar...?

His thoughts were torn away as Granel saw a massive aquatic entity slam into the ship. With a grip of fear in his heart, he stopped. There was an <em>assault</em> happening on the Canopus right now. The security guard thought about the repercussions of letting the ship sink.

If it sunk, they were dead.

&quot;<strong>Donald. DONALD!!!</strong>&quot; Granel yelled as he sprinted back towards the cottage.

His bones still hurt, but now even his head suffered the same fate. A minor throb had sprung behind his eyes and made it hard to keep them open.

Duty called, however. Granel burst through the front door to see Donald now sat up. His hands supported a heavy head, which glanced in his Brothers direction. “Wha-what? Problem?”

Sounded like a storm brewed over… something. Surely it was a big deal. However, he had gotten a little too much of the whiskey to be on the draw at the drop of a hat. Granel would have to settle for a much more measured response. 

“Where’s the trouble, Granel? If ya give me, oh, five minutes, I’ll be in fightin’ shape,” he said. “An’ a canteen of water.”</span>

Sober up.</strong>&quot; Granel said, shouldering past the Scotsman as he picked up their supplies. He saw Donald&#39;s pistol on the ground, before tossing it to him.

Donald seemed to recuperate as Granel prepared. Maybe Servants could only be drunk when they wanted to be? It was a strange theory. Nonetheless, Granel was more focused on current events.

&quot;<strong>The ship is under assault. As a member of the Security Division, I am under obligation to defend it. Without it, we have no home to come back to.</strong>&quot; Granel said ominously, straightening his suit and tie. He didn&#39;t even need to look into a mirror to do so. It was as straight as an arrow.

&quot;<strong>Rouse yourself, Donald. I saw a water bucket in the back. Wash your face and soul. You look terrible.</strong>&quot; 

It was tragic to leave this little cottage behind. Few buildings were built for men as large as Granel, and in a different world, it might have made a good home. However, it was not time for fantasies.

What was the mud leaking from the trees? Who was behind it? Where were the schematics for Nirvana? These were all questions Granel had failed to answer. He could only hope that his comrades could figure it out.

After all, he wasn&#39;t known for his detective skills.

&quot;<strong>Leave nothing. I doubt we&#39;re going to return here. Ever. Where&#39;s Cameran?</strong>&quot;

Whatever’s left in me system’ll get lost once we get goin’ and hydrated,” Donald explained, the pistol caught with casual precision. Besides, even if he was drunk, he had one a duel completely off his rocker once! Maybe. It was a bet gone wrong and a time best forgotten.

And not relevant. Saber instead used that time to freshen up, back to the mentioned water bucket. It had been left in the corner in case of a rampant house fire, yet had gone untouched for the duration of their stay. A film had built up on the top of the water, which he disposed of with a quick splash onto the wooden floor.

Most of it went into his throat, a welcome liquid to his parched mouth. Each glug sent his headache back, until it was drowned out by the rest of his small aches. It tasted peculiar, yet there sounded to be no time for something a little fresher. 

And speak of no time, a spike of anxiety drove into his body at the mention of Cameran. His hands shot to his pockets in desperation, his gut sure that the little bugger was going to be somewhere long gone. 

Instead, he felt the hard carapace and tiny movements of the brown insect.

“In me pocket! Thank the Lord, too.”

This was goodbye, eh? This little cottage had been witness to many an event. A discussion of morals, plans, and even a bond that transcended the realm of reality. To just leave it felt a tad disrespectful, a fate perhaps worse than death. 

Oh well! 

A much more presentable Donald faced Granel, with only his weapons and optimism packed. He stepped to the worn door, “Ready whenever ye are, Brother. The Canopus awaits!”</span>
