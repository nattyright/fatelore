Her footwear wasn&#39;t the most ideal for this terrain so she almost tripped a good few times. She wasn&#39;t the most physically trained out of her peers and it was coming back to bite her in the ass.

She could hear the sounds of the fight behind her. She wanted to turn back to see if they were okay. Her orders were absolute though.

<em>&quot;Get to that place, quick.&quot;</em>

She needed to get to their <span class="mention">#forest-camp</span>. There she can wait for Ace&#39;s return, or carry on the mission alone should the worst come to be.

Sweat dripped from her forehead as she rested up against a tree to catch her breath. Her lungs screamed out to her to stop, but she knew that she couldn&#39;t. The further she gets from the fight behind her, the safer she will be. That way Ace didn&#39;t need to worry about her at all. 

Well, maybe a little breather shouldn&#39;t hurt after all...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Emeilia roamed the forests, unaware that she had actually taken a detour from the correct path to the base that her and Ace had constructed earlier. Perhaps she wasn&#39;t thinking clearly due to how anxious she felt, or perhaps she needed to work more on recognizing landmarks on the field. Either way, she felt she was close. Plus, she knew for a fact that she was far away from the fight. All she could do was pray for Ace to make it out alive.

But was she truly alone?

<em>&quot;Do dodododo-du-dodododo-du! <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="♪" title="♪" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/266a.svg">&quot;</em>

A familiar voice rang in her ears, coming from an abandoned looking building that had been covered in an invasive species of flora. Judging by the design and appearance, it very much reminded her of research bases back home. It was such a shame to see a beacon of knowledge be reduced to a sorry state.

Even worse was knowing the fact that someone inside of it was singing.

<em>&quot;Making my way downtown, walking fast, faces pass and I&#39;m homebound! <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="♫" title="♫" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/266b.svg">&quot;</em>

Whoever was singing was not only familiar, but dreadfully offkey and poorly tuned, to the point that her ears questioned reality. Nobody could be <em>that</em> bad.

<em>&quot;Do dodododo-du-dodododo-du! And I need you! Do dodododo-du-dodododo-du! And I miss you!&quot;</em>

The voice got closer, much to Emeilia&#39;s displeasure. She felt tempted to leave, but her inner curiosity caused her to remain in the proximity of the building.

&quot;And if I could fall...into the sky! Do you think time, would pass me by-<strong>AHHHHHHH!</strong>&quot; The mysterious singer emerged from the building doors, casually walking past and humming a familiar tune before finally noticing Emeilia standing right outside. They were beet red and embarrassed, as if caught in the shower with no pants on.

The woman put two and two together. That familiar voice. That horrid tone. That gaudy outfit. It was none other than the Servant from earlier: William Shakespeare.</span>

&quot;Y-You! What do you think you&#39;re doing, sneaking up on people uninvited?&quot; William was quick to defend himself, adjusting his hat as he stared at Emeilia with arms crossed. The sign of a pissed poet.

&quot;I had no idea you outsiders were such peeping toms. Perhaps I was wrong to support you. Tell me, what else did you get to see? Or are you satisfied now? Hmph.&quot; He scoffed.

The sounds of <s>awful</s> singing soon reached her ears.

Did they really catch up that quickly? Was she so unlucky that she managed to run into the hideout of one of the Islanders? Someone who sang like that <strong>had</strong> to be mad! 

The answer didn&#39;t escape her for long though. The sight of a familiar figure made themselves known. Their scream made Emeilia scream back. Out of all the people to run into, William was the last person she expected to see in this forest. Though it was curious as to <em>why</em> he was even here to begin with. Perhaps this building was one of his many hiding spots. It made sense due to how remote and hidden it was after all.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to peep on you! Who are you to accuse me of something like that?! A proud Genevi would never!&quot; With a finger pointed at him, Emeilia retaliated with her own little outburst. To think he would have the nerve to say that she had the interest to be stalking him! 

&quot;I was merely just hea-&quot; She stopped herself before she could say more. Even if William was an ally, she was given orders from Ace to never disclose the location of their <span class="mention">#forest-camp</span> to <em>anyone</em>. They never knew who could be listening. Secrecy was their strongest weapon. &quot;heading to safety. Ace and Berserker are fighting so he told me to run and hide. Berserker would be able to track me anyways so I have no worry about getting lost.&quot; A solid lie. Neither of what she said was entirely untruthful after all.</span>

Things got so heated that she had almost revealed the location of her and Ace&#39;s camp! Thankfully, she bit her tongue before she could reveal any further details.

Albeit the information she revealed seemed to awaken a sparkle in Shakespeare&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Oooooh! Your boyfriend and your Berserker are fighting someone? Why, that sounds like quite the spectacle.&quot; He exclaimed with a cheery grin.

&quot;Say, do you think they will mind if I go watch? I was looking for a muse anyway.&quot; He manifested a book and pen out of thin air. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

At least, that&#39;s what she <em>would</em> be thinking if it wasn&#39;t for William&#39;s interesting choice of words... 

&quot;<strong>BO-BO-BO-BOYFRIEND?!</strong>&quot; 

That outburst was loud enough to cause nearby birds to fly away. Her face was red enough that it wouldn&#39;t be too outlandish if steam started to come off her head. 

&quot;Ace isn&#39;t my boyfriend! I mean he truly embodies what Geneva stands for and more. He&#39;s also an icon for anyone who knows of him and who doesn&#39;t know of him in Geneva! But that doesn&#39;t mean I like him! My heart belongs to Geneva-&quot; Emeilia continued to quickly rambled off in an attempt to defend herself. Despite her attempts to prove her innocence, all it did was dig a hole deeper for her. How spicy! Budding love on the battlefield?</span>

&quot;Geneva this, Geneva that. I don&#39;t even know what a Geneva is! All I know is Genova that dear Romeo visited.&quot; Shakespeare shrugged. 

&quot;In that case, would you be his Juliet? Ah, so romantic!&quot; He was clearly referring to Ace, giggling to himself as he walked towards the steps to the forest labs and took a seat on them.

&quot;Though, I have to say, he&#39;s quite the terrible boyfriend if he let you roam the woods alone. You <em>do</em> know this is a nature reserve, right? Had it not been me, you might have encountered one of them wild bears I keep hearing so much about. Or worse.&quot; He said, casting her a lazy glance while resting his cheek on the palm of his hand. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

Surely there are bett-&quot; Emeilia froze once William mentioned that this was nature reserve. He was right. How could she have forgotten about that fact? Did she put so much trust into Berserker and Ace that they could return to her before something else found her?

The dangers of this place dawned upon her. She was <em>alone</em>. Well, she had William but she doubted that he would stick his neck out for her. It must have been a miracle that she didn&#39;t run into something besides William.

&quot;I suppose it must have slipped my mind..&quot; As the fear settled inside of her, she moved away from the tree line and towards the same steps that William sat on.

&quot;What are you doing here then? This place isn&#39;t your home, right?&quot; A finger pointed to the labs. If this place was so dangerous, why would someone like William be here? Did he have some attachment to this place?</span>

The soothing sensation that she felt from finally giving her legs a rest felt so relaxing. She didn&#39;t sit next to William of course. There was enough space for them to both rest without needing to invade each other&#39;s personal space. 

Her embarrassment was slowly fading away until her cheeks were only rose-tinted now compared to the bright red showing of earlier. 

A deep breath was taken before she continued. &quot;Berserker needs to feed or else they might return to the throne. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.&quot; A false story, sure, but they did need to keep Berserker fed so it wasn&#39;t that far off. She didn&#39;t even know what might happen if Berserker didn&#39;t feed so she went for a safe guess. &quot;The thing is, Berserker wouldn&#39;t eat any of the game here.&quot;</span>

He stared back at her from a distance, a suspicious glance in his eyes.

&quot;Uhhhh, you do realize I was <em>joking</em> right?&quot; He casually stated while raising an eyebrow. &quot;Is this your way of continuing the joke? Because you need to take some comedy lessons my dear!&quot;

While Emeilia most likely felt even more embarrassed by that statement, William wouldn&#39;t give her the luxury of dwelling on it.

&quot;But if what you&#39;re saying is true, then we have a Berserker at our hands that needs to eat meat to remain in this world. How completely and utterly ridiculous!&quot; He declared, arching his back as he stretched his arms before standing up.

<strong>&quot;I love it!&quot;</strong> William squealed. &quot;This is truly the inspiration that I have been craving. Tell me, tell me! What&#39;s their True Name?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

The distance it flew could possibly rival the mountain in Nirvana if one were to compare the two. The one thing that the Scholar Corps didn&#39;t train her in seemed to be her people skills. That or comedy might as well be a lost piece of human culture over at Geneva. 

She felt the hot wash of shame engulf her completely. Now she really wanted one of the dangers to come get her to put her out of her misery! If she wanted to avoid feeling like this again, she needed to work on her comedy skills! 

Luckily for her, William didn&#39;t seem all too interested in teasing her some more. 

&quot;Their True Name?&quot; Emeilia was a bit taken back from how excitable William got. It wasn&#39;t what she expected from what she could remember about his ServantPedia™️ page. But, Nirvana was weird so maybe it affected him more than she thought. Maybe 

&quot;I doubt you would recognize them even if I told you their True Name.&quot; An idea crossed her mind. It was a gamble but she wanted to be useful to Ace. &quot;I will tell you the name though, <strong>If</strong> you tell me something in return.&quot; A trade of information!

&quot;Comes with the profession. Though, hmm.&quot; He pondered on Emeilia&#39;s proposal. Even he was wise enough to see that she wanted an equivalent exchange of information.

&quot;Sure, why not! I hate keeping stuff to myself anyway. Go on. Ask me anything! I can tell you anything you need to know about Nirvana, from the three sizes of every woman on the island, to Verga&#39;s most common phobias!&quot; He said with a cheery expression on his face. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

&quot;What is this place? It doesn&#39;t look like the rest of the buildings here in Nirvana. Is it the only one on the island?&quot; Her lines of questions were simple. If there were certain buildings out here in Nirvana to look out for, that could lead them on the right path to figuring out where to find the blueprints and the mystery of this place. 

&quot;We&#39;re looking for a few things on this island. That&#39;s why we came here to begin with.&quot; So that&#39;s why the outsiders are here on this island!</span>

&quot;It&#39;s just another one of them research facilities. Don&#39;t know who used to run them and honestly don&#39;t care. I just know Nirvana used to have a lot of sciency types in it, until one day, they just went poof!&quot; He stated. Interesting...

It was unlike whether she was judging him, trying to see if the numbers thing was another joke, or simply trying to see if he actually did or not. 

Though the fact there this was a research facility meant that she and Ace could find something worthwhile inside. She needed to remember to come back here with him for later. There was no telling what could be in there after all. It would be safer with two. And maybe Berserker for some extra protection. 

&quot;We couldn&#39;t really care less what the islanders do on this island. What we do care about is information regarding Nirvana itself. It&#39;s a precious piece to humanity so any blueprints are highly coveted. Once secured, we plan to leave this place once and for all.&quot; Not the most exciting reason the outsiders are here for, especially to someone like William, but it was something.</span>

&quot;Numbers? For heaven&#39;s sake, no! There is a reason I chose to become a playwright, after all.&quot; He replied, showing his lack of affinity towards math. &quot;Blueprints. Hmmm. I get that! Sort of. I love me some good, comfortable house-&quot;

When Emeilia mentioned that Ace and her had no interest in Nirvana besides the blueprints, it&#39;s like a fuse lit up in William&#39;s head.

&quot;Leave? What do you mean, <em>leave?</em>&quot; He asked curiously. &quot;Come on now! You know you can&#39;t get to the end until you&#39;ve been changed by the journey.&quot;

End? Journey? What was this charlatan talking about?

&quot;This quest of yours. It needs to happen! Sure, you could leave after you gather all of the blueprints, <em>ORRRR</em>, you could try to figure out what&#39;s actually going on in this dump.&quot;

He sounded rather annoyed at the thought that Emeilia had came here for her own desires, as if he weren&#39;t expecting her objective to be so...normal.

Though, she didn&#39;t think that she would strike a nerve so easily like this with him. It was almost like he didn&#39;t want them to leave! It was unsettling to say the least. However, he did bring up a good point. One that caught her interest.

&quot;Why would figuring out the mystery here matter? Our goals is to secure the blueprints after all.&quot; Emeilia retaliated with her own question. &quot;Ace and I have our mission. Getting sidetracked like that would only hinder us after all.&quot; This person played too tightly to the rules. Adventure was something this type of person needed in their life! 

First, William needed to find out a way to convince her to undergo this quest! To do that, he needed to give her character a reason, a motivation if you will, to set her on the path he wanted. Perhaps he could do that by adding value to figuring out the mystery of Nirvana? Value that she haven&#39;t even noticed herself!</span>

He shook his head, pacing himself around the girl before starting to walk up the stairs to the lab again. Towering above her, he started to speak once more.

&quot;So, is Genova or whats-it-called filled with clock punchers like youse?&quot; He asked with a judgmental tone. &quot;Have you ever <em>thought</em> for yourself?&quot; He broke into laughter soon after asking that.

&quot;Sorry, wrong question. I&#39;ll rephrase that: Are <em>you</em> after the blueprints or is that your boyfriend&#39;s goal? Are you just following him like his little doggy? I mean, I won&#39;t judge! I&#39;m into that kinky stuff myself.&quot; He laughed, but there was no humor in his words. If anything, things took a darker turn. Part of Emeilia felt like William was joking, while the other part of her felt like she was being judged. It was different than how Ace acted around her. While her senior usually doubted her, they still felt <em>human.</em>

William Shakespeare did not have the warmth of a human.</span>

&quot;You know, you really do remind me of Juliet. As a character, specifically.&quot; He turned around, facing away from Emeilia as he walked up the stairs and went further beyond. &quot;A lot of my fans would ask me: How do you do it, oh almighty Shakespeare? How do you craft such wonderful stories? Well, it really is simple: <strong>I know what I want.</strong> I want a tragedy? I write it. I want a comedy? I write it. I want something filthy and perverted? I write it. Pure and nubile? You guessed it.&quot;

He took more and more steps, until he had almost reached the top of the stairs to the lab entrance.

&quot;<em>I know it all.</em> What I want from the book, before it&#39;s even written. And you, Juliet, you&#39;re just a character. You have no <em>goals.</em> All your drama with Romeo? Written by me. All your fears? Me. All your problems? Me!&quot; William declared proudly before turning around, staring at Emeilia from a distance.

&quot;Every step you took to get here,&quot; He pointed to the stairs. &quot;I paved the road.&quot; His fingers then started wiggling, alternating between his index and middle finger, like a person walking.

&quot;You? <strong>You just walk down it.</strong> And if you&#39;re happy with that, by all means, keep at it! Follow your Genova customs till the end of the Earth!&quot;

<em>&quot;ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&quot;</em>

A pen popped from his fingers out of thin air. He tossed it towards Emeilia.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;It&#39;s <em>Geneva</em>!&quot; Emeilia spoke up at William&#39;s continued mispronunciation of her home&#39;s name. She even stood up, ready to defend her place even further. Until he asked if she ever thought for herself though. Then she froze before she even took a single step up the stairs. Bullseye. Right on the mark.

&quot;What-&quot; 

It was the truth that even she didn&#39;t want to acknowledge. Never once did she think for herself. All she did was for Geneva&#39;s sake. If it helped to benefit Geneva in some way, she didn&#39;t care whether it was her thoughts or another&#39;s being implanted. 

&quot;Ah, well, you see-&quot; Each time she tried to defend herself, or speak up, she was shot down by William. Another point was tossed at her after the other. It was overwhelming. Though, the dark air around William didn&#39;t go unnoticed by her. She was remained that William wasn&#39;t a human like herself. He was a <em>Servant</em>. 

Did she even know what she wanted? Sure the mission for Geneva was important. She wanted to see it finished to earn her place within Geneva finally, but was it really what <strong>she</strong> wanted. 

The more he talked, the more he towered over her. She felt like she was being left behind, anchored down by the chains placed by the illusion of choice. William had none of that. He was, as he said, truly free to do whatever he wanted. 

A pen flew at her. She barely made it in time to catch it with both hands before examining it. She looked at it in awe, like it was something greater than just a mere pen. 

&quot;My own author?&quot; She sounded in disbelief. Like the idea was completely alien to her. Could someone like her truly take charge of her own life? That defiant flame inside of her, that Ace so kindly decided not to snuff out, told her yes.  &quot;Is that even possible for someone like me?...&quot; That last part sounded more like a plea. It seemed William managed to capture her curiosity.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Tomato, tomahto. Who cares!&quot; William replied, unaffected by Emeilia&#39;s attempt to correct his spelling. He would rather focus on the main course of this spectacle. A delightful feast for the soul.

The darkness within Emeilia&#39;s heart.

&quot;I write characters. Stories. I don&#39;t write <strong>authors.</strong> That&#39;s up for you to decide. What&#39;s the difference between me, lining my various puppets up, compared to your boss who expects all of his soldiers to obey like good little boys? There is none.&quot; William declared. &quot;<em>But</em>, make no mistake. It&#39;s not too late to become a real, living person. Everybody has to start somewhere!&quot;

He kept talking, slowly descending the stairs. One step at a time. Eventually, he got tired of such monotone walking, instead preferring to hop from step to step.

&quot;You want the blueprints? You can have them! That&#39;s not even what I&#39;m mad at. But are you truly satisfied with that? Are you fine with fulfilling the average goals of an average life for your average boss?&quot;

He took another hop.

&quot;I believe that humans can be...<em>weirder.</em> We have both comedy and tragedy in our very souls. All we do is wait for the critical point that tips the scales.&quot; He gestured with his hands, forming a makeshift balance in his arms as it leaned left first then right next.

&quot;Now, I have no idea what you want to do, but there can be beauty in excess. If your mission is to recover the blueprints, say, why not go <strong>even further beyond?</strong> You want to impress your <em>boss-slash-boyfriend-slash-authoritative figure-slash-mentor-slash-daddy-slash-author</em>, don&#39;t you? Then simply...<strong>do more!</strong>&quot;

And another hop.

&quot;Once you find the blueprints? What then? Leave Nirvana? No no no. What you <em>could</em> do is try to dig even deeper. Look up the research facilities. Try to figure out why a tourist trap of all places had such raw tech lying around.&quot;

Another hop.

&quot;And then, <strong>finding out the true nature of the technology behind this island.&quot;</strong></span>

And another one.

&quot;And then, <strong>discovering who made the tech in the first place and why.&quot;</strong>

And another one.

&quot;And then, <strong>finding the connections between these clues and Nirvana&#39;s wacky antics.&#39;&quot;</strong>

And another one, albeit he almost slipped.

&quot;And the-<strong>AHHHH!</strong>&quot; He held at the handrails to prevent himself from falling. &quot;Ahem, as I was saying, and then, <strong>getting down to the truth of what exactly happened at Nirvana.</strong>&quot;

The penultimate step.

&quot;And then, <strong>finally getting your well-deserved pats and admiration for a job well done.</strong>&quot;

The last step, causing him to hop and land right next to Emeilia, crouched and huddling as he adjusted his hat.

&quot;And then...<strong>You&#39;re welcome!</strong>&quot; He clapped his hands.

&quot;I just wrote you a play that writes itself. Draw the line, but cross it first, as they say.&quot; He chuckled, standing up as he hopped off the final step as well. His feet touched grass.

&quot;So, whaddaya think?&quot; William turned around, peering deep into Emeilia&#39;s soul. &quot;Impressed? Swooning? Ready to go out on a date with a <em>real</em> man instead of mister shades-for-brains?&quot; He joked while rubbing his fingers.

&quot;...Well? What are you here for? To worship me? Get on cracking! Scripts rot in <em>seconds.</em>&quot; He incited her to follow her ambitions. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Emeilia watched as the playwright in front of her took step after step, followed by hop after hop, until he got to her level. She saw it as William&#39;s truth becoming ever so closer until it was finally within her grasp. 

He was right. 

She could just complete the mission was instructed. OR she could go above and beyond what was asked of her. It was brilliant! A smile formed on her face as she stared at the pen in her hand and tightened her grip on it. She didn&#39;t have to wait for her superiors to see her worth! By figuring out the mystery, she can do more than just that. She could even get the approval of Ace! 

The promise of such personal rewards was too much for her to simply pass up! Besides, she was confident that she could figure it out. It was the only way for her to truly prove herself after all! She can already feel the pats and hear the words of admiration already, and it was oh so sweet! 

It was impossible to think that William&#39;s words failed to convince Emeilia to go on this path of personal indulgence with her confident smile. 

&quot;You know what, William? I think you&#39;re absolutely right!&quot; She corrected the position of her glasses with smirk on her face, which caused a gleam to reflect of the lens for a moment. Though, that confidence soon started to erode once William so brazenly, and jokingly, offered to ask her on a date. Her cheeks lit up bright red before she puffed them out. 

&quot;<strong>LIKE I WOULD CHOOSE YOU OVER ACE</strong>&quot;

She stormed her way towards the forest with the pen firmly in her hand. A symbol of her acceptance towards being her own author. Just before she escaped the rampant teasing of William, she stopped. There was something that she almost forgot. 

&quot;A deal&#39;s a deal. A Genevi always stays true to their word.&quot; Emeilia turned her head to look back at William over her shoulder. &quot;Berserker&#39;s True Name is <strong>Wendigo</strong>.&quot; With that, she ran off into forest once more. Eventually, she could no longer to be seen. All that was left was William.</span>

William gulped a bit as Emeilia cleanly shot him down. It was brutal, even by his standards. He was lucky that he was merely teasing her.

&quot;Romeo....Perhaps I treated you too harshly.&quot; He whispered to himself as he watched the woman head off, before she turned around and gave him one last nugget of wisdom.

&quot;Wendigo? Uh. Never heard of that before. But thank y-&quot;

Emeilia was already long gone.

&quot;...You. See you soon!&quot; William replied, shaking his head and stretching his arms and limbs a bit. A smile remained impressed on his face.

&quot;Soon, indeed.&quot; He giggled. &quot;I&#39;ll say, what is it with people wishing to go further and beyond? All that hard work and dedication for something so meager and small. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t judge. Not like I&#39;m any better!&quot;

He laughed, reading a book in his hands, before dropping it on the stairs.

<strong>The War of Art: Giving your Characters Consistent and Relatable Motivations™️</strong>

He then lit a match and tossed it at the book, allowing it to deeply burn while simultaneously providing him with a makeshift fireplace.

&quot;Now then,&quot; He sat next to the stairs. &quot;time to do some research!&quot; He chuckled as he started to look up the word <em>&#39;Wendigo&#39;.</em> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>
