            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">The north of the island is filled with thick forests and tall mountains, the perfect climate for arboreal animals or predators who prey on the latter. One will find plenty of squirrels, birds and deers, along with foxes, wolves and bears. Naturally, they are kept in separate enclosures to avoid any tension between herbivores and carnivores.

The tallest mountain in Nirvana is man made and designed to give a clear overview of the island from the very top. While initially planned to host holding cells for animals used to high altitudes, it has become a common tourist attraction for romantic couples looking to take selfies from the top of a gigantic mountain, something that is very much lacking in other cities. Of course, there haven’t been tourists on the island for ages.</div>

10 men and women were gathered for her, just as she had ordered Jayce to do. &quot;My children... Thank you for heeding my call at such a crucial time. As you were made aware of, some of your brothers and sisters have been... Abducted, and I fear.... Killed.&quot; There was a gasp from her small following collected. 

&quot;I expect my Angel to be within the woods before us. As she has a sense for death and dying. My children, I expect each of you to spread out and search these woods. Leave no stone unturned. Find any traces of those who have taken your siblings in faith. 

&quot;And of course... Offer them the chance at forgiveness at my own hand. Or end their lives if they chose to still reject such a high honor of penance.&quot; All 10 nodded before bowing down to their Holy Mother, they then began to spread out. Going in pairs of 2.

According to the <em>Felder boy</em>, the Forest Reserve was their safest bet. Although its <span class="mention">#residential-area</span> housed large numbers of Nirvanans, the bigger parts of the wild forest were as uninhabited as it got. Having a safe location near the Nirvanan&#39;s largest residential cluster also meant they could easily spot any sudden changes in the inhabitants&#39; behavior, which might prove to be a healthy asset later on. The group took a bet and followed the boy&#39;s directions, ultimately deciding to settle here.

A few kilometres from their <span class="mention">#forest-camp</span>, the group meaningfully paced through the woods, combing through the wild reserve in an effort to neutralize any impending threats to their camp. They had to make sure everything was in order before resting, or else how would they relax?

And after yesterday&#39;s argument, <em>god knows how badly they needed their rest</em>. The oppressive silence, while not unlike the regular silence that usually sat, made it hard on the nerves of a certain person in the group. Just how long would they keep walking randomly through the woods before the veteran would be satisfied?

The air tasted damp, the smell of wet rocks and nature was omnipresent. Seeing how far the forest extended and how natural everything looked, it was hard to keep in mind that this landscape was <em>artificial</em>. A man-made paradise meant to mimic old earth. Ace wondered, was this the sort of sight that would’ve greeted him if he was born prior to the great flood?

In any case, he hadn’t had the chance to be in such a forest in a long time. Geneva wasn’t exactly known for its dense flora, the most trees he had seen as a kid were the ones delimiting the yard in his orphanage. He took a moment to look around him, silently taking in the image of his surroundings. His finely honed ears picked up the sounds of the forest—birds chirping, pine leaves rustling, a few sounds he didn’t immediately recognize but that reminded him of insects. Cicadas, perhaps? But those only sang in summer, if he recalled correctly. Did Nirvana even house these kinds of exotic insects?

&quot;...you think there are cicadas here, rookie?&quot; A sudden, gawky question from the veteran. This marked the first words the pair exchanged for a little while.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The construction of their base of operations went smoothly. With their Monoband Military Radio set up at their <span class="mention">#forest-camp</span>, they could begin relaying coded information to Geneva in the form of reports. However, there was a task that needed completing before they could even send the first one out. That task is a simple one: <strong>Scout the area.</strong>

Much to the dismay of the rookie&#39;s sore legs, Ace requested that they scout out the local area for an potential dangers. It was a smart move, though one she hoped she didn&#39;t have to take a part of. She was the one with the memory though. Her memory was Ace&#39;s strongest tool in terms of collecting information after all. He wasn&#39;t going to just leave something like that at the camp.

Though a simple question broke Emeilia out of her stupor as she was glancing around the large nature reserve. &quot;Huh?&quot; She spoke, dumbfounded by the kind of question that was just asked. It was a pleasant surprise. She wasn&#39;t going to deny that. 

&quot;Well, given the location, probably not. If this place had a more warmer climate to one of their reserves, then we would have a better chance at finding some there. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised though if they kept a plethora of different species, not just bugs, here though.&quot; Emeilia pushed up her glasses a little as she spoke. Each step was taken with great care since she had short heels on. Not the best footwear for hiking in the forest as one would imagine.</span>

He had heard the insects&#39; chirps for the first time on an expedition back when he was a rookie, at a nomadic island that housed a forest similar to this one. While his first experience on the field wasn&#39;t as traumatic as Emeilia&#39;s, it was harsh enough that he thought back of it from time to time, usually in quiet moments much like this one. Back then, the cicadas&#39; chant helped him take his mind off of the bad things, off of his then superiors&#39; noisy complaints and harsh abuse. He would gently lay on the grounds and close his eyes, relaxing his exhausted body, focusing on the sounds of...

Sermons?

The veteran hushed the group, taking a couple of quiet steps ahead. He could see humanoid forms lurking behind the trees and the foliage.

<em>People.</em> Men and women alike, huddled up around a young woman with green locks of hair and an unbecoming robe, completely galvanized by her speech.

The woman at the center. Green hair, multiple hair garments delicately perched on top, tanned skin, holy garbs.

<em>Ruth Naomi.</em>

Were they looking for the missing cultists? But the-new-holy-mother was nowhere near the Forest Reserve, and the cultists had disappeared for no more than a day at this point. Was her presence here but an ill-fated coincidence?

Ace stopped in his tracks, turning to meet the gazes of his rookie and...

Just his rookie. Where was Wendigo?</span>

&quot;Children, If you are here. It would be best for you to just <em>show</em> yourself, instead of making me start a blaze to burn this whole sector to the ground.&quot; Her voice was loud, and still carried a saccharine tone to it. 

Another step and now the cult leader held 7 points of intense light upon her head. Each seated perfectly into her head piece. &quot;Hide and seek, was always my least favorite game to play. Not quite as exhilarating as something like tag.&quot; The woman&#39;s voice continued to muse, as her head scanned the forest. Twigs snapping beneath her feet, with little care for being stealthy.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Every day since her summoning, the Banshee bore a dull ache that pressed down on her skull and sought to crawl up her throat, numbing headaches and waves of nausea. These were the marks of mortality, the ever-present reminders of Nirvanans and outsiders alike dying. Every day she thought its burden weighed less on body and soul as the Investigators inevitably fell to blade or word.

Over the last day, she had sought refuge in the garden she was summoned and the floral memory of her intended  master provided a much needed balm for her condition. A temporary distraction from the inescapable pull of her duty and the terrible cries it elicited from her. 

Banshee did not expect her intermission to last forever and yet it lasted even shorter than she expected for a sharp spike of grief struck her mind as a white hot iron nail and forced her to cry out for the poor soul who died an excruciating and humiliating death, for what else could jar her mind so? 

Her cries worked to amplify the signal, to isolate that skein of fate from the rest of the tangled mass of lives running about and there she could sense that foul taint that she had experienced once before. The profane consumption of human flesh, driven by madness. Worse yet, she had the uncanny sensation of the corpse moving, its essence immersed in one of the damned, those who defied life and death. In that moment, she let all that pent up pain and sickness erupt. 

A shrill cry echoed through the forest, its origin unknown but its tone clear. Anguish and sadness, fury and hatred. It was as much a battle cry as it was a funerary mourning. The voice sounded inhuman in how it not only echoed but reverberated on itself as it broke out again.</span>

No steps could be heard, even in the silent lulls between the screams. Some poor souls could feel a baleful presence cast a detesting gaze upon their forms for a moment that stretched on to eternity. Others yet could feel a cold breeze pierce their clothes and settle like rime on their hearts.

The leader of them all, the prideful Ruth, would find that hateful gaze lock upon her and the cries seemed to erupt directly into her recovering ears. The cold wind cloaked her, numbing her body as it found itself tossed to the wayside and out of vision.

Despite her best tries, she could not marshal her voice to utter a scream of terror, a cry for help and not even a grunt of pain. For the Angel of Death perched herself on top of her saintly form.

&quot;<strong>Ruth Naomi, she who would call me servant, tell me. Where is the poor soul who you have devoured today?</strong>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Death plagued the forest. The act of cannibalism now tainted Nirvana yet again. To think Ruth would so brazenly partake in such taboo a second time despite the previous warnings given to her by her servant. However, upon arrival, Ruth&#39;s figure was pristine and free of these crimes placed upon her. They couldn&#39;t have done it. If she didn&#39;t, then who could? What being could so lost and deprived of morality to willingly consume their fellow person?

In what felt like mere moments after the first came the presence of a second life that was tragically cut short the same way. The tragedy and pain of their death was as searing as any fresh wound would be. Though, unless one had the ability to do so, this eerie presence would go unnoticed by mostly everyone. To the spiritually attuned though...

&quot;<strong>▅▃▃▃▃▬▬▬▬▃▃———!</strong>&quot; An ungodly howl that mirrored Banshee&#39;s own howl echoed through the forest. Animalistic yet made from a person.  Inhuman yet human in nature. 

A sudden shift in the air was felt. This time, unlike the previous presence, everyone felt it. An immense density of mana rapidly approached the group. There was no mistaking it. This was the presence of a servant.

<em>Rumble</em>

The sound of something leaping off the ground was heard in the distance.

It wasn&#39;t long until the thing came crashing down a fair distance behind Ace and Emeilia with a loud crash. 

Dust and dirt was kicked up in the air, briefly concealing the emaciated figure until they stood up at an unnatural height. Their limbs were long and their hands, along with their jaws as well, were dripping with blood from a fresh feast. Torn bloodied robes of two cultists was clung tightly in both of their hands. 

&quot;<strong>Master. We have Islanders.</strong>&quot; After they spoke in Ace&#39;s voice, Berserker held out the robes towards their Master to show that others were nearby. Though, with the appearance of the others already around them, it was pointless. They were already here.

 The robes were tossed aside once their worth ran their course. A disrespectful gesture to the recently departed. 

It would appear to the other cultists that the outsiders brought along with them a <em>demon</em>, with antlers in lieu of horns. Much to the contrast of Ruth&#39;s &#39;angel of death&#39;. As if they needed another reason to hate outsiders if they were bringing such taint with them to their beautiful paradise.</span>

The Cry That Signaled The End was heard once more. ‘<em>Surely… Surely Berserker will not be… Killing me.</em>’ The woman was frozen, due to the deepest most primal fear she held. A fear that even <strong>the hunger</strong> held. 

Death. 

As Banshee placed herself above Ruth and tossed her as if she was a rag doll. 

Her voice was stuck within her throat. The woman could not defend herself from these accusations of cannibalism. The Grievous sin which caused this unsteady relationship between both Master and Servant. Tears began to stream from her eyes, pleading for her innocence. 

As the true culprit’s own cry was heard. A beast similar in nature to Ruth. A being whose sole purpose was to <strong>consume</strong>.  It made itself known to all those in attendance, tossing a bloodied robe of one of the followers away. 

Ruth wanted to speak, but the words were not forming in her mouth. They sat, stuck deep beneath in her lungs. Some spell was put to work to cause such an effect. Hopefully this other beast would draw berserker’s Ire.</span>

The one most shocked was Kell Angelo. For his love, Ander Angelo, was taken by some beast, a devil. He could only stand in shock, slowly falling to his knees. Holding onto the severed Limb the Wendigo so graciously left behind. Mumbling to himself as he cradled it like a new born nightmare. Ignoring the grievous wounds that this beast had left him with. 

Yet the other 4 pairs continued, with more hesitation. Slowly encircling the investigators, and their antlered devil. For they still held a mission given to them by their Holy Mother, and they did not want to disappoint.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While the crowd dispersed, it seemed like the cult leader was quick to learn about their position. The crown that dearest Henry mentioned sat firmly on her head, glowing brightly in all of her seven-pointed glory. 

A deafeningly high-pitched scream, not too unlike Wendigo&#39;s, pierced the veteran&#39;s ears. Its pale perpetrator swiftly came into view, knocking over the cult leader and perching atop her unprotected figure. An unexpected ally?

<em>Ruth Naomi, she who would call me Servant.</em>

No. <em>The angel of death.</em>

An animalistic howl quickly came to answer the previous scream, one the veteran came to learn everything about in the last couple of days. The earth shook, a giant leap, then an explosion. Soil splattered, mud jumped. Wendigo&#39;s familiar figure appeared, blood dripping from its maw and claws. This was where Wendigo went. <em>It went feasting again</em>.

The veteran gripped two bullets in his inner pocket, infusing them with his emotions. They briefly glowed bright green, then were immediately pocketed inside his magnum&#39;s chambers along with three other bullets.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ace answered to his own voice, his tone almost identical. &quot;We have Islanders.&quot;

The bloody robes tossed aside, various steps echoed around the group. It seemed like the starving beast&#39;s cannibal tendencies weren&#39;t enough to persuade the cultists, as they approached the group with measured but significant steps.

Much like during Wendigo&#39;s summoning, Ace put himself between the cultists and Emeilia, positioning himself so both he and Wendigo were on either side of the rookie. His right hand fished in his inner pockets, taking out a military knife.

&quot;Mother,&quot; The veteran called out to the cult leader, uncaring of her struggle with her own Servant. &quot;Tell your followers to fuck right back to their church, or they&#39;ll fuck right back to their creator instead.&quot;

He took careful aim, his left hand resting on top of his right hand for support.

<em>&quot;I will fire two warning shots.&quot;</em>

Pressing the trigger twice, two bullets flew off from the magnum&#39;s barrel and hit the two cultists in front of him straight across the forehead.

Yet, no gunshots were heard, as if the veteran hadn&#39;t shot his magnum at all. And, perhaps most disrupting, <em>the bullets stopped in their tracks right as they hit the two cultists, awkwardly sitting on their foreheads as if frozen in space.</em></span>

However, she must believe that both Ace and Berserker could protect her. No, they <strong>will</strong> protect her. For that is their mission. That is what Geneva tasked for them to do. Ace wouldn&#39;t let down Geneva. She believed in that fact wholeheartedly. No amount of screams could break that belief of hers. 

On shaking knees, Emeilia stood up. She wasn&#39;t going to be a liability towards Ace. Not as long as he&#39;s still able to fight.

&quot;Orders, sir!&quot; She spoke despite the tension in the air. She wanted to know the best way to be of use to him.</span>

The Genevan had pulled his fire arm, and shot twice. No resounding <strong>bang</strong> was heard. The bullet itself was even stranger. 

 Gertrude Valdi, and Bart Neace both now had a bullet placed against their foreheads. Pressing ever so slowly, grinding away flesh. Pain was soon felt before they both pulled away. Ducking into the surrounding greenery. Blood now anointing their foreheads. As they began to cry in pain, from the worst head ache they will ever experience. 

This however still left the issue of the 3 remaining pairs. Who had currently halted their forwards movement. Weapons drawn, but feet standing still… waiting for whatever will happen next.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The fear of death played itself across Ruth&#39;s face, tears leaking from the corners of her eyes, lips trembling and body drawn into itself as it feared potential harm. Banshee gazed down upon her with the darkened gaze of a conqueror as she discerned if Ruth sought to hide that monster again. A foolish mistake, to hide it and yet still feed it would be her downfall.

Unfortunately, Banshee found out she was wrong about her target, very wrong as her own wail was met by the hunting howl of a very much real monster. She did not even need to utter a word or note to sense its fetid presence. The dead and the undying overlapped with each other and the rotting result permeated the area in which it stood.

Shots were fired and men panicked from what they thought was their sudden death. Their fate would not end there, at least from those bullets. Banshee&#39;s head locked in the direction of the Wendigo and the team of three could feel the angel of death&#39;s judgmental gaze bear down on them with full force, the only mercy to be granted to them was a swift death.

She did not move from her position but Ruth could feel an invisible string loosen its magical stitching upon her lips and feel the ground tremble underneath her as Banshee prepared her strike.

A barely perceptible ripple rolled across the forest floor, growing in amplitude as it neared Ace, Emelia and Wendigo. For them, the ground rumbled, the intensity magnifying every second before the earth fell silent again.

A second later and the earth beneath them would erupt in a forest of rocky spikes, uprooting whatever cover they hid behind and threatening to pin them all on this hostile outcropping. 

<strong>&quot;Spirit of gluttony, you will hide no longer! Come out so I may put your tortured soul to rest!&quot;</strong>Banshee commanded, standing in clear view of her target her reddened eyes glowing with an potent inner light and her silken white hair coursing with ancient power.</span>

It seemed she cared as little about her loyal servants as Ace did. Gertrude and Bart&#39;s inhuman screams both came to an abrupt stop, the bullets on their foreheads having finally reached deep enough into their skulls for their life to leak out.

Then the earth rumbled, shaking violently beneath the group&#39;s feet. The veteran instinctively shot a glare at the angel of death. <em>Was this the work of the enemy Servant?</em>

Ace instinctively ducked low, but little did he know that he had made a grave mistake. Spikes emerged from the ground, grazing skin and hair as they flew right past his frame. But, while he had the reflexes to dodge those life-threatening hits, he knew that <em>she</em> most likely didn’t.

With little care to his well-being, the veteran jumped back, putting his large body between Emeilia and the earthy spikes. While they were made of soft soil, the spikes felt <em>unnaturally hard</em>, sharp enough to easily tear through the fabric of his clothes and his skin. A red froth slowly dipped out of the veteran&#39;s wounds.

&quot;<strong>Run</strong>,&quot; The veteran ordered. &quot;Get to <em>that place</em>, quick. Don&#39;t worry about any of these cultists tailing you, <em>just run to safety</em>.&quot;</span>

But, the spikes stopped in place. They never reached her. One look up from behind her arms, which she used to feebly defend herself, and the answer was clear.

Ace saved her. 

Worry immediately overtook her. Then the guilt came. Ace didn&#39;t need to take the blow for her. She needed to make sure that his wounds wer-

<em>&quot;<strong>Run,</strong>&quot;</em>

Her hands froze as they attempted to reach towards Ace. She was ordered to run away. It was the smart choice to make. She was just going to be a hindrance to those two if she stayed. However, she couldn&#39;t just run in good conscience without doing <em>something</em>.

&quot;<strong>Berserker!</strong> You make sure to protect Ace no matter what, alright? I&#39;m trusting you!&quot; 

With that, she ran into the forest to the vague location Ace mentioned. It was up to those two now. She had to do her part and get away.</span>

Berserker&#39;s instincts went haywire. They were right. The ground itself attempted to skewer the trio out of their cover soon after the rumbling stopped. Berserker&#39;s quick moments allowed them to narrowly dodge the protruding spikes beneath them by retreating back away from them. 

Ace, however, took the blow for the other one. They understood why, well, one side of them did. 

Just as Ace gave his instructions to Emeilia, Emeilia gave hers to Berserker. 

&quot;<strong>Protect Ace. No. Matter. What.</strong>&quot; Berserker mimicked back in her voice. The last parts were said with a deep rumbling from within. If they wanted to protect their new purpose in life, they knew what they had to do. <em>Eliminate the enemy.</em> 

<em>Thud.</em> 

A thud, followed by soft crunching, was heard as Berserker made their first steps towards their opponent. Their eyes flared up, blazing with an ice-cold desire, as the world began to freeze around them. 

It appeared that this Spirit of Winter and Famine has accepted Banshee&#39;s request.</span>

Two bodies fell to the ground with a thud as Banshee gave her counter to the investigators and their beast. Two of her own fell. Screaming in unbearable agony. “How dare <em>you</em>. Strike down my children whilst my <em>voice</em> was caged away.” There was a shaky hesitance in her voice. 

From her assessment of the situation, at least 2 of her 10 cultists were dead. Whose to say if there were more or not who have passed away. One investigator retreating, and the one and his servant remaining. Banshee would be dealing with the servant, the murderous intent was clear. And uncomfortably familiar. 

“My children. Kill the man. For he does not wish to accept my offer of penance.” The holy woman’s voice carried with it the weight of a judgement of execution. As her hand raised up, two motes of light began to float forwards. 

Collapsing into one intensely burning point. Aimed not at Ace but the ground underneath the man’s feet. Looking to blast him away from his servant with a lovely fireball.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee was unfazed by the monster&#39;s demeanor or the frost settling around it. The beast&#39;s roars did effect her, funneled into her flawed origin and increasing the volume at which her conscious chanted her duty upon this earth. The evil spirit had committed a grievous transgression against the dead and forever tarred their memory with a heinous fate. No memorial could obscure that. But what would redeem the cultists would be to slay their monster.

Yet for such a monster, she would need a suitable weapon and very few were up to the task. The fate of one man drifted into her mind, a great warrior yet no ideal king. The strength and size of the weapon he yielded were necessary for honoring the newly dead. 

&quot;<em>Of the hallowed dead, I call upon the honored memory of a warrior king. One without fear, one without hunger, I invoke your strength to slay a great foe to all. Give unto me a totem of your greatest feats so I may sing your song once more...</em>&quot; the pale lady in cloak of green and dress of white chanted, her words laced with a magical power and her voice became many. A pillar of stone extended from the ground before her and glittered with potential. 

&quot;<strong>That which hewed three hills in a single stroke, I desire. That which sundered a hundred heads from a hundred bodies, I request. That which warded the people of Ulster, I command. SWORD OF RAINBOWS, COME FORTH AND STRIKE DOWN YOUR MADDENED FOE!</strong>&quot; All in earshot could feel the potency in her words and the pillar above all others for light began to shine through the rock, cracks creeping across its surface. 

All it took was a single touch of iron gauntlet to cause the structure to crumble and reveal a greatsword wider than most, made of dark grey basalt while the blade&#39;s edges consisted of polished obsidian glittering in the sunlight. Twin arcs of inlaid opal bounced down the face of the blade. Its earthen materials were dark yet there was no shortage of surfaces for the light to refract brilliantly.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ruth Naomi or her angel of death. One of those two had tried to impale Emeilia. They had the audacity to try and snuff out the life of a proud Genevi soldier in front of <em>his</em> eyes. Although his own blood ran across the many punctures left behind by the spikes, the only anger he could muster was directed to this impetuous and vile attempt at disrespecting both him and his country. After all, he had said this much to the rookie back at the <span class="mention">#lake-general</span>. Every soldier falling on the battlefield constitutes a blow to Geneva, no matter how small or insignificant that soldier might be.

<em>Which meant that either Ruth Naomi or her Servant had just figuratively tried to punch Geneva in the face.</em>

&quot;And how dare you lay your dirty fingers on <em>my rookie</em>,&quot; The veteran jerked, snapping the soil spikes embedded within him. &quot;Two of your boys aren&#39;t gonna cut it for payback. I&#39;m gonna need <em>more</em>.&quot;

A cherry flash emanated from the veteran&#39;s military knife, bright. He could feel the weight of the knife shifting, getting lighter and lighter as he poured more of his <em>anger</em> into it. The edge expanded forward, an invisible aura around the tip, an aura that would cut through everything and anything with ease.

Banshee’s chant earned a stare from the veteran. While the initial interaction between this Servant and Ruth Naomi initially led him to believe she was a <em>Berserker</em>, or perhaps a cocky <em>Lancer</em>, the incantations now favored the option of <em>Caster</em> more. 

The impressive greatsword that was invoked shattered that option right away. He gave up on trying to find that one’s class. She was Wendigo’s prey anyway, and he had more pressing matters to tend to.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The motes of light surrounding Ruth quickly grabbed the veteran&#39;s attention, coalescing into a fireball that was aimed directly at him. So this was her Magecraft. The tortured cultist hadn&#39;t spoken much about the ominous crown the cult leader wore, but something told him this wasn&#39;t close to the extent of its capabilities. <em>He had to play it safe for now</em>.

The veteran quickly ran to the side in an effort to dodge the impressive ball of fiery flames, running head-first into two more cultists. The powerful blast from the impact almost knocked him out of his feet, but the veteran showed no hesitation in his run. As a matter of fact, he showed <em>no emotion</em> on his face. Only a cold, unrestricted intent to kill.

The closest of the two cultists was quick to strike the veteran with an iron pipe, aiming to knock this cocky outsider out once and for all and perhaps earn a few brownie points from Mother herself.

Unfortunately for him, this was no regular outsider. As a matter of fact, on this third expedition, <em>none of them could&#39;ve been considered regular outsiders.</em> The hand holding the knife was jabbed at the cultist&#39;s weapon, effortlessly cutting through it like a hot knife through butter. The cultist hardly reacted as that same knife was brought up, then violently plunged onto the top of his head.

Once again, the knife cut through like a hot knife through butter.

The cultist immediately went limp, falling to the ground in an undignified pose. His eyes didn&#39;t even have the time to properly shut.

The second cultist enraged, running like a mad man at the veteran in an effort to silence fear and hesitation. Ace turned his way, calmly taking aim with his other hand. A bullet to the head did the trick, there was no way he could&#39;ve missed at such a distance.

They warned them that if that truly was the fabled Sword of Rainbows then they shouldn&#39;t take her lightly. Of course, that advice goes for <em>any</em> Saber they might encounter on this island. Not just this one. Or so the ▅▅▅▅ thought Banshee was a Saber.

Banshee then made her move. Her sword swung in a swift arc that sought to cleave Berserker in two. Berserker replied in kind. Dirt was kicked up from Berserker&#39;s dash forward to clash with Banshee head-on. Their speeds were both impressive, but Banshee had the advantage, forcing Berserker to react.

Berserker reached out with their right hand to halt the advance of the blade before it cleaved too deeply into their right flank. Ice crept onto the blade as Berserker held onto it. The blade managed to draw blood from Berserker&#39;s side and hand, but it became abundantly clear just how resilient this creature was, and how strong.

The other hand went straight for its target: Banshee&#39;s head. They aimed to slam the faux Saber into the earth with their monstrous strength. From there, they can give her a quick, and icy, burial.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee, the beautiful sorrowful specter made her approach to the horrid beast of famine and cold. Calling once again upon heroes of old to lend her their weapons. It seemed as if both the berserkers were going to be an even match for one another. 

All that remained was to deal with this <em>soldier</em>.  &quot;You have fangs, just like that <em>boy</em> on the beach. But we shall see how sharp they truly are.&quot; 

Ace made a quick movement avoiding the brunt of the explosion. Unfortunately for Niles Grant, their metal pipe was less than suited for dealing with this outsider. 

As the knife tore through it and found itself placed right into his cranial vault. Life and blood spilled from his body. 

Then a bullet was placed right in the forehead of Hannah Baker. Having her meet the same fate as two of her other siblings in faith. Only 2 pairs remained standing at this point. 

This one was emotionless, unlike the other who was full of passion. Full of fire. He could be considered more <em>dangerous</em> but equally exciting to <strong>consume</strong>. 

&quot;Children, Back down for now. Let Mother deal with this foolish child.&quot; Ruth spoke aloud, stepping forwards and drawing one of her daggers. &quot;You see, your <em>payback</em> isn&#39;t justified. You have taken of my flock. Your servant hath killed my children, and so have <em>you</em>. Eye for an Eye, <em>boy</em>.&quot; Ace would notice something, she did not exactly care for them as people. She cared for them as if they were her <strong>livestock. </strong> 

&quot;I could say the same for you however, a bunch of <em>foolish outsiders</em> returning to a place where they know others have perished before. Expecting a different result.&quot; Ruth shook her head before staring down Ace, eyes hungry. Arms were wide open, one hand empty the other holding her dagger. 

She took a wide breadth to avoid the battle between servants. Going to meet the soldier head on. As he would begin to smell the scent of ozone in the air. 

Three bolts of lighting then struck down right on the soldier&#39;s position!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The words and cries of humans fell away from Banshee&#39;s perception as her eyes fixed upon the frozen monster before her. The beast was far larger than she believed. It towered over her with its spindly frame fattened by rags and meals.

It reminded her of the ancient monsters of Ireland&#39;s past, the feared Fomorians, giants who ate humans and Tuatha de Danann alike. She could not permit such a being to rampage across Nirvana and she felt her spirit ignite with indignity and anger. Those who had been consumed would be avenged.

Her carving strike was stopped by the monster&#39;s impossible strength. With that indignity, Banshee stomped on the ground and more of those stone pillars shot up, slamming their blunt ends into Wendigo&#39;s spare hand. They would be sacrificed to prevent Banshee being sent to an early grave. And with that disruption, she grasped the ancient sword with both hands and heaved it clear of her body, the blade flinging frozen droplets of blood away from both of them.

With the Berserker&#39;s attention preoccupied, Banshee seemed to completely disappear from sight within the span of a single blink. 

Though her whereabouts would be revealed when she brought the sword around to careen into the back of one its thighs and sever its hamstring before being brought back around to cripple the other leg&#39;s knee.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That boy on the beach, the cult leader spoke. Did a fellow investigator initiate contact with her prior to the current? If so, <em>did they survive the encounter</em>?

A thought he hardly had time to dwell on as the glamorous woman took steps in his direction, beckoning her children to put their weapons aside. It seemed she wanted to handle this <em>by herself</em>. She wasn&#39;t nearly as cowardly as Ace would&#39;ve thought a cult leader to be, but then again, he didn&#39;t expect cultists to throw their lives away so easily with but an order either.

Her hungry stare met that of <em>lassitude</em>, locked behind two black squares that made his facial expressions hard to pin down. While her body language was relaxed, openly welcoming the soldier with open arms, he was compact and focused. In that instant, they were almost <em>polar opposites</em>.

&quot;Others have perished before,&quot; He repeated, wiping the filthy cultist blood off of his knife with his palm. &quot;<em>We are not others.</em>&quot;

As he spoke, the veteran felt a slight disturbance in the air. The hairs on his arm stood, his nose felt weirdly itchy. This sweet, pungent aroma. <em>Ozone</em>?

He didn&#39;t have time to blink. Ace rolled to the ground in a panic, relying on pure instinct rather than rational thought to guide his body to safety. Three bolts of lightning were shot from the cult leader almost at the same time, too quick for even him to try and evade. 

Two of the three lightning arcs hit the ground at either side of the veteran, a lucky consequence of his instinctual urge to dodge.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">But the veteran took the third straight on. His whole body flashed, the outline of his more than impressive frame turning blue for but a split second. Uncontrollable shaking overcame him, his body no longer his to control. Intense, <em>intense</em> pain rippled. The smell of ozone was now being progressively replaced by a slight odor of <em>brunt meat</em>.

But, should the cult leader approach the electrocuted man, she would notice a small detail. The veteran&#39;s blade had <em>vanished</em>, pushed deep into the earth. A slow, unnerving realization would dawn upon her.

The man had <em>grounded himself</em>.

Small electric arcs jumped from the man&#39;s body to the hand holding the knife, progressively disappearing into the ground. He heaved his body up, progressively finding his balance, albeit struggling at it. The forearm connected to the hand that held onto the army knife had significantly blackened, an unfortunate consequence from the electrical current that rushed to it.

A trembling hand was lifted, touching the blue jacket that usually sat on the veteran&#39;s shoulders. It glowed <em>cyan</em> for a split-second before turning back to normal. 

&quot;Genevi don&#39;t believe in an eye for an eye,&quot; The words were spoken, a lot less whiny than one would expect from a person hit by lightning. &quot;What we do believe in, though...<em>&quot;

*BAM. BAM.</em>

The two bullets left exited the magnum&#39;s barrel with astounding velocity, hitting two more of the cult leader&#39;s children before they had the chance to react. It seemed the veteran&#39;s accuracy had taken a serious hit, the hits being nowhere close to the cultist&#39;s heads. Nonetheless, the two cultists were blown away from the mere impact of the bullets hitting their chests, with little to no chance of survival.

&quot;...is in a well-done job.&quot;

It seemed the emotionless man wasn&#39;t done playing with the cult leader&#39;s livestock.</span>

Sent to their death. This Island will be a <em>slaughter house</em> for you all.” She spoke whilst shaking her head. 

While two of the arcs of electricity had went wide, the third one struck true. Leaving the man to be sent to the ground. 

Her body language remained loose, open. The dagger lazily held within the cult leader’s hand. The hungry gaze not leaving its current target. Not yet, perhaps this one had some surprise. 

There was one detail missing. The blade. ‘<em>Did this fool really fall on his own knife</em>’ The woman chuckled slightly at the thought, still approaching the enemy master. 

But there was no <em>blood</em>. 

The knife’s blade was firmly planted into the ground, providing a perfect conduction away from Ace’s body. “Oh you clever <em>bastard</em>.” The venom in her words was noticeable as they were almost spat from her mouth. 

Shakily he pulled himself from the ground but Ruth had increased her pace. But it was not fast enough to stop the next to shots to be fired.</span>

Only one pair remained standing at this point. Still awaiting orders from their mother, and doing their best to keep hidden from the fray but also staying close enough in case she called for their aide. 

“Haha, a job well done?” The motion was ridiculous to Ruth. “I admire your tenacity, <em>soldier</em>. Blindly dedicated to his superiors.” Her words carried their venom as she was now just paces away from Ace. 

Another mote then traveled directly for the Genevan, whilst The Cultist broke into a sprint. Bearing the dagger in a hope to carve it right into his abdomen. “It it were so well done, you would have already <em>killed me</em>”</span>

Berserker&#39;s eyes flared up once more as an icy explosive burst shot out from their hand when the impact crumbled the pillars. A violent torrent of frigid winds ripped a path in front of them, leaving behind a trail of frost and ice behind. 

If the impact didn&#39;t end up finishing off Banshee, an icy blast up close like that would have. Or so they thought at least. With Banshee&#39;s quick thinking, they didn&#39;t get the chance to see if they&#39;d be right or not. 

Banshee was quick. There was no getting around that fact. It was foolish to think though that she was the only one who was quick on their feet...

<em>Slash</em> 

Blood spurted out onto the frozen grass as the blade found its target. 

Upon closer inspection, Banshee saw that Berserker&#39;s blood was <em>different</em>. The core of it was blacker than most, with the edges maintaining that signature crimson colour.  There was also a malicious aura that radiated off the blood itself. Even the smell itself was off. It smelled rotten and tainted. The ground itself appeared to scream in pain once the blood started to hiss upon contact with the frost-coated grass. No visible harm was done to the grass however.

That wasn&#39;t Banshee&#39;s immediate concern though...

Just as the second blow attempted to limit Berserker&#39;s movement, the accursed spirit already turned to face their opponent with their right hand being brought down upon them. Claws primed to gouge flesh straight from bone in a vicious trade, should Banshee follow through with her attack. 

Berserker may not be in possession of a fabled blade, but their claws are more than enough to tear apart any Servant in their path.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee was not a fighter yet she found her body performing maneuvers that would rival that of the mighty  C&#250; Chulainn.. In life, she had nary lifted a blade, for that was not her duty. Her voice should have been her primary means of attack and defense. However, she could not help but wonder what the Morr&#237;gan had given her to stand her own ground against the giant beast.

It was odd, she felt both in control of her body and an observer from within, her mind in a surreal flux as the servant frame performed its own interpretation of her duty. A rare rush of dopamine flushed her head with satisfaction as Berserker&#39;s hamstring was severed though it would be replaced just as quick as she witnessed the beast&#39;s blood stain and sizzle against the grass. Her throat tightened as the repulsive smell reached her nose and her undead heart skipped a beat.

Whatever her foe was, its blood was irreparably tainted, a liquid curse that would bring nothing but pain and delirium. Her mind drifted, her focus lapsed and her armored fingers twitched, a sympathetic pain shooting up from her finger tips and addling her mind with memories she wished to suppress. She did not want to drown, drown and suffocate underneath that baleful slime again...

Without thought, she channeled all her strength into a crippling strike against Wendigo&#39;s knee, bringing him to kneel. Yes to kneel would bring it down and let her execute this monstrosity. This was her duty ordained by fate. It must fall, regardless of the cost on her body.

Looking up, he spotted the ruthless cult leader breaking a sprint in his direction, yet another mote of light following closely behind. It seemed she wanted to take this fight to... close quarters?

<em>What was she, a fucking clown?</em>

Just a glance at the difference in their builds was enough to tell how stupid of an idea that was. There was no way a petite, slender woman like Ruth Naomi would be able to hold a candle to a big, hardened man like Ace. And, unfortunately, even a dagger wouldn&#39;t be enough to tip the scales in her favour.

&quot;Kill you?&quot; He repeated, calmly putting the oversized rounds inside the empty magnum chambers. &quot;No, no. You don&#39;t get it—&quot;

<em>STAB!</em>

Before he could finish his sentence, the dagger was plunged into the man&#39;s abdomen.</span>

This confidence was only bolstered as her dagger found itself within Ace’s abdomen. “I don’t get what, <em>boy</em>?” The cult leader whispered as she drug Ace’s ear down to be level with her head. 

There was a pause as a realization dawned upon the woman. Why he was able to survive banshee&#39;s spikes. 

<strong>The soldier had Kevlar on.</strong>

Her confident smile turned into a frustrated expression, as she brought her knee up to knee the man in the Geneva jewels. 

The mote which remained floating lazily behind then proceeded its advance towards Ace and Ruth, increasing its velocity going to strike the pair!</span>

The blow struck their knee. The blade dug deep. More blood escaped the cursed vessel that was Berserker&#39;s body. But, the blade was stopped by what could only be the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame itself. It was either that or their bones were more denser than anticipated. The damage was still dealt to this monstrosity. 

Pain shot up through their body. It screamed at them but that only fueled their bloodlust. <em>Nothing</em> fought back like this before since their summoning. It was <strong>exhilarating</strong>. Berserker truly felt as if they were back in the Hunt once more.

&quot;<strong>▂▂▃▃▅▅!</strong>&quot;

To repay the enemy Servant for such a thrill, their claws dug into Banshee&#39;s right shoulder. They tore through flesh and bone as their claws raked across her chest in a diagonally path. If Banshee didn&#39;t happen to be a Servant, they surely would have been bisected in a raw display of carnage.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her first strikes proved the monster could bleed and now with a strike to the frame itself, Banshee knew it could feel pain. Not only did its legs quiver with a fraction of the pain it had inflicted on its victims but it gave a beastly howl. Pain would cloud its thoughts, close its vision to everything but her. The crowning blow was surely close...

Banshee saw a crow of black fly towards her only for it to dig and claw its way into her shoulder, the fabric of her dress and the pale skin of her body posing no resistance. She could felt her body shake as it sought to saw through her bones, plucking bundles of muscle and strings of nerves before shredding all in four ragged crimson canyons carved crosswise across her body. Her modest dress of white sagged and quickly blossomed into many roses of different shades of the same striking color.

The blood ran down yet unlike Wendigo&#39;s blood, did not linger on the ground but rather merging with it like a raindrop does with the surface of a lake. The ghostly woman instinctively took a leap back but the Wendigo would not hear howls of pain or cries of pleasure, no limbs trembling from blood loss nor a face contorted by pain. Only her own frustration with the devilish beast before her could be read. She stared at the berserker for a second, her eyes trying to peer beyond that skeletal mask, to understand its nature and perhaps its past fate with how intently her reddened eyes gleamed.

The wind blew and dust rolled off her wound, as if she was already fading. Another blink and it seemed she had been caught by the wind in her entirety. The ground rippled underneath the berserker, trembling every direction before trailing off deeper into the forest. Then, a moment of silence as the wind gradually faded. If he dared to hunt the pale lady, it seemed now it was the beast&#39;s turn to take a risk.

They stared at Banshee with their unblinking blue dots. While her eyes may show frustration in them, the beast of famine&#39;s eyes remained emotionless. The slight tilt of their head told her everything she needed to know however: <em>They were confused</em>. 

The mystery behind their eyes was murky. The moment something could be gleamed from them it was gone the next. More like, it was forced away by an unknown force. 

The standoff between the two Berserkers didn&#39;t last long as Banshee appeared to fade back into the forest with the wind. If they wanted a hunt, then they will receive a hunt. Berserker didn&#39;t intent on being the hunted though. They preferred to be the one hunting.

&quot;▃▃▃▂▂...?&quot;

Berserker felt their balance to be off. One step was all it took to force them to take a knee. Ah. That&#39;s why. Berserker glanced at the wounds Banshee inflicted thus far. She was craftier than they previously thought. 

<em>Crunch</em>

Another step was taken. This time Berserker was forcing their legs to move despite the damages. This resulted in heavier impacts on the ground, but they were determined to finish the Hunt. Thankfully their high Endurance meant those wounds weren&#39;t severely crippling, only partially, but they did hinder their movement by a significant margin.

They continued their march after their opponent into the forest without any fear towards the specter. There was only so many times she could afford to trade blows after all...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While the would-be mortal blow was miraculously stopped, a deep push was felt onto the man&#39;s abdomens. It seemed as, even after being stopped by Kevlar, the cult leader didn’t completely stop, her sharp dagger grinding against his bowels stills. This couldn’t help but make him <em>slightly uncomfortable</em>.

&quot;You won&#39;t die, Ruth Naomi,&quot; The soldier continued his previous speech, ignoring the pressure on his stomach. &quot;Once I get my hands on you, trust me, you won&#39;t die <em>for quite a while</em>.&quot;

As he talked, a knee was brought to the man&#39;s private parts, an attempt to shut the cocky soldier&#39;s mouth at long last, which was met with...

An audible bonk and a hurt knee on Ruth&#39;s side. It turned out the area that had been aimed at was unnaturally hard. Once again, the soldier&#39;s previous words would echo in the cult leader&#39;s head. The one thing the Genevi truly believed in was a <em>thorough job</em>. It seemed like that statement also applied to their equipment: <em>Groin protection</em>.

<em>Just how many layers of protection did the soldier harbor behind his fancy suit?</em>

The man&#39;s undershirt, what Ruth guessed to be the hidden layer of Kevlar, glowed yellow from under his clothes. His right hand snatched the cult leader&#39;s, a firm grip enveloping her deceptively youthful hand, keeping the one that held onto the dagger as close to his chest as possible. He wouldn&#39;t let her leave his side, it seemed. The emotionless soldier clearly had no notion of personal space.</span>

Her knee then went for the felling blow, before a resounding <em>BONK</em> was heard. 

Groin Protection. Truly these Genevans were through in all aspects of their work. From missions to armor. This could only lead to further frustrations. Just how much more protection did this soldier have. 

In anycase Ruth attempted to draw the dagger free from his abdomen, only to have a firm grip placed upon her hand. Keeping the woman and the man side by side, in a sadistic tango. &quot;Tell me your name, <em>boy</em>. I prefer to know the name of my <em>dance partners</em>.&quot; From how close Ace and Ruth were he could see that ravenous hunger, focused solely on his being.</span>

A void, emotionless stare hidden between two black squares came to meet the ravenous eyes of the cultist broad. He took a quick breath, his lips forcefully closed and his jaw clenched.

At that instant, as the pair locked eyes and the mote of light accelerated once more, Ruth understood. The yellow-glowing Kevlar, the sudden closeness that the veteran imposed onto her—both actions had been done with a clear goal in mind.

<em>So both would be engulfed in the mote&#39;s destructive power.</em></span>

The light then engulfed both Soldier, and Cult Leader. Their eyes becoming blind in that moment. 

This was the first time that Ruth had felt the magnificent wrath of her glorious crown. As it struck the pair letting out its fiery wrath upon both. Burning away a portion of The Holy garbs, and leaving swaths of burnt skin in its wake. 

in this moment of pain, the cultist&#39;s brain was temporarily scrambled. Yet, not long enough for the <strong>hunger</strong> to worm itself into this dangerous dance. &quot;I always loved a man in <em>uniform</em>, Mr. Colin.&quot; 

Once the light and the flames cleared, Ruth&#39;s eyes snapped right back onto Ace&#39;s. Pulling herself deeper into the man&#39;s hold, looking to drive her dagger deeper and deeper within his abdomen. Whilst her free hand shot up and slapped the soldier across the face, leaving nothing but a squirming sensation and a numbness in the wake.</span>

It groaned and her innards shifted around from the deep gash, dust trailing behind her as the blood faded back into its component parts. It mattered little, she could still run, she could still fight. She was a being of earth, the necessary repairs could be made at a later date. Her duty was far more important.

The forest stretched out ahead of the Wendigo and small tremors ran ahead of it, teasing the cannibalistic hunter forward. Scraps of torn fabric carried her scent, one of a freshly buried grave with a hint of somber incense. The trail ran strong.

Arrows of white-speckled diorite whistled through the undergrowth, some splintering the trunks of nascent trees and others shearing their canopies before ramming their stony shafts against the berserker&#39;s scrawny, rotten frame. They came first from his right, then left and then center....

The volley came and went like a downpour before the Banshee dashed out and slashed at his arm with dizzying speed, arriving like a lightingbolt and leaving just as quick, a wail announcing her presence like thunder. She would do this multiple times in succession, hoping to overwhelm the hunter with her storm of strikes and leave its arms beyond use...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Thrill of the Hunt stabbed and twisted Berserker&#39;s bottomless stomach despite having just feasted awhile ago. This caused their movements to become more frantic as they grabbed the trees to propel themselves along faster. 

Their target was near. Their peculiar scent proved that they were. But, just as they thought they caught up to them, the sounds of whistling objects made their way towards Berserker. 

Their arms were brought up to shield themselves against the two barrages of stone arrows on their left and right sides. Some skated across Berserker&#39;s body while the others made cuts that caused more of their tainted blood to splatter onto the ground. They managed to block the majority of the arrows with little more than scratches to show for it. That is, until the ones that came from the front were launched at them. Those ones stuck into Berserker&#39;s chest. A pained grunt came from the creature as they stumbled back before they broke them with a single wipe of their hand. 

Banshee didn&#39;t intend to give Berserker any breathing space as a flurry of attacks came rushing at them from all sides. They had no choice but to put them their defences to withstand the storm that came at them in full force. 

The slashes covered their arms in gashes that bled onto the blade and covered the area with their blood. 

Berserker&#39;s eyes scanned Banshee&#39;s movements until...

Their right arm fell limp.

A strike must have dealt a blow that crippled it. This just meant that Banshee only needed to cripple one more limp. They would be defenceless if they succeeded. However, before the final slash could be made, Berserker laid a trap for her. After figuring out Banshee&#39;s intentions, Berserker intentionally made their arm fall limp so she would target the other arm, allowing Berserker a chance to run Banshee through with the supposedly disabled arm.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The recoil of the explosion made the veteran wince in pain. Even though he had thoroughly prepared himself for the blast, having reinforced his Kevlar with <em>Adfectus Missus</em> beforehand, the force contained in this little mote of light still managed to surprise him. His slightly burnt skin was damaged even further, the pain slowly getting to a point where it was no longer forgettable. Between this and the bolt of lightning, it seemed this fight was shaping up to be a lot harder than expected, and the grinding from the knife against his bowels didn&#39;t make it any easier. To think that a mere cultist broad was capable of such fighting prowess, Nirvana sure was full of surprises.

&quot;And I always loved a <em>docile woman</em>,&quot; He retorted, pushing her dagger-holding hand back. &quot;Too bad you decided to be a pain in my ass.&quot;

Then a slap. First, Ace was surprised. Shortly after came confusion.

And finally, anxiety.

The sickening numbness in his face, as if his facial muscles were forcibly put to sleep while the rest of his body winced in pain, couldn&#39;t help but strike the man with concern. She couldn&#39;t be allowed to roam freely in his vicinity, not after that hit. <em>He could no longer afford to go easy on her</em>.

Gripping her hand with bone-shattering force, the veteran pulled her even closer to him, then forcibly made her turn once around herself. Was this a continuation of their masochistic dance, perhaps?

<em>Toss!</em>

The cult leader was sent flying high in the air, similarly to how a dancer would toss her partner, except a <em>lot more violently</em>. The power of his left <em>Enchanted Glove</em> had been unleashed in that moment, giving the already-huge man even more power in his toss and securing a throw that would put any professional baseball player to shame. He even wondered if the broad&#39;s shoulder was still resting in her socket after that.

In that brief moment of respite, the veteran cocked his gun, looked around him until he spotted his prey.

Two bullets were shot, the accompanying holes on the two cultists not far from their heads. It seemed his accuracy was slowly but surely recovering.

Yet, at the same time, he could also feel his Od leaking out, as if sucked through a straw. Not because of his <em>Enchanted Gloves</em>, but because of something he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on. 

<em>So you are offering to let me feed off of you</em>, the words echoed in his head. Coincidentally, he stared at the cult leader.

<em>Did the broad somehow cause that leakage</em>?</span>

As the dagger was being kept from tickling the man&#39;s internal organs. &quot;But being a pain in the ass, most definitely is more <em>fun~</em>&quot; 

The mana drain was now placed. But as they were still so intimately close and touching, the drain remained. Ace had a response to it being placed. 

His large hands gripped down upon her arm. Easily engulfing the woman&#39;s arm, and placing a crushing pain upon her arm. Before forcibly turning her around, with a satisfying <em>pop</em> as the cult leader&#39;s arm was forcibly dislocated. 

She could only cry in response to this movement. Both a dislocation and a fracture. Two extreme pains, as Ruth was sent spinning through the air. 

A ballerina without a partner to catch her diminutive frame. 

James McFay and Nancy Heart suffered the fate of their 8 brothers and sisters. One bullet for each and now their lives were gone. Lost in the name of their holy mother. 

The Holy Mother then landed. Crashing into a tree, her arm broken and dislocated. Barely holding onto her consciousness. &quot;<em>Ara... Ara... You do know how to excite...</em>&quot; Weakly her voice spoke, eyes trying to remain on Ace. Who was just paces away. 

Forcibly the woman attempted to drag herself forwards. Using her still functional arm. Just trying to reach Ace once again.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee&#39;s systematic assault on the cannibalistic spirit was one of attrition and already it had begun to bear fruit.  Its chest was dotted with arrows and its foul blood cursed the area with its presence. Each swing planned to throw the blood away from both berserkers but the gory work would invetiably lead to the pale lady being stained. Thus it was a race against the clock until she would fall under its influence. Her next step had to be weighed carefully, musing over it with each strike. 

And then an opportunity presented itself, Berserker&#39;s right arm fell to her merciless onslaught. Another crippled limb, another step closer to decapitation and the spirit&#39;s just demise. Her mind began to run with potential avenues. The knowledge blessed onto her by memory of those she mourned advised due course for her attritional approach. They were facing a wily spirit and it was likely one who played tricks. The Will of her divine master, the lady Morr&#237;gan, compelled her to strike terror in the heart of the fiend, to make it pay for every life it took for even beasts could feel fear...

Her mind, having never been one for combat before, her duty always been to mourn the dead, found itself in deadlock on what to do. There had to be some other factor within her that would tip the scales in favor of one course or another. Indecision was not something she was used to, her duty had always driven her forward but now the fractions clashed. Her mind indecisive, her heart made the decision for her when she heard the crack of thunder and felt a familiar life creep closer to death....

Ignoring all caution, Banshee brought up her stony blade and dashed forward, her feet pounding into the ground and sending stony forks up to obstruct the beast&#39;s arms while she moved to stick the hog. Putting all her strength behind the hefty claymore, the ghost of stone and sorrow lunged and buried the sword deep into the beast&#39;s chest and sought to bring it to the ground where its rest lie...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The decision was made. Banshee sought to ram her blade through the beast, aiming to finish it off and allow the poor souls it tore apart to rest. However, even the fabled hunter of Berserker himself couldn&#39;t put the beast down easily, let alone keep it down. Something Banshee will soon come to learn herself in these coming moments. 

The opportunity was there. A gap in Berserker&#39;s defences which allowed a deathblow to be struck. Banshee&#39;s heroic sword of old pierced into Berserker. Blood spurted from the wound onto Banshee&#39;s face. The task was completed.

There was a problem however: The beast was still stood tall. No golden flakes came off their body. The blow wasn&#39;t as decisive as she previously thought.

This curious phenomenon was solved simply by examining Banshee&#39;s weapon. Berserker held onto the blade with their hand once more to prevent the claymore from reaching something critical. The difference in their strength allowed them to halt the blade enough to pull this off. 

There was something else. Berserker&#39;s previously &#39;disabled&#39; arm managed to grasp onto her forearm. By taking the attack, they were able to grab onto her the moment they were within reach. The grip tightened around her earthly flesh. Frost began to creep onto her arm. The pressure locked her into place unless she chose to lose her arm in the process. 

Unfortunately, Banshee did not have the luxury of allowing such thoughts to run through her mind...

A deep rumble erupted deep within Banshee. She was exposed to Berserker&#39;s blood. Now, their skill, <strong>Curse of the Wendigo</strong>, ran rampant throughout their body. The corrupting madness that Berserker was known for inflicting upon others met its first victim. Banshee had her own type of madness. This meant <strong>Curse of the Wendigo</strong> caused her personal madness to go haywire and move up a Rank.

&quot;<strong>Put your tortured soul to rest, Spirit.</strong>&quot;

As the last bits of sanity left her, she heard her own voice spoken back to her. With those final words spoken, Berserker used his grip on her arm to lift her up and over their head to slam against the ground behind them with all their strength. Their grip held tight in order to repeat the process until their Spirit Core could take no more or their S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame crumbled, whichever would come first.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee&#39;s nerves were deadened due to her unique condition yet she found her body shivering as her pale white face became stained with the freezing blood of the Wendigo. Her mind began to race, the voices of the past spirits and the conscience of her duty began to meld together in a maddening cacophony of voices. She pushed harder on her blade to kill the berserker before her yet no matter what she did, the blade would not move. It may have pierced the beast&#39;s chest yet its hands had once again prevented a killing blow. 

She tried throwing her body against the hilt only to find frost creeping up her arm and her vision beginning to take on a reddish tint. The beast&#39;s face began to twist and reshape itself before her eyes. She would not see what form it would ultimately take as she heard her own voice brought against her and accusing her of being that which she sought to destroy. Her grasp on reality slipped and her vision went black.

Banshee&#39;s head slammed against the ground, breaking her nose and bruising her face. The bell pealed once. Berserker slammed it down again, gouging the ground as her head dug into the earth. The bell pealed twice. Banshee&#39;s vision returned for an instant, everything dyed the color of blood before turning black again and the beast could feel bone give way to its strength. The bell pealed thrice.

The Wendigo could feel the berserker in its hands grow limp and take on the same temperature of its frost. What it might not notice was that the dirt displaced by the slams seemingly disappeared entirely. The thought of killing its prey was too enticing.

Yet all would be made evident when a sickening crack came from Banshee&#39;s frozen arm followed by a sound like tearing canvas. Looking down, the Wendigo would notice that while it still held the frozen arm, Banshee had escaped its grasp with one arm completely lacking flesh, the exposed muscle sheared and oozing a dark carmine ichor.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her face was webbed with weeping fractures, her broken nose pushed into the nasal cavity and her skin pulled taut over shattered bone. Her eyes had sunken deep within their sockets, red beady orbs flickering in their place. Ugly shades of violet, ochre, amber and crimson stained the skin of her intact arm and mottled the muscle of the other, both radiating outward from her iron gauntlets now caked with rust, blood and dirt.

She panted heavily, those hateful orbs drilling into the Berserker’s though  she no longer saw the beast. Instead it was a hellish mixture of the Fomorian giants her master had once slain and an unnamed Irish musician that provoked an enmity deep within her gut. 

“<strong>Sing no longer, servant of Manann! Drown… Drown… DROWN!</strong>” She screamed, her voice no longer one unified voice but a rancous chorus that tripped and yelled over each other’s words, resulting in a disorienting flange. Hate filled her mind to the brim, wrath burned every muscle in her body, envy and disgust poisoned her soul. All these soaked into the air she did not need within her lungs and were expelled with a piercing scream that held the same force as the largest foghorns. All nearby would be deafened by this wail and even the Wendigo’s ears would bleed from the audial assault. 

Without sword, without a weapon but her gauntlets, the vengeful specter leapt at her fellow berserker and sought to bite and tear away at her foe, using her speed to clamber onto the beast and position herself on its back and attempt to dig into its neck and expose its esophagus to the world.

The ruthless Berserker tossed around Banshee like a ragdoll. They didn&#39;t care how they landed, just that they did end up striking the ground.

Each sound fueled Berserker&#39;s desire to hear more. Though there was one sound that they soon heard that wasn&#39;t made by them. It was the sickening noise of flesh being tore off the body. This made them stop and examine what they had in their hand. The skin that once coated Banshee&#39;s arm now hung limp on their grasp. 

Berserker discarded it without a second thought.

Neither of them looked pleasant to the eye. One needed a strong stomach to even gaze upon either of them. That or they&#39;d need to be used to such gore. 

Then came the scream. 

The force of it stunned Berserker long enough to stop them in their tracks to launch a counterattack. Before they could recover, Banshee was already upon their back. She clawed with her gauntlets and attempted to rip flesh apart with their teeth. 

&quot;<strong>▂▂▃▃▅▅▅▅ーーー！</strong>&quot;

A howl erupted from Berserker as they attempted to throw Banshee off. Berserker refused to remain still and give Banshee an easy feast. A hand reached back to protect their neck while they ran and slammed their back into trees, causing some of the weaker ones to come crashing down, in an attempt to peel Banshee off. They shook their head side to side, hoping to gore Banshee with their antlers as they ran through the forest. 

To the their Masters, it sounded as if a natural disaster was making their way towards them, but both of them knew the truth.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">No longer was the thunder distant for the Banshee, for each step the Wendigo took and each time they careened against rock and tree, it roared in her ears. Her undead heart beat with a tempo it had never dared before. And above it all was the duet of the beastly base and the wailing soprano. A symphony of madness it was and every beat, it demanded more attention from the dueling pair of masters.

Banshee for her part yelled ancient obscenities at her partner as they performed their dance of blood and gore, demanding his death all the while. First she dug into his throat, only to hold on tightly as he charged. Discouraged, she struck lower, clawing away at stuck arrows and the deep stab wound, causing Wendigo&#39;s blood to fall like rain.

But the beast&#39;s body was as inflexible as the duty that bound her container. The word stuck on her tongue, staining it with a wretched flavor and sending tremors down her body. That which kept her from living her own life so so long ago, forcing her to always live on the margins, to always give and mourn, nothing to be given back but fearful tales passed down by parents to scare their youth... she would deprive Wendigo of any similar freedom at whatever cost it took. Her body could give all that was needed. 

Her mind free of reason and full of spite sprung into action, iron gauntlets grasping hold of Berserker&#39;s antlers and pulling from one side to the next, forcing his unwieldy stature into trees and causing him to pin his antlers even as they lashed at Banshee&#39;s ruined, weeping body. One collision yielded the chance she so desired...

With the antler pinned between tree and gauntlet, she slammed her foot down at the base. Beast, Banshee and tree all shook from the tremor but again she brought her heel down. Again and again she went, feeling something break in her foot but it didn&#39;t matter. Blood smeared the antler, didn&#39;t matter. All she wanted was for it to snap like a branch and with her final kick it did.</span>

A curved, malicious piece with many talons branched like a portion of a tree. All perfect for making the one who brought her voice against herself pay, to deprive it of its freedom, of its life. But she would not mourn its death. No, she would dance on its corpse, bathe in its foul blood and laugh as its soul sunk in damnation. With a sickly smile, she grasped at Wendigo&#39;s mask and rammed the antler into the eye socket.

In and out it went, each time giving a different tremor of resistance as it gouged away at flesh and muscle. It felt... pleasurable to the mourner of the dead and cackled for once in her life. It was a sound just as terrible as her assault on the Berserker&#39;s head but not because of the action it described but the intention it revealed. She laughed through the pain as blood gushed onto her own skin and the pair came ever closer to revealing the horror to their masters...

You know, maybe you should drink milk instead of feeding on your folks&#39; life force.&quot;

The feeble state in which the cult leader was left felt good to look at. Ace was reminded of his one-on-one date with dear Henry, with him in a position of power whilst a person was stuck to the ground, barely even able to crawl. Ace just knew that the cultist broad was just shy of falling to her demise, a simple bullet between her eyes would do the trick. Even in his hurt and exhausted state, he was confident he wouldn&#39;t miss the shot if they were <em>this close</em>. 

&quot;Now that it&#39;s just the two of us,&quot; He said, taking a few measured steps towards his opponent. &quot;Maybe we can start having fun? Think I’ll start by breaking your other arm first, just to be safe. Then I&#39;ll work my way down slowly and carefully, <em>thoroughly</em> making sure you don&#39;t pose a threat to anyone anymore.

&quot;As I already stated before,&quot; A gun trailed at the cult leader, the soldier hushed. &quot;<em>You won&#39;t die for quite a while.</em>&quot;

But true to his comment from earlier, he still wanted her to <em>suffer</em>. To no longer be a threat to others that came to this island. 

This however gave her the chance to get within reach. “I agree… I won’t be dying for <em>quite some time</em>…” Ruth’s still functioning arm then reached out, touching Ace’s ankle. 

Something then began to change, the numbness disappeared from his face. 

But there was a more pressing situation now, as the two servants barreled towards the masters. 

A testament to the bloodshed that Berserkers are capable of.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Abruptly, the soldier perked up. The distant noise of battle he had unconsciously blocked out suddenly invaded his mind, their perpetrators quickly approaching his location along with violent steps and gory screams. The sounds of trees breaking apart, forcefully uprooted from their beds by an unimaginable force. Fleshy thuds that wouldn&#39;t stop, then a dramatic breaking sound. The man took a few steps back, looking out towards the thick forest that spread around him. The trail of ruined trees quickly pulled his attention, following it to find...

<em>A bloody Banshee and an even bloodier Wendigo.</em>

A significant distance from there stood the two Masters&#39; frenzied Servants, lashing at each-other with a violence that would put even the cruelest of soldiers to shame.

A crippled arm, stone arrows piercing Wendigo&#39;s chest and a huge diagonal cut across its torso: Wendigo&#39;s tainted blood endlessly sprayed around the two Berserkers, coating both them and their surroundings in morbid colors. Most shocking of all was the antler the beast <em>lacked</em>, that same antler held onto by the cultist bitch&#39;s Servant, the same that stuck onto Wendigo&#39;s back. Banshee&#39;s face was bruised and bloody, its form distorted by the countless contacts it had made with the ground. Yet, despite the injuries and the flesh-torn arm, the spirit kept stabbing the cannibalistic beast with its own antler again and again..

This morbid, gore spectacle was overwhelming, <em>unbearable</em> to look at directly.

Battles between Berserkers often devolved into bloody slugfests, and this fight was no exception. They were like two rabid dogs violently biting one-another, each dog uncaring to his own injuries, wanting nothing more than to hurt the other as much as possible. No honor, no grace. <em>Just sadism and madness.</em></span>

Those two words were the only ones that could describe the gruesome dance the two Berserkers were stuck together doing until one of them falls to the other. Bones crunched and it was unclear which Servant the sounds came from or who caused them. Flesh hung from their bodies from their brutal onslaught of attacks. 

Berserker&#39;s attempts to tear Banshee off of them were made with failure. Banshee was tenacious to say the least. She valued ending their life rather than preserving her own. No matter what damage she sustained from hanging on further, it was clear that it wasn&#39;t going to be enough until the deed was done. 

&quot;<strong>▅▬▬▃▃▃▬▬▅ーーー ———!</strong>&quot;

A horrid scream escaped the tortured lungs of Berserker once they felt their eye gouged out by their antler out of all things. It dug deep. The sounds of gore told Banshee that she found a soft sound in Berserker&#39;s defences. Finally. A means to put this accursed thing to rest.

The skull cracked and exposed more of what was underneath to the world. However, the void within kept the light from shining through. She needed to pry deeper to expose the beast within.

Berserker managed to grasp onto her wrist. With that, she immediately felt the inertia upon her body as Berserker flung her off their body and towards the group of Masters. Berserker couldn&#39;t care less how they flung her or whether or not her arm was made to be swung in such a way either. They just wanted them off.

Once Berserker was freed from Banshee, they fell down onto one knee. Raspy breathing could be heard as their breath was visible from the cold temperature that surrounded them. Their sights were fixated upon their opponent. The broken eye socket had more of Berserker&#39;s eye staring at them rather than a simple dot. A full pupil was visible. Though it remained just as unblinking as the other. Besides the flame that burned more intensely, the bits and of pieces of Berserker&#39;s eye that Banshee managed to gore out hung by a thread from their mask. While she managed to tear out the eye of the beast, it wasn&#39;t the same one that stared back at her...</span>

Her broken arm no longer swinging lazily from her side. The Holy Mother now held a gaze which fight right in with the two Berserkers. Ravenous, ready to <strong>feast</strong> upon Ace. 

&quot;Thank you for giving of <em>yourself</em> to me, Soldier. You are not so different from my cultists. The ideal of Geneva and The Holy Mother are so similar. But your superiors hold little vested interest in your survival, unlike my wishing for my flock to remain alive and healthy to <strong>feast upon</strong>. For your killing of them, I now see that you will make an excellent feast. Tenfold of those you have mercilessly slain. Ace Colin. Allow me to unveil my origin, I will <strong>consume. LEAVE NOTHING OF YOUR PITIFUL BODY BEHIND. EAT MY FILL OF YOUR ESSENCE THEN GOURGE FURTHER AND FURTHER. LEAVING NOT A SCRAP BEHIND. DIE AND BE CONSUMED INTO OBLIVION</strong>&quot; 

Electricity sparked within Ruth&#39;s palm as she lunged right for the man&#39;s throat. Three Bolts arcing from it&#39;s center, just before Banshee was sent flying right towards Ruth. 

A collision was made between master and servant, sending them both sprawling along the forest floor. The Cult leader now trapped beneath the dead weight of her berserker. The specter itself was now barely holding herself together. 

The thing that was Ruth Naomi, still wanted to crawl free. Still wanted to <strong>CONSUME Ace Colin.</strong> But could not at this moment.</span>

She showered in its blood, the warmth greedily being lapped up her own cold and jealous frame. Its howls were music to her twisted mind. A few more strokes were all she wanted, all she <em>needed</em> but when did Banshee ever get what she desired? 

The Wendigo, in desperation, snapped her wristed and flung the pale wraith off his back  and sent it colliding with Ruth. It wailed, clawing at the air as it was so suddenly deprived of its victory. The berserker would hit Ruth not as a limp body but rather a dense boulder that would break bone and limb. Were it not for the body&#39;s automatic response by commanding the ground beneath them to reduce to a muddy sand, that was surely the fate that would have awaited Ruth and the beast within her. 

For a moment, Banshee&#39;s body seemed to rest on top of Ruth, dust flaking and blood rolling off her body and onto her master. Shallow breaths alongside a sucking sound emanating from her chest sought to blot out Ruth&#39;s internal thoughts and her body weighed heavily on her. But that changed when Banshee felt the warmth rising from underneath her. What stupid soul had gotten in her way-

Banshee&#39;s heart froze as her unsteady movements finally brought her to her feet and see who she had landed on top of. She felt like crying like she never had before. How could fortune be so cruel as to cause her to harm and nearly suffocate <em>them</em>? Of all people, why <em>them</em>? Her gauntlet twisted itself into a tight fist threatening to puncture itself as her mind entertained the thought of ripping out her own heart and offering it as an apology. But then again, that would end the moment she had long, long been waiting for...</span>

YOU&#39;RE HERE AT LASSSSST...</strong>&quot; the wraith&#39;s voice rasped, all dissonance from before silenced as her lips parted into a wide grin. Several of her teeth were chipped in jagged ridges and blood-soaked drool pooled at the edges. Yet any of the grievous wounds across her body were not what drew Ruth or her origin&#39;s attention.  No, it was the hunger in her unblinking little red orbs, one that had been denied its desires for centuries. And now that longing could finally be satiated.

&quot;<strong>The servants of Manannan seek to tear usss apart. I will tear them apart for you...then... then... then we run... where fate can not separate ussss...</strong>&quot; Banshee hissed, her body leaning over the huddled form of Ruth and her chest heaving with an excitement Ruth had never seen from her servant before. The grin became increasingly perverted while her saliva grew as thick as mud and changed to a dark, ruddy red that stained her skin as it rolled down and sizzled upon contact with the ground. 

Ace and Wendigo would then be able to view the full delusion of the Banshee as she turned back to face them, a delirious fusion of ecstasy and rage distort her normal somber composure. From every opening, that mud-like substance seemed to ooze and pool around her feet.

“<strong>YOU WILL NOT TAKE HIM FROM ME! NOT THIS TIME! SO… DROWN! DROWN! DROWN!</strong>” She yelled, the discordant voices returning and both master and servant could feel the power embedded in her words.

 While it would make Ace feel uneasy and light-headed, Wendigo could feel her threats flow into his frame and sink down towards the core. He would not hear her condemn him to a watery death. Instead, it was a word that was quickly coming to describe the rumbling pangs that disturbed his stomach to a degree he had not felt since summoning. It was debilitating in its severity and already he could feel his innards beginning to digest themselves for sustenance.</span>

It would start as a little bump but wrap more and more of the earth in its insanity, growing into a wave of dirt, stone and Banshee’s own festering blood. If the two did not move quickly, they would be condemned to the death the enemy berserker wanted so much for them to suffer.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Too captivated by the Berserkers&#39; showdown, Ace paid no mind to the groveling cultist at his feet. He didn&#39;t come to his senses until the mention of Geneva escaped the woman&#39;s lips.

Turning his head, the sight he was greeted by took him aback. It seemed her arm had miraculously recovered and, instead of crouching on the ground, the Holy Mother now stood fully on her two feet.

Not only that, but the uncomfortable feeling on his face previously left by the cultist&#39;s slap had suddenly vanished. At the same time, a wave of exhaustion washed over the soldier, the numbness on his face spreading to the rest of his body like wildfire. His Od uncontrollably leaked out of him, depriving him of his oh-so precious energy, eventually leading the soldier to fall on one knee. He felt <em>drained</em>, just shy of falling into a deep slumber. The circuits in his gut worked overtime to absorb the atmospheric Mana in his surroundings, but it did little to lessen the load of the drain.

The origin of the Holy Mother unveiled, shivers were sent across the man&#39;s body. Somehow, even he could feel her repulsing, everlasting need to <em>consume</em>.

It was so sudden, so unilateral that there was nothing he could do to fight the sleepiness that knocked on his door. At this point, the only thing keeping him awake were the various injuries he sustained in the battle against the Holy Mother.

...or were they. Was the hurt really the thing that kept him from falling in battle?

<em>No.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The unholy, putrid, <em>gut-wrenching</em> words of the cultist bitch ignited a fire within the veteran. The audacity of even entertaining the thought of attempting to compare <em>glorious Geneva</em> to the likes of her sect—the soldier felt no greater anger nor shame in the entire encounter. The vein on his temple threatened to burst in response to these strong feelings of him, every fiber of his being contracting in an effort to resist the anger. With such pure rage fueling him, the soldier wouldn&#39;t fall to the exhaustion yet.

With such rage, he wouldn&#39;t fall <em>even if he had both arms and legs separated from his torso</em>.

The motion that the Cult Leader went through next felt familiar, and the smell of ozone told no lies about her next move. Once more, the veteran&#39;s body naturally moved out of harm&#39;s way, instincts taking over for a split second. Once more, only two of the three bolts had been dodged. The veteran could only watch as the third made its way to him, making full-contact with his body. This time though, <em>there was no knife to redirect the electrical current away from him</em>.

<em>CRASH!!!</em>

A flying Banshee came to meet her Master in a violent shock, knocking the two out of the veteran&#39;s vicinity. 

The frenzied Banshee was quick to scream her pains away, an incoherent mess in the form of words. Then came her devastating attack, the ground liquefying under her will and engulfing the forest in front of her, the waves so high they completely hid the veteran&#39;s figure beneath.

<em>Were their coordinated efforts enough to put the soldier down?</em></span>

There wasn&#39;t much time to register that they were grabbed before they were hoisted up into the air. Ace suddenly stopped in midair. There he hung as the wave of dirt swallowed up anything unfortunate enough to be in their path.

One look was all he needed to see what just happened. It was Berserker. They knew that they couldn&#39;t escape Banshee&#39;s attack on foot in their condition, let alone do that while saving Ace as well in the process. This left them with one option: <em>Climb</em>. 

Like a primate, Berserker clung onto Ace and leapt up a tree to safety to avoid certain death below. Berserker&#39;s claws were more than enough to bore into the trees to climb.

&quot;<strong>Berserker protect Ace. Ace is safe.</strong>&quot;

Emeilia&#39;s words were spoken in-between raspy breaths for air. Berserker could have easily left Ace for dead, but it appeared that the beast of famine was capable of following orders to some degree.

It didn&#39;t take a genius to see that Berserker had little left in them. The wounds placed upon them were grievous and somehow made Berserker smell even worse. They had just one last resort remaining up their sleeve. Though, in their condition, they might not even make great use of it. 

That&#39;s not all either. Banshee&#39;s last scream afflicted Berserker with pains and memories that caused ▅▅▅▅ to scream in agony. On the surface, Berserker felt their body weaken on them. The wounds felt similar. It was as if they were placed there by another. One whom they fought and met their demise by several times over. To think that Banshee would cause Berserker to relive the feeling of being the hunted once more...</span>

A beautiful madness… A sight that made her feel her heart race…. Not out of fear. Not out of survival. This was a sight of love. A sight of lustful desire. 

Ruth was the object of her servant’s desire. Taking the cult leader to safety whilst keeping those fooling invaders at bay.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Unimaginable pain struck him as the electrical current tickled every nerve in his nervous system. Fried a second time, the numbness in his knees threatened to make him fall to the ground, and with Banshee&#39;s attack incoming, that would most likely spell death. 

...It was a risky bet, but he had no other choice than to cast <em>that spell</em>. An all-or-nothing, last ditch effort to take the advantage once more and be done with the two enemies in front of him. He knew better than to just use that technique randomly in a fight, knowing that it would eventually lead to complete and utter exhaustion. Thus, the rare times he has had to use it were in life or death situations <em>exclusively</em>. This situation, as far as he could tell, fit that description quite nicely.

The anger he had been burdened with since the cultist bitch&#39;s uncouth remarks would come in handy. He would take that anger and make it <em>his</em>, shaping it into a deadly weapon that would make the bitch swallow her words, that would make her regret ever speaking against the motherland. His Genevan pride screamed, and he was just about to respond in kind. Genevi soldiers didn&#39;t care about revenge, but when it came to Geneva itself, <em>they could bend the rules a little</em>.

But, as the veteran placed his hands on his chest and started molding his emotions, an oversized hand yanked him out of harm&#39;s way. The ground grew distant as he was forcefully made to fly through the air. Despite the exhaustion, the pain and the anger, Ace found his mind to be <em>unnaturally clear</em>. If Ruth and her Servant were in front of him, that could only mean one thing.

<em>Berserker protect Ace. Ace is safe.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Hey buddy,&quot; Ace mustered despite the exhaustion, his voice deeply hoarse. &quot;Thanks for unnecessarily saving my butt out there.&quot;

Reaching for his holster, the veteran took a hold of his antique handgun, barely able to keep his hands from trembling. 

Ace was greedy. He should&#39;ve delivered the final blow when he had the occasion instead of stalling for the sake of questioning. Even worse, after taking the brunt of Ruth&#39;s attack once more and now that the unsteady Wendigo held onto him, he didn&#39;t expect his accuracy to be good enough to hit the Holy Mother from his position. She would most likely get away with that crazed Berserker of hers before any of his bullets could hit...

&quot;<em>Now you can let me down</em>,&quot; He spoke, two bloodshot eyes staring a thousand daggers into Ruth and Banshee. &quot;I&#39;ve got unfinished business with the bitch underneath the Servant bitch.&quot;

…which meant that the only solution was to get up-close and personal, and this time, <em>he wouldn’t be as nice</em>.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;**No. In no shape to fight. No shape to protect. Must find Emeilia.&quot;

Berserker strung as many words as they could from both Emeilia and Ace&#39;s words to form the thoughts they needed to get across. Continued fighting would prove to be too costly. There was a chance that neither of them could retrieve Emeilia if they pushed themselves further. 

Before he could line up the shot, Ace felt his body shift again. Berserker moved from tree to tree to avoid the ground for another one of Banshee&#39;s potential strikes. It wasn&#39;t the fastest method of travelling but it was the safest method. At least until they were a good ways away from Ruth and Banshee, of course.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ace could only watch as Wendigo leapt in the opposite direction of their enemies, uncaring to its Master&#39;s demand.

&quot;You fucking idiot!&quot; He roared, clutching the beast&#39;s hand with his unscathed arm, <em>squeezing hard</em>. &quot;I&#39;m not done... I&#39;m not done with those guys yet!&quot;

But, unsurprisingly, the beast did not yield. <em>The absolute order given from Emeilia wouldn&#39;t allow such a thing</em>. The pair got farther and farther from Banshee and her Master, Wendigo&#39;s effortless jumps carrying the two like the wind would leave. He needed to act now. Prying himself from the beast&#39;s clutch would prove to be quite tricky, but maybe...

…

…

Ace&#39;s hand eventually let go of the ravenous Servant&#39;s hand. A raspy curse was the only word that managed to leave his mouth.

Although the effect was delayed, the mention of Emeilia <em>in his own voice</em> helped keep the veteran&#39;s rage at bay. They didn&#39;t come here to hunt down Nirvanans, even if some of them rightfully deserved to tank a few bullets. While they fought, tired and injured, Emeilia roamed the dangerous forest, alone and vulnerable. If the encounter went any further than this, there was no guarantee they could make it back to her… all things considered, the rookie&#39;s safety far outweighed a decisive outcome over the cult leader and her Servant. Not to mention that, fighting aside, they had a mission and multiple matters to tend to, and, unfortunately, a limited amount of stamina and health to do so.

Reaching inside his flapping jacket, the veteran condensed his feelings and etched them onto yet another bullet that he inserted into the magnum&#39;s chambers. His mind now completely clear, his body could finally relax.

Ace glimpsed at the bloody and beaten spirit of famine, quietly wondering. Was he just very good at following orders or did he have a consciousness somewhere beneath that boney mask of his?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The twisted mind of Banshee could only cackle with delirium as she watched the muddy wave crest and tower over the investigators before falling down upon them. It was good, it was right to watch them be witness to the same fate they had condemned her to so long ago. Though they would drown in a substance far more suffocating than water. She did not see Wendigo flee nor did she care. For that moment, she had defied her fate and finally got what she wanted.

The Banshee in her greviously ruined state, turned around to smile and embrace Ruth, her eyes glowing with maddening glee. &quot;<strong>Oh Ciabh&#225;n! I finally did it! I&#39;ve finally beaten my fate! And now... and now... you&#39;re ALL MINE!</strong>&quot; She cackled before caressing the cultist&#39;s cheek with her bloodied guantlet, leaving thin trails of burnt sienna behind before leaning in and kissing Ruth. The intensity of her action was suffocating in its desire, all limitations on her surpressed desires crippled by the Wendigo&#39;s curse.

Ruth would find herself pinned to the ground as the Banshee&#39;s inhibitions similarly disintergrated and her talons dug into her back and that cold tongue craving all the reservoirs of warmth it could find within the woman. The cultist leader may have feared her own origin but this was a form of consumption that she could be subjected to and never wither away. She was the prey swaddled by the hunter and subjected to its predatory, unbridled lust.

Time became impossible to keep track of, dissolved as it was in the thick haze of lust and madness. The dying and the undying, tangled in the follies of the heart, lost their distinctions in that warm darkness that they shared. It was only when the night came and the moon rose did the heat dissipate and the couple would find themselves on a quiet but tender journey back to the Naomi estate...
