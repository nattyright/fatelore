            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">Deep within the Nirvana swamp, surrounded densely by trees and water, lies the remains of a plane wreck. Half of it hangs (mostly) intact in the shrubs of a broken tree, while the other half peppers the surroundings with fractured metal. While uneventful and dead for quite a long time, recently, it seems as if there&#39;s been new life breathed into this old bird&#39;s grave... 

Named fondly the &quot;Rattlin&#39; Bog&quot; due to the mangled plane&#39;s shakey footing, the area won&#39;t seem like much from the outside in. But make no mistake, there&#39;s more than meets the eye in this secluded bog. In truth, the clever works of Ronda Parker are at play here, making it a splendid place for Ryn to take as his workshop.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Amidst the downfall of the Canopus a small few were able to escape unscathed and unaffected by the ensuing battle. These lucky few were that of a young boy, a red head engineer, a fresh corpse, and a being beyond comprehension. They found themselves in a wreckage filled swamp yard near in the middle of the island. Most were astonished and pondering on how this was possible, yet it seemed the work was not yet done. For the boy gave the request for one other to be ripped away from the jaws of devastation in that unforeseen attack. The tall woman in black held upon the shoulder of the young boy prepared for what came next, his own responsibility was to point his allies out. Soon they too were gone once more without a trace. The red head was left on her own for the time being, her only companion being the now slowly decaying remains of her former boss. With a sigh, she took some scrap metal she found nearby and dug as good of a grave as she could from the marshlands and placed the former Author into the hole. He likely deserved far better than this but this was what could be managed.

In the absence of her new compatriots, the engineer investigated the swamp a bit further checking over each corner to find something useful. Eventually she came upon the remains of a fallen aero plane lodged within a tree. This location had potential not to mention, a place for them to sleep at night. Gathering up any scrap metal and broken tech she could find within the vicinity the engineer would begin her work in fortifying a haven and base of operations for them. Pulling out her multi tool and tome of abjuration, she got to work.</span>

Especially the downed aircraft planted within the tree, at least that’s what it seemed on the surface. Going a bit deeper there would be layers of several different abjuration bounded fields placed around the area, one’s of non detection, sound dampening, as well as their own alert enchantment in case something got close. 

Inside the plane itself was Ronda buried underneath the paneling of the fallen contraption working her proverbial mechanical magic with her trusty universal multi tool. Grime, oil, and stains of swamp water covered her entire body, yet she found herself in utter peace with herself. A quiet environment with the time and ability to work on a unique machine that she’d always dreamed of getting her hands on. Crossing a few wires and measured punch to a small motor kicked on a small process within the plane itself, Ronda sat up and fist pumped in the air with a giant grin upon her face. “Finally got the ducking air conditioning unit back on line. Mana’s going to sleep well tonight.” Jumping to her feet she’d look around the rest of the aviator. It was wrecked and abandoned a long time ago, but to an expert mechanic like Ronda, it may just be salvageable. “Next thing, let’s see if we can’t reinforce the durability of your exterior.”</span>

His bosom rested upon a sizable tree branch thicker than his waist was wide, and his legs swung back forth off the side, casting a playfully animated shadow above the plane&#39;s rusty exterior. His eyes trained through a patch of metal and watched as flecks of red fumbled around, jumping and frolicking about the plane like some twisted playground. A rather silly sight really, made even sillier when Ronda&#39;s voice pierced the foggy veil that plagued these bogs, along with the occasional rattlin&#39; of the plane from her shuffling. What a character they&#39;d brought along.

<strong>&quot;You think she&#39;s talking to the plane down there?&quot;</strong> the lad mused, his guitar quietly rumbling behind his back while he tilted his head up to his side. Another presence loomed over him where he gazed, this one far darker than the one below, though, just as much an enigma to Ryn.</span>

The idea of being able to touch the sky is a dream that many hold, but few can reach. It appears our compatriot is keeping themselves busy. Her efforts shall be quite beneficial to us. I can keep my presence concealment up for awhile, but I surmise based on the methodology of my summoning into a robotic shell if I maintain my absence too long my existence may be preemptively terminated by the regulations of my form. With these enchantment laid down with the area I can drop my guard without worry that other servants will sense me.”

Her eyes then gently feel upon her master was merely enjoying the brief respite and looking down upon the working mechanic. “You know master, you are welcome to speak to her and introduce yourself properly. I understand that she was willing to come with us and has accepted this tentative alliance, but it is prudent to get to know one’s allies. Even I do not know your take in its entirety as of yet. Besides, you are a relatively attractive young man, I’m sure you will win over her favor in no time.” <span class="mention" title="&#198;nkidou#4116">@Enkidou</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A little tint of pink shaded Ryn&#39;s cheeks after the Boogieman&#39;s last comment, and taken aback, he broke out into a grin.
<strong>&quot;A-Aww shucks, you think so? Hehe, thanks!&quot;</strong>
Beaming red, it seemed as if he was far more flattered at being called anything remotely attractive, rather than such winning over any lass&#39;s attention. Except the Boogieman&#39;s, apparently. He had to bring a hand up to his cheek the ebb the flush away, as hopeless as that was. Though when he finally did settle down, he turned his gaze down once more, back within the cracks of the plane. 

<strong>&quot;Though- nah. I&#39;ll get to introducin&#39; ourselves better later, looks like the lass is already having a real compelling schmooze with the aircraft, no? I wanted to talk to <em>you</em> anyways.&quot;</strong>
Shifting entirely around where he sat to face his servant, Ryn perched his elbow upon a crooked branch, and rested his chin within his palm. Mysterious yellow met admiring red as the lad examined the Boogieman closely, before curious words parted his lips.

<strong>&quot;Be honest; are you <em>really</em> the Boogieman? Heard you loud and clear back at the train but... I mean... I never imagined the Boogieman would be so... er, talkative!&quot;</strong>
He said all this with a shrewd tone of voice, not exactly dismissing the possibility, but not entirely believing of it either. After all, this was certainly a strange Boogieman before him, if she really was one. The monster in the closets he&#39;d imagined when he was younger was a vile thing, the stuff of a child&#39;s most abstract and terrifying fears of what lumbered in the dark. Not some tall woman with stylish sense of dress and polite vernacular-- no no, Ryn believed there was more to this. Possibly.</span>

You see my existence is an amalgamation of several legends and interpretation around the world and through history. I am a creature able to be molded to whatever suites my purpose.” She spoke cryptically almost always, but it did seem as if she was trying to explain herself. Whether Ryn was able to follow remained to be seen. “It seems I have not given you a proper demonstration of what I truly am capable, rest assured we soon shall make our move upon this island. Both it’s people and you will know what my type of fear is.” 

Slowly she edged closer to him her presence almost increasing the pressure of air around him. It was almost difficult to breathe I’m her proximity. Her hand arched downwards lightly grazing against Ryn’s face, her back bowing to meet her master eye to eye. Unflinching and unmovable was her expression as once again it seemed as if she stared deeply into his soul and seemed to almost study and ponder upon it. Then at the height of this expression she remarked. “Dorian shall be found, I swear it to you. Even if I have to rip a part this land by its core. Let those worries leave your mind for time being.

The lad froze up as the Boogieman lowered, and his eyes instinctively met her&#39;s. Making it all the more easy to see right through him.

Once he realized what was happening, he tore his gaze away, and grimaced slightly. Being pried like that wasn&#39;t very fun to say the least, Ryn didn&#39;t like being read like some book. But the things his servant took away from her little readings-- well... they were quite comforting, at least. Ryn&#39;s hand rose to clasp around the Boogieman&#39;s, and pulled it away from his cheek, down between the both of them.
<strong>&quot;Thank you... but,&quot;</strong>

The lad clasped the Boogieman&#39;s hand harder, and shook it firmly.
<strong>&quot;-no point in swearin&#39; on what&#39;s set to be!&quot;</strong> he announced, smiling. Ryn didn&#39;t stop for even a moment, and paraded on with fiery ardor.
<strong>&quot;It was destined the second I stepped on that boat-- and even <em>more</em> so when I summoned you. We&#39;re finding him, or, we&#39;re headin&#39; home with him.&quot;</strong></span>

There&#39;d be no convincing him otherwise. Ryn was dead set on finding that old magus, now more than ever! Failure wasn&#39;t an option he even considered, and after letting go of his servant&#39;s hand, the excitable master looked off to the horizon, just as the Boogieman had earlier.
<strong>&quot;Say- maybe we could start right now!  Go out &#39;n talk to one of those islanders maybe, see what we can find out.&quot;</strong>

The edge of his lips curved into a smirk, and whilst the subtle rosey hue of his cheeks returned, he gingerly spread his hand to his chest.
<strong>&quot;Though I&#39;m well aware I&#39;m a &#39;relatively attractive young man,&#39; there&#39;s no way they can tell I&#39;m a foreigner just by looks right? And you-- you can turn into whatever you want-- I bet we&#39;d blend right in!&quot;</strong></span>

If you have settled your heart and mind on a particular goal then few things shall stand in your way of achieving it. Though I caught you to ready your heart, the world is not always good or fair. There are dangers around every corner, beasts of evil that sooner see you bleed out upon the pavement then let you have happiness. To each such things one needs to work hard and be willing to make sacrifices. I trust you know what lies deep within your heart and you will know what to do when the time comes.” 

Boogie was an enigma in the truest definition, at times she shall be stoic the next she is endearing and uplifting. There was no solid ground to be had with her, she was being of constant motion and uncertainty. As Ryn went on she merely listened before a devilish grin grew upon her face. “I suppose that is something we can do, especially if it is your desire my master. Let us take a trip around the island. I’m certain we can arrive at a few answers by searching around as well as talking to the right people. I don’t believe it entirely necessary for me to amount some form of disguise considering how I move through the shadows, but I shall take into consideration the option if needed.” A hand would land upon Ryn’s shoulder. “Let us begin our investigation in earnest, see if we can’t <strong>scare</strong> up some information.”</span>

As intently as he could anyways, really, could she not choose herself a more digestible vernacular? At the very least, he thought he got it. What he was getting was that the road ahead wouldn&#39;t be an easy one... finding Dorian will take more than his own two feet. <em>Well duh!</em> It took starving and committing crimes already... after that, the lad thought he was ready for anything. Again, there was no convincing him otherwise in his mind.

Giggling, the lad stood up, balancing upon the tree branch with his arms airplaning out at his sides as he tiptoed closer to his servant.
<strong>&quot;Yeah yeah... you talk way too much, <em>Boogie</em>. My Old Man&#39;ll love you.&quot;</strong>
Boogie&#39;s hand kept the lad from losing his balance, and smiling, he looked up at her gratefully. Boogie. He hoped she didn&#39;t mind the nickname, Boogeyman and Assassin were such mouthfuls after all, and she seemed far more &quot;Boogey&quot; than she was &quot;man&quot; anyways. He thought it fitting, and whilst she kept him steady, he set a firm hand on her upper arm.

<strong>&quot;Let&#39;s! Take us wherever, pick someplace a bit discreet. We&#39;re only goin&#39; for a little chat.&quot;</strong>
Then, as if remembering something, he cupped a hand over his mouth, and tilted his head towards the aircraft below.

<strong>&quot;WE&#39;RE GOIN&#39;!!&quot;</strong> he shouted, voice loud enough to echo. Grinning mischeviously, he nodded at his servant. Now they could go.</span>
