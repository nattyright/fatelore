            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">Right next to the jungle is the Nirvana swamp, though it is called wetlands on the official guide pamphlet. The wetlands host animals that require a mixture of ground and sea to live, such as capybaras or crocodiles. Due to the amount of cold blooded and peaceful animals that lived in this area, almost no defensive precautions were taken and tourists were freely allowed to interact with well-fed animals. However, that is no longer the case, as the animal feeders stopped showing up, resulting in animals cannibalizing each other. The swamp now serves as one of the more treacherous areas of the reserve, with predators hiding underneath the muddy water as they wait for a tasty snack to arrive.</div>

Since meeting the Geneva trio, Octavius had moved all around the island, given his speed and lack of anything or anyone holding him down, he decided that he wished to sightsee this island paradise. His travels took him from around the lake to the forest and back through the tropical forest. It appeared that indeed individuals across the island were hearing up for the end of the world or at the very least, the end of this conflict. He bemused that this was likely true either way from the look of the moon and the sky. It seemed that whatever was altering the minds of the animals and people on the island was now affecting the weather and everything in between. Whatever it was, it was surely airborne then. Unless it was some presence that fundamentally affected each person differently, who&#39;s to say that he wasn&#39;t becoming like the people of Nirvana, what if this was that first step into madness that created the monsters in clothes that roamed the island. He has wished that he would have explored more, sought out the reasoning for the chaos and insanity that was seeped into the varied soil of the earth, although he supposed it was too late for that now. He hoped to eventually get to the bottom of this mess one day, for now though, he would have to reunite with Dante to plan out their next goal. He had to tell Dante that he found other investigators, that they weren&#39;t alone in this place and as well, he needed to learn whatever Dante found if anything.</span>

He knew that this has to have been a recent development as nothing had settled, whatever happened within these walls happened recently, which meant that Dante had seen more action than him. He hardly looked within the complex, he knew Dante would flee at the first sign of trouble as per their agreement, which meant that he simply needed to catch up. It wouldn&#39;t be hard, he noticed footprints enter and leave the complex, although the fact that there was more than one set of footprints was certainly off-putting, the footprints made it all the easier to find Dante. As he ran forth following the footsteps, he had found his way into the swamp. As much as this made the Roman grimace from the muck, it did make finding Dante easier. 

In record time since following the tracks, The Saber had found that the tracks diverged at a point, meaning that whoever Dante was traveling with had split off. As well, whoever it was had been large indeed. Making it all the easier to follow the smaller footprints as well as marks etched into trees. If this was not Dante then, hopefully someone that he could ask politely for answers. Then, clear as day, there was his master, moving from tree to tree, although he didn&#39;t know why. For dramatic effect, The Caesar moved to a tree adjacent to Dante, making it so that when Dante blinked he was staring at a tree one moment, then the servant standing there in the next. Roman theatrics aside, he asked the immediate question on his mind.

&quot;Dante, are you alright? what did you find within the labs?&quot; The Roman asked as he rested against the tree near Dante, although he immediately could feel the presence of <em>him</em>. Octavius didn&#39;t say anything, but simply looked in the direction of where he found feel Vortigern&#39;s immense presence.</span>

He had to keep himself away from Vortigern, but track him. . .Wait until Granel had gotten back to him. But, it’d have been a bit better had he not lost his saber in the mix of everything before hand. The swamps led back into the tropics, however, it also meant he’d have to get past the beast itself, and he didn’t think it smart to attract the eye of Vortigern.</em>

<em>His mind was stuck on what Granel had mentioned earlier. Anthony had called him rider. . . But Vortigern had exhibited berserker traits. . . And he had identified him with such ease.</em>

<em><strong>”That man and a journal I found several days ago. In it, he summoned a Rider-class Servant.”</strong></em>

<em>That was what Granel had said, but it didn’t seem possible. . . Servants didn’t kill their masters, right? If he had summoned such a servant then how did William get his hands on the same servant? How did it manage to become such a berserker?</em>

<em>The doctor plunged his knife into the tree, twisting it to carve a small but visual hole in it. He’d use this. If anyone needing to find where they went, this would be it. He was smart about it. . . Keeping the large trunks of trees as his own way to cover himself so he wouldn’t be seen, but having enough distance to see the figure of the servant in his view.</em>

<em>Truly, the doctor was quite wrapped up in his own thoughts, not even noticing the glint of red and orange that had been close by. It wasn’t until something pierced his silent atmosphere that Dante looked away, almost jumping out of his skin to see that Octavius had been there.</em></span>

He would have thought it would be important to fill in a partner on the important details of a life and death senario such as following the Berserker Vortigern. The servant that twice now he&#39;s fought and twice now he&#39;s failed to slay, not for lack of trying of course but of the simple reason of he simply couldn&#39;t strike down the beast even with his Noble Phantasm. Whatever plan his master had put them on, the Emperor would have liked to be filled in on such a scheme. He would rather not throw his life away to try and fight the Mad King a third time, knowing what he already knew about the servant.

&quot;He&#39;s in that direction.&quot; The saber pointed out to his master, knowing the presence of Vortigern like a sixth sense at this point. The King was so distinct that it would be difficult not to smell the stench of death and rot from him. As well it seemed as if the Berserker had only grown stronger since their last encounter. &quot;I can keep a well enough sense of where he is. I don&#39;t care if this is for some plan you&#39;ve made, I want to know exactly what&#39;s going on before I put my life on the line for a plan I have no clue about. Who put you alone up to the task of following Vortigern himself?&quot; He asked and pushed again. The Caesar wouldn&#39;t be content to idly following the orders of some other individual that wasn&#39;t Dante, of course that forced the Roman to follow along with this as his master was apparently a willing participant in this wonderful plan.

He wouldn&#39;t try a similar stunt like he pulled against the tyrant in their prior battle.

Yet, there was a part of Octavius that wanted to find that upper limit though. His own pride had him into a crossroads. The fist of the Emperor clenched tightly for a moment as the memories of his battles against Vortigern flashed in his mind. His words and thoughts were contradictory. He had to resolve this one way or another, the Emperor knew this. If not for the good of the island, than specifically for himself. To triumph over humiliating defeat, it was a wonderful feeling. To be given a chance to right that wrong, it put a smirk on the his face. 

Oh he wasn&#39;t lying when he said that he would grab Dante and run, but before that moment, before that decision would be made.

He wanted to try his best to find the Mad King&#39;s limits.

He understood what it was in him that made his being a walking contradiction in this moment. It was soul fighting itself in a civil war. His blood as a Roman, his body of a servant, his spirit as an Emperor. It all vied for ownership of the being known as Gaius Octavius Caesar. 

With that realization in the Roman&#39;s mind, he then began to move further into the swamp, following the trail of Vortigern with his master.

&quot;As your servant Dante, my job is to protect you. That currently entails two seperate criteria. We either strike him down here. Or I leave from this battle with you in tow, the rest of this wretched place be damned for all I care.&quot;

He took a glance back at Dante.

&quot;Are we clear on that?&quot;</span>

It was important to note that many nomadic cities lacked genuine, real deal swamps. Maybe Granel hadn&#39;t visited the right cities, but ultimately, he felt that he made the right call.

The ground was wet, the insects were terrible, and the smell was not to be desired. Additionally, it was difficult for someone of Granel&#39;s weight to move silently or quickly, as his boots sunk into the mud.

Of course, the brilliant minds of Nirvana had elected to place one on the preserve, and it was his job to recover the schematics. Maybe people had forgotten how to make swamps, and the Investigation Team&#39;s sacrifice would benefit humanity.

Hopefully that wasn&#39;t the case.

Granel brought up the vanguard alongside Verga. His prints left deep impressions that were easy for the others to follow. It was also appealing to be able to fling Verga at Vortigern if things went south quickly. The Italian author did make an excellent projectile.

&quot;<strong>Are we here yet, Pachinko?</strong>&quot; Granel hissed over the buzz of insects. The red sky mixed with the swamp&#39;s downing atmosphere was a real morale drainer.

&quot;<strong>You better not be dragging us around in circles, or I&#39;ll wring you into one myself. How&#39;re you holding up, Donald?</strong>&quot; Granel asked with a loud thwap! as he crushed an insect that was buzzing around his shiny head.</span>

None of them tried to go into his ears, and that was about as good as it got. Besides, he was more than willing to house Cameran in his pocket. It’d be a touch hypocritical to hate on these buggers. No pun intended.

“I’ve got no hat, Granel,” he said. “An’ an infinite supply of bloody bugs that come in various shapes ‘n sizes. I’d call this hell, but that’d be a touch blind considerin’ the state o’ affairs elsewhere.”

At least this wasn’t new territory, unlike that dry desert that felt like a fever dream more than an actual place. Mud wasn’t new, but the addition of water made it a bit weird. Felt, looked, and smelled like a latrine. The miniature drones that circled him to no end made life a touch easier. Any time he opened his mouth he tasted bug instead of a foul dankness. 

How the hell was he supposed to fight in this? He was no sloth, but it was hard to be much more with this terrain that sloshed and stuck to his boots. Maybe this Vortigern would be ok with a request in field change before they tried to murder each other.

“How much longer, ya think? We’re due to die t’the island rather than this Berserker with the rate we’re goin’, and I refuse to perish by the hands o’ Mother Nature,” he stepped forward, only to sink down further than he anticipated.

Damn it, Granel! That behemoth of a man created dangerous pits wherever he went. Donald’s foot was now soaked to the bone with murky water. A familiar-yet-extremely uncomfortable feeling.</span>

Not only did he make a sizable investigation team tag along with him, but he even had the gall to walk a sizable distance away from the group. The swamp water looked disgusting, causing him to instead take the slower path around it while Granel and Donald instead brave it like the numbskulls they were.

&quot;Oh oh, you might want to look out for leeches as well. I doubt they drink mana, but they most certainly drink blood.&quot; He snickered, rubbing his stache as he watched the two buffoons curse their current situation. 

&quot;A book isn&#39;t written in a day. Likewise, it will take us time to find that slippery bastard you are after. Especially when they can just hitch a ride on a Berserker.&quot; He reminded the two as the walk continued. Had it not been for the disastrous climate and the unnerving sky, one could have easily confused this idle pace for that of a picnic.

&quot;...Hmm. Quiet now. I hear voices.&quot; The writer pointed out, halting his advance as he scoured the area ahead. No sign of Vortigern or William, but someone else. A boy and a man in clothes that reminded him of history books of old, specifically those that he became quite a fan of in his nationalist years.

&quot;Are these yours?&quot; He pointed ahead, causing Donald and Granel to tilt their heads. Several dozen feet or so away, they could see the faint silhouettes of Dante and Octavius in the distance, the two skulking and sneaking around like a pair of bugs hidden in reeds. An odd sight for someone as dignified as the Saber. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnugget</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

First your gun, then your hat, then your second hat. I&#39;ll find a magus that can put a tracking spell on your next one if it makes you feel better.</strong>&quot; Granel laughed as his massive arm lashed out, quick as a whip, only to crush a handful of bugs in his palm.

Was Granel truly talented, or was it just so easy to get a shot that he made it look easy?

&quot;<strong>Thanks for the heads up, Pachinko. Maybe after we take a dive into the ocean, you&#39;ll tell us that it&#39;s actually a massive area of shark-infested waters.</strong>&quot; Granel spat as he crushed a leech underfoot. He was wearing boots, but his pants were thin. Any leech brave enough could easily sink its fangs into him.

As Granel, Donald, and Verga poked their heads out of a mess of reeds, Granel&#39;s eyes brightened. That was them! Dante looked like he had been hit with a train, but that might&#39;ve just been the bugs. And that Servant next to him had to be Octavius!

&quot;<strong>Dante! You are all right! This is wonderful news. I have brought help.</strong>&quot; Granel beamed, gesturing towards the scruffy Scot and Italian author. Was this what Granel meant by help? An old man and a Servant fighting a losing battle against bugs?

Were they doomed?

&quot;<strong>And you must be Octavius, Dante&#39;s Servant. Wonderful. I am Granel, this is Donald, and this is...</strong>&quot; Granel trailed off. Crap, what was Pachinko&#39;s true name? Had he said it back at the merch store? 

Not like it mattered much. Verga had done his job, and had lead them to Dante and Octavius, who in turn, could lead them to Vortigern. Granel didn&#39;t trust him, but he had played his minor part.

&quot;<strong>...Another Servant. Where is William and Berserker?</strong>&quot;

As he was about to speak to the newly assembled group as they introduced themselves, well at least the large one did, he paused at the mention of his true name out loud. He was slightly annoyed as he gave a side-eye glare to Dante for a moment before giving a defeated sigh. Whatever speech he would give his master on subtlety and caution would come later after the battle was over. He already had a lot on his mind with this entire situation. The fact that the master of the mad king was some other servant named William and that he was a Rider class servant which Octavius rolled his eyes at. What was he a Rider of? Did his wings or his dog-like personality qualify him for the class? It didn&#39;t matter either way for the Saber, especially since they had... The Emperor barely wanted to call reinforcements.

This was the plan? This was the support that they would get to take down such a powerful opponent. A large cannonball that looked like he could eat Dante, a smaller cannonball that sadly felt his head for what the Roman could assume was either a missing article of clothing or his hair, he couldn&#39;t figure out which and an old cannonball that looked like he had an annoying laugh and a devilish tongue. 

If Octavius had half of a mind, he would have taken Dante and left while they could. Alas, they were there now, and apparently, the rest of them were confident in this plan, so the emperor was outvoted.

We are far enough away that we still should have the element of surprise, even with your loud blustering.&quot; The Roman said indignantly, pointing the last poke at Granel specifically, taking a passing glance at Verga before turning back towards the direction of Vortigern and William and continuing to speak.

 &quot;I&#39;ve fought him twice before, a minor advantage we can gain however is if we can disarm him. His sword of flame can cut even me in half if given the right momentum and his purple sword distorts and corrupts Magecraft in his favor, getting him away from his blades will make this battle lower risk, albiet he&#39;s still formidable with just his hands as well. I suppose it hardly matters what force we have, or what strategic advantage we gain. We either destroy him and his master here or continue to hide while he kills more people.&quot;</span>

Seriously, do ye not got a way to clean yer clothes? A little dirt n’ grime never hurt a soul. And it don’t, Granel. I usually keep a good eye on it.”

However, he did stop in his tracks the moment Verga told him to. Annoyance or not, it was better to trust him the first few times than assume he’s a liar and die in the next few moments. Sure enough, he was right this time: there were a few living people around. Better yet, they didn’t seem to be their quarry. 

Instead, it was some normal-looking guy and… whatever the hell that person was. Official. Fancy. Despicable. This was the guy they had to also rely on? He’d take that mysterious Servant that he murdered any day of the week based on looks alone.

“Disarm, eh,” Donald chirped up, “well, I can try me hardest. No promises, though. You’ll just have to stand back and let me work me figurative magic.”

Fire sword? Bah, what good was a fire in a place filled to the brim with water? Sure, Magic was weird, but it couldn’t be <em>that</em> flammable! Besides, it wouldn’t matter if he simply did not get hit. 

“Listen… Saber? Saber. As a fellow Saber, lemme remind ye of the third option ye forgot… we get absolutely slashed to ribbons an’ perish <em>while</em> this bloke continues his rampage,” Donald waved his finger at the other Servant. No sense to ignore the very real possibility. It was better to confirm the stakes with everyone anyway. 

Failure was certainly not an option, from the way everyone acted about this other guy.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Like a hound let loose, Berserker scours the area around the group rather than staying with them. This way they could cover more ground alone with their speed, allowing them to work as a sort of security alarm in a way; should Berserker go on the offensive then perhaps they found their mark.

However, they were not silent in the slightest. Their large body, which swung from tree to tree in the swamp, disturbed much of the canopy above. This made any idea of a stealthy approach impossible, if Granel didn&#39;t make that impossible by his mass alone already, not to mention the large amount of servants in one place adding on top of that. 

Also, while they <em>could</em> make full use of their speed to their advantage, the mud that poured from the trees themselves made things all the more difficult to maneuver around. Each leap and grasp needed to be precise to avoid it. There wasn&#39;t an easier alternative though. The swamp water below would freeze from Berserker&#39;s touch, causing issues for both Berserker and their travelling companions. This left them with this sole option, at least until they encountered their target.

Berserker stopped upon a tree to stare at the two new arrivals to the group from a distance. The lack of much response from the others told Berserker that they weren&#39;t their target. No. Their prey was still out there.

The sounds of Berserker leaping through the trees to scour the perimeter continued to ring out into the air.</span>

“A—above us, I assume t—that that is an ally, no? Or is it a wild animal . . . It doesn’t seem to be attacking us, so I could only hope that it either is not aggressive or it’s not crazy.”

V—vortigern is boosted by these wings that William modified. . . If I remember on the boat, he used pages to stick onto objects, I—it’s what helped me when I fought the spider woman on the Canopus. I don’t know if it’s the same for Vortigern, but it could be that those pages that helped me and saber before that are helping Vortigern. . . They are glued to the wings, and supposedly after they are, his mana signatures would raise. . . So I wonder if his wings are something important.”

<em>He tried to slow down as he spoke, his mind racing through the many thoughts in his head.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Ace reluctantly accepted to come here in an effort to bring this <em>Vortigern</em> down, endangering both him and the rookie in the same process. This was the poorest decision he had ever taken since their arrival on Nirvana, and he got reminded of that fact for each sloppy sound his shoes made with the ground, with each insect swatted by his gloved hands.

This wasn&#39;t like him. To trust an outsider to Geneva to this extent, even if he did get along with them, was a rare sight. And deviating from a mission he had been tasked with to do something else was even rarer. It might&#39;ve been the tone of Granel&#39;s words, or his desperate attempts to bring Ace onboard for the mission, but there was a sort of <em>finality</em> to this whole Vortigern ordeal. Enough that Ace was reluctant in both accepting and refusing Granel&#39;s proposal.

The veteran&#39;s suit had managed to somehow hold its form after arriving on Nirvana, even after multiple spicy run-ins with the locals. Compared to Granel&#39;s mess of a suit, Ace&#39;s was still looking sleek, sharp, clean...

Or at least it was the case <em>until</em> they arrived at the swamps. Nasty place, nasty animals, <em>nasty goo</em>. 

While Wendigo was noisily scouting the area head of the larger group, the two Genevi lagged behind. Primarily to stay on the look-out for any nasty surprises that could arise in the back, and partly because Emeilia&#39;s physical conditioning and uniform didn&#39;t do well in the swamps. Not to mention that the sap-like liquid that oozed from the trees was pretty much everywhere, almost unavoidable in some instances and requiring various detours to be made.

She was a brainiac, and brainiacs had no place in the battlefield. Leaving her to fend for herself alone wasn&#39;t an option either, especially when taking her rebellious tendencies in consideration, so the logical decision was to bring her along. She&#39;d watch from the sidelines of course, and hopefully, a violent encounter with a monster of a Servant would spook her enough that she wouldn&#39;t attempt any more risky shenanigans for the rest of their stay here.

The group stopping to greet Dante and Octavius gave Ace and Emeilia the opportunity to catch-up. Ace raised a hand as he came close, greeting them both.

&quot;Hey,&quot; The man spoke, a familiar half-smile on his face. &quot;Glad to see you&#39;re still kicking, Saber. Next step is to make it out alive of <em>this</em> dump, then you&#39;ll have officially earned my respect.&quot;

He turned to Dante, observing the man&#39;s features as he spoke about Vortigern. He had no recollection of ever meeting him back at the Canopus, and quite frankly, even if he had, his facial features felt basic enough that he would&#39;ve easily forgotten him. Octavius had spoken at length about him, sometimes referring to him as a soft cry-baby, and others as a willful man that was to be respected. In that aspect, he had caught the veteran&#39;s attention.

We&#39;ll be assisting with Vortigern, <em>I will</em>. This isn&#39;t a wild animal, but my Berserker. Don&#39;t fret, he&#39;s an ally.&quot;

He pointed to Wendigo. While the veteran had a few questions about the doctor&#39;s lengthy talk on Vortigern, Dante had finished with a question of his own, one that made Ace raise an eyebrow. He graduated from the Occult Corps&#39; division, and as such, he had somewhat of a culture on everything Magecraft. He decided to answer.

&quot;...depends on what you mean by <em>create</em>, exactly,&quot; He spoke. &quot;Theoretically, every Heroic Spirit that was and that will ever be already exists to be summoned. <em>Creating</em> a Heroic Spirit in the truest sense of the word doesn&#39;t make sense in that regard.&quot;

&quot;But if you meant creating a <em>Servant-like being</em>,&quot; He added, thoughtful. &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible.&quot;</span>

The idea of staying behind <em>was</em> nice in theory, but she didn&#39;t want to be left alone on this island without anyone by her side. So, if it meant having to deal with this dreadful situation, she will put up with. She kept safe with so many others around her after all.</span>

Of course, as Verga would quickly point out, they had omitted one small detail: If Dante could notice Vortigern from afar, then the reverse could be the same.

This was something for lecturers at the Mage&#39;s Association colleges to discuss. He barely knew how summonings worked, beyond catalysts and incantations. 

If you wanted someone to kill a magus, Granel was your guy. If you wanted someone to explain the inner workings of Magecraft, it was better to ask someone else.

However, the subject would be quickly dropped.

&quot;<strong>Hey, William. Long time no see.</strong>&quot; Granel growled, looking up at him. While Vortigern was taller than Granel, William was in the perfect position to be punted all the way to Alexandria.

Despite that, Granel couldn&#39;t deny the help that William provided. From fighting Koji to the journal in the hospital, he had been helpful to the investigators, despite Granel&#39;s inherent desire to punch his teeth in.

&quot;<strong>Bad assumption, William. Nowhere in our contracts does it state that saving the people of Nirvana is required. We simply needed to accomplish two things:</strong>&quot;

Granel held up two fingers. &quot;<strong>The first is to obtain Nirvana&#39;s schematics. This is ongoing. The second is to find out what happened to the prior investigation teams.</strong>&quot;

That nameless investigator from the lab. They were all dead besides him. All the old Servants were gone. All the people who had a complete picture of the previous two raids were lost to history.

There was no true desire to save Nirvana. It was a cursed place, rotten to the core. The plant-life leaking mud and the sky above proved that. Even the people here had been caught in Nirvana&#39;s infectious grip.

And yet...</span>

Nirvanans. What a pointless word. There was only the ill and the ill-equipped.

&quot;<strong>I am forcefully making an addendum to the contract I signed. I want a world without that—</strong>&quot; Granel jerked his chin towards Vortigern— &quot;<strong>Killing investigators and natives alike. You&#39;ve injured <em>my</em> men, William.</strong>&quot;

His arm twitched as his anger rose. How dare this man walk by as if he had done nothing wrong? He helped the investigators one moment, before turning around in the next to allow Vortigern to stab them in the back. He had attacked Dante and Octavius multiple times.

His anger grew.

 &quot;<strong>William... You <em>fraud</em>. I think you&#39;re a lying sack of shit. Attacking some of my coworkers with your Berserker and getting all buddy-buddy with the others.</strong>&quot; Granel hissed.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re the one modifying this brute. Meaning, that if you go down...</strong>&quot;

Without as much as a blink, Granel tackled William to the ground in an attempt to beat the bard&#39;s face in.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Verga’s quick words were all Donald got before he turned around. It was then that he got his first glimpse at the opponent they were to deal with. 

The fucker was taller than Granel. Not bigger, but that didn’t mean much when it was compensated with two dangerous swords. Bonus points for one being on fire and the other that had a dark purple hue to it. What luck, to deal with two opponents with dual swords in his time here. In a swamp.

As soon as Vortigern got agitated and raise his swords, Donald took a few steps back. His own sabre remained hilted, but was ready to be drawn at a moment&#39;s notice. So long as this guy couldn’t teleport, he’d be able to attempt a parry or the like. 

“To be honest, I’ve been drug along fer the ride,” Donald told the bard. While the stories weren’t being denied of his deeds and the beast&#39;s rampage, he couldn’t just go and be a dick to the guy that bailed him out that one time. “But it sounds like yer pal here has been causin’ problems fer others.”

Granel confirmed it. His contract had been changed, by his own hands alone. He wasted no time in the physical part, immediately going for William. 

This was a terrible idea, in his eyes. Not because of the target selection, but because his target was <em>still</em> right next to his very dangerous and capable support. There were too many people for Donald to really offer much help, but…

Couldn’t just let his own Master go off and die without a friend along the way, right?

So, with absolutely no idea of this Berserker’s capabilities or what the hell the rest of their party would do, Donald raised his sword and charged Vortigern. The sole purpose of the charge: 

Make sure Granel didn’t get murdered within the first ten seconds of his assault. 

“Granel, ye fucking oaf!”</span>

They had rushed forward into the thick of it without a single plan or thought in mind, they were going to get someone killed because of this, if that Granel had waited a moment, instead of tackling a servant in front of the volatile mad king, they could have set this entire scenario into their favor, however now they were in the thick of it. He hardly appreciated the other Saber&#39;s dismissals of his remarks if it weren&#39;t for the appearance of the soldier and the rest of the Geneva group, he would have suggested leaving this drivel behind to fight the tyrant and his pink master. The Saber gave a nod to the Geneva group and set his hand on Dante&#39;s shoulder as he walked towards the fray.

&quot;I shall go Imperator. You can handle yourself.&quot; He said to Dante and gave him a serious look, showing that his entire statement to his master wasn&#39;t any sort of sarcastic jab or remark or any kind of snide backhanded statement. He then walked to a tree near them, grabbing the tree with his left hand and pulling it from its roots out of the ground. He would help the other Saber in his assault against Vortigern, as much as he wanted the plump man to figure out the King&#39;s style of combat on his own, he figured that would take too long to acclimate to.

The Emperor shifted the tree above his head and held a spear thrower&#39;s pose and launched the tree past Donald and towards Vortigern before jumping into the air, summoning Auram Pax into his hands and dove after the tree, planning to swing down upon the Berserker, either through the tree or into Vortigern, determined to act upon if the mad king decided to take the tree head-on, although if he simply dodged the tree then hopefully this affair would be a nice momentary buffer or distraction if the other servant decided to meet Donald head-on with a charge or bare minimum, keep it&#39;s attention on opponents of it&#39;s own caliber, the gathered Servants.</span>

“W—we didn’t say you’ve caused it. . . H—however, we cannot ignore that you’ve allowed Vortigern to kill its own master and allowed him to kill others. . .”

<em>His whispered condemnation of the man was quiet yet resolute. So this had been William, and to think he had helped them previously. . . Why? He couldn’t wrack his head around it, was he just doing it for the random chances of it all, or if he truly had any idea of it, was he doing it for an actual goal? Granel left no time before he went and assaulted William, while Donald and Octavius had gone to defend against Vortigern, leaving the doctor to his own fearful devices as he backed away from the battle at a safe distance to make sure he wasn’t caught within the crossfire. He wasn’t one to exactly fight the servant, knowing he wasn’t to win. . . But he’d try to attempt it. The blurb from Anthony had resounded in his head, and in a brief moment of thinking the doctor screamed towards his saber, a command for his own tactics.</em></span>

It was all but confirmed, William was indeed mingling with the crazed Berserker. The playwright&#39;s rivalry with Verga caught his attention, enough to make him wonder why two smug pricks so similar in their bad taste could hate each other to this extent. Before he could muster a response to the playwright, he was once again thrown off. By Granel, this time around.

&quot;<em>What a fucking idiot!</em>&quot; Ace&#39;s complaints mixed with Donald&#39;s, a cry of desperation in response to his recklessness. His hand went to his oversized gun, but his head turned elsewhere.

The rookie.

He groaned, leaving his weapon to run in Emeilia&#39;s direction. With no time to waste, he raised her off the ground, putting her body on his shoulder. He immediately ran off again, hoping to put as much distance between him and the fray. As much as he wanted to, he couldn&#39;t engage William while she was at risk, and he didn&#39;t trust her to run off fast enough on her own because of the swamp&#39;s disadvantageous terrain.</span>

The unmistakable presence of a Berserker was clear even to them. They have found their prey. Also, it appeared that Vortigern wasn&#39;t alone either. They had another with them.

&quot;<strong>that Caster bastard</strong>...&quot; The voice of a certain Scottish Saber came from the trees before another sound overtook it shortly after.

<em>Crash</em>

A violent burst of power erupted from the trees as Berserker launched themselves from their position towards Vortigern. Their arm reeled back, ready to bring it down upon them once they got within reach of them. They came from the other side that Octavius launched his own attack. A full-on assault from three different angles.</span>

&quot;You were just a means to an end. Pillars for Vortigern to stand on. If anything, I should thank you all for showing up here! Now the feast can begin...&quot; He snickered, licking his lips before noticing that Granel had gotten suspiciously close, until...

&quot;Whoops!&quot; He slipped out of Granel&#39;s arms, much to the latter&#39;s surprise. They knew for a fact that they had grabbed the writer, yet there William was, standing several feet away.

&quot;Can&#39;t catch me so easily, not even my fans could manage! Self-Preservation, remember?&quot; He mocked, flaunting one of his skills. No wonder he felt like slippery meat. Granel remembered reading about a skill like that on ServantPedia™️. It wasn&#39;t an offensive ability, but it was so annoyingly effective at defense that most Servants would rather attack the Master instead.

Unfortunately, in this case, William <em>was</em> the Master. He couldn&#39;t get of Vortigern unless his own creator left the picture. William knew that too, hence why he started walking backward.

&quot;I&#39;d be glad to entertain you all, but I would rather you admire my masterpiece over here.&quot; He glanced at the Berserker. &quot;He&#39;s more than up for games today. Now, if you will excuse me...&quot;

Without another word, William ran off to the deeper recesses of the swamp, vanishing into <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#the-rattlin-bog</span>.</span>

Wordplay was never his strength, to the point Rowena called his poetry shallow and tasteless. It was a struggle for him to even follow what Granel was even talking about. The only words that he could speak involved groans and battle, which Donald so graciously decided to provide as he lunged his sword at the Berserker&#39;s neck.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> An ear shattering shriek echoed across the swamp, sending waves towards the muddy water as a clash of swords could be heard.

<em>clang!</em>

Donald&#39;s eyes were half blinded by a malicious glint. His sword was locked by the purple blade, grinding against it as he could feel his biceps cry out in pain. Whatever Vortigern was, he was strong, to the point he could feel his opponent&#39;s blade grow closer and closer, rubbing on his arm as it cut him slightly. He was being pushed back, not by any form of skill or technique, but by brute force alone.

&quot;You.....Youuuuuuuoooooooh!&quot; Vortigern snarled, staring deep into Donald&#39;s eyes. He felt ready to strike-</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>&quot;My power...&quot;</em> Vortigern stared back to Donald, remembering that he was in the middle of overwhelming the Saber. Of course, the moment he did that, he would receive a tree to the face, followed by whatever else Octavius had in store for him. However, if he took evasive maneuvers right now, then he would lose any form of pressure he had applied on Donald so far.

Vortigern was not used to thinking. He was a Berserker, born to destroy and usurp. El Cid, however, was a strategist. One honed in the art of swordplay and strategy. The tactical part of his brain had remained dormant all this time, but it was finally ready to be awakened.

<em>0.4 seconds...</em>

In less than half of a second, Vortigern had come to a conclusion. He stared at the sky, watching the tree plummet down as he raised his flaming sword and planted his feet on the ground. His arm formed an arc, similar to a whip.

&quot;Uooooooh!&quot; He cried out, tossing Tizona towards the tree and cutting it clean in half while simultaneously burning it. Octavius emerged from the destroyed projectile, attempting to use the tree to mask his true attack with Auram Pax.

Of course, Vortigern had expected that, so he employed a strategy that Octavius would no doubt be familiar with. The tyrant looked back to Donald and raised his now free hand, proceeding to slam it down the purple blade&#39;s hilt.

<em>whirrrrrr</em>

He slammed it with such force that it was now spinning repeatedly, right around Donald&#39;s own sword! He could feel his blade by nicked, his fingers being slashed and blood dripping from anything involving his arms. It was a rotating fan of death, to the point he wondered if the blade had a mind of its own.

This not only worked to subdue Donald, but to intercept Octavius as well. The blade was long and incredibly wide as well. As a spinning blade, it was wide enough to intercept Auram Pax, which grinded both blades to a halt as Octavius and Donald were now stuck to one another.

This would be the ideal time for Vortigern to counter attack, but he relented, for he sensed another opponent approaching.

&quot;Beast...&quot; The tyrant muttered as he stared at the sky, noticing Wendigo about to crash on the site of battle. Exactly what he was counting on.

While Wendigo was just a second away from landing, Vortigern briefly crouched, gathering energy in his legs before jumping as well. He soared in mid air, like a graceful eagle, colliding straight into Wendigo.</span>

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; He screamed into the beast&#39;s ears. It was a brutal clash, with both sides wrapping their limbs around each other and gnawing at their skin like vicious animals. But there was a certain degree of control to Vortigern&#39;s rage. Wendigo was the beast, but Vortigern was the tamer. Ever so subtly, during their mid air fight, he was carefully shifting the monster&#39;s balance in an effort to change their landing spot.

&quot;You all...Fall...Beneath me!&quot; He revealed his plan, suddenly shifting his weight as he spun around Wendi and gripped at the creature&#39;s face. He pushed it downward as he aimed to cushion his fall with Wendigo&#39;s body while simultaneously crashing on the two other Servants. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnugget</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

However, William wasn&#39;t stupid. He was a coward, yes. An utter scumbag, also yes. That list did not include stupid. As soon as they even hinted that they were going to bash Vortigern&#39;s skull in, William would simply tell Vortigern to go nuts. With that in mind, Granel simply did the only remaining option:

Lunge.

Maybe Vortigern would cleave him in two, and give Granel a chance to throttle the author while the others descended on the Servant. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

The actual reason was that Granel was simply pissed. He wanted to tear up William&#39;s stupid hat and feed it to the leeches. Maybe getting the snot beaten out of him would give William some inspiration for writing more human characters.

Or so Granel thought, before William squirmed out of his grip like the snake that he was. Did he just <em>teleport</em>? Granel had planned on crushing the Servant against the mud, but since he had moved, Granel found himself tasting dirt.

He got up, cursing to himself.

Right. ServantPedia™️. Emelia had mentioned that when he, Ace, and Donald had met up with the author. He would just worm his way out of any situation. That was fine, he couldn&#39;t do it forever, right?

And Granel had a lot of energy to burn through.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re shitting me. You have fans? Here?</strong>&quot; Granel spat. &quot;<strong>Donald, Vortigern is all yours! William&#39;s mine.</strong>&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Well, Donald was learning! Just not in a good way. 

First: Vortigern was <em>strong</em>. Much too strong to fight with strength. He would have to be the David to the Goliath if he hoped to come out of this one alive. 

Second: Vortigern was fast. The way he reacted to Octavius’ tree-spear and consequent swing of his sword with time to spare was of great concern. Even worse, his blade was now caught up with the other two, and the purple one had been spun like an axel. It was near impossible to break free and not lose his blade, which pricked and cut the outside of his fingers. 

Three: Vortigern was way too damn smart for his own good. Being able to process all these actions, counter them near perfect, <em>and</em> turn the leap from the big beast into another attack was simply too much for himself. That one was no fault of his own, just a difference in how they operated. 

That was all the time he had to think, there was a pseudo-projectile to dodge! 

“I’ll let ye ‘ave ‘im if ye <em>really</em>--”

Donald side-stepped, if only barely. The pair that crashed down would send waves from the point of impact, which pushed the Scot even further back. His sword was still safely in his grasp, but the trickle of blood and general water would make it hard soon.

“Want!”

For now, he would whip out his Flintlock and take aim. Within a few seconds of the land, Vortigern would hear the sound of gunfire. Two shots, near back to back, going right his way. 

To approach was suicide, for now. Even with one sword, he was still–

Wait, one sword? Then, where did…</span>

For a moment, he didn’t even look like the mad beast he was, but someone more intelligent, more tactical. The doctor had moved back far enough to where he didn’t have to fall victim to the brutality the battle brought on. . . Even with two sabers, and the berserker, nothing seemed to be working. Nothing!</em>

<em>Dante was unaware when it came to fighting, but he wasn’t ignorant. He couldn’t do anything, his magecraft nothing but an obstacle that could have been turned against him with that purple blade nearby the Tyrant’s grasp. He couldn’t even interfere, knowing how well that beast was, and seeing how Anthony had likely been killed swiftly by Vortigern’s own blade, a magus, no, a human would have been nothing but a fly to him. He’d be killed swiftly.</em>

<em>As the three servants had gone about their battle, Dante had saw how Granel had ran after William, who was quick to slip out of the security Guard’s grasp and retreat. The doctor let out a breath. He had to move, somehow, somewhere. He had to choose, to stay and fight. . . And likely be left in the collision between blades and blows, or go after William as well, in order to give Granel any support he could. He had questions as well, why would he have wanted to make a servant that wasn’t recorded? How had he managed to get hold of a servant that wasn’t his? Everything was beginning to wind in his brain, all of it making his gears churn and go on. Fortunately, the latter was more pleasant than the former. He could get to William, he simply needed to get past Vortigern. Which, thinking about it now, wasn’t simple at all. And with how quick Granel and the author’s silhouettes were slowly fading away into the distance, the doctor needed to act quick.</em></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Ace remained silent to the rookie&#39;s protests. His sleek dress shoes glowed a light red as he ran, and a shift in his running posture was felt. His feet no longer sunk inside the muddy earth, Emeilia could easily notice. They merely bounced off of the ground with each step he took, almost adding to his overall speed.

Minutes of running later, the two found themselves in a dense forest, a sizable distance from Vortigern and the three other Servants. Ace finally put down Emeilia on the ground, rolling the shoulder she was previously carried on.

&quot;Do not underestimate a Servant&#39;s destructive ability,&quot; The man spoke, pointing to the Servants, little more than dots in the distance. &quot;And that goes quadruple for our current situation. Hell, I&#39;m not even sure you&#39;re safe <em>here</em>, to be frank.&quot;

Ace&#39;s hand fished in his suit, taking out a sizable military knife with a dark blade. He pressed its handle onto the rookie&#39;s hands.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be an understatement to call this place a <em>battlefront</em>, your very first battlefront. Stay alert at all times, always keep your surroundings in mind, never stop moving. Your enhanced optics should give you the edge when it comes to assessing the situation. If things get too dicey, retreat back to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#forest-camp</span>. If you need to, use this for self-defense. You went through the obligatory course in close-combat, you should know how to properly wield a knife.&quot;

He looked back once more time to Emeilia. Leaving her alone a second time didn&#39;t sit right with him, yet he knew it to be necessary. Both for their mission, and to further her education. Experiences such as these served to forge a soldier&#39;s character. This was what Emeilia <em>needed</em> more than anything else, the stepping stone that would allow her to go beyond her status as a mere rookie.

&quot;<em>Survive.</em>&quot; An important weight was placed behind that word. The man looked dead serious. &quot;This is an order, Emeilia. One that you absolutely cannot disobey.&quot;

Finally, Ace turned towards the scream’s general direction, then ran.</span>

The only time she saw a Servant in action was Berserker repairing the ship and when the other attacked them with the earth itself. They were isolated cases. None of them were <em>truly</em> in combat, and already she could tell the difference with what was going on with Vortigern and the other three from afar. 

With the blade placed in her head, her subtle shaking was made all the more noticeable. The wave of information that poured from Ace was difficult to process with her heart racing so quickly. The gist of it was understood. Keep moving and watch your surroundings. Retreat back to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#forest-camp</span> if needed. 

But what of Ace? 

That singular thought entered her mind as she attempted to voice her concerns. &quot;Ac-&quot; The words <em>&#39;Survive&#39;</em> stopped her in her tracks. An absolute order. 

Before she could answer him, Ace took off running to aid the others. Emeilia was left alone to assess the situation from a distance. 

&quot;The same goes for you, Ace.&quot; Emeilia spoke those words under her breath as she tightened her grip on the knife before slipping away out of sight.</span>

Two Servants of considerable mass striking each other in such a way meant that there was no winners in that engagement. Berserker felt their frame shaken to its core from the collision, but fortunately they were a <em>Berserker</em>. A destructive force capable of tearing up the earth itself given the chance. 

&quot;<strong>▅▃▃▃▬▬▬▅▃▃▃———!</strong>&quot;

Without a second wasted, Berserker started to rip and tear into Vortigern while they were in the air, only furthering the ideal that Berserker was the wild beast between them. Their aerial combat didn&#39;t last long as Berserker found themselves underneath Vortigern before crushed underneath them once they landed. 

However, Berserker wasn&#39;t a simple beast to be tamed so easily. 

Berserker grabbed onto Vortigern&#39;s wrist, holding onto it with all their strength while their eyes flared up again. The area around them suddenly became cold before Berserker let loose a roar as an burst of ice and freezing winds erupted forth from Berserker.</span>

They now had a three-to-one advantage on the Berserker, however whatever development that the Frankenstein&#39;s monster of a servant had gained over the last few encounters, it made their numbers advantage into more of a battle of attrition than anything. He was smarter, stronger, and faster than he was before. Less a brute and more of a legitimate fighter, albeit a monstrous animal of a fighter, but still his strategy and fighting style had been evolving as he fought. That couldn&#39;t be more evident than the mad king fighting three servants at once and countering them much the same. 

However, the Roman wouldn&#39;t be caught in the Berserker&#39;s same tricks a second time, he had already dealt the brunt of the spinning blade and having the full weight of the servant on his body, and he wasn&#39;t willing to be stuck in the same predicament twice. As soon as his sword was intercepted why the spinning blade, the Roman dismissed his sword, and using his momentum, he flipped to the side of the crashing Berserkers, sliding through the marsh waters into a tree. Then he heard his master speak as well as seeing him off to the side of the battle, heading away, which was good, he couldn&#39;t afford any distractions, especially with this Vortigern, he had to put everything into this battle. 

He would try to do as Dante suggested. Those wings would be his to tear off.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Although he now had an objective, the Berserkers&#39; dance of death made the Roman hesitate. He had felt the Geneva Berserker&#39;s cold once before, he didn&#39;t want to tempt fate by engaging in a class quarters brawl next to the creature. Hindering both of their skill sets with the fear of friendly fire would only lower the chances of success. At least the other Saber had a weapon besides his saber, the firearm made that fool a much-needed versatile intermediate force. Either way, the Emperor needed to return to the battle.

As the Wendigo attempted to flash freeze the mad king, Octavius would take a sprint to pose on the tree before launching himself back into the fray. His launch sent him above the quarreling Berserkers, good thing that Vortigern preferred to be on top of else this assault wouldn&#39;t work. The Roman summoned his blade back to his hand above the tyrant and spun, making a cut along the King&#39;s back longways as he landed off to the Berserker&#39;s opposite side.

&quot;We take his wings, then we take his hands, then we take his legs, and then off with his head!&quot; He called out the simple plan that was surely easier said than done to the other servants, hopefully, this ragtag group of servants would be able to synchronize against this behemoth and pull off some sort of victory, at least so far they had taken minimal injury as a whole, although the Emperor knew that the tide of battle could shift at any moment with this Vortigern. 

He hoped that the Caster would be dealt with as his involvement would make this battle a whole lot direr. The Roman could remember the boost he felt on the boat, of Vortigern, got one of those power-ups added to his normal power, they would get slaughtered. Although it was a little late to consider that as a problem, he could only hope that the masters would deal with the pink menace.</span>

Donald and Octavius had thankfully jumped out of harm&#39;s way, but this simply meant that their follow up attacks would be rushed and erratic. Two bullets whizzed through Vortigern, piercing his chest and shoulder respectively as he smelt the burning fragrance of gunpowder in the air. This was followed by Octavius jumping around him like an elegant dancer, before a warm liquid seeped out of his back as Vortigern realized that he had been cut.

&quot;Uooooh...&quot; He emitted grisly groans once he realized that Wendigo&#39;s beastly instincts had returned. The fiend had latched onto Vortigern&#39;s wrist, keeping him pinned as a wave of cold blanketed his entire body. His flesh was chilled, being scraped away from the sheer cold alone which resulted in a slew of bloody icicles falling down the swamp. The mud had frozen solid, causing the terrain to be slippery and frail. Both the bullet wounds and the slash on his back were now closed, being encased in ice as the tyrant of Britain now resembled an igloo more than anything else. If the Wendigo kept this up, then they wouldn&#39;t need to defeat Vortigern: It was far easier to simply imprison him.

Of course, that implied that they had succeeded.</span>

Wendi&#39;s instincts reemerged, warning it of an incoming projectile. It swiftly dodged out of the way, realizing that the flaming sword had come flying back. Tizona had attempted to return to its owner, but it certainly could not have predicted that Vortigern would be frozen solid at the time of arrival. It chopped off one of the king&#39;s hands as a result, causing Wendi to stare in confusion as they were now holding the wrist of a disembodied limb.

<em>fsssssss</em>

But the heat of Tizona was all that Vortigern needed. It was fire that could not be silenced through cold or temperature alone. It even pierced Magecraft, making it a godly blade that could strike down even Divine Spirits when wielded by its original owner. Vortigern was not El Cid, but he could wield it all the same. His body rattled, gradually being unthawed by the surrounding heat as he broke himself free of his icy prison.

<em><strong>&quot;RRRRRRRUOOOOOOOOOOOOGH!&quot;</strong></em> He snarled, feeling groggy after his nap. He regained consciousness and inspected the scene around him, including himself. He noticed his missing hand, now being gripped by Wendigo&#39;s hands. He put two and two together. Then, he growled.

<strong>&quot;You think...That stops me?&quot;</strong>

Blood spat out of his right arm&#39;s stump, which was missing up to the elbow. He raised whatever remained of his arm and lunged forward, proceeding to smash his bloodied stump right in the Wendigo&#39;s face.

&quot;I command thee....<em><strong>KNEEL! Foul beast!&quot;</strong></em> He shouted with the ferocity of a demon and the dignity of a king. Wendigo&#39;s jaw cracked as they received a blow so potent that their head was crushed downward. They hit the ground, face first as their mouth never truly recovered from the impact, leaving their jaw dangling around like a horrifying monstrosity.</span>

But Vortigern wasn&#39;t done yet. Despite his injuries, he wouldn&#39;t not budge. He grabbed the arm that the Wendigo had now dropped and proceeded to forcibly reattach it to his stump. It was shoddy patchwork that barely resembled healing Magecraft, but the nerves connected and the tissue reformed itself. You could still notice the site of the cut if you paid attention, but his arm seemed to be functioning again.

He gripped Tizona, extracting it from the now boiling swamp as he glared daggers at both Donald and Octavius, as if deciding on who to face first, before tilting his entire body towards Octavius. Chills went down the Roman&#39;s spine as they realized that Vortigern&#39;s stance felt familiar. They reminded him of his instructor, no, <em>himself.</em>

&quot;I...owe you.&quot; Vortigern said cryptically, much to Donald and Octavius&#39; curiosity. It was then that the Roman realized just how terrifying of an opponent they were. Vortigern gripped Tizona with both of his hands, before proceeding to raise it upward. The blade burned even brighter. That stance, that movement, it was just like...

<em>...when Octavius had unleashed Auram Pax.</em>

&quot;Noble...&quot; The Berserker whispered.

<strong>&quot;Phantasm...&quot;</strong>

<em><strong>&quot;Release.&quot;</strong></em>

A flash of light emerged, piercing the clouds and reaching the sky. Tizona now resembled a scorching ray of sunshine more than anything else, as if Octavius had incurred the wrath of the Sun itself.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-fix">NOBLE PHANTASM - TIZONA: THE FORBIDDEN SUNLIGHT</div>

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; Vortigern screamed, bringing his fury down and his blade along with it. A gigantic beam crashed down on Octavius, threatening to snuff his life out from the sheer amount of mana and heat concentrated behind it. Even Donald and the Wendigo weren&#39;t safe, feeling the aftershocks of the heatwaves contained behind that destructive blast. It threatened to supplant them and raise them above ground, before sending them flying away towards God knows where.</span>

To top it all off, even the foul beast contributed with its icy prison. By all means, Vortigern should’ve been at least scratched and aware that the odds were against him

Unfortunately, that was anything from the truth of the matter. While his arm had been cut clean off by his own sword, its heat had melted the ice. The cold shackles were smashed to smithereens, much like the beast moments after. With a few free moments, he <em>re-attached</em> his own bloody arm. Either this guy was beyond even a Servant, or he had some outside help from the one bard. A two versus three was not in their favor when one alone nearly equaled three.

It did not stop there. Vortigern stared down the Roman.

The sword rose to point at the sky. 

“Oh, fer the love of…”

Yep, this was a Noble Phantasm alright! One to scorch his own hair, despite not being the target. Donald dashed backwards yet again, with a new string of curses to follow. This was going to be his most disastrous battle yet.

However, Vortigern had briefly forgotten his second sword. With the bright glow from the blow that would incinerate one of his two allies, he spotted the blade near the Berserker. It’s purple glow made it obvious as well, a beacon to its position in the dark water.

As soon as the heat died down to a bearable temperature, Donald would make a mad dash for the weapon with a raised sabre and a grimace. Maybe Lady Luck would keep him safe from the behemoth’s gaze long enough to stand a chance…</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">That bastard, of course would go for the ironic and thematic strike. To think that the mad king would also have such a destructive Noble Phantasm. The only thing that the Tyrant failed to remember was that he could regenerate from his injuries, Octavius couldn&#39;t. To say the emperor was displeased with his current predicament and the irony present with the situation was an understatement. Whether he was pleased or disappointed hardly mattered anymore, Octavius was facing down the direct consequences of his actions from the prior battle. There was nowhere to run, nothing to use as cover, and no options that he could use to reasonably get out of this spot without facing the brunt of Vortigern&#39;s Noble Phantasm. That meant that if he wanted to live, the Emperor of Peace needed to respond in kind to the Berserker. The Saber held Auram Pax to his side, preparing for a sideways slash. The Roman planned to fight Noble Phantasm with Noble Phantasm. The light of two separate futures that had to meet to reveal whose Will was stronger. Two fakes acting as the real article. 

Golden Peace versus Forbidden Sunlight.

<strong>&quot;Noble Phantasm...&quot;</strong>

The Emperor spoke in a hushed tone, from the outside it would seem as though the Roman was praying to his Gods, awaiting his death, however that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.

<strong>&quot;Release.&quot;</strong>


<strong>&quot;Behold the power of the conquerors of the world. Witness the price of peace wrought upon those that would deny progress. Gaze upon the Roman who stands against you. Lay your eyes upon God, tyrant. Auram Pax! RAAAAAAAAAAHHHH&quot;</strong>

Upon the proclamation called out by Octavius, the Emperor responded to the Mad King in kind as his body and blade became wreathed in flame and mana, swinging Auram Pax to meet Vortigern&#39;s Tizona.

Everyone present would witness the clash between the Flames of a Tainted Sun and the Flames of a Violently acquired Peace.

Two Monarchs carrying the will of other people&#39;s fire.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Berserker only needed to subject Vortigern to more bursts of cold before they were frozen in place. However, they weren&#39;t going to wait until that happens. It was better to finish them off now. They brought up their other arm and attempted to pierce their opponent&#39;s chest straight through, only to be stopped by their instincts. <em>Something was coming.</em>

Narrowly avoiding the spinning blade that came back, Berserker retreated their hand as the very same blade took Vortigern&#39;s own arm. 

The scene that unfolded before them confused Berserker. That confusion didn&#39;t last long as the sound of bone cracking underneath the force of a blow landed rung out in the air. A dislocated jaw was no issue to Berserker. The real issue came when they saw, out of their eye, Vortigern unleashing their Noble Phantasm, along with Octavius matching his with their own Noble Phantasm. 

Their jaw will need to wait. Right now, they needed to get out of the blast radius of such a collision.

Once they got out from under from Vortigern, they knew they couldn&#39;t get far enough in time so they resorted to kneeling before implanting their hands into the earth. Their eyes flared up once more as a storm of ice surrounded them. This wouldn&#39;t protect them fully. The least it can do is ground them and mitigated some of the heat. It wasn&#39;t much, but it was better than tanking two Noble Phantasms instead.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">El Cid was a champion. Spain&#39;s greatest hero, and a warrior whose name had echoed for generations to come. He was no leader, nor was he a genius, but in terms of mastery of the battlefield, he was second to none. Even if Vortigern was a shadow of Rider, he still held all of those skills and memories that the Servant before him had.

Octavius was not just fighting a leader, but one of the greatest warriors who had ever lived. That was the main difference between the two.

And it showed.

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;

Seconds passed as Octavius could barely feel his fingertips anymore. He held Auram Pax proudly, but could see that his beam was making no progress. His advance had stalled. For the first time in his lifetime, Rome had <em>stopped its advance.</em> No enemy had ever forced him to pause. No army had ever caused him to retreat.

Things got worse as he saw his beam visibly retract. It cracked like glass, letting Tizona&#39;s flames seep in as he could feel the gap in power between him and Vortigern. His feet started leaving skid marks on the swamp, his body being pushed backward from the sheer strength alone.

No, this was more than strength. It felt as if Auram Pax&#39;s divine aura was being penetrated by Tizona itself. A sword worthy of felling a God, one blessed by a Lord from a religion beyond that of Rome. This type of divinity was something Octavius had seldom experienced, let alone fought against.

&quot;Ashes to ashes...&quot; Vortigern muttered, gripping his blade tightly as he started spinning it around, causing a vortex of flames to emerge from the two pillars of light. &quot;Dust to dust!&quot;</span>

Both beams imploded, cracking into shards of light before a shockwave of raw power hit the two fighters and everything around them. The difference was that Vortigern stood tall and proud, while Octavius felt the brunt of the force due to being on the losing side of that struggle. He felt his armor crack as he almost lost his balance from the impact alone, his feet trembling and his arms going numb. For a second, he was almost going to <em>kneel</em> from the force of the Berserker alone. A humiliating thought that filled him with anger.

But it wouldn&#39;t be as painful as what followed next, as the vortex of flames finally reached him, surrounding him completely as he was blanketed by flames that threatened to scorch him alive. He could see Vortigern in the distance, sword still raised as the Berserker prepared to end the Roman&#39;s life, until he noticed Donald scurry off in the distance.

The Saber was rushing towards the downed Colada. They were rushing for <em>Rowena.</em></span>

...

Wendigo could not avoid a few burns here and there, but their ace had succeeded in reducing their injuries by 90%. Octavius wasn&#39;t so lucky and neither was Donald, but it wasn&#39;t as if the creature cared. All they cared about was obliterating this beast known as Vortigern, who had foolishly turned their back on them. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span></span>

Now!

Donald raced forward, low to the waterline. The heat still hadn’t dissipated, but it was bearable. While this was an obviously dangerous venture, it felt extremely necessary. There was no way in hell they’d beat him through normal means, and that sword looked very dangerous. Octagon had said something about the ability to corrupt Magic, and that sounded really good.

Unfortunately, it was more than just a sword that glowed purple: it also housed another soul. Rowena’s actual ‘life’ was still up in the air on being real or fiction, but he heard her voice all the same. 

Donald stole a glance behind him at the frantic sounds of movement, and his jaw nearly hit the mud below. There wasn’t even time to shout obscenities as he was forced to abandon his bum rush. Hell, it was barely enough time to get out of the way. Red hot pain shot through his side as he avoided <em>most</em> of the blow. 

“Grhaaaaaaa!” His sabre pushed the other one away, enough to let him escape the immediate vicinity of Vortigern. Not enough to be safe, but enough for a breath or two. Another shot was fired out, point-blank in the direction of his foe. 

Great, singed hair <em>and</em> a singed torso. What was next?!

“Octagon! Get yer ass up and fire another o’ those flame shots!”

While his allies rallied together, he would do his best to dodge and weave between any sword swipes and punches. So long as those other two didn’t interrupt at a bad moment, he’d manage. For now.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">He had lost the clash against the mad king. As the flames and energy made their way to the Emperor, he was floored by the force of the explosion, crashing into the treeline, his body broken and beat from taking the brunt of the attack. His armor was broken, particularly his gauntlets and cracks appeared elsewhere on the armor. As he opened his eyes after the attack he saw Vortigern, preparing to end him. Truly, irony found a will and a way to mock the Roman. At the last moment, however, the tyrant changed direction, which confused the Roman for a moment before he looked in the direction. Donald had made a mad dash to the other sword of Vortigern. This was delightful news, that meant that Vortigern could be distracted via keep away with that living sword of his. He had to thank Donald at some point for the save some time if they even lived for him to have the chance.

He heard Donald&#39;s plea to use Auram Pax another time, but the Emperor simply scoffed as he stood up again.
&quot;I can&#39;t keep launching my Noble Phantasm over and over. I have one more opportunity to use it and I can&#39;t simply throw it out at random!&quot; He said as he took a few steps forward, his body hurt, which was an understatement of course, but he had to keep moving forward. The Caesar grit his teeth and launched back towards Vortigern, 

&quot;Never turn your back on an opponent you insolent Berserker!&quot; Octavius called out as he ran his blade into the back of Vortigern, right in the middle of his wings as the mad king closed in on Donald. While he couldn&#39;t launch another Auram Pax just yet, he could still give support to the other Saber. As well, Octavius looked to the side to the Wendigo, he wondered why the creature hasn&#39;t returned to the battle yet, they could use any support from the allied Berserker as they could get.

Although, the Emperor didn&#39;t realize how much he would be regretting these sentiments.</span>

They were safe from the main blunt of the attack. Although, it was only because they were not the main target from the Noble Phantasm. They were simply <em>nearby</em> when it happened. 

With a hand on their jaw, a sickening crunch was made as they forced it back into place as it wouldn&#39;t hang limp any longer. Though, after that, Berserker heard something else.

&quot;▅▅▅▅▅▅!&quot;

Berserker twitched as the voice within them spoke once more. It warned Berserker that things will not end well should they rely on their brute strength alone. Vortigern has them beat in that department. The previous attacks made that painfully clear. 

&quot;▅▅▅▅...&quot;

If they wanted to take down this prey of theirs, they needed to shift the scales in their favour.</span>

Berserker stood up.

<strong>Rumble</strong>

A large concentration of Mana was being formed around Berserker in the form of winds and ice particles which seemed to grow in intensity as they gathered what they needed to cast their Noble Phantasm. Ace felt it too. That draining effect of their Mana being taken from them.

Even Berserker&#39;s fellow servants could tell what they were planning. 

Just as Vortigern attempted to scorch the place, Berserker sought to freeze it all over.

<em><strong>RUMBLE</strong></em>

Their azure eyes flared up once the Mana reached its critical mass. The flames nearly rivalled their sole remaining antler in height. The cold air rushed into their lungs as they prepared to release a mighty roar.

His blows grew more violent, forcing Donald to retreat with well-timed parries and expert footwork. There was no hope for the Saber to overwhelm their opponent, so all they could do was buy time. Bullets flew, and their aim rang true, peppering Vortigern&#39;s skull and grown. Two holes appeared in the monster&#39;s cranium, yet they seemed unfazed.

No, the only thing that saved Donald there was Vortigern prioritizing Colada over his opponent. They lunged at the ground, grabbing the sword and staring at it, mesmerized. Donald was confused, watching as the Berserker started snuggling at their own blade for a second.

The Roman took advantage of the Berserker&#39;s blind spot, stabbing them right in the back as Vortigern saw the tip of Auram Pax&#39;s blade emerge from the center of his chest.

&quot;Uooooooooh!&quot; Vortigern snarled in pain and rage, though his frustrations were the result of Octavius interrupting his conversation with Rowena more than anything else.</span>

Before she could finish, an ominous cold blanketed the three inside of the swamp. The mud disappeared, replaced by layers of snow. The red sky had been masked by a heavy blizzard, one strong enough to mask the world around them. They could only see faint shadows in the distance, namely trees and figures moving in the dark.

The Wendigo was long gone.</span>

A hunger so overwhelming that it went beyond the levels of lust and desire. It crawled into the realm of necessity, something that would cause him to die if he did not sate this irrational desire.

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; He cried out at the sky, driven mad by repulsive instincts. He turned around, glaring at Octavius like he were a delectable pile of meat. Instead of removing Auram Pax, he hugged at the Saber tightly, burying his face into Octavius&#39; neck and sinking his monstrous teeth inside of the Servant&#39;s skin. Blood spurted out, along with traces of mana as the Roman felt his neck being mauled.</span>

It was not a game Donald would do well in for the long run. However, it stopped without a single word or the preparation of another Noble Phantasm. Instead, he returned to his fallen blade.

Vortivern… cuddled his blade? His face rubbed against the cold metal in a way one would do with a lover or a pet. It was hard to do anything but stop and stare at the bizarre twist of events. No wonder he was so rabid to get his sword back, if this is how he viewed the long hunk of metal. 

Not even that would last long. Soon enough, everything would be replaced. The mud became deep snow, which came down from the sky. The trees were spread out, and were difficult to spot in the spontaneous blizzard. The temperature dropped until it was no warmer than it had been in the mountaintops. 

And the hunger… was strong.

This was no normal hunger. It was a deep, primal one. A desire to consume and gorge on just about anything present and able to be eaten. That included Vortigern, who seemed to be afflicted with the same feeling. His face was currently buried in Octavius’ neck, and a crimson stream emerged from the spot where they met.

That looked… no! Donald smacked himself with the flat of his own blade. A red mark emerged from the point of impact, a reminder of what would happen again if he thought about how delectable his allies and foe were. 

He dashed forward in a much similar fashion to the Roman, and started to slash upon Vortigern&#39;s back. The opportunity to feast on his foe was hard to ignore, yet it was imperative he do. Otherwise, he was no better than the beast himself.</span>

Energy? <strong>Hunger?</strong> It was certainly enticing indeed to the Emperor. He could hear the roars from the Berserkers around the arena, although the only thing on the mind of Octavius was the taste of blood in his mouth. It mattered little that it was his own, he simply enjoyed the taste. In fact, when Vortigern turned around, he hardly held onto Auram Pax as the mad king held onto the Roman. Held onto him, then took a bite out from his neck. Octavius felt as though he should have been more alarmed by this, however, at this current moment all he could see was red. Was it the injuries he&#39;d already exchanged in the battle that ruptured his mental processes? Was it this fantastic new field of effect that consumed his thoughts, it was difficult to know for sure, but for the Roman, he made a toothy smile as he brought his right arm to his side in a knife hand, subsequently stabbing it into his assailant&#39;s stomach while bringing his left hand to the King&#39;s face and rending the berserker&#39;s head from his neck, slowly himself away from the king, using the assault that his good comrade Donald was oh so graciously committing to the brutes back as extra help. He jammed his hand further into the Berserker, using that in tandem with his other hand to push them apart, finally launching the Roman away from the king, covered in blood.

First, he licked his hand clean of the Berserker&#39;s blood then he began wiping up the blood on his armor and body, tasting and slurping up the blood that covered his body. Perhaps the darker aspects of Octavius&#39;s story were sleeping through due to the Wendigo&#39;s slight nudge. All the while, the Roman&#39;s neck healed bit by bit as he devoured the blood on his body. Soon enough, however, the Roman seemed redder than he did prior, his armor now actually stained red as he looked like some sort of bloody phantom.

&quot;Give me more blood, would you?&quot; He said weirdly casually with his regular tone of voice as he spirited back into the fray with a slightly crazed look in his eye. &quot;Rome demands it!&quot; His hands were to his side in the shape of knife-hands, even without his blade within reach, the bloodlusted Caesar was going to try his best to create wounds.</span>

Thus it makes their seemingly &#39;calm&#39; demeanor all the more unsettling. However, as Vortigern will soon learn, Berserker is anything but calm at the moment. 

Emerging from the snowstorm out of thin air is Berserker. <strong>Presence Concealment A</strong> made closing the distance unnoticed all too easy. A flurry of strikes came from them. Their claws aimed to rip and tear Vortigern to shreds on the spot. 

But, before they could turn focus on the ravenous beast that remerged to make a meal out of him, they backed off to disappear into the storm once more. 

<em>Hit and Run tactics.</em>

The attacks were meant to maim and wound their prey until they could no longer fight back. 

Again and again Berserker appeared to deliver more attacks upon Vortigern. However, Berserker was a beast. They were no tactician. They lacked the mindset to make these attacks sporadic and without patterns. So, with a careful enough eye, one could slowly begin to predict when and where Berserker would appear next.

It was cold and lacerating, yet Octavius&#39; flesh was more than enough to distract him. Even the Roman agreed, indulging in their pleasures as they pried Vortigern away from their neck and shoved them aside, before lapping up their own blood and looking deranged.

&quot;Uooooooh!&quot; Vortigern snarled, as if implying that Octavius didn&#39;t deserve any share of blood compared to him. The two were about to fight yet again, before Wendigo intervened, carving a piece from Vortigern&#39;s flesh with its claws. It left no room for counterattack as it retreated in the blizzard, vanishing like a shadow in face of light.

Donald and Octavius stared in awe, watching Wendigo reappear and disappear in the span of seconds, each time chopping another piece from Vortigern&#39;s flesh. Blood started to bathe the snow, causing Vortigern to crawl on all fours as he started lapping up his own blood, driven mad by his hunger. It was a pitiful sight.</span>

<em>&quot;The...The insolence of it! There is no amount of brutality I could bring against you that would satisfy me!&quot;</em> The queen seethed, the sword stabbing into the puddle of blood as Vortigern&#39;s eyes reflected on it. He groaned for a second, his mind paused. Colada was made of the purest steel, a steel so pure that it was incorruptible, giving it the properties to deflect all sorts of Magecraft tossed at it. Being in Colada&#39;s presence was slowly reducing the effects of the Wendigo&#39;s Noble Phantasm on Vortigern...

Berserker wasn&#39;t even putting up any sort of defence either. Their sole focus was to finish off Vortigern before their mana stores ran out. Perhaps they were confident that they could at least take a few blows to let themselves so open like this...</span>

A lone voice broke the silence, filling her with shock as a flaming blade parried the Wendigo&#39;s latest attack. The Berserker couldn&#39;t help but writhe in pain, staring at its charred claw that had hit the blunt edge of Tizona&#39;s blade, yet painful all the same.

This entire time, Wendigo had been attacking with impunity, causing it to put more power and speed behind its blows. However, this was under the assumption that it would never receive retribution. That Vortigern had been truly captured by its Noble Phantasm.

How shocking would it be, then, to discover that Vortigern&#39;s previous actions were merely an act?

<em>&quot;For a second, I truly felt hungry.&quot;</em> The king thought to himself, stabbing Wendigo with Tizona right in the knee, preventing it from retreating to the blizzard. The flaming sword was a perfect counter to those frigid lands, melting any form of snow or frost that could protect the Wendigo.

<em>&quot;I was hungry. I wanted to devour. But...&quot;</em> He stared at Colada lovingly. 

<em>&quot;No matter how intoxicating that desire might be,&quot;</em> He snarled. <em>&quot;the love burning within me now is enough to sober me up!&quot;</em></span>

For once, it was no longer the apex predator, but yet another creature waiting to be hunted. It felt sickening to the beast, to the point it released all sorts of mana limitations and unleashed the full extent of its Noble Phantasm.

Colada&#39;s length grew by a significant amount, absorbing all the Magecraft casted in the air as it redirected it into a single strike designed to overpower its original caster. In other words, the Wendigo.

<em>Cast into infamy, my honor was denied.
But who I am has never changed.
If I must brave showers of blood for the one I love...
...then I will see it done!</em>

It was a single slash. One large enough to split mountains. Wide enough to raze the earth. Yet none of that happened, for all of that power had been spent on Wendigo. The beast felt its body shatter, almost breaking into pieces instantly as one of its arms vanished while the other was in a terrible state. A diagonal cut, spanning all the way from its waist to its shoulder, was wide agape. If Wendigo weren&#39;t so sturdy, they would have been cleanly cut in half by now. In fact, they were halfway there, their organs and intestines dropping on the snow from the damage received. They were a dead man walking.

Survival was impossible. They had seconds left, at most. Enough mana in reserve for one more act. Be it folly or revenge, it was up to them to spend it. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles, Brownie Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating</span></span>

To think they would spend them standing there...

.

..

...

&quot;<em>Is this how it ends, you beast of famine?</em>&quot; 

The voice inside their head spoke to Berserker, for what might be the last time from the looks of things. 

&quot;<em>You, who would steal my body from me once more and force me to watch your ravenous ways.</em>&quot;

Berserker&#39;s cold blood ran down the lengths of their body, pooling at the snow beneath them, as they stood there. Their body seemingly lifeless.

&quot;<em>Have you had your fill now? Your gluttonous nature sated? Can we finally rest?</em>&quot;

The voice held no resentment. No pity. Nor anger. They simply longed for rest. To be freed from this waking nightmare. For once they finally agreed on something. Rest does seem fine after all. They could use some shuteye.

A low, grumbling, and raspy, voice came from Berserker. Their own vocal cords felt like they were being torn just trying to make said voice. A voice that haven&#39;t be heard from them yet. <strong>Their own.</strong>

From whatever strength they had remaining, they used it all to grasp onto Vortigern&#39;s wrist to prevent them from pulling away as Berserker&#39;s core started to glow a icy cold blue which grew in intensity from within their grievous wound. 

With whatever Mana they had, and drained from the others, they poured it all into one last attack. An All-out burst using their <strong>Aspect of Winter</strong> with everything they had, even if it meant sacrificing their core. 

&quot;<strong>I. CHOOSE. HOW. I. DIE.</strong>&quot;

The mass of energy collected was unleashed once it reached its apex resulting in a final explosion that knocked any that did not brace for the attack. However, the moment the dust cleared the trio was back in the muddy swamp. The cold sting of winter being nothing more than memory and Berserker barely recognizable as a S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame with what little remained of it.</span>

The beast didn&#39;t have much time left to live, but like its nature implied, it was anything but honorable enough to die in peace. Vengeance and hatred fueled it, a creature born out of myth and malice, causing it to spend its last moments cursing Vortigern and preparing an attack with all of its reserves pooled into it. Rowena was the first one to notice.

<em>&quot;Vortigern, look ou-!&quot;</em>

Shards of ice ripped right through Vortigern&#39;s skin, tearing his robes into tatters as most of his blood had now left his body. An explosion followed suit, sending Vortigern and Rowena flying away while Tizona remained embedded in Wendigo&#39;s carcass.

...

A whole minute passed. A rather disorientating and quiet one. Even Donald and Octavius were confused as they suddenly realized that the hunger from before had all but vanished. Wendigo&#39;s Noble Phantasm had vanished, which meant that-

&quot;Uoooh...&quot; Vortigern grumbled, his body in critical condition as he slowly stood up, gazing at his broken limbs and torn flesh. Icicles slid out of his skin, blood on their tips as they had penetrated his organs successfully. He wouldn&#39;t die, of course, but he looked more ghoulish than usual in that miserable state. The only thing that kept him sane was the warmth of Rowena&#39;s glow, along with the satisfaction that the fight was over.

After all, Wendigo was gone. The only thing left of the beast was its frame, which Tizona was gradually melting by simply being close to it. Vortigern sluggishly dragged himself over to the Berserker&#39;s corpse, extracting Tizona from its snowy mantle and staring at the melted frame. Whatever creature that was, he was glad that it was gone, for it brought fear in his heart. Fear of losing control again.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Wendigo was a fearsome beast, and so too was Vortigern. While it seemed one-sided at first, it was turned around in the blink of an eye. The beast had made one critical error: being predictable. Vortigern capitalized and cut down the beast from where it stood near immediately, with both a fury of blows and yet another Noble Phantasm. 

It stole the very magic behind the dreaded winter and turned it back on Wendigo. Not enough to stop its own dangerous explosion, but it was too much to survive.

Donald flew back, thrown into a nearby tree. He collided and dropped down to the ground as a sack of rocks would. Dozens of cuts and scrapes littered his exposed flesh, and his clothes looked to have been thrown into an active weed trimmer. 

By the time he returned to his shaky feet, there was only a husk left of what used to be the beast. A S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame that poked out from the murky swamp. Even that was not long for this world, with the fire sword hot enough to melt it through the water.

That left their assault down to two on one. Odds horribly <em>against</em> them. 

The only thing they had in their favor was Vortigern’s own state of being. He looked hellish at best, with blood and cuts all over his body. Even his movement was slow, a good sign that the explosion had done a good number to the Berserker. Water trickled down as well, the only remains of the weapons that did the damage.

Donald yanked his own sword from the mud and slashed it around to remove the debris. With two hands on the hilt, he charged the man oblivious to the world around him. The others surely heard the explosion, they’d know how bad things were. 

If he and Octavius couldn’t stop him, then they could at least buy time for the others to get a head start or something. With a creature this big, it would be hard to pierce their Spirit Core. He settled for something a bit more mainstream.

“Yer a bastard an’ a monster!” He shouted, his sabre already on its way to pierce The King’s heart.</span>

They were two on one, yet it felt as if they were dealing with a monster that could overwhelm them all with ease. Donald had sustained his fair share of injuries in his lifetime, along with making sure other men stayed down. Never before had he seen someone like Vortigern, who would keep rising up despite all sorts of punishment that you doled out at them.

But that didn&#39;t affect his charge one bit, because that was his duty. The duty of a Heroic Spirit to fight till the very end for his Master&#39;s sake.

&quot;Silence!&quot; Vortigern shouted back, irritated by Donald&#39;s interruption. Words of bastards and monsters rang hollow in the face of how much he had suffered. How much abuse he had received from tormentors and allies alike. Rowena was the only one who cared for him. The one who saw past the visage of a king and tyrant.

It is a shame that Vortigern wasn&#39;t perceptive enough, to notice that the release of Colada&#39;s True Name was enough to destroy the thin layer of protective Magecraft that William had placed on the cardboard cutout of Rowena. It was flapping in the wind, all it took was one more push.

<em>clang</em>

He instinctively parried Donald&#39;s blow with Colada. It would have been wiser to use Tizona, since it was a far superior sword in terms of combat, along with being the sword El Cid was most familiar with, but Vortigern was not motivated by strength nor tactics, but by <strong>love.</strong>

And it was love that led to his undoing.

&quot;...U-Uoooh?&quot; Vortigern whispered, watching as the cardboard face was now disfigured, having been caught in Donald&#39;s blade. It was stabbed, then torn to shreds in a flash, removing any trace of the crudely drawn face from the world.</span>

All that was left was Colada&#39;s ominous glow. A grim reminder that it was simply, a mere sword. A mythical and magical one, but a sword nonetheless. Rowena was nothing more than someone Vortigern wished had existed. Someone to pardon his sins for him.

There was a brief moment of silence, followed by a spell of rain. Wendigo&#39;s last traces of snow had sprung to life in the Berserker&#39;s dying breath, causing them to gradually melt as they morphed into a light drizzle.</span>

Vortigern stood silent, still clutching at his swords. His mind was empty, burdened with feelings that were unbefitting of a king. Fear, sadness, grief, anger and guilt. It was all a blur, a train that showed no signs of stopping with him at the front seat.

<em>&quot;I have to apologize...To her.&quot;</em> He thought in his mind, feeling sick at the thought that he didn&#39;t even get to say goodbye. His mind was looking for someone to blame. His instincts begged him to blame Donald. To completely destroy Saber and eviscerate him, guts and all. Spray his blood and mix it with the mud. Defile his corpse until it was unrecognizable.

But the sane part of him, the innocent part of him that caused Rowena to love him, implored him to reconsider. Because deep down, Vortigern knew who was at fault.

<em>&quot;...Why did I use Colada to block that blow?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Ever since I was born, Tizona was my weapon of choice. It would have done better. Then...why?&quot;</em>

He thought about it deeply, letting emotions spill through as his eyes widened and his head ached.

<strong>&quot;I know.&quot;</strong> He glanced back to Wendigo&#39;s corpse. The melted Servant frame.

<em>&quot;That one slash. That single slash.&quot;</em> He repeated to himself. A strange warmth had cradled him the moment he cut Wendigo down. Because he wasn&#39;t alone. No, someone else had cut his foe down alongside him: Rowena.

<em>&quot;The feeling of destroying with someone else by my side...<strong>I liked it.</strong>&quot;</em> He admitted to himself, looking teary eyed. <em>&quot;I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.&quot;</em>

<strong>&quot;I WANTED TO EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN!&quot;</strong> Vortigern shouted out loud, finally speaking words and catching Donald completely off guard. The Berserker seemed to have broken down into a tantrum.

If only he had kept a level head. If only he hadn&#39;t chased that high of relying on his beloved. If only he had assessed the situation fairly.

<em>&quot;If only I hadn&#39;t loved her so much...&quot;</em></span>

A paradox. Vortigern had only won because of his love, therefore, it was impossible for him to avoid a loss caused by his own love.

It was his own fault that Rowena perished. He indirectly murdered her. All that was left now was grief and sorrow.

A fitting end for the mad king.

<em><strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em>

Vortigern turned into a vortex, swirling around Donald as he blanketed him with slashes at all sides, using a mixture of Tizona and Colada as the Saber saw red and purple. A slash to the chest, a nick to the arm, a gash to the knee. He was being tossed in a meat grinder and crushed into a pulp. What else did he expect after poking the bee&#39;s nest? Granted, he knew nothing of the cardboard cutout, besides that it looked fairly odd, but Vortigern seemed to have taken it rather seriously.

Things looked dire for Donald, until the king ended their tantrum. They wept, tears falling down on Tizona as a small vapor trail filled the air. Their guilt was soul crushing, to the point that murdering Donald didn&#39;t even feel that satisfying anymore. Not that Donald would mind, since he felt like he could barely move anymore, his arms bleeding ten times more than a woman on her period.

<em><strong>&quot;ROWENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot;</strong></em> Vortigern howled at the sky, screaming the name of a beloved who would never return again. He then jumped towards the starry ceiling, as if trying to grasp at the heavens and demand an audience with his wife again. It didn&#39;t work, causing him to simply plummet to the ground as he fell in a forward arc, landing into a deeper part of the swamp, in God knows where.

Donald and Octavius could still pursue, but they didn&#39;t know if it was worth it. Wendigo was dead, Donald was heavily injured and Vortigern seemed to be in an unhinged and unpredictable state. Plus, they hadn&#39;t received contact from their Masters in ages. What was going on?</span>

What in the hell was that all about? Why did this Berserker have such a strange attachment to a sword? Perhaps it was related to the caricature that crashed into the water with the advent of rain. 

Donald cleared his throat with much vigor and gripped his sword tight, “Ya know, that wasn’t me inten–”

“<em><strong>I WANTED TO EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN!</strong></em>”

The monsoon crashed against land.

Donald struggled to even live the first ten seconds. Even if he blocked one sword, the other was quick to punish. Their speed might’ve been even, in that ‘duel’, but the raw strength was simply too much. Arms screamed from weariness, and his legs groaned from the continued exertion. A cut to his forehead trickled blood past his brow and into his left eye, and the salty burn forced it to shut. 

This was his divine punishment for a past life lived too selfishly, he contemplated as yet another thread of red was created upon his skin. It was hard to even stand, near the end. As Vortigern wept for a lost love, Donald prepared to meet his own. 

And yet the final blow never came. Each breath felt as empty as those after his long marathon, and just as pained. The sabre shook violently against the last strike, which nearly sent in to the land of the birds. Not even Berserker had it within his heart to finish the job.

With one last scream of his beloved, Vortigern jumped off. Saber didn’t have the strength to check his new position from the ground, blade buried into the hidden ground. Sweat and blood mixed as discolored stains upon his clothes, and created a smell that rivaled Wendigo’s own. 

“Octa…Oc–Octavius… where’d the bastard go? It’s yer turn fer… a minute er two…”

Donald’s voice was deathly, a whisper within the storm of rain and insects that hovered around his half-dead body.</span>

Wendigo&#39;s NP, his Hunger that lingered within Octavius, numbly coated the mind of the Saber. Even though as quickly as his perception of the battle had been altered and returned to the status quo, he still felt pain. It wasn&#39;t the pain of hunger or battle, no no, it was something worse for the Caesar. In his blind bloodlust, he had defiled one core component of his being, he had acted unworthy of Rome, he had tried to fight like an animal rather than a Ruler. He had been <strong>tainted</strong>. So while Wendigo perished and Donald fought valiantly against Vortigern, Octavius had been weakened. He had been on his hands and knees, his body rejecting himself, the red on his armor and hair losing its luster momentarily at the apex of the battle.

As the Mad King raved on and left the battlefield, Donald would see the Emperor suffering from one of the integral parts of Octavius&#39;s being. Donald would see Octavius losing the Will of Rome.

From the manner he behaved in, the Caesar&#39;s parameters plummeted and he grew weak, his body shook in the swamp water as he struggled to breathe and stand. His wounds, which hardly bothered Octavius before, now hindered the man&#39;s ability to exist. He took shallow breaths, the wound on his neck debilitating, the cuts on his body, paralyzing, his mind, suffocating. Was he going to fall next? Was he going to die as well? Was he-</span>

Then everything came back into focus. The battle, everything. Vortigern&#39;s parting assault on Donald, the fading Saber, the long-gone Wendigo, and the image of a fleeing Vortigern. If he had been faster, if he had had more control of his own mind and body if he had only been able to snuff out the light from that wretched mad King sooner, then none of this would have had to have happened this way, now the tyrant, <em>no</em> the creature, was making his escape. Octavius stood from his pitiful location on the ground and walked in the direction of Vortigern, but stopped when he passed Donald. The servant had seen better days, that was for sure. Was this how the Roman looked as well? Was this how he had looked after the prior two engagements? 

Octavius looked back in the direction of Vortigern and then to Donald, as the red returned to Octavius&#39;s armor. He had almost forgotten himself fully. He had realized that Wendigo&#39;s Hunger had merely brought out the troublesome feelings that Octavius had this entire investigation. Regarding Vortigern, regarding this island, regarding the insanity present in the very soil. If he was going to have a chance at getting Dante off of this island to secure some sense of dignity from this godless endeavor, he would have to leave that path unsettled. 

He then finally spoke to the other Saber. &quot;I apologize for my absence. My saint graph wasn&#39;t doing too well from our departed Berserker&#39;s Noble Phantasm. In our state we can&#39;t chase the bastard down, although Vortigern is just running, not in any particular direction, he&#39;s just going. We should meet up with our masters regardless, tell them of the battle and see what&#39;s going to happen next.&quot; He said as he pats Donald on the back before walking in the direction of where their masters left to pursue the Caster, keeping in step with the other Saber in case he needed a helping hand.</span>

The beast was dead, he wasn’t terribly far off himself, and Berserker gone to who knows where. As for their next step, it could wait until they were rested up and figured out.

For now, he would drag his sore, tired body across the metaphorical finish line. His sabre would act as a make-shift cane, an anchor for Donald to put most of his weight into. Any attempts of help from Octavious would be met with a smack from both a free hand and his eyes. 

Eventually, either they would find themselves with the others, or they would cover the rest of the distance once they saw Donald in his awful state. What heartless Master would make their Servant walk when it was near impossible?

This would prove to be the case, as Saber pulled his metal stick from the ground and pushed it into another spot forward. It struck something hard, and instead slid forward. He followed suit, now on all fours on the ground. His nose nearly breached the top of the water as he glimpsed into the makeshift mirror.

Man, he looked like <em>shit</em>. How was he still alive?
