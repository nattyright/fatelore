The cottage was almost too massive, seemingly built for a giant instead of a man, but it could&#39;ve been worse.

At least they could snooze away from Wendigo&#39;s atrocious scent. Even if Ace had eventually gotten use to it, somehow...

However, Ace was a soldier, trained by Geneva to fight in any scenario. He slept light, and it would take but the slightest creak to nudge him from his slumber.

However, what followed wasn&#39;t a creak.

<strong>SLAM!</strong> The cottage shook, groaning slightly, rousing the Genevan Faction awake.

<strong>SLAM!</strong> The door splintered slightly. Something was trying to get in!

<strong>SLAM!</strong> The door flew open, and a massive man enveloped in shadow appeared in the doorway. It didn&#39;t matter who it was, the Genevan squad would have to be on their guard...—

&quot;<strong>WHO LOCKED MY DOOR!</strong>&quot; The voice boomed, inhuman.

The guard made the floorboard creak with every step he took, plunging deep inside the oversized house to find...

Nothing.

The interior of the house looked a lot different, too. Granel could&#39;ve sworn it had gotten <em>bigger</em> than before. The junk that used to be on the floor had somehow disappeared, the broken furniture had been strategically moved to a corner of the room so as not to attract attention, and everything else just looked... cleaner, somehow. Tidy, as tidy as a place overrun by vegetation could have looked.

Though, because the place was so tidy, the guard couldn&#39;t help but notice <em>two messy sleeping bags sitting in a corner of the room</em>.

&quot;We did,&quot; A voice came to break the silence coming from the guard&#39;s left, behind what little remained of the front door. <em>A dead angle for anyone looking to enter the cottage</em>. &quot;God dammit, Granel. You scared the shit out of me. I was just about ready to shoot you in the brains, too.&quot;

<em>It was soldier boy&#39;s</em>. Though, his lack of emotion contradicted his words. He had his prized antique between his hands, safety off and ready to shoot. Behind him stood young Emeilia, sandwiched between him and the wall for protection. Judging from her incredulous look, it seemed the Genevi pair weren&#39;t expecting a visit this late into the night. Even less from an ally.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Donald knew how to march. That was half of what he did in the army. Wake up, march out, set up camp, dick around for a few hours, do it again the next days. When not in a siege, on the precipice of battle, or stationed at an actual camp– pretty much if there was a place to go, there was a march to be had.

To run was a whole different story.

So, Donald found himself half-dead on his feet. Even with his measured pace and fair/average amount of breaks, it was a drag, to say the least. Once he had exited the snow, it somehow got <em>harder</em>. Perhaps due to the cold no longer counter-acting the heat that built up, or maybe it was because of the sheer distance of it all. 

Whatever the reason, it was a godsend when he knew it was close. The trees grew denser, and the sound of cute little animals that were vicious for blood became more apparent. A concern for most people, but he had grown a little used to the phenomena. Too used to it. Oh well!

In fact, he could see it right there! Granel stood outside the front entrance, nearly ready to tear down the door at the next slight that it gave him. “Granel,” Donald called out faintly. 

“Granel! Problem!”</span>

He took a step forward, grabbing Ace&#39;s hand and shaking it. It was as if the soldier&#39;s arm was going to be torn off! He picked up Emelia, spinning her about for a moment, before putting her down. It was like being on a rollercoaster from hell.

&quot;<strong>You both are well! This is excellent news. Truly, truly excellent! I had little doubt, of course, but things around here are getting stranger and stranger. So strange, in fact, that it is a surprise to see you here!</strong>&quot; 

More accurately, it was a surprise that <em>he</em> was here. To an experienced soldier like Ace, it looked like Granel had been on a non-stop march. His normally pressed suit was dirty, covered in tears and dark splotches, and there were areas were the article of clothing was torn, showing dark skin underneath.

Despite that, he looked as fresh as ever. Did this man <em>ever</em> get wounded? It was as if he wasn&#39;t even concerned by getting shot by a skilled marksman. 

&quot;<strong>I am sorry to awaken you. Glad to know that you have been utilizing my workshop. I thought my Servant was here. You haven&#39;t happened to see Donald, have you?</strong>&quot; Granel asked, before quickly looking around. His beer cans were gone. Had Ace or Emelia cleaned up, maybe?

Suddenly, Granel turned serious, having heard Donald&#39;s cry outside. He held up a finger. The message was clear: <em>zip it.</em>

Before suddenly, his face brightened, before being replaced by a mask of worry.

&quot;<strong>Donald!</strong>&quot; Granel gasped, leaving the cottage to assist his Servant, helping hoist the Scottish Saber up. The Master tapped his pocket, before producing a mana battery, which he handed to Donald.

&quot;<strong>All yours, buddy. You don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ve missed you.</strong>&quot; Granel murmured, before raising his voice.

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s good that you&#39;re here, Ace. I need your help.</strong>&quot;

Instead, he settled on the support that his Master provided. He leaned heavily on the giant man, air gulped down without almost a single other care in the world. 

Almost.

He snatched the mana battery and shoved it into his mouth, swallowed down in near desperation. “Thanks… Granel…” he managed to get out between deep breaths. What had happened to this guy? It was like he had just run a marathon for the last few hours. Not even the energy to make a joke about the companions that had used their house as a camp spot. 

“So much… snow… mysterious Servant… big hole in ice… two dead investigators… whatever th’hell an ‘Executor’ is… big hole in ice…”

It was hard to make out the exact meaning behind some of his words, but the general gist of it was obvious. He had found not a whole lot of niceties in the ‘Heart’ of Nirvana, but what little there was was bad. 

“Soldier boy… let me in…” he groaned. Saber was in desperate need of a place to sit and rest, and perhaps even a spot to conk out if necessary. Even if that place was right next to that ungodly smell that was somewhere inside. Hopefully Ace would understand.</span>

&quot;Things are getting stranger?&quot; He repeated, remembering the impression of his first hand-shake with the guard. Way too strong. &quot;I <em>felt</em> things change since a few days ago. Something to do with Nirvana&#39;s leylines, I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;ve got my theories, stuff we&#39;d like to share with-&quot;

Zip it. The man followed the order instinctively. That&#39;s what being a soldier for more than 15 years will do to you, you become subconsciously obedient.

The mention of Donald was made, then a drained Donald made his entrance inside the cottage. The man caught a glimpse of the exterior beyond the Saber as he leaned on his Master. Red skies, dark clouds. His eyes widened slightly.

Soldier boy... let me in...

&quot;Things are getting stranger.&quot; Ace repeated for the second time, this time with a touch of alarm in his voice. He gave Donald a shoulder if need be, then saw him to the cottage&#39;s fireplace, beckoning him to rest on the only usable armchair this house had to offer.

&quot;...I can&#39;t guarantee our help,&quot; The man answered Granel, taking his shades off. &quot;We&#39;ve still got a mission to see through, but I&#39;m willing to listen. Put us up to speed.&quot;

Between Donald&#39;s extreme exhaustion and cryptic words, Nirvana&#39;s weather domes that had taken a nosedive seemingly overnight and the fact that <em>Granel</em> of all people needed help... nothing helped to reassure the veteran. He was left to worry despite reuniting with whom he considered his most valuable allies on the island. What a way to start the night.</span>

As expected, Emelia and the big beast itself were stationed there as well. At least one the crew was using the space properly, although that would change once he was eased into the armchair. 

He continued his deep breaths even in the seat, himself as far back as the furniture would allow him. That meant against the wall, at a roughly 45-degree angle. It was surely anxiety-inducing, but Donald had other troubles on his mind. 

Saber did not bother with words and instead reached a hand into his pocket. Two ID cards and an intricately-carved cross were shoved into Granel’s hands without anything else to explain what they were. 

With the most important of his finds handed over, he could now properly focus on proper recovery. At least his breaths were getting a lot less labored, as time went on. An A-Rank Endurance would do that, he figured.</span>

Fear from not knowing who it was that attempted to enter. To relief once she saw that it was a familiar face rather than a native who found them. Then straight back to fearing for her life once more as she was taken in Granel&#39;s strong grasp. 

&quot;It is nice to see you too, Mr. Mason!&quot; She clung onto him while he spun her around before attempting to get the world to stop spinning, and her racing heart to calm down as well.

She made sure to give Donald some distance as he was helped into the armchair to rest. 

With her reports done for the night, she had nothing to do but listen to Granel&#39;s request for help. The fact that he asked Ace meant that it was probably nothing that she could help with herself, but she remained attentive just in case there was a spot she could help with.</span>

Sit down, sit down.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he and Ace lowered the Saber into an armchair. His Servant looked worse than he did. Where were Galvin and Ankou? Dead? There was no way. Vortigern had been on the other side of the island with Granel and Dante. There was no way he could teleport.

Why, then, was only Donald here? 

He&#39;d have to ask later.

&quot;<strong>Ace.</strong>&quot; Granel said, taking a seat against the wall, causing the shack to groan. &quot;<strong>We both read the same debriefing, I assume. Our roles are nearly identical. Remember the second Investigation Team?</strong>&quot;

Granel paused for a moment. &quot;<strong>We found a survivor. He was mad. He was killed by a hulking monster. A Berserker-class Servant named Vortigern. Are you familiar?</strong>&quot;

With this mention, he casually skirted over Donald. Weren&#39;t Donald and Vortigern from similar countries? Granel didn&#39;t know Old World geography. 

&quot;<strong>Ace, listen to me. I know your job isn&#39;t the safety of the team or the populace, but if Vortigern goes around killing every wealth of information on the island, we will never leave. He killed a sick man. A sick man with presumably enough information to cut this hunt in half.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<em><strong>What if in a rampage, this Berserker tears up the schematics?</strong></em>&quot; Granel hissed. It would be a massive disaster for everyone. Ace would&#39;ve failed his job. Granel would&#39;ve failed to protect an investigator, and his contract would be breached.

To hell with the contract.

&quot;<strong>Besides, Mister Dante is currently keeping an eye on Vortigern&#39;s movements. Three investigators. Three Servants. Those are good odds.</strong>&quot;

The sky was reddish and the trees looked sickly. Something sinister was happening to the island, enough to plant seeds of doubt in people&#39;s minds. Granel snapped them back to reality as he discussed a survivor of the previous investigator team, alongside the elephant in the room, or to be more precise, the <em>monster.</em>

Vortigern was a fearsome foe. Terrifying enough to the point that Granel wondered how he had never heard of him before. All he knew was that he despised him, not only for killing a precious source of information, but a <em>man.</em> One of his own.

Before he could discuss further, however...

<strong>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!</strong>

Loud knocking came from the cottage door, causing everyone to go into high alert. Before they could even attempt to reply, the door creaked open, the person having most likely realized that it was already open.</span>

A valuable source of information he would&#39;ve been, if not for the fact that he was looking a little <em>dead</em>. So much for being a &#39;survivor&#39;. An incredibly valuable source of information had slipped between their fingers, a shame.

The name that was spoken next was indeed familiar to the veteran. He nodded his head.

&quot;I know of it,&quot; He answered, half-sitting on one side of the armchair. &quot;Dr. Colt&#39;s Saber filled me in. Scary thing. <em>Strong thing</em>.&quot;

And it was because of those details that the man had his reservations. He heard little about <em>Vortigern</em>, but each time he did, it was nasty.

&quot;But wait, don&#39;t tell me...&quot;

Granel&#39;s intentions became increasingly clear as his words kept flowing. <em>The guard wanted to bring this Vortigern down</em>.

The guard had made an attractive point. A rampaging beast could very well destroy invaluable things or people in its frenzy, potentially leaving the investigation forever unachievable...

But that was an <em>if</em>. A possibility. As a matter of fact, the Genevi could&#39;ve very well spun the argument against <em>anyone else</em> on Nirvana. Granel argued that Vortigern&#39;s volatile and violent nature could lead to the destruction of valuable clues or schematics, but really, <em>everyone on Nirvana was volatile and violent</em>. Some arguably more than others. Really, who could tell which was more detrimental to their investigation between one big crazed maniac and eighty thousand smaller maniacs.

From my standpoint, that <em>Vortigern</em> issue looks an awful lot like a &#39;they&#39; problem. If it keeps wreaking havoc everywhere, why not let it be? Let the locals deal with it. <em>We&#39;re short on hands here</em>, I don&#39;t know if we can afford to split our focus and shift our efforts towards that thing. Not to mention that, well, this isn&#39;t the <em>safest</em> endeavor. Even if the odds are in our favor, and even if we&#39;ve got someone tailing it.&quot;

Gathering the island&#39;s schematics had been the man&#39;s purpose on this mission, but an unspoken second objective laid at the back of his mind constantly: his and the rookie&#39;s safety. He couldn&#39;t afford to die, for if he did, he&#39;d be unsure of Emeilia&#39;s fate on Nirvana. Not to mention that he had many things and many other assignments he needed to accomplish after that one. Same thing for the rookie, her death here would negatively impact Geneva in a way that a botched mission couldn&#39;t.

And, the rational aspects of their survival aside, he loved himself and his fellow countrymen. 

Before the man could say anything else, the group was interrupted by knocking on the barely-standing door. A man crept inside, seemingly unaware of his surroundings in the way he addressed the investigators. A flurry of words and a few puffs of smoke later, and the Genevi was already sick of whomever had entered. The Genevi was taken aback, unsure of how to react to what was happening, what was said in front of him.

D&#233;j&#224; vu. This situation and his reaction to it felt familiar. The peculiar mannerism and the nonchalant nature of that cigar-smoking fella couldn&#39;t help but remind Ace of a little someone. <em>Shakespeare</em>.

Ace’s body tensed, ready to spring into life at the slightest misstep, the only thing keeping him from attacking being the unusual lack of a reaction to this outsider from Granel and Donald.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Genevans were as by the book as ever. Ever since visiting Geneva for himself, Granel had realized that if you ordered a Genevan to jump in front of a mana rail, they would salute, before flinging themselves into oncoming traffic with open arms.

Infuriatingly enough.

Granel could order Ace to join him, but he wasn&#39;t Ace&#39;s superior. They didn&#39;t share a department. Even if he was, it felt <em>wrong</em> to order a man to their death. They had to be willing to do so. Granel didn&#39;t want any more blood on his hands.

He felt pathetic.

&quot;<strong>Isn&#39;t that strange, though?</strong>&quot; Granel scratched his chin thoughtfully. &quot;<strong>If they could, why has Vortigern remained active since whenever it woke up? More likely, they&#39;ll just adapt to it. We cannot accept the natives here to resolve any issue. If they could, we wouldn&#39;t be in this shithole.</strong>&quot;

Surprisingly, there wasn&#39;t any anger in Granel&#39;s voice. To Donald and Ace, this was normally the part where Granel began raving about revenge and how the islanders were scum, but he just seemed <em>resigned</em>. Was that a hint of pity in his voice?

&quot;<strong>Ace.</strong>&quot; Granel stared at the man as he tossed Donald another mana battery. &quot;<strong>We are together now. Call it optimism, but we have a chance here. You, me and Mister Dante. All of our Servants. You and me can survive, it is our job. What about Emelia? Dante?</strong>&quot;</span>

Wasn&#39;t that the Servant Granel had flung at the tin can back in town? His attitude, his attire, and his desire to give everyone in the room lung cancer were the first real impressions Granel had of the man.

He disliked the Servant immediately.

&quot;<strong>El Pachinko. Don&#39;t you have a mafia to run somewhere?</strong>&quot; Granel remarked drily. Verga acted eeriely similar to a movie Granel had watched on Nirvana: <em>The Mobfather.</em> He had a desire to toss the author into the lake.

&quot;<strong>I have the utmost faith in my comrades. Thank you very much. To what do we owe this pleasure? Don&#39;t you have a stack of <em>Nirvana Times</em> articles to peddle?</strong>&quot;

Sounded terrifying, and like he’d be one of three involved with the beast. What the hell had he done to get roped into such a fiasco?

And then, Verga joined. 

As soon as he heard the voice, he knew who it was. That guy from the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#main-lab</span>! How in the ever living <strong>fuck</strong> did he show up, nearly as perfect as the time they’d seen each other last?! Donald had ran a Servant’s marathon, yet this guy got to the same place a few minutes behind with no sweat?

“You,” Donald leaned forward in his chair. The dead-tiredness was still stuck within his bones, but his lungs were almost ready to stop being so demanding with the sheer amount of air required to go back to normal. “Did ya hitch a ride in that trunk Ankou offered as soon as I left?!”

“An I thought ye were lookin’ fer William… though I still got no clue why yer first place to look was in that white hell you call a science lab…”

Donald pointed to the two main chatters so far, “Ease off a little… met ‘im at that lab ye sent me to… didn’t immediately attack us, showed us a thing er two. We can trust ‘im enough fer now. On my word.”</span>

I existed before they were even born inside their little cribs.&quot; Verga remarked, taking out his cigar and dropping bits of ash on the wooden floor. &quot;The Nirvana Times is on hiatus. Forever. At least, until it stops raining cats and dogs outside. Have you taken a look at the weather recently?&quot;

He laughed, tapping on a nearby window. If the group were to take a look outside, they would notice that the situation was getting a lot worse. Red skies. Trees leaking an odd, corrosive substance and the haunting wails of animals lurking in the distance. Something had gone terribly wrong on the island.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you all have such faith in me.&quot; He giggled, observing Granel and Donald&#39;s reactions. They didn&#39;t attack him on sight, so that was already a good sign. &quot;I&#39;m here to observe, is all. It feels like the story is heading into its climax, and I don&#39;t want to miss a second of it.&quot;

He stuck his tongue out, dousing the cigar with his own saliva before tossing it on the ground and treading on it. &quot;You were mentioning a fellow called Vortigern, correct? Vile beast. Not of this world. Shouldn&#39;t even exist, to be fair.&quot; He pointed out, putting a hand in his coat as he started to unwrap and unfurl a bag of plastic. Inside of it, an aged tome could be found, missing a spine and anything gluing it together, to be exact. Something akin to a manuscript.

&quot;Such a creature belongs to fairy tales alone. Such as this.&quot;

He tossed it towards Donald, the papers flying right in his face. While the Saber would have most likely cursed at him, he noticed the peculiar title on the front page.

<em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>

Upon touching the manuscript, he could also feel its age. This wasn&#39;t a book dating a few years or so. This felt centuries old, like something out of a different time period altogether. It gave him a sense of unease.</span>

That was just ‘normal’. But the rest of that? Not a single thing could explain it outside of The Rapture or perhaps the island itself had decided to murder anything it could physically could. 

“Observer, eh? Sounds just like that other bloke yer lookin’ fer,” Donald said. “But as long as yer not plannin’ on stabbin’ us in the back at the worst possible moment, then yer fine to stick around.”

However, that talk of Vortigern came up again. What vile actions had such a man taken to get so much disdain? Sure, anyone who murdered a few others was down to be looked upon. That didn’t make him too much different from the rest of the people on this island. And why did it pertain to that thing Verga pulled out of his pocket?

He raised a finger to point and ask, but was stopped when it <em>flew</em> into his face directly. It smelt better than that beast of Soldier Boy’s, but not by much. Tasted foul too. How old was this thing?

Damn old. Felt like something real and genuine, from the Old World. <em>His</em> world. No better way to put it, with the material that threatened to come apart at the touch. The pages were worn and ancient, and the title was one he’d only heard rumors about. 

“‘Romeo an’ Juliet’... what’s this nonsense got to do with anythin’?! Who cares if it’s fake er not, it don’t mean nothin’ from where I stand. Unless yer tryin’ to–”

Ooooooooohhhhh. Donald could make safe assumptions, and the pieces were roughly forced into the mental jigsaw puzzle. 

“So, this… Vortigern, is tied to that Shakespeare guy? Is that yer point?”</span>

Oh. So that&#39;s what Verga meant. How had he missed that on his march here? How had Donald? Ace? Emelia? Did it just start? Granel wasn&#39;t sure what this meant, but he found himself remembering Anthony&#39;s journal. Granel had come to the conclusion that the land was rotten, but this...

This was cursed.

&quot;<strong>Wonderful. As the world ends, we&#39;re going to sit here and discuss a fake copy of William&#39;s work. Why don&#39;t you show it to him, I&#39;m certain he&#39;d...</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s eyes narrowed with confusion. &quot;<strong>...like it.</strong>&quot;

Why was Verga showing them this? It was a waste of time. He might as well just drop a copy of the Nirvana Times on them and be done with it. Instead, however, he spent time on this.

Curious.

&quot;<strong>William is connected to Vortigern, Donald. This much is true, I&#39;ve seen it myself. However...</strong>&quot; This was such a roundabout way of telling them. Verga could easily have just said it and nobody would&#39;ve batted an eye.

Why does it being a fake matter? Granel flipped through the transcript of the play, snatching it from Donald&#39;s hands. It was virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. It wasn&#39;t like a movie, where you could tell who the director was.

Or could you?

&quot;<strong>Have you ever heard of a term called Alan Smithee, Pachinko?</strong>&quot; Granel asked as he looked up from Shakespeare&#39;s work. &quot;<strong>It&#39;s a phantom director for a movie. If a director elects to abandon his name, that is the name the director is placed under. They use it to mark a film they deem terrible. that nobody should watch.</strong>&quot;

Granel tossed the manuscript back to Donald. &quot;<strong>I wonder if there&#39;s an Alan Smithee Servant out there in the world. Would you summon that individual as a Servant, or the person who <em>actually made the movie</em>?</strong>&quot;

...huh?

“... This seems rubbish,” Donald summarized. He ‘closed’ the book the best he could, and set it on the ground. “Fake er not, I’ve not a single clue who this would interest. No wonder he invested in this other bloke, I’d tear me own eyes out if I had to bring that sucker to life.”

And his Master put the old noggin to work. More terms he could only hope to maybe understand? “Well, Granel, you’d be castin’ yer line out to the whole of the Throne, unless you used somethin’ directly tied to a Servant. If yer puttin’ the situation like that, though…”

Well, you’d summon… the, uh… one of the two, right? Only ‘two’ people were ‘responsible’ for the product. But Alan Smithee wasn’t a real person. If it was related to the film industry, then ‘Alan’ had no way in hell of being an actual Servant. 

“Alright,” he threw his hands up in the air, “what’s the bloody secret, then? I don’t see how this play bein’ a fake has anythin’ to do with yer Alan guy. One would’ve directly made a fake, the other just didn’t want their reputation burnt to the ground. Former wants attention, latter wants anythin’ but.”</span>

The veteran had caught a glimpse previously, but he failed to spot the ominous resin-like sap that the trees sweat. How much more fucked up could this island get? Was this a common occurrence? No, it couldn&#39;t have been. Those apocalyptic events coincided with the third investigation team&#39;s arrival on the island. Ace could <em>feel it</em>. The weather getting slightly worse each day, the tension in the air rising with each passing hour, the very leylines beneath his feet pulsing in reaction to someone or <em>something</em>. It was like the island itself was responding to the outsiders&#39; presence, growing sicker and more wicked with each passing day. How utterly fucked up.

At the exact same moment Ace started linking Verga to William in terms of unlikability, obnoxiousness and haughtiness, the Servant had pulled out a manuscript. Romeo and Juliet? Ace had no idea what that was. If he had focused, he would&#39;ve maybe found the name to be familiar, something about the rookie briefing him on William Shakespeare, but he did not care enough to retain those details.

The unexpected link between this <em>Vortigern</em> and William made the veteran twitch. The Servant who outed himself as an ally of the outsiders, who oh so graciously helped the investigation move forward, was actually working together with the crazed Berserker? How unexpected. However, Ace <em>knew from the beginning</em> that William couldn&#39;t be trusted, though he had no valid reasons to think as such until now. The veteran glimpsed at Emeilia, eyebrows knit. The message in his eyes was clear: <em>I told you so</em>.

Truly, that man&#39;s very specific knowledge on <em>movies</em> was impressive, in a way similar to the rookie&#39;s never-ending general knowledge on every and anything. In contrast to him, Ace could probably count the number of movies he had watched throughout his life on one hand. With half its fingers cut.

…But quite frankly, the guard&#39;s words sounded like rubbish to his ears. They left the Genevi more confused than before, left in a state much like Donald&#39;s.

&quot;I don&#39;t follow your analogy either, what does the quality of a movie have to do with this manuscript?&quot; The man spoke, pointing to the manuscript in Donald&#39;s hands. &quot;As long as the end result is indistinguishable from the real thing, I don&#39;t care about summoning this Smithee person or the real director. Both would work.&quot;</span>

It was apparent that the three were still struggling to get to his point, and while he could easily reveal the truth, he thought it would be much funnier to see them stumble.

&quot;The point is, there are some things that William Shakespeare would do, and some things that Alan Smithee would do.&quot; He explained while stroking his beard. &quot;They both might be authors, but they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be the same in terms of personality and goals. In that case, would you rather have Shakespeare, or Mr. Smithee?&quot;

His words were starting to resonate with the four.

&quot;Well, whatever you pick, I&#39;d just like you to know: I know where William is.

&quot;<strong>Well, Soldier Boy, what if you summoned Smithee instead of the actual director. What if you summoned the <em>forger</em> instead of William Shakespeare? If you used a movie version of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, would you summon William Shakespeare, or the director of the movie?</strong>&quot; Granel explained. What was with this guy and movies? It was the only thing he seemed to have good info on, besides punching things until they break.

&quot;<strong>I think. I&#39;m no magus. The only knowledge I know on Magecraft is what I&#39;ve gleaned from slaughter. I can barely summon this alcoholic.</strong>&quot; Granel smirked, pointing a thumb over at Donald.

If Verga could lead them to Vortigern, that would save time. It would allow them to find Dante quicker, and possibly save his life. If he got caught by Vortigern, even with his Servant...

It would be over.

&quot;<strong>Ace.</strong>&quot; Granel stood up, towering over everyone in the cottage. &quot;<strong>You&#39;re a soldier, as am I. Our duty as soldiers is to fight in battles that others cannot. So step up to the plate. Our mission means little with Nirvana itself against us.</strong>&quot;

Despite the world ending right outside the cottage, Granel seemed relaxed. Despite that, this was just another obstacle in his way. This little corner of the world was ending, but Granel didn&#39;t bat an eye. 

This was just another addendum to his contract.

&quot;<strong>Get up Donald. I need somebody to drag my corpse home.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he picked up his bag and slipped on his brass knuckles. He raised an eyebrow towards Verga.

&quot;<strong>Well, Pachinko? Lead the way.</strong>&quot;

“When one of youse wants to go ahead and <em>say</em> what yer point is,” Donald interrupted, “I’ll listen a bit more. Until then, all I’ll say is that it sounds like we’ve got a job to do, and we’re the ones fer it. And I ain’t got a drinkin’ problem. I drink just fine.”

He sniffed, and hacked the air up right after. Forgot. Cigar smoke and the smell of death. Ugh. Saber rose from the armchair, bones still sore from the hours of movement earlier. “Er don’t, Soldier Boy. No skin of me bones. Hopefully.”

Sabre? Check. Pistol? Check. Cameran? Check. Hat? Che– wait, no. What the bloody hell?

His hands moved to grab the accessory but were instead met with short, near-black hair. Bollocks, he must’ve lost it on the run back! Sure, it was ugly as the island itself right now, but it was a hat! Without it, he felt… exposed. Naked.

A few curses escaped the hairs of his mustache as he followed behind Granel, very much not ready for the fight that lay before them.</span>
