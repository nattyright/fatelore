It wasn&#39;t really the time nor the place but he really couldn&#39;t help but think that this mission had become a bigger pain that it was worth it. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with this people...?&quot; he asked aloud as he rested his back on a nearby wall as his mind continue to try, like it had for the last few hours, what was happening. One would believe that after all he and Graf had been through after their arrival into the island they would have gotten used to the craziness that this place seemed to be build around. But like fate or whatever deity that ruled this world would have wanted it it seems like surprises weren&#39;t over yet. 

 It all had began with a really disturbing chill running over his spine, it was a familiar feeling, one he had encountered many times before. That feeling when thing are about to go bad in ways no one could even begin to imagine and once again soon after he was proven right. He knew the islanders wanted him death, at least most of them anyway, but things had changed they had become more irrational as if guided by some frenzy which made them care about nothing except his and his servant demise. 

He looked at said servant as let out a sigh, they had been on the run for a while already but seemed like they could catch a break at least for now. 

&quot;How you holding Graf?&quot;</span>

So instead they went with her other much more suited skillset. The avility to disappear without a trace. Launching the floatplane Graf kept an eye on the surrounding areas and the movement of the crazed islanders. On more than one occasion they avoided getting spotted by the islanders thanks to the ability to see from the planes perspective and it gave them enough time to hide.

Eventully they reached a place where they could finally take a little rest. &quot;Like a beached whale... I dont like being on land.&quot; she replied to his question of how she was holding up but soon after she came up with her own question. &quot;well since were on the run constantly why not do what we were supposed to do? snoop around some and see what we can learn. Maybe we can figure out why these guys have gone all loopy and act like some zombies from a horror movie.&quot;</span>

By her side was the young man who was always by her side and from the expressions on their faces they weren&#39;t in the most cheerful of moods. &quot;We apologize for intruding, you see my master and I are in search of information and we believed you were an appropriate group to turn to first. I realize this may come as a shock seeing us, but I assure you were not here to cause you any harm.&quot;

Though Allen and Graf would not know it, Assassin had made a full recovery from her fight with Ruth, only suffering minute surface level damage that healed within a day&#39;s time. Her hand rested upon Ryn&#39;s shoulder and she seemed to be gently squeezing upon to give a measure of comfort to him. What exactly happened to them between now and when they had fought Ruth?</span>

The familiar, youthful face to Allen and Graf was... less than elated. Ryn&#39;s gaze was downcast. His eyes, half lidded. He almost seemed to lean into the hand resting upon his shoulder, as if his knees may buckle without its corpse-cold support, and while the Boogieman spoke on his behalf he uttered not a peep. Only when his servant was done talking, an awkward, heavy silence hanging in the air, did he finally raise his eyes to greet the duo before them, red orbs flicking from Allen, to Graf, and then to Allen again.

With his eyes going between the two back and forth, almost dazed in the way he took them both in, Ryn&#39;s lips parted to speak.
&quot;Hi...&quot; he started. Then ended. For he returned to silence not a second after the greeting slipped his tongue, lips pursing up softly. Indeed... what happened to this young man, so different in the week Allen and Graf had seen him?</span>

He had been trying to avoid thinking about it but it was a reality he had to eventually face. How many of them remained in this island?? Not only counting other investigators but even the surviving crew and the such, he hasnt seen anyone else besides Ruth, Ashley and the islanders who had tried to kill him. So while he hadn&#39;t told Graf he couldn&#39;t help but wonder if maybe they were the only ones left. It was concern he couldn&#39;t shake, it was only due to Graf being with him that his mind didn&#39;t went down that path yet. 

So seeing Ryn, seeing the same boy he had just a few weeks ago found hiding in the kitchen and trying to open a can of food with his bare teeth was something he needed. The pleasant surprise was enough make him forget for a moment what was happening around him as he walked up to the young man and put his hand on his shoulders. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you are alright&quot; he said with a sigh of relief.  But as soon as relief found him Allen&#39;s mind seemed to  recall all it had been forgetting for the the last few moments. His eyes widen as he looked as the being supporting him, it was clearly a servant. In matter of second Allen mind began to put 2 and 2 together question and questions began to pop inside his head one after the other but one took precedence over the others. 

&quot;Ryn what happened?&quot; he asked with concern in his voice.</span>

Boogeyman and Ryn showed up out of nowhere. This of course had the ship all frazzled as she aimed all of her guns at boogeyman for a second or two before relaxing a little and lowering her threatening stance.

&quot;Ive spotted a pair headed this way... there is what appears to be some sort of a bunker entrance down that way. Its hard to tell from so high up But it should be safer than out here.&quot; she told the trio now before just unceremoniously picking up Ryn. they had no time to waste here if the didnt want to get spotted and chased again.</span>

If it wasn&#39;t for the fact they were allies she might have ripped their arms for even attempting such an act. However, Ryn encouraged to practice temperance, so that is what she intended to do.

As a measure of equal faith, Assassin moved behind Allen and grasped upon their shoulder. &quot;You take my master to a safe location, I shall be having words with yours. I&#39;ll shall be with you in due time.&quot; Allen felt a cold chill as their bottom limbs began sink down into the nearby shadows while being held in the Boogieman&#39;s grasp. The sensation felt like falling sideway in a never ending wind tunnel of empty abyss . He was only there for a few seconds, but it felt so much longer. Eventually they came out in an open clearing far from any danger. &quot;I apologize for the abrupt transport, but I believe a communication needs to be established as soon as possible between our groups, and presently my master is not in the most talkative mood.

That is not to say that he liked it or it didn&#39;t make him any sad, he hated it he hated killing for whatever reason but he wasn&#39;t naive enough to believe he could go while keeping his hands clean. But if he had to say what was what he hated the most about it was the atmosphere which remained once people died, it was like time stood still in a certain spot, it was cold and it make him feel sick and in this very moment that being, Ryn&#39;s servant give him that same feeling. 

It took him a few moments to regain his wits, as he wasn&#39;t sure what to do till Boogie began talking. 

&quot;That is how we called the islanders since a few days ago, you guys probably have noticed as well.&quot; he said as began to calm himself up. The person in front of him give him a bad feeling but she didn&#39;t seem like a bad person at all at least in his standard. &quot;When they attacked they didn&#39;t care about anything beyond killing us, even if we kill they don&#39;t feel fear or anything and they just try harder and harder to take us down.&quot;

 Allen eyes began to focused as he continue to talk. &quot;About any other information, we managed to keep the Canopus from sinking so we still have a way out of here but we need someone who can do proper repairs and there is also..&quot;

He explained to it that they had found survivors from the previous expeditions and how this girl Ashley seemed to have them all, to him it seemed like she was protecting them and so she seemed trustworthy. He admitted he only was sure about one of them named Alyster but he had yet to properly meet the rest of them..</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">When Allen put his hand on Ryn&#39;s shoulder, it wasn&#39;t there for long. The lad had scowled, and swatted him away-- all without so much as realizing it. Least it didn&#39;t seem that way, when he returned his arms to his sides, not making any indication that he heard Allen&#39;s sigh of relief. Though he did hear his question. <em>&quot;What happened?&quot;</em>

That roused a reaction out of him. A slight tilt of his head. The parting of his lips. A draw of breath, holding an answer between his gritted teeth-- only to turn into an &quot;oomph&quot; as Graf so unceremoniously picked him up. Then whatever he said was gone, and he fell to silence again. The others spoke a bit, and Ryn listened only a little, before being carried listlessly along by Graf. 

Up and down his body bobbed. Up. Down. Following the strict march of his carrier like some ragdoll. Eventually, after a while of silent walking, Ryn grumbled.
&quot;I can walk...&quot;
He sounded annoyed. Like he was irked that the servant had decided to pick him up in the first place. What, did he look weak, or something? Incapable of treading a short walk by himself? He&#39;d made it this whole way on his own. Stowed away island to island for weeks till he finally made it here-- messed up run down Nirvana, where he only had one destination to get to. He didn&#39;t need support, not one bit... besides. Getting the blood flowing might kill the headache from that woman pounding in his head.

&quot;Put me down... please.&quot;</span>

Though that can easily be remedied.&quot; Slowly she began to encircle and prattle around Allen, almost like a stalking animal right before it was about to pounce. She was not threatening him by any means, but simply by her did she feel intoxicatingly thick with negative energy. 

She didn&#39;t immediately respond to what was said, seeming to ponder on all that had been revealed. Her gaze was partially hidden beneath her hat, but Allen could at least tell that she didn&#39;t quite lead into what he was saying. &quot;You remark that you encountered some who were protecting members of the former expeditions. While that is partially concerning, for when I spoke to a cult leader by the name of Ruth she said that they made sure that they suffered. That only those who saw the light were allowed assimilation. The rest allegedly being consumed. I only mention this for it may imply that one of these individuals we encountered whether it be Ashley or Ruth was not entirely speaking the truth.&quot; This was troubling further to Boogie due in part to the deal she and her master made with the cultist.</span>

If necessary I can get her in contact with you, it shall be no hinderance upon our group. However, if you are merely seeking a means to leave the island unarmed. Then you merely needed to say so.&quot; In a sudden jolt Boogie reached out once more at Allen taking ahold of his shoulder and dragged him into yet another shadow. They traversed as before moving aimlessly and directionally twisted for several seconds before they both landed upon a ground that was absent of dirt or the smell of ocean air. Peering up Allen would see something that should by all means be impossible. Overlooking the horizon ahead of them was row by row of skyscrapers against a setting sun that should be much higher in the sky. This should be impossible, but it was in fact reality, a miracle he did not know existed. For the first time in several weeks, Allen no longer was on the island of Nirvana, but a different floating city entirely.</span>

Weirdly enough the more they talk Allen could feel a bit comfortable around her, her presence still send him shivers but it wasn&#39;t too bad all things together. 

&quot;Well is not like I wanna bring fear to them in the first place.&quot; he said with a smile.

But that smile soon vanished, the air around him would change and flames would began to caress the sleeves of his coat as he heard that name. Ruth Naomi, to him she was the biggest thread in this island due his lack of knowledge about everything else that was happening. Boogeyman words about consuming make him feel sick, as the word only make him think the worse about what may have happened to them 

&quot;Well.... Ashley called them her family&quot; he  said as he remember their conversation. &quot;So that is why they survive in that woman eyes they had assimilated. Will try to find more when I speak with Ashley again.&quot; 

This theory could be nothing more than wishful thinking on his parts as it was likely either or both of them were lying but he wanted to at least give Ashley the benefit of the doubt.</span>

But before he could ask her about it he was suddenly transported to a different place, his eyes widen as he let himself absorb the situation. He was no longer in Nirvana but more than thinking about just staying here he turned to Boogeyman. 

&quot;I have no interest in leaving without Graf&quot; he said without a single echo of doubt. &quot;But this is a good thing, if worse comes to worse take whoever you can and leave this place.&quot; he said with a sigh of relief as even if things went south as long as she remained alive the expedition could succeed. &quot;Yeah I would like to meet with her if you have the chance but now...&quot;

His eyes turned serious. &quot;Explain, what happened to Ryn?&quot;

It was time to tackle the elephant in the room, how did the same kid who was able to smile so brightly was now in such state. &quot;And I don&#39;t take good to lies so please dont try to trick me, if there are thing you dont want to say dont do it but I can&#39;t help him if I know nothing&quot;

Part of him wanted to be wrong though, wanted to believe that his current mood was just a temporary thing and not a product of that woman crazyness.</span>

The only reason I parted this time is, because I was already familiar with Archer after speaking with him when I rescued you during your arrival upon the island.&quot; 

Slowly she made her way to the edge of the rooftop to seemingly look over the horizon. &quot;I shall get you in contact with our engineer so that may help you with your own endeavors. Now in regards to what occurred with Ms. Naomi. I had approached her under disguise and was able to receive the information I just now gave to you. However, her gluttony overtook her and she attempted to take a bite out of me...That was the worst decision she could have made. After ripping the flesh from her neck with my own teeth, I dislocated both of her arms, and knocked her unconscious. From there we took her to a secluded dark location, so that our identities would remain hidden. That is when we began the interrogation.&quot; Boogie filled Allen in on the details that occurred, including the fate of Dorian. &quot;You see Ryn, is not in his usual mindset presently, which is why I am the one speaking to you. Although, from what I understand you had a sizeable impact on him when you were traveling to Nirvana. Perhaps later on, you may speak to him in a way that I cannot. There are certain things that he likely doesn&#39;t wish to hear come from me.&quot; 

She&#39;d turn back to him with an expression almost became human-like as if Assassin was speaking from her own wishes, such a strange sight to witness from a creature quite literally surrounded in darkness. &quot;Is there anything else you wish to know of me or an action I can take upon myself to aid your own plight. Presently my only concern has been to follow the desires of Ryn, but I suspect his goals may soon be shifting. Perhaps there is something I can do for you in the interim.&quot;</span>

But still as his guess was proven right Allen expression began to change. The young man was unsure of what to say to Boogie.  Regret began to take root inside of him, part of him couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he should had just stopped him when he had the chance, maybe find a way to return him home but at the same time had he done that Ryn would have probably ended up dead when they attacked the ship. 

&quot;I can try but.... &quot; it was sad, a kid like him had no place in this island where it was kill or be killed. &quot;... All I can promise is that I will try to do my best for him even if he doesn&#39;t see it that way.&quot; 

As the youngest of them all Allen wished for Ryn to survive, even if Ryn would hate him for it it would be alright. But more than that, he had another reason to settle things with that woman, after talking with Ashley he would be sure to try and end Ruth once and for all.  Ryn was to a degree his responsibility, a responsibility he had neglected so far so all he could do right now was to make up for it. 

&quot;So... even if it looks like im being harsh on it please trust me. Just like you I want him to survive, he is still to young so even if its hard im sure that he will be able to move forward.&quot; he gave her a weak smile. 

As she suggested another help she could provide Allen eyes regain some life. &quot;How many more survivors are there??&quot; That was something he needed to make sure, how many investigators were still around as he knew that whatever would happen he couldn&#39;t do it on his own. &quot;If there are more could you maybe get us all together??&quot;</span>

That if you are unable to live up to the expectations you agree to that you are a lesser man, that you shall fail once more. I tell you this now, fear of the unknown is a common trait, it affects many and few are able to conquer it. However, I believe you are capable of such things. You do not turn away from doing the right thing, even if it is hard. We don&#39;t all have to sacrifice our lives to be heroes, sometimes the bravest thing is to simply do what we can, to push the endeavor that much further. That can be as grand as leading an army into battle, or giving a young stowaway a can of food.&quot;

Boogie approached the man once more this time placing a hand over his heart. The touch was cool, yet for some reason it did not feel threatening. To call this servant an enigma would be an understatement. She could be mysterious and intimidating one moment, and then calm and reassuring the next. &quot;You value the importance of one&#39;s word, so I shall give you mine. I swear that in all my power I shall do what I can to help you, on the condition that it does not supersede the safety and well being of Ryn. So long as you understand these limits I am at your service for I have feeling our goals likely intersect with one another. In terms of other survivors you are the only other group we have come across. I can locate the others, but I will need to know who or what I am looking for to assist in narrowing my search.&quot;</span>

It was both nice to hear and also something that send shivers through his spine,  as part of him couldn&#39;t help but wonder how could she knew so much in their little interaction. 

&quot;One&#39;s word is something everyone has, be it poor or rich, strong or weak is a right we are all born with, so one who cant cast that away, cast away that which is an integral part of our existence can be trusted.&quot; he said as he reassure her words, he didn&#39;t knew what to feel about been called a good man, in his own eyes he was just a regular man but it seemed Boogey saw him in a better light which actually make it that he wanted to fulfill her expectation. 

&quot;That much is fine, I want that kid to be safe as well and whenever he understands it or not he cant be safe in this place...&quot; he let out a sigh as he took a small pause as he wonder about how Ryn would react if he were told that he needed to leave this place. 

&quot;That kid can be stubborn on the most weirdest things&quot; 

As he listen to Boogey words about how to find others and began to think and think about those he had met, he told her about Emelia who was his roomate in the Canopus and how he though she had a partner named Ace, about Dante and Octavius and finally about Granel. He tried his best to describe them to her although he hadn&#39;t speak with too much with them so it was hard and could only hope it was enough. 

&quot;There may be more but cant really tell, I may have seen more people but those are the ones who leave a big impression in my head.  Oh damn... isn&#39;t it time we go back??&quot; he was a bit concerned about leaving Graf and Ryn alone specially with the mood the later one seemed to be.</span>

Not necessarily in age, but the mind. Up until now he has been mostly ignorant and naive to the world. He wishes to see the good in all people, and just recently that outlook was challenged when he spoke one on one with Ruth. To encounter such an unabashed evil can shake the most innocent of hearts. Hopefully, he is not too far gone for me to still save him.” 

Moving beside Allen and placing a hand upon his shoulder one last time Assassin would nod. “I will find those you have mentioned. Perhaps I locate them, they will also know others that need to be received. Let us head back and meet with our partners. I imagine they are likely wondering where we went off too.” The two of them then transported via shadow back to the isle to Nirvana and those who needed them.</span>

Perhaps due to the fact that she essentially wasnt supposed to exist? well questions for later, as of right now she was missing her captain and that was a problem.

Jumping to action Graf ran for it with Ryn still in her hands. After finding a safe place she ran inside and slammed the door shut behind them. &quot;This isnt good...&quot; she spoke mostly to herself as she began running through her options with Allen missing for god knows how long. She still had a couple of those weird capsule things left to keep herself going for a while but that was a permanent solution, and then there was his promise... He wouldnt abandon her and would fight to the end by her side. Calming down a little she used her plane to scout the surrounding area and saw nobody nearby. Once Ryn spoke again she snapped back to reality and lowered him down. &quot;Where did Boogey take my captain to?&quot; She asked him with some slight suspicion.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Letting out an irritable sigh, Ryn muttered a prompt thanks as Graf set him down, his head pounding from both dizziness and a headache. When his feet finally touched the ground, he looked down at himself, and scowled slightly. How dirty his shirt had become... all this time, it&#39;d been caked in dirt and sweat and blood, and hadnt given a rats ass about it. Though now... eugh. Disdain curling his nose, he matted his shirt out, pressing down the wrinkles. When Graf asked where here master went, his answer was near dismissive. 

&quot;Dunno.&quot; was all he had to say. And he&#39;d have left it at that too, if he hadn&#39;t looked up. It took one glance at Graf&#39;s eyes for him to tell there was genuine worry there. Which surprised him a little. 

&quot;You care about him... huh.&quot; He thought a moment, continuing slowly under his breath. &quot;Sweet what a couple weeks can do...&quot; 

The boy finished dusting off the filth from his shirt and straightened. With his gaze tilted outside, he sat on the floor, and nodded.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. As his servant, you can feel it, can&#39;t you? He&#39;s alive. Boogie wouldn&#39;t do anything to him. Probably. And as long as they&#39;re alive, we&#39;ll see them again... right?&quot; 

His voice had become soft by then, lost of the annoyance from before and completely lost in thought. He hadn&#39;t even realized he&#39;d asked Graf a question she couldn&#39;t answer. Nor could he really, but, he didn&#39;t think so. Ryn curled his knees up and tucked his chin into his chest, mumbling through his arm.
&quot;... give them a minute. They&#39;ll be back.&quot; 

And then, he left it that.</span>

All she really wanted was a master or in her case a captain she could trust to keep his word and as Allen had proven that she was more than willing to do all in her power to keep him safe, even if it meant taking a bullet for him. Fortunately nobody else here had guns...

&quot;Now that you mention it.&quot; She closed her eyes and felt for her captains life force and did indeed notice it as it kept moving about rapidly. she couldnt pinpoint locations but she knew that he was indeed alive. &quot;Guess i will give them some time.&quot; she said and took another look through her planes eyes.

&quot;Yes, your master does like his swears and his vows and his promises-- it&#39;s kinda stupid. But really admirable, too.&quot;

Ryn eventually sobered, put in slightly better spirits. He was even smiling a little. Though, it quickly turned into a frown after Graf&#39;s question, and his eyebrows weaved in confusion.
&quot;What makes you think that? I trust her. More than I did ten days ago, at least... does it... not seem that way?&quot;

Now he really wondered if it came off that way... like he didn&#39;t trust Boogie. That wasn&#39;t actually true though, was it? He was sure he trusted her. But, then again. It had him pondering if, perhaps, he trusted her too much...</span>

He was still thinking about what Boogey had told him about Ryn, she had some expectations on him in the sense that he could help poor boy. But even if she didn&#39;t he would still try and help him, but he needed to be smart about it. 

In their previous conversation and even as they worked together he didn&#39;t managed to learn that much about Ryn. While part of it was due his own fault as he didn&#39;t try to push the kid to talk as he wanted to respect his own business it could also be seen as Ryn not trusting him enough to share it with him nor request his help. 

He walked towards Ryn while giving Boogey a look as if trying to tell her to give them some space. 

&quot;Ryn, what do you plan to do now?&quot; he knew that he couldn&#39;t just share what Boogey had told him, what Ryn had been through had shaken him to his core and even he knew better than just stupidly bring it up. &quot;You aren&#39;t and investigator I know that fair well so you must have come to meet with us for a reason.&quot;</span>

Once Allen showed up she looked at him for a bit and then said. &quot;I am glad you have returned unharmed.&quot;

After saying that Graf used her floatplane to keep a watch on their surrounding area. Aside from the occasional mindless islander zombie thing there wasnt much of note and they were all just shambling about aimlessly. Her scouting however did yield an interesting bit of news when it came around for a second pass over some more advanced looking building than the rest. &quot;It appears there is a sizeable group of people entering a building nearby and they dont appear to be mindless brutes like the islanders.&quot; she reported to allen and let out a little sigh as she wished to just be back in her warm tub of water. The ship hated this horror movie stuff.</span>

As their time together was a mere speck in their lives, there were still some lingering doubts that Boogie wouldn&#39;t hold herself back. But, those worries subsided seeing Allen in once piece, and he brushed aside Graf&#39;s words as he stood. He watched Allen approach him, carefully narrowing his eyes at the man while he queried him. Allen was right-- Ryn was not an investigator. But, that was the exact reason he had Boogie take him here. Ryn explained.
&quot;I came &#39;cause you&#39;re a real investigator. I expect you&#39;ve done your job investigating this island.&quot;

His gaze flicked towards his servant, gesturing to her.
&quot;So, if she didn&#39;t ask you already,&quot;
He turned back to Allen.
&quot;I just have one thing to ask. Then I&#39;ll be outta your hair for good. You&#39;ll never have to see me again.&quot;

Ryn&#39;ll be gone from Allen&#39;s life, if he just gave him answers. Was that what the fiery man wanted? Ryn thought so. He was a nuisance for everybody. Everybody but one. And he didn&#39;t care for sitting around with others, as long as he saw that one again... 
&quot;Do you know Koji Naoharu? Where he is? What he can do? Anything?&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It was easy to know what Ryn wanted to ask of him, it would strange if there was anything else on the young man mind. While Allen ignored how deep was the relationship  between Ryn and Dorian he could deduce some parts of the information he got from boogey. 

That being said he really had no way to help Ryn, leaving aside that helping him was even a good idea to begin  with. He hadn&#39;t met anyone with that name since arriving to the island but from the look on Ryn&#39;s face that wasn&#39;t an answer her would enjoy.

Well it really couldn&#39;t be helped but for Allen the issue was what to do afterwards. He didn&#39;t doubt Ryn&#39;s words so he would probably  just leave and if he did Allen had no way of finding him not with his servant ability nor while also dodging all the islanders wanting to kill him. 

&quot;Oh so that what you after? No need to be so cold after all we are all that remains with the kitchen crew...&quot; 

He was stalling as he tried to find some sort of answer that would keep Ryn from just leaving. It was then that as if being a god send Graf let him know of a group of enemies coming. That give him a bit more time at least. He turned to Boogey and froze for a moment he really didn&#39;t know what to call her she seemed to know her name but he had no idea of hers and just calling her a servant seemed rude. 

&quot;Couls you use your ability  to get us out of here for the time being Miss? I saw a cabin not today from here.&quot; 

He tried to describe the cabin and pointed at the direction he though it was.</span>

All the investigator managed to do was earn himself an increasingly annoyed glare as the seconds ticked by, Ryn slowly losing faith that coming here was a good idea. If Allen knew nothing, then he should just hurry up and say so, the boy thought.

He was losing his patience come time the man and his servant stressed that enemies were coming nearby. What worry was there? They had two servants-- they weren&#39;t defenseless. Certainly they could fight their way out... <em>after</em> Allen spoke what he knew. Alas, he only decided to stall longer. Typical.

&quot;Fine.&quot;
The boy let Boogie&#39;s tendrils wrap around him, and awaited to be transported to whatever safe place Allen had asked to move to.</span>
