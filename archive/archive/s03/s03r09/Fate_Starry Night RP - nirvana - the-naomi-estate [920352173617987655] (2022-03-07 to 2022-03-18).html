From the moment that damned vessels glided upon shore of Nirvana it has been chaos. Chaos wrought through the lands of Nirvana. Ruth herself had heard a few pieces of such chaos through her cult and what Jayce had shared with her. 

So far she herself had interacted with 3 different parties. That fire boy which Ashley might now be leading into a trap. Ace Collin the soldier. And the mysterious shadow who had taken her own divine form, aligned with the heir to that <em>musician</em>. 

Today at the very least things would... make sense. A meeting would be held. Her little birdie and poppet would be in attendance. All to decide what ways they should advance their <em>destruction</em> of these pests. 

&quot;Berserker, dear. What gown should I wear today?&quot; The holy mother broke her silent deliberation and turned towards her servant. In her grasp were two gowns. One a daunting red with black accessories and accents. The other a welcoming blue with simple white accents. 

The Banshee could sense a change in her master&#39;s disposition. Her hunger seemed more ravenous, less restrained. &quot;I do hope that you are also ready for this day&#39;s festivities. You will be getting to meet some of my... Closest allies on this day.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The past week of existence was much to process for the specter of stone and sorrow. It was equal parts fulfilling her duty as she had done before the Flood and clawing her way through this hellish island. The Lady Morr&#237;gan had tasked her with upholding the former and preserving the string of fate yet the latter was impossible to actually accept. The world bent in odd ways here, twisting the destinies of all that stepped foot on it.

The island itself... she had not felt it when she had gone to the crypts that one called home but now there was a dull pressure that grasped the back of her skull and spine. She felt like she had to watch her surroundings more than usual, the call of the dying more clear and the pull to condemn the undying all the harder to resist. 

Yet among all the impulses beginning to fester in Banshee&#39;s mind, the most alien but alluring was the one her fellow berserker&#39;s blood awakened and Gertrude&#39;s spirit encouraged. The pressure seemed to abate when her mind drifted to Ruth and especially now that her reddened eyes were taking their fill of the holy devil. The contradictions in appearance and action were hard for her to parse but the beauty she possessed and the attention she gave were addicting...

&quot;This meeting is akin to a war council, no? Best to command an imposing presence and demand the respect of your peers. Thoughts of the placid sea or calm skies will not do. Choose the red and black one... dear,&quot; She said with some hesitation before trailing off, her attention on how it felt to hand out affection for once.  It was like she was rolling the word around in her mouth and contemplating if she wanted more of the curious flavor. 

The ghostly fae lady found herself fixated on Ruth&#39;s beautiful form as she exchanged garments. It was hypnotic to watch and in the corners of her mind, Banshee felt a sense of innate familiarity with the scene and her own behavior. Why were humans such messy but captivating creatures?</span>

Already she could feel the grey clouds, fattened with moisture beginning to roll in on her mind and threaten to flood out those pleasant thoughts.

&quot;Festivities is not how I would put it. You deal business in shattered souls and broken spirits. Those you consider allies are no different... I have already met the one you call a &#39;daughter&#39; and she is truly in a state of ruin. She could not see the reason in my words nor my actions, so terrible are her delusions,&quot; Banshee said, rising to her feet as she felt that indignation from before stir in lock step with her compulsions. An accusatory talon was levied against Ruth&#39;s breast. 

&quot;If there is love for her, I hardly can see it over the neglect you buried her in. She has only corpses to keep her company...If there is a family you claim to have, how do the ties extend beyond well-maintained bodies and rotten minds?&quot;

It is rather fitting for our ‘war council’. Intimidating.” The Holy Mother set down the other dress, And held up the one decided upon by her servant. Admiring her own beauty in the mirror, catching just glimpses of her servant’s gaze. 

“So you have met my little <em>poppet</em>. An endearing little thing. “ The cult leader spoke as banshee placed her claw upon her lightly dressed breast. “You know… this reminds me of our night together… do you recall it?” Her hand placed itself overtop of the talon and gingerly held it. 

“But I do love her. As I love the others of my congregation. It is not my fault the girl chooses to associate herself with those puppets. There is very very little I can do to give her social interaction.” Ruth spoke with a slight tone of pity, most likely false. As that hungry gaze found itself settling upon Banshee’s eyes. 

While ravenous… it was different as their eyes met. Perhaps a love that only seeks to consume both partners?</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Banshee found herself interrupted in the middle of her talk with Ruth&#39;s warmth attempting to seep in to her armored hand. Her initial thought was to pull it away as she had done with Ashley&#39;s callous investigation but her hand stayed put. The slight changes in pressure were soothing to the corrupted flesh beneath and the warmth made those taut muscles relax from their regular tension. Ruth would spy the slightest hint of redness grow on her servant&#39;s cheeks before it continued to speak.

&quot;Love her as you love your congregation? You do not treat her as part of some flock of sheep but rather a carrion bird to be fed with those you long grew bored of. She tells me of how you send her corpses to play with and reanimate. It may not have been your fault originally but you have chosen to encourage this behavior. I can never approve of this... dear,&quot; Now she wielded the word offensively, a word to spear Ruth&#39;s monstrous heart and see if she still yet bleed like a person. Banshee&#39;s hand pressed into Ruth&#39;s own with more weight.

&quot;I have already relieved her of those bodies from that day,&quot; the blush grew stronger for a moment while Banshee averted her gaze, her mind still fixated on how low she had sunk during that encounter. &quot;And told her I will come back for the rest within a week, that it would be best to make a family of the living. It is forceful but there is nothing else that girl will respond to.&quot;

&quot;Yet I must tell you that my eternal duty was not the only thing that influenced my decision. I did it... I did it for you, Ruth. The girl is a victim of this island, she needs a proper mother... not some holy magistrate nor a supplier of flesh. Nirvana has already interfered with her fate and I responded in kind. A second chance, that is what she needs.&quot;</span>

“I see… Perhaps there was a chance to give her a more… average life. But she has the potential for great things. Things which would be stifled if she were smothered by the love of a <em>mother</em>.” The woman spoke with a more sincere tone. Guilt was felt within her heavy words. 

“Perhaps I did… screw something up with that girl… However a second chance could always happen in this land. Nirvana is dependent upon <em>her people</em>. To take them away from this land is tantamount to blasphemy. Do what you wish to her bodies, to her family. But do not take her from this land.” Ruth’s tone grew almost fearful of Banshee suggesting removing Ashley from Nirvana itself. An odd shift of emotion to see and sense.</span>

Perhaps today, you should try to mend the divide and be a proper parent, something she has not had in a long time, <em>love,</em>&quot; Banshee said as she moved her hand up so that Ruth&#39;s hand rested against her own warm cheek. There was a cunning look in the servant&#39;s eyes as they seized up a particular weakness of Ruth, even if it meant tying her closer to the green-haired matron.

 &quot;And already you admit it? Mhmm, you have already made it over the difficult step. Now just do what I have suggested and perhaps this &#39;family&#39; of yours will be more truthful to the name, no?&quot; As Ruth&#39;s tone grew more fearful of what her servant might do, Banshee&#39;s own gaze and words began to drip with her own form of desire and sweet promises. For somone apparently dead, her voice began to take on new life and fae mischief hidden behind a thin veneer of regality. 

&quot;Do not worry about Ashley, or have you forgotten my promises made to you when I was summoned? I will not harm the living, especially those who are victims of such deep misforture and dance on fate&#39;s strings as much as your *dear poppet,&quot; her mouth hid behind her other hand as if she could not help but chuckle at Ruth&#39;s fear now.

&quot;Now what of your other allies? Are they bound by similar misfortune or practice other abhorrent forms of magick? I would rather hear it from your beautiful lips now before I am taken by surprise later today. You know what would happen in that scenario, my dear...&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The shadows of a young lady dances through the forest, carefree and almost beautiful. Humming a soft tune as she made the long trek over to her <em>mothers</em> dwelling. The woman seemed strangely, happy? That couldn&#39;t be right she was moving faster through the trees. Just overnight there was a shift, something the mentally broken girl barely noticed but all those around her saw her normal calm and tired eyes turn manic and her large grin never leaving her face as she had gotten ready to visit the witch. Ally and Nate watching in fear as she spun around her room having never seen her so happy to talk to someone, almost completely brushing off the issue from the day before. 

In her head the loud buzzing only grew louder, the voices only got louder and louder, the voices of the dead calling out for her to save them, protect the beautiful and destroy those looking to harm her family, whether that be the outsiders, or someone just next door. 

Just as she came up on the large estate it hit her, what would she do about Allen. Someone who was an outsider yet, she couldn&#39;t bare to seem him meet the same fate as all the others. She liked his voice too much to seem him end up like everyone else. Thinking a bit as she leaned on a tree just outside, biding her time until she had a game plan until it hit her. She can just keep him there, on the island, wouldn&#39;t that be beautiful? She could keep him in her arms forever... A small giggle escaped the crazy girls lips as a few members of the cult inched away from where the daughter stood. It took these small movements for her to even notice her servant that had been following her this whole time. Far to lost in thought to carry any kind of conversation as she waited to enter her own personal hell.

The events from two days ago were still heavy with the Caster of Vile Weeds, something not aided by the choking garment around her neck. Ashley insisted that she needed to look nice for this meeting with her &quot;mother.&quot; For someone who hated this Ruth, she certainly was doing everything in her utmost power to impress her. The frills and extravagant puffs of her shoulders made Locusta feel very...<em>vulnerable,</em> with the woman growling audibly as she tugged at each fold, each flowing garment and binding elastic around her arms and legs. She was practically a rolling field of frenzy, a tumbleweed of flowers and satins as she was carried by her Golem, it&#39;s bark-encrusted frame giving at least a spectral display of power. Ashley had argued that something less foreboding was required, but Locusta put her foot down; she would wear these cloth prisons, but she would NOT compromise on her image. The bark Golem stays. 

&quot;As if it isn&#39;t humiliating enough to have your home invaded, now we have to placate some...some would be tyrant? Oh, this is truly not my best of summons,&quot; Locusta whispers to herself, being sure to follow closely behind Ashley, never to lose sight of her Emperor. Losing their haul for the day...it was clear that the visit of the Banshee had done something to her Emperor, had begun to stoke her flames. A good start, but constant failure only breeds contempt for the self...although, part of her wondered if Ashley could even hate herself. It was something she found endearing...almost the abject loss of self...in a strange way, Ashley was the least selfish person she&#39;d ever met...to a degree, there was the matter of the boys, but that was a sore subject. Perhaps a meeting like this would be what&#39;s needed to take the next steps. 

Caster cranes her neck to look upon the Naomi Estate, her own eyes swimming in the sockets as they struggled to take in every facet of its structure. What a palace...</span>

This was the smile of a manic killer, the smile of someone whos horrors hid just beneath. Her normal fear of conflict seemed to have subsided as she walked up to the door bravely. To face the woman who put her through hell and back for a reason even Ashley didn&#39;t know. To the people who broke into her home and tell her it was all lies when they were the ones who started it all. Her scissors were strapped to her side, just in case and the normally clear strings now hung, shining a light purple from her fingers, floating around the woman. 

&quot;Now Caster, we have to pretend to play nice for now, its not just... her... whos here... father will be joining us as well, so I can&#39;t take any chances.... not to mention her army of crazy people all over this place....&quot;

She hadn&#39;t seen her so called &#39;father&#39; in a long time, since before these new bugs climbed onto the island, and honestly out of all of them, out of this whole situation she was more then happy to see him again, maybe he could teach her new tricks, maybe he would help her stand up to Ruth? She wasn&#39;t sure but was happy all the same of the though of someone who was at least tolerantly honest to her.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">In truth, Scylla cared little about the affairs of her fellow islanders. It simply was not in her nature to get involved in their petty dramas and politics. She&#39;d already drank her fill of that from dealing with those irritating little authors, getting caught up in the clash of their petulant ideals. No, she had intention to get herself wrapped up in any of this. Getting tangled in a spider&#39;s web was not conducive to living a peaceful, quiet, happy life.

But, Naoharu Koji had nevertheless received an invitation, slipped underneath the cabin door in the early hours of the morning. As of such, it became necessary to arrive, if only to make it clear that no, they had no interest in these games they played.

As of such, Scylla had failed to dress for the occasional, clad in the same attire she always was. No effort had been made to appear presentable. In her eyes, this was not a party, where she might make merry and be joyous with her peers. No, this was the last meeting of predators before the last moon of the hunt began.

...Well, perhaps that was a little too glorious a description for this sham of a meeting. 

Eventually, after a long walk down the mountains to the lake district, both master and servant would be able to see the rooftops of the estate in the distance. It wouldn&#39;t be much longer before they arrived in front of the gates. Not much longer before this sordid affair would be underway.

<strong>&quot;If you have any last minute warnings, I would appreciate them.&quot;</strong> Rider addressed Koji, muttering to him as they walked along the path. <strong>&quot;I would prefer to avoid nasty surprises with the other</strong> <em><strong>guests,</strong></em> <strong>so to speak.&quot;</strong></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">So, an invitation.

Koji was never one to care for formalities. Except such that brought him benefits, of course. Unfortunately, an invitation sealed with wax and smelling strongly of perfume was rather middling in terms of said benefits. 

There were two reasons for this. The first, and the most obvious reason, was that even at his best, Koji never bothered putting on more than three layers. His closet consisted of plain shirts, undershirts, striped shirts, shirts with patterns, a single aloha shirt, bird tees, and a lanyard that held his work ID. If he were feeling fancy, he&#39;d put on scrubs, but those &#39;special occasions&#39; were usually, mostly, most <em>definitely</em> reserved for his workplace. 

Then there was the second reason. He&#39;d already been expecting the meeting before the invitation had arrived.

Ever since the outsiders invaded Nirvana almost three years ago, a group of islanders who felt <em>just</em> a bit more strongly about the invaders had decided that a gathering of sorts would be beneficial to Nirvana&#39;s wellbeing. Over the years, members came and went, but those who stayed eventually gravitated towards a woman named Ruth Naomi. 

She was an elegant host. A charming host. Her estate was spacious and lovely. Plus, it provided a wonderful view of the lake, framed by impressive mountains high above where vineyards were cultivated. It was a miniature heaven within the bigger heaven that was Nirvana. It was of the utmost honor just to be offered a chance to step through the gates.

But do it enough times, and the trek from the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#mountain-lodge</span> to the estate became one of the most insufferable thing ever known to man. 

Thankfully, the trip this time was made less tedious with a companion by his side. One who wasn&#39;t much of a talker, but who was made to share the suffering of the lengthy walk. And thus, the suffering had been halved...

...until said companion dropped a tome in his hand.

<em>The Joy of Cooking: All You Need to Make Food Taste Not Shit</em>, Koji read the cover with a mortified chill down his spine. Ever since yesterday, Scylla had begun to excuse herself from the cabin whenever it grew close to mealtime. He hadn&#39;t thought anything of it back then, of course, since food was but a nice-to-have for a Servant. But now the book had cast new meaning on Scylla&#39;s behavior.

The remainder of the trip had been spent perusing said book. Koji flipped through the pages with a vengeance, criticizing their contents with such self-assuredness that even the tendrils Scylla had manifested to beat back bushes shrunk in fear. They were moving on to a brand new debate over whether blueberries went with peanut butter chips and cinnamon (a resounding &#39;yes&#39; from the doctor himself) when they arrived within sight of the Naomi estate&#39;s main gate.

A few people seemed to have already gathered. Two of them, in fact. The telltale purple colors from one of the two immediately clued the doctor in on her identity. As for the other one decked out in a puffy dress...well, it wouldn&#39;t take much of a guess, considering the nature of the young woman&#39;s magecraft. 

<em>Is it doll? Or-</em>

&#39;-a Servant?&#39; Koji asked Scylla as he gestured towards the shorter girl with his cane. &#39;The short one. Can you get a read on her?&#39;

He kept the conversation casual, not making much of an effort to lower his voice for the puppeteer and her companion. Unlike Scylla, this wasn&#39;t his first rodeo. He knew what to expect at these meetings, even though the advent of other Servants complicated things a little.

&#39;Get us out of here at the first sign of trouble. It doesn&#39;t matter who started it. Could be Ruth. Could be her Servant. Could be me,&#39; he tucked the cookbook under his arm, a defensive gesture. &#39;I have questions, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be pleasant to her ears.&#39;

Alex Bondre walked the paths of the Naomi Estate and hated every second of it. The estate was loud with the noise of devotion of whimpering sycophants, but underneath it was the more sickening tone of gluttony and hunger, staining the grounds like blood from a slaughter.

To make matters worse, the mental state of Nirvana was worsening. The natives whipped into a mad frenzy, partaking in acts of degenerate violence against the outsiders. Alex found themselves having to constantly fight off the overwhelming urge to permanently silence those around them. Something that took much more effort than normal. Alex couldn&#39;t help but think about Ace&#39;s words in the back of their mind. Was something external making the natives like this?

Normally Alex would despise gatherings like this and avoid them at all costs. However, the more Alex ruminated on Ruth and their brief encounter, the more Alex felt the need to assess her and if it came to it, silence her. So with the verbal invitation of Koji, Alex had strolled through the front gates. The servants quickly avoiding the visibly irritated Alex&#39;s path out of fear as Alex made their way to the front door.</span>

As Rider turned her head, she would indeed spot the smaller of the two women, being carried along by their golem. Well, &quot;golem&quot;. In truth, it was a pitiful excuse for an automaton, hardly a dragon tooth warrior. Resorting to driftwood to bolster your ranks... how lowly.

But, her own personal disdain aside, there was one thing that was crystal clear.

<strong>&quot;Definitely a servant.&quot;</strong> Scylla replied, eyes narrowing at the form of Locusta. She would inhale deeply, trying to catch any notable scent from their body, but only being met with an acrid odour of death. Her nose crinkled as she turned away from the girl and back to Koji. <strong>&quot;She&#39;s rancid. Don&#39;t touch anything she touches.&quot;</strong>

With that curt yet necessary warning out of the way, she would listen to Koji&#39;s order. If things got bad, get out. Simple enough, made doubly so by the fact she did not want to be here in the first place.

<strong>&quot;So be it.&quot;</strong> Rider nodded, before her pace began to quicken. <strong>&quot;Now let&#39;s hurry up. The sooner we&#39;re free from here, the better.&quot;</strong></span>

Their faces now resting close to one another. Their bodies pressed into one another. “Love… Is something the girl could be given today. It would be only fair for her and her services she has given…” The new life which shone in Berserker seemed to captivate the cultist. 

“Koji… The little <em>birdie</em>. I would like for you to keep things civil with him and his… own flock. Even if they may have had necromantic experiments.” The Woman spoke in a low whisper. Leaning into her servant’s ear. “That is all I can really say. He keeps to himself and brooding over a long dead <em>love</em>. Unlike that which is kindled between us.”

Ruth then pulled herself away from her servant. “Dear, we should be getting ready now. The guests will be arriving shortly. Do you mind helping me get this dress on?” The holy mother asked of the specter before her stretching her arms out and holding up that dress, red enough to be thought to be stained with blood itself.</span>

Caster sighs while rolling from the mighty shoulders of the Tree Bark <s>automaton, why I oughta-</s> Golem, the creature giving a shudder as it simply kneels in place, bowing in order for Locusta&#39;s palm to rest on its hide. &quot;Stay here, my precious. I assume you&#39;ll cause too much of a disturbance inside,&quot; she says, glancing about to keep an eye for the other guests. In her scan, she catches sight of one in particular, a rather...<em>rather</em>...tall one, a woman of such renown and generous proportion that Caster herself could only surmise her as a Servant...and she was looking right at her...

&quot;...&quot; 

Caster looks her up and down, front ways and back, catching all of her radiance before looking back down at her own form...silently, she presses two hands to her own chest before taking another look back, almost having to bowl backwards, even at this distance, at the sight of hers...

<em>@!$%</em>

&quot;...Hmph...&quot; She turns her cheek sharply, fuming beneath the brim of her hat as she sidles next to her Master, wearing a miserable expression while keeping her arms fully crossed in front of her. The frigid ambience she would have attributed to her own sullied mood, had it not been for another arrival...

Metallic clanks move past them quickly as an automaton slinks by, Locusta herself watching carefully as it arrives at the front door, patiently waiting for it to open...

&quot;...Is the three legged man your father or this...what are they called, robits?&quot; She asks, aloud, unfazed by any potential insult that could be derided Alex&#39;s way. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@islander</span></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The ploy the Berserker had drafted seemed to already be bearing fruit. Ruth was a being driven by her own feral urges, more so now than ever before. That wicked beast of hunger practically drooled at the promise of indulging in Banshee&#39;s cold yet ample flesh again. A fact the servant was using to her full advantage.

What shame and embarrassment she had felt seemed to fade away by the second along with the dull pressure of madness. The relief was its own delightful form of pleasure and Banshee did not pull away as Ruth&#39;s petite yet endowed form interlocked with her own more imposing shape, fitting together as one single, complementary whole. The warmth the woman so readily gave off was intoxicating to the ethereal fairy and she drank deeply from it. 

&quot;Mhmm, such a beautiful promise. Perhaps a reward is in order, hm?&quot; She whispered back, her lips close enough to Ruth&#39;s that the latter could feel the cold condensation settle on her lips.  Banshee&#39;s mouth grazed Ruth&#39;s eager lips but pulled away gently before the woman could indulge in that intimate pact. &quot;But only after you follow through with those words. A couple hours should not be an agony to endure...&quot;

&quot;Oh but even with your presence in tow, I can never abandon that eternal duty of mine. Were any of his creations to wonder into the estate, I would simply do with them as I had done with the daughter&#39;s false play things. The dead need to be interned but for you? I can delay their burial for a day,&quot; The servant responded to Ruth&#39;s pleading demands with her own teasing conditional acceptance.

As Ruth ended the moment on her own terms and brought their little dance to a close, Banshee once more found herself in full view of her master&#39;s seductive, succulent figure. It may not have had the blood of the Home Country yet she felt no qualms in claiming it as part of her land. And so she sought to tame and groom its beauty to her own desires, lovingly draping it in fibers of crimson and lace of night.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">“you flatter me so… denying your duty just for a day~” Ruth mused as she was dressed with assistance of Banshee. Cutting an intimidating image with the Red and Black gown. Choosing a fitting hat to accompany it to their tea time. 

“For you. To wear. To keep.” The cultist offered a beautifully crafted piece of leather to Berserker. Intricately decorated with sprawling vine patterns and occasional flowery filigree.  

The pair then left the upper floor of the estate and found themselves walking outside the front door. 

Attendants scurried about the lavish estate. Getting the ‘festivities’ ready. Jayce stood alone with a scowl, which turned to a forced smile upon placing Ruth within his field of view. No words were exchanged between the two of them, but a glance was made. All that needed to be communicated was communicated. 

With an ethereal waltz Ruth herself approached the gate to her estate. Giving a welcoming smile to those approaching. Taking account of her ‘allies’ and one… familiar figure who was not invited, but for the time being is welcome. 

“Ahhhh ladies and gentlemen. Welcome welcome. The festivities will be beginning momentarily. “The matron spoke in a loud and saccharine voice. The gate then opened as she stood there, eyes hungrily gazing upon each individual in attendance.</span>

It was a reasonably necessary precaution. The magic in his blood was dangerously low, which meant that for the time being, he could no longer shrug off injuries as he had before. A well-aimed strike from a human could wound him easily, not to mention a Servant capable of commanding wood golems the size of a small building.

But, in the end, a wood golem was made of just that: wood. Good in a furnace, and excellent for making bird houses.

Koji approached the girls. &#39;Hello, Ashley,&#39; he greeted the purple-haired puppeteer. &#39;You haven&#39;t grown a bit since the last time we met.&#39; 

Which <em>was</em> a long time ago, mind you. A few months? A year? He hadn&#39;t seen her at the previous gathering, though he hadn&#39;t stayed long himself, either. Once the gossip dried up, it was usually cue for him to leave, etiquettes be damned. 

But their host clearly thought otherwise, playing up the event as some sort of festivity that only seemed to grow more lavish each time round. As the front gate opened, Koji&#39;s suspicion would be confirmed. Ruth welcomed them in an extravagant gown of striking reds and black, the scent surrounding her sultry and demanding, drawing her guests in...

&#39;You don&#39;t suppose we can talk here?&#39; Koji suggested plainly, and the charm was broken. &#39;The last time I was here, it took me longer to find the exit than to get my questions answered. We are all busy people,&#39; he looked at her meaningfully. &#39;You should know that I don&#39;t grant my services for free.&#39;</span>

Even Koji could tell there was something off about her. She seemed so much more aware of what&#39;s around her then before, almost awake but the bags under her eyes stated otherwise. She grabbed his arm excitedly and pulled him to the side with a childish giggle, she was so much more childish then before. 

&quot;Dad! You actually showed up I couldn&#39;t wait to see you and... that witch... but how have you been? It&#39;s been so long~?&quot; 

Her voice didn&#39;t trail off into silence like it used to, his words didn&#39;t even reach her brain as she starred at him happily. Getting any form of attention from him was more then enough for her to be happy.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The moment continued in its saccharine bliss as Banshee dressed her master. Yet she was stunned, her stilled heart jumping in her chest, as Ruth presented her with a leather belt embellished with floral patterns. This was what she wore during the summoning and the patterns were unmistakably those of the one who would have been her master but instead confined to naught but memory. Banshee did not have to say anything in return. The message was clear enough...

___

Compared to Ruth&#39;s ominous red and black attire, the woman standing at the opposite side of the gate wore a green cloak and  a heavy white dress with little embellishment, only her leather belt carrying much in the way of detail. She was absent of the glowing vitality and predatory hunger her counterpart was infamous for. Her eyes were bloodshot, her hair was white as bleached bone, and her scent was unmistakably that of a freshly dug grave. 

She did not speak but rather sought to examine each guest with a hard, stolid gaze. There was only one for whom her expression softened. Ashley seemed in unnaturally good spirits, had she already taken her lesson? Or perhaps was something more sinister at play? A watchful eye on the broken child would have to suffice for now.

It was for Koji that Berserker&#39;s stare was the most intense and critical. She locked her eyes with his until he acknowledged the gaze and then let her eyes look back and scan the treeline, then lock with Koji again, bounce to Scylla, to the treeline and back to Koji for one more time. She said nothing nor moved otherwise.

Only the surprise arrival of Alex motivated her to take a few steps forward and reveal a hand casted in cold, dark iron. Yet Ruth&#39;s continuing pleasant demeanor let the mysterious being past her post and into the estate. All guests could once again feel the servant&#39;s watchful gaze settle on their backs like winter&#39;s frost on the morning lawn.</span>

Alex could sense that Ashley was more deranged than usual. Her mind a source of loud, erratic emotions. Alex clenched their fist tightly to avoid going for the dagger in their coat pocket.

Alex then looked towards their host. Ruth stood by the gate smiling that smile Alex had seen so many times before. That fake smile one put on for appearances. Alex walked up to the gate.

Unlike everyone else, Alex had not even bothered to dress for the occasion, only wearing their normal clothes and coat. Fortunately, they were clothing from the upper echelons of society and fit in the setting well enough. If one ignored the wear and tear from both time and the elements.

Alex stopped at the gate and stared at Berserker. The unerring purple light gazing at her. Alex guessed that she was likely Ruth’s servant and possibly the source of that horrific wail over a week ago. Alex continued to stare, letting their empathic power prod the mind of this being. To see if she was the source of those horrid, dreadful noises.</span>

The words that came out of Scylla&#39;s mouth were practically soaked with surprise. Indeed, if one were to turn and look, they would see that her jaw had dropped. How old <em>was</em> Naoharu Koji? She would have guessed no older than thirty, and yet here he was, standing next to a daughter who looked only a few years his younger!

Was this another one of his experiments? Some kind of bird-creature wearing the skin of a human girl? No, that hardly seemed conducive to his efforts. Then, a straight piece of necromancy? Hardly, she was far too lifelike. Then, was she actually his daughter...?

No, no point in prodding this here and now. She didn&#39;t particularly need to know. No, she did not. Not at  all. Nope.</span>

And what her Master failed to mention was the overwhelming beauty on display, a beauty that was marred by just how...perfect it was. It wasn&#39;t on account of any ungodly symmetry, or perhaps an altogether unnatural youthfulness. It was, in accordance with the black and red cascading down her shoulders, the scores of followers at her beck and call...her Sister, the Banshee, dutifully standing behind her with head bowed...it was the simple, quiet, display of power. A beauty Locusta came to admire, and one that she was painfully aware of being absent from her own Master, who even now was flocking at her &#39;father,&#39; whom gave an impression of fragility as well. Such splendor on display would obviously put the rest into a submissive state of abiding. Not completely, but any submission is more than enough. She learned that a long time ago...

<em>KILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHERKILLHER</em>

The thoughts buzz in her own thoughts and whip a maelstrom of frenzy as Locusta does only what she does best, and gives a glowing grin in the face of such opposition...

&quot;My Master...Mr. Father, I&#39;m going to go ahead inside. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t offer much to this game of catch up...&quot; She says, giving a sidelong glance at Scylla all the while, her face still red with...well, what was that? Envy? Whatever it was, it was hidden beneath the brim of her hat as Locusta made her way up the steps, flashing a brightened glance at Banshee before pushing past, not bothering to spare a glance at Ruth. <em>Hide your malice, Locusta...an Emperor does well to snuff out such impudence, even if it&#39;s worn solely on the face...</em>

Rolling her eyes to Koji’s unwillingness to actually stay and speak for a time. “Little <em>birdie</em>, we have some of your <em>favorite</em> jams amongst what will be served today. At least that should be payment enough. If it isn’t, the wine more that certainly will be.” The Matron’s eyes then hyper focused right onto the doctor, her hunger was more prominent than ever. “We also have other business to discuss regarding your <em>research</em>.” 

The gaze then moved itself off of the good doctor. Settling on Ashley, clinging to the man as if she were a child. “Little <em>poppet</em>, welcome dear welcome. You and your caster’s work at <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#city-docks</span> when they arrived was rather amazing. Too bad the follow through didn’t seem to pan out.” The woman signed. “There is always ample opportunity to give it another chance, dear.” 

She didn’t bother a gaze to either of their accompanying servants. Rather leaving that formality to her Berserker.  As her gaze settled upon Alex. 

“The <em>Bondre</em> Heir… What a peculiar appearance for you to make here.” The cultist then directly approached them. Extending a hand, of course gloved with the finest of silks with intricate lace work, she expected them to take it. “I would enjoy to hear of how you came across an invitation?” Compared to the time within <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#merch-store</span> that ravenous hunger seemed to have grown in magnitude. Consistent with those changes the empath had noticed in fellow islanders.</span>

You know how to do that,&#39; he tried to free his arm from her grasp. &#39;Do you?&#39;

It wasn&#39;t quite the touching reunion one would have expected from the young woman and the man whom she referred to as &#39;dad&#39;. Koji kept things strictly on business, but those who&#39;d worked with him before could tell that something was amiss: since when had the doctor ever offered to help with <em>anything</em> for free?

Alex, in particular, would be getting a large dose of conflicting emotions from the doctor, positives and negatives all mingling into one unorganized clutter. Though at the sign of Scylla&#39;s jaw-dropping reaction, those emotions would take a nosedive. 

A breeze blew the doctor&#39;s hair back, making it look like the ruffled feathers of a disturbed bird as the telepathic link between him and Scylla opened up. <em>&#39;I am</em> <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> <em>a deadbeat,&#39;</em> he insisted very strongly. <em>&#39;I am not, and I never-&#39;</em>

Curses, that wasn&#39;t the issue.

<em>&#39;Listen,&#39;</em> he said, as though Scylla wasn&#39;t already reading too much into his thoughts. <em>&#39;I don&#39;t have kids. I&#39;ve never adopted any. I don&#39;t have time to play house!...End of discussion.&#39;</em>

Never had he retreated from their telepathic link so fast. 

Ruth watched as the doctor&#39;s usual deadpan face underwent several rapid changes, some of which even she hadn&#39;t seen in all the years they&#39;d known each other. He looked shaken, to say the least, though she had a distinct feeling that it wasn&#39;t entirely because of her uttering the taboo word.

She still succeeded somewhat, however. Koji shot her a sharp look at the mention of his research. He almost looked upset, and Ruth couldn&#39;t fathom why.

Scylla wasn&#39;t exactly sure if she believed 100% of that, but she at least believed 50% of it, and that was enough. Enough for now, anyway: Any further prying into the personal affairs of Naoharu Koji could be done later. Right now, she concerned herself with the other prying eyes all around them, their &quot;fellow&quot; islanders.

She knew the metal man, whom Koji had administered aid to a few days prior. He seemed the blandly inoffensive sort, though his taste in newspapers tended towards the <em>blatantly slanderous</em> more than she liked. This pink-haired girl and her servant, too, seemed inoffensive, at least, to the extent that they presented themselves on the surface. Though, with all that said, she did not particularly care to dig deeper into them and their affairs.

So, that left their gracious hosts, the one they called Ruth Naomi and her ghastly, deathly servant. Rider could not quite place why, but she felt a deep disdain rise in her looking at the two. Not hatred, not anger, just loathing. How odd, but she didn&#39;t question it. She didn&#39;t intend to distrust her instincts about these two, least of all now.

Yes, there could be no doubt, if there were ever going to be an obvious display of &quot;the first sign of trouble&quot;, it was them.</span>

Dear, doctor… I have no interest in being a <em>copycat</em>.” The woman mused as her gathered guests began to make their way inside and be greeted by Jayce Longbranch who remained at his post. 

The frantic movements seemed to finally draw to a close as Ruth sat herself at the head of a table brought outside for this very occasion. Of course it was only ever reserved for gatherings of this magnitude, most of the year it would remain within one of the many many other rooms of the estate. 

Tea sets were set along the table, with many different treats being placed along the center. “Now. We can talk business. While we enjoy some tea, or wine.” The woman spoke as she sat down at her chair. “The <em>threat</em> to Nirvana. Of them a few, as you all are also aware, have made contracts with servants. I have had the <em>pleasure</em> of meeting at least three of these pairs.” She then made a look over to Ashley. “I believe you also met the <em>fire boy</em>.” Her glass was then raised up and an attendant quickly came and filled it with a burgundy red liquid. “As for you two, the doctor and… well is it a mr or mrs Bondre? Anyways, who all have you encountered at this point?” The glass was then brought to her lips and drank from, lazily hanging in her grip while her eyes gave the impression of being on the hunt.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Banshee would give Locusta a perfunctory nod as she passed by, thick in a cloud of her own noxious fumes. Ruth was the only other one who had given her a smile and based on their previous encounter, it was no doubt due to the caster&#39;s fascination with her exemplifying the end state of her craft. Sisters in the business of death was what they were and Banshee let her be for the moment. 

The unannounced guest was far less respectful for Banshee&#39;s state of mind. Suspicion and curiosity swirled in equal measure as she tipped her head down to gaze into that soulless mask. A hint of annoyance edged all, they were a surprise guest after all and one who held their identity close to hand. 

A bit more digging would uncover a thread of affection branching off towards Ruth, one of concern towards Ashley and another of veiled hostility towards Koji. Curious but not surprising given Ruth&#39;s own attitudes towards her family. But beneath it all was a different beast, one just as endless as Ruth&#39;s hunger but much more potent to the likes of Alex.

It was a dark sea of sorrow and loneliness, duty and longing, illuminated briefly by flashes of love or anger. A stormy, inhospitable place for one&#39;s whose heart bled simply by being near the betrayed and depressed. It sought to draw him in and drown him in that sea of tormenting emotions but the helmet would prove to be his safety and reign him in before being another memory lost in that sea...

___

Banshee was the last to enter the gates and watched all humans and servants begin to file into her lady&#39;s manor. Well all except for one, the smallest and most mischievous of them all.  The one who dubbed her a sister in death. The one who reeked of assassination yet clothed herself in the thick mana of a magus bar none.</span>

A little bit of her fae heritage deafened the specter&#39;s steps and allowed her to glide towards her tardy guest. A chilling wind was all that would herald her arrival, no notice given until the Berserker was upon her.

Locusta would feel something large brush against the hairs on her neck and send a cold shiver down her spine. It was as if one of her victims had brushed by her form, a grim reminder of her past deeds and a warning of her inevitable condition that no concoction could ward off. If she turned around on the spot, she would discover the weathered iron gauntlet of her fellow servant only millimeters away from her neck, as if she was tempted to plunge a metallic talon into her spinal cord and forever cull her weeds.

Yet there was no indication of outward hostility on the woman&#39;s face or in her posture. If anything, it was a look of pleasant curiosity.

&quot;Admiring the grounds, dear guest? I have not yet had the time to keep to them and cultivate their beauty to the fullest. A shame but one easily remedied. Though I do not recall your expertise being in flowering plants but those more closely related to our mutual business, no?&quot;

&quot;...I was honestly expecting hatred from you, sister.&quot; Locusta says, slowly rising as she dusts off the hem of her dress. Even if she abhorred the outfit, it wasn&#39;t her place to sully the work of her dear Master...which, as far as she could see, had already begun her discussion with the other Masters. No doubt they&#39;d expect an appearance from Locusta soon, but for now...

&quot;...You&#39;re well read, or at the very least, you simply research quite fast...but how did I take part in those acts of mutual business, dear Sister? An assassin is only truly defined by their work and their methods. In my case...it was the belief and trust in nature that helped to fell kings beyond my stature. Nature, whose secrets I fully unlocked, became mine to wield. It is true, my container of Assassin is far more common, but as a Caster...I fully feel the presence of my mistress. Not dear Ashley, who i do adore...but Hecate...am I wrong to assume a Mistress does not bind you to the very earth? To the dead? You must forgive my own absent-mindedness in regards to your history, my dear sister, but we Romans are oblivious to a fault. Perhaps it&#39;s part of our curse...we fully buy into our own history, and not much else...&quot;

&quot;Well yes mother.... but there was also.... another one.... a small doctor with beautiful eyes.... his servant was.... annoying to say the least.... the red knight... horrid.... I wish for those I picked.... for their bodies to remain in tack.... you know my rules.... those with my strings... they are mine.... they will stay with me on the island forever....&quot;

Hissing also towards Ruth and to the others, she expected everyone to know these rules by now but she knew how Ruth was. She would not let Ruth lay a finger on Allen at the very least. 

&quot;Mother... I wish to take care of the fire boy... myself.....&quot; 

A new request from the shut in, she never before willingly joined the fight even if they were horrible outsiders. The spider always waited for the unlucky few to run into her, run right into their doom and yet, something about her shifted. Was it that she had a servant now? Was she stronger now after all the time locked away, for Ruth would have no idea.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Koji kept his expression carefully composed as Ruth led the group into her mansion, letting his irritation brew under the surface instead. Ruth&#39;s response hadn&#39;t sat well with him. It was thoughtless, predictable, and he could already see things play out the same way as they did with the bard. 

In hindsight, the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#mountain-lodge</span> was a poor choice for a workshop. It was quiet, he wouldn&#39;t deny that, but its wooden exterior didn&#39;t exactly do a good job at keeping unwanted guests out. William could&#39;ve forced his way in through the chimney if he wanted, not to mention anyone with an axe and some basic understanding of dismantling bounded fields.

Lost in his thoughts, Koji claimed the first seat he came across, unwilling to take a step more than what was absolutely necessary. As the cultists busied themselves with setting up the tea and treats, Koji started entertaining the idea of setting fire to his own cabin. 

He didn&#39;t get very far. 

At the topic of outsiders, the room burst into chatter. Everyone started talking. Even Alex, who seemed to bear some grudge towards Ruth, contributed what he can. Koji raised an eyebrow at Alex&#39;s vague description. A strong man that he knew personally? Thinking back to his encounters with the outsiders, there was only one who fit the bill-

&#39;That one is mine.&#39; He spoke adamantly, leaving no room for negotiation. &#39;I need him, so I&#39;d appreciate if you can keep your hands off him.&#39;

He didn&#39;t elaborate further. Delving into Granel&#39;s regenerative capabilities was grounds for trouble. He&#39;d rather keep the secret to himself, unless Alex wanted to be generous...

&#39;Some doctor has taken up residence at the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#desert-hospital</span>. A Roman Servant was with him. Caesar?&#39; He wondered out loud, not being particularly well-versed in Roman history. Or just plain history, for that matter. &#39;Both of them are useless to me. So do what you wish...&#39;

Only took us… what two invasions to even come to this?” The Holy Woman was rather amused by both Ashley and Koji doing so. 

“Well I suppose I should speak of those I have encountered. There is the fire boy, and his archer. As well as a Soldier, a Scholar, and their <em>berserker</em>. A famished spirit, it is. Then finally, that <em>musician</em> apparently had progeny. Said progeny Summoned a servant that can steal another’s appearance.” Ruth’s face morphed into a scowl as she spoke. Remembering the frankly… embarrassing situation she was forced into with Ryn and Boogieman. The thought soon passed however as she looked at Ashley.

“You have until the next week to make him part of your <em>family</em>, understood? Not simply marking him. You need to <em>end</em> him.” Her tone was full of malice and spite, as that ravenous hunger solely focused in onto Ashley. “Luring him into a false sense of security, is most definitely a good option to reaching this goal. I applaud your work so far, daughter dearest.” Venom only dripped from Ruth’s lips, even if she was congratulating the puppeteer’s plan. 

A pause was taken as Ruth took another lazy sip from her glass, and took one of the confections into her free hand. “I believe our best option moving forwards, is to <em>kill</em> the outsiders. As well as William.” She then crushed the treat in her hand and let it fall to the ground. “They need to be dealt with.”</span>

That seemed the prudent choice, should they need to make a swift exit. Or, if worse came to worse, should she need to protect her master from oncoming attack. 

But, in terms of the ongoing discussion, she had little to add. Their encounter with Granel and his Saber had already been covered, as well as their brief meeting with Dante and his other Saber. Her opinions on the outsiders, strong as they may be, would add nothing to the current chatter.

Of course, that would change at the mention of a certain playwright.

<strong>&quot;William? That fraud? Hmph, there is no need to waste the effort on killing him.&quot;</strong> Scylla snarled, her contempt for the author barely restrained. <strong>&quot;He is too busy playing author with his beloved hackjob of a Vortigern to be of any real concern to us. Better to let the leech drink its fill and fall off than try and rip it from the flesh.&quot;</strong>

She paused. Did anyone else even know who Vortigern was? Were they even aware a Servant with that name existed on the island? She did not care. Telling them would only incite their desire to know, and that, in turn, would only muddy the waters.

No, all efforts would be best spent on the slaughter of these outsiders. The petty squabbles among them could wait.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&quot;It is... true that you subjected me to a terrible fate. It is something I must not forget but... I am willing to forgive that transgression this time if you are willing to forgive my own intrusion... Your master is a victim of this place... and we both must watch over her in our own ways... to see she does not break... further. Hatred would only see ruin befall her as it has countless others,&quot; Banshee said, her reddened and leaky eyes locked onto Locusta&#39;s even as they hid underneath her brim.  The lady was stately in her beauty but grim and tired in tone, a dark cloud darkening her pale face. 

&quot;As such, we should not cross paths in anger or hostility again. I will not harm your master but will cull her dolls and in return you must not harm my master but may thin her flock. I know she is a tempting target for your concoctions but then again, Ashley&#39;s magics make her just as tempting to me...&quot; A mischevous glint that only a fairy could produce twinkled in Banshee&#39;s eye.

&quot;Our focus should be instead on the outsiders with their demons and machines who pose a grave threat to all and also bolstering our masters so they may live to see another day in clarity, a struggle I believe will demand great effort from the both of us. It can not be wasted on squabbles between us... &quot; She lightly pressed a gauntlet against Locusta&#39;s back, urging her to walk the grounds with the ghostly lady. Her hands folded neatly together and her sorrowful demeaner seemed to dry up with any tears and take on a form more fitting for a queen, planning out steps to address the problems of her court and kingdom.

 &quot;If you agree to this, I would also be willing to grant you knowledge of my own past and who I <em>truly</em> serve. The deal is yours to take, <em>sister</em>...&quot;</span>

Pain was clear in Locusta&#39;s voice, even in spite of that ghastly smile on her face as Banshee led her away. The promises that came to protect each of their masters fell on deaf and vacant ears as Locusta pulls the brim of her hat slowly over her brow. Her face blushes while her chest tightens against the soothing words, conflicted on just where she stood next to this beautiful sister of hers...

&quot;...An assassin is one who lives in darkness. A killer is one who steeps themselves elbow deep in blood. A magus wallows in the infinite depths of intellect. Each of these are capable of great power...destruction...love...woe...and potential. I am all of these...and yet, one thing I will never be...is a liar. One that will unweave the fabrics of truth and natural order. 

&quot;Sister...Banshee...I cannot promise this to you...for as much as a love burns in my heart for one who is born of the earth and breathes life in death, my soul scorches in the same intensity of hatred for your Master.&quot; Locusta&#39;s eyes glint brightly in response, the woman finally crawling from beneath the shadow of her hat to meet Banshee&#39;s gaze, her Cheshire smile widening. 

&quot;One who treats my Ashley like a dog, who couldn&#39;t even be bothered to inform her Servant of her daughters faculties. My Ashley...she is an Emperor. Her potential is shoved and lambasted by your Master, a crime I cannot forgive. She is the way she is because of your Master, but she could be so much more...so much more...if only she were to heed me and my advice...&quot; 

Caster&#39;s body shakes, partly of fear and partly of excitement; she knows Banshee can kill her on the spot. Even with her poisonous Affliction, the Berserker could likely snap her neck before the effects took hold. But Locusta...would rather die than lie about Ashley&#39;s place...

&quot;I will love you, my Sister, but not your Master...perhaps you find it hard as well...&quot;</span>

Hardly.&#39; Koji pressed his lips into a tight smile. &#39;There&#39;s no way someone like me could stake claims over someone like you. Likewise with Ashley, or the venerated Bondre heir. I am merely stating a fact when I say that I&#39;ve got a better, more important subject to tend to than keeping memorandum on who wants a piece of whom.&#39;

He leaned back into his seat and looked up at Scylla. &#39;I am done with that fool,&#39; he sighed, brushing off the issue. &#39;He&#39;s no longer worth my time.&#39;

There was an air of resignation in his voice. &#39;Here&#39;s what I believe,&#39; he said, his expression growing more thoughtful. &#39;William may have stolen my methods, but he doesn&#39;t truly understand them. He doesn&#39;t know that grafting doesn&#39;t work on what&#39;s already dead. That there&#39;s no way to improve upon something that&#39;s rotten to the core. Left to his own devices, Vortigern will eventually perish. No amount of mana batteries will save him. Not even a Servant frame can defy the laws of nature.&#39;

The light in his eyes dimmed as a trace of regret flashed through his mind. Had he wasted his efforts for nothing? Had he almost wasted his and Rider&#39;s lives just to chase after his own shadow? What had he gained out of vilifying Vortigern&#39;s existence?

Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. Even Scylla seemed to have a better grasp on their priorities than him.

<em>&#39;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re able to put up with me for so long.&#39;</em> He spoke into Scylla&#39;s mind. <em>&#39;Why didn&#39;t you say something sooner?&#39;</em>

She had. He simply never listened.</span>

The monstrous woman perched besides the doctor spoke of William, and confirmed a rumor to be true. There was some beast roaming the island by the name of Vortigern. “Interesting input.” This was then doubled down as the little birdie continued his chirping. “So that is what your <em>disdain</em> for copycats is stemming from. Well, if that is the case he shall be dealt with after the <em>invaders</em>.” The matron spoke, and her words held the weight as if she had carried out a verdict of guilt. 

Even if Ruth held no authority to do so. In this moment she might as well have been speaking right from the papal seat.</span>

Her eyes flickered around the table, to the stiff, borderline mechanical form of Alexander Bondre, over to the eternally drowsing Ashley Drakin, and then to the megalomaniacal Ruth Naomi. Yes, this certainly was a lousy bunch to be stuck with. But, she was glad that they were her neighbours, rather than the ones responsible for holding her leash. 

Well, &quot;glad they were her neighbours&quot; would be a <em>strong</em> word for it.

Ouch.

In the meantime, the conversation at the table had gone off the rails ever since the Bondre heir had interjected. Koji&#39;s hunch was right. Alex had come here in pursuit of Ruth, to put it broadly. He questioned her on the nature of her being, as if her mere existence posed a threat to him. 

Did these two go way back? Koji wasn&#39;t a native, but if there had been bad blood between two of the more prominent families within Nirvana, then surely he&#39;d have heard a thing or two about it. The fact that he <em>hadn&#39;t</em>, suggested that the nature of Alex&#39;s animosity was, perhaps, on a more personal level.

He&#39;d seen these things happen all too many times. People flocking to Ruth in pursuit of their desires, only for Ruth to spit them back out as bleached bones. Nirvanans, outsiders, affection, hostility, everything would end up the same. It was quite exciting to watch, at first.

&#39;Hunger is a wonderful phenomenon,&#39; he explained to the two Nirvanans, who insisted on bickering over the simple issue like school children at the lunch table. &#39;It&#39;s natural and good to be hungry before a meal. Nirvana&#39;s soil is rich. It only follows that those who embrace her fully have developed an appetite and grown up to be healthy and strong.&#39;

He rose from his seat.

&#39;From a biological standpoint, it&#39;s a drive born out of a human&#39;s desire to live. From a psychological standpoint...&#39; he paused, examining the table filled to the brim with dishes and bowls and platters piled high with fruits and snacks. It would take him days to go through even a portion of what had been served at the table.

It wasn&#39;t as strong as the emptiness he felt for his lost love, but it was still the same kind of lonely need. A need to sink his talons, figuratively speaking, into something more substantial than the sugary, flaky confectionery served on silver platters.

He turned to look at Scylla and shook his head slightly. <em>&#39;Gossip is good,&#39;</em> he said over their telepathic link. <em>&#39;Sometimes, it takes my mind off things. Other times, it brings it into focus. I&#39;ve learned something useful today. That no matter which way the wind blows or how hard the gusts hit, we won&#39;t ever be short on quality materials for days to come.&#39;</em>

Whether said material came from an outsider or a fellow Nirvanan was of no great significance to him.

&#39;Do you fancy a detour on the way back?&#39; He asked Scylla, making his intention to leave clear. &#39;I need to pick up a few things from a hospital. There&#39;s one in the area. Not the best stocked on the island, but it should do.&#39;</span>

Alex got up from their seat and started to follow Ruth but stopped next to Ashley. Her deteriorating mental state had not gone unnoticed by Alex, along with the animosity Ashley’s servant had towards Ruth. It also appeared that Ashley and Ruth’s servant had some altercation.

Alex put a hand on Ashley’s shoulder and learned in close. <strong>”I hear it on occasion, through the rancorous noise.”</strong> Alex whispered. <strong>”The selfless affection of a parent for their child…I’ve never heard it once from her.”</strong> Alex glanced in the direction Ruth went.

With that, Alex left to follow Ruth. Their hand went into their inner coat and grabbed their dagger. Carefully hiding it just out of view in their sleeve.

Time to enter the lion’s den.</span>

Though their opinions on the discussion differed, they both found the same conclusion. She supposed that was a good sign. A symbol of some kind of unity in thought, but she would concede that might be peering too deeply into murky water. 

All of that is to say, that they were of one mind about leaving. It made sense, really. They&#39;d learned all that was worth learning, and with the growing tensions between Alex and Ruth, the skies were clearly darkening. The storm was brewing, and it would be foolish to stick around when the waters got rough.

<strong>&quot;So be it.&quot;</strong> Rider responded positively to the notion of a detour, straightening up as she prepared to exit. <strong>&quot;It should be a fine opportunity to take the measure of the land. After all, I doubt these intruders have been taking our lapse in aggression lightly...&quot;</strong>

Her eyes flickered over to the others once more, particularly lingering on Ashley and her Assassin, as though trying to communicate her point in the most unsubtly subtle means possible.

At that, she would begin to move towards the exit, pausing at the door to ensure that Koji was following.</span>

Stopping her pace, she had turned to loom over her guest and blanketed the pint-sized woman in a cold shadow. Her hands were still folded over her lap but caster knew there had to be desire to strangle her, why else would she shake in place?

&quot;I... am saddened by your refusal... and disappointed we could not put aside this matter, <em>sister,</em> &quot; Banshee sighed before using the word Locusta gave her with her own brand of venom, the slow acting pain of guilt. Had she always used the word and affection Locusta gave her with such cold manipulation or was this a one time act of desperation, to turn back her decisions? Banshee stepped closer. 

&quot;Yet I can not deny you have surprised me. I thought you were open to shadowy agreements and cunning plans to ensure your survival,&quot; a cold iron talon ran down the side of Locusta&#39;s neck, matching the curving path of her vein. &quot;You speak with courage more fitting of one of the many warriors whose tragic ends I have mourned over the years... you fight for Ashley in spite of what it might incur... for that you have my respect...&quot;

Banshee&#39;s hand them pulled away from her neck and settled lightly upon Locusta&#39;s shoulder, her reddened eyes softening for a moment before she had to attend to those dual obligations that have come to determine her actions. 

 &quot;As for these charges you bring against my master, dear Ashley shared a similar condemnation earlier. Everyone I have met brings forth similar testimony. I have seen how she has treated those she has used up, I buried several of them.  I know Ruth is a deeply twisted individual, one who gave in to their own curse. One who should have truly perished because of all her deeds. Yet I... have this bond with her I can not shake. One I can not ignore or neglect. So it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you this...&quot; Banshee&#39;s other armored hand came to match the first on Caster.</span>

Her thumbs splayed out and down past Caster&#39;s shoulder blades and towards her heart.

&quot;I see two ways we may meet again, either when I fulfill my promise to Ashley and claim the rest of the corpses she keeps for company or when I fulfill my promise to Ruth and protect her against any threat to her life. I pray that I will only see you in the former case, thought that is not my choice to make..&quot; she ruefully sighed, her hands still pressed against her guest.</span>

She waited by the door as Alex took a stop and whispered to Ashley. The lioness stood poised, as the door to the manor swung open. 

Ruth then walked into her own home. Admiring her own decor. “Alex Bondre. You are quite… interesting. Showing up, uninvited. Calling me on a supposed lie. Saying I will only become <em>gluttonous</em>.” She continued her waltz through her own home, before finally reaching the stairwell. 

From The Holy Matron’s raised position, she stared down upon The Empath. “I would like to know <em>why</em>. Why have you chosen to show up to our <em>gathering</em>?”</span>

Just looking into her eyes gives Locusta the deeper impression of watching someone&#39;s soul and will tower over your own, the divide between them both even greater as she can feel brimming power and rage shaking in the metallic gauntlets. The tracing of her own carotid artery along her slender neck hitches her breathing, though if Banshee was expecting fear...it would be the last thing she would receive...

&quot;Oh...do you promise, <em>Sister?</em>&quot; Her voice wavers, her own hands shaking as she places them gently on Banshee&#39;s gauntlets, almost begging for her to push her deeper into the earth. Locusta&#39;s eyes shine violently, relishing every taste of pure malice that wafts from Banshee&#39;s figure, drinking in the bitter taste and miasma of blight eagerly. &quot;Do not make such promises if you cannot provide the strength to stand by them...but I know your power...it is most impressive, enough to kill me here, even now...&quot;

But still, that malicious streak basks in the diminutive form, Caster sending a sly glance back to the table as she watches the proceedings come to an end. Ashley was left alone as Ruth stalked off with the automaton...one last glimpse at the one called Koji as his Servant casts one last disgusted glance her way. Perhaps it would have been best to meet the others...gauge this Koji and Servant&#39;s willingness to offer a hand with Ruth...but their prompt retreat gave her the impression that neither would be willing. Ashley...her family...was this truly what she considered a family? 

&quot;...But, we should also consider...&quot; she finally adds, her glare receding and leaving only the husk behind once more, a dopey smile gracing those lips once more as she stands limply in Berserker&#39;s grasp. 

&quot;That between us both, it&#39;s 1 count of death in my favor. And I&#39;d be glad to kill you as many times as you wish, Dear Sister...I can tell it&#39;s part of your very core...&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Rewritten Eagan, Princess Bride</span></span>

I dare to say we&#39;ve missed quite a bit of the festivities with our little catch up.&quot; She gestures now, arms outstretched at the thinning herd of parties, eyeing quite covetously the leftover pitcher of wine at the table...something she would have to take part of as an esteemed guest....maybe some of the cheeses too...

&quot;Your Master is currently leaving with that Bondre fellow...my Master has made mention of him, and suffice to say...well, perhaps your presence is needed with this dear matter. Oh, and do bring up your plan with the Holy Mother...I suspect you already have, but with her, it&#39;s worth reminding. Hunger goes to one&#39;s brain, after all...&quot; 

With one last squeeze of her gauntlets, Locusta slips away from her grasp, skipping lightly to the table and bounding next to her Master, from whom she callously takes her glass as she pours a rather...that&#39;s a lot of wine...<em>refreshment</em> into her cup. &quot;So, I take it the meeting was a resounding success? You must forgive me, Master, for politics bore me incessantly. I prefer actions over words.&quot; Her words were almost drowned themselves as Locusta takes a long draught from the glass, draining the burgundy spirits completely before pouring another, along with reaching (strenuously, curse this high table) for the hors de vours. &quot;Sho, wiw he hawp usch? (So, will he help us?)&quot; She asks through a mouthful, referring to Koji and Scylla.</span>

He caught up to Rider in quick strides. &#39;Do not worry,&#39; he said, giving her an encouraging pat across the back. &#39;If the recordings from my scouts are anything to go by, a group of them should have taken refuge at a safehouse near the lake. Including a certain Granel Mason and his Saber.&#39;

All that was left to do was to conduct a carpet search of the vicinity of the lake. All in a day&#39;s work.</span>

Alex was very much focused on Ruth, the purple light following her like a spotlight. Alex knew that they were at a disadvantage, in Ruth&#39;s home territory and without a servant of their own. But, Alex felt that they couldn&#39;t play passively anymore. Perhaps it was whatever was riling up the natives, or maybe Alex had finally reached the limits of their patience.

<strong>&quot;What are you and Verga planning?&quot;</strong> Alex bluntly asked.</span>

“Verga and I have a few plans in mind. Let’s say that Nirvana will most definitely be <em>more quiet</em>.” Ruth did not dance around the answer, responding in a directly blunt manner to how Alex asked the question. “One step towards ascendance.”

She shook her head but remind quiet, as she didn&#39;t want any words to reach back to Ruth&#39;s ears in any way. She didn&#39;t want to be involved in her and Alex&#39;s fight but she knew she would be next. If she fought or not she would be taken next. To protect her family she would have to remove any threat, all threats, even those who she would call <em>parents</em>.

&quot;Come on lets just go home now~ We have a new guest to prepare for~ A new member of the family~&quot;

Caster could tell from her words that wasn&#39;t the intent but for most of the others who hadn&#39;t seen her much in this new state, many couldn&#39;t tell what she meant or what she was even talking about. Snatching another bottle of wine from the table while Ruth was busy for her dear caster, since she herself did not store any alcohol back home. Grabbing Caster she started for the door, hoping to make it out before anyone could mention the boat once more.

The empath lunged. Ozone filled the air. A singular strike of lighting firing from the woman towards her attacker. “<strong>DIE THEN</strong>” She screamed both in agony and in anger.</span>

Most ordinary folk would&#39;ve been felled or stopped by such a attack.

Instead, Alex followed through.

With inhuman tenacity, Alex stepped forward and plunged their dagger into Ruth&#39;s pristine flesh. No sound came from Alex, no growls of rage, no grunts of exertion. They exuded the persona of the automaton they were often mistaken for, a being that wanted nothing more than to kill Ruth. There was no malice or spite, but a similar feeling one gets when they remove a pest.

The temperature dropped as three golems of ice manifested behind Alex, their hands sharpened into icy daggers. With a twist of their ritual dagger, Alex ripped their blade free from Ruth in a spray of blood as the three golems descended onto her.</span>

&quot;Then know that you may have scored first blood and that while my frame may be susceptible to your poisons, my endurance to fulfill my duty is endless and all you need to do is make one mistake. The game would be over in that moment...&quot; Banshee responded with one last intense glare and press of her gauntlets.

&quot;Thank you again for your company, Caster. We will continue the matter once again in the future as fate wills. So long, Sister...&quot; And with that, the sisters in death parted ways, each heading towards their respective masters. Banshee kept to the wings of the estate, avoiding the main reception area. 

Any interaction with her fellow islanders would likely be a waste given that the guests seemed to be leaving. Except for the one that had pursued her own master deeper within the estate. The one she had almost barred entrance from given their lack of invitation.

Ruth would be alone with them, no one else to witness their acts, no one else to guard her, no one else to protect and <em>love</em> her. Ruth by herself saw herself as strong but Banshee knew she was weak in isolation, dependent on the attention others would give her. No wonder she had given in to her curse, that monster could hide the weakness from her even as it continued to fester. Only Banshee could save her... She did not realize that her pace had quickened until she reached the door to the inner rooms.</span>

She couldn&#39;t believe the sight before her and there was no holding back the tears and the screams. She had been too late, the unwanted guest really was an assassin and she had not kept her suspicions up. How naive of her... only to spot the knife held aloft by Alex and the deep red blood dripping off it.

She could no longer think in that moment. All seemed to go red or black and Alex would suffer the crack of lightning only to feel the immense pressure of the storm about to break behind him.

&quot;<strong>GET AWAY FROM HER, YOU MURDERER!</strong>&quot; Banshee screamed, her voice misaligned with itself and resulting in a disorienting flange. They would not be able to make a move before the wrathful servant clamped down upon the knife bearing hand. Like a meager bundle of twigs, all the bones in their hand shattered and gave way before the cold, merciless iron and reduced to naught but a misshapen, red fleshly lump. The knife clattered harmlessly to the floor while Alex levitated up several inches. 

Banshee felt her tears thicken and something heavy flow out of the corners of her mouth. Her hearted beated as it had rarely done before, drilling into her the same instant of loss on each beat. Alex and Ruth would see Berserker&#39;s pale skin tighten and her tears turn black and ruddy, leaving dark lines on her cheeks and chin, a maddened red glow burning in her sockets.

Alex would then be thrown into the nearest wall with a force that would plant them firmly within the wall and send tremors through their spine. All the while, their mind would quickly become awash in a familiar stormy sea, the waves churning with whitecaps of anger and fear and the winds howling of vengeance and desperation. What sanity and placidity calmed this ocean had disappeared as soon as her master&#39;s blood diluted those waters...</span>

<strong>”So it was you, the source of that damnable wail.”</strong> The flickering helmet gazed at Banshee before turning towards Ruth. <strong>”Shame, I wasn’t fast enough in killing you.”</strong>

Two of the ice golem leapt to attack Banshee, while the third began to slash with wild abandon at Ruth. At the same time, the image of Alex flickered and they completely disappeared from sight.</span>

The blade was plunged right into her abdomen, the crimson of the dress increased ten fold. The knife then withdrawn with a spray of blood. Then a cool sensation swept over her home. The empath summoning 3 small golems to do their bidding. 

However it was not all hopeless. For Her Angel of death has arrived to the scene. That beautiful specter of stone and sorrow. The banshee would for certain rescue her. “My dearest….” 

Alex was tossed as if they were a rag doll. Now embedded into the wall like one of her many many decorations. Ruth crawled from the floor in an attempt to reach berserker, but forwards progress halted by the ice golems. 

Those 7 beautiful points of bright glowing light then showed themselves upon her forehead. “If you were a professional, you would’ve went for the throat.” The woman responded snappily as a singular point of light was fired off towards the golem approaching her. 

“Banshee… dearest… I appreciate your rescue. How shall we deal with this <em>pest</em>.”</span>

She was not too late and because of her intervention, her master still lived. Now it was simply time to make sure that Alex could never hurt her again...

The berserker would wail loudly, sending another toxic wave of emotions to wherever Alex was hiding, the muddy tears continuing to seep from her eyes and pool around her. She needed not to look at the ice golems as she sent a wave of sharpened stone spears to skewer one in its place while she caught the other with a armored hand and crushed the ice within her grasp before twisting to grab it again with both hands. With little effort, she sundered it in half, revealing her wounded lover in red and black. 

&quot;<strong>It is simple, we make sure they never can leave and then we</strong> <em><strong>crush them</strong></em>,&quot; her eyes gleamed with baleful energy, constantly scanning for the faintest glimmer of light before an idea hatched in her mind as she watched the dark liquid of her misery pool before her feet.

With one violent motion, the floor beneath it shattered and many stone pillars shot out of the floor, scattering that dark liquid to all corners of the room and any occupants within it, seen or unseen.</span>
