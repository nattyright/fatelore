Leading for one nosy gentleman to obtain the letter left behind by her admirer. 

Entertainment to go along with his morning cup of coffee. 

That was a perk of being Ruth&#39;s keeper.  Jayce was able to live in the luxury that the Holy Mother herself enjoyed. With much less responsibility. 

Keeping the granddaughter, the experiment of, Eliemelech Naomi inline. Keeping her happy. Keeping her up to date with what is going on in Nirvana. Keeping her <em>alive</em>. 

The gentleman&#39;s hands held the letter gently. <em>He</em> had to have sent it. 

The biggest asset to the cult leader, and his greatest pain in the ass. It was most likely an invitation, an article to edit, or some other frivolous thing.  

&quot;What will he be getting up too...&quot; Jayce spoke opening the letter and seeing that it is just an innocent invitation. For a <em>private</em> interview. Up to the lady&#39;s choice on location. 

The man rolled his eyes while reading from the correspondence. Setting it back within the envelope and leaving it upon her favorite coffee table.  Whilst he took up his favorite seat in the den. Waiting for the <em>goddess</em> to awaken.</span>

He never showed up early, nor did he show up late. Precision was his strong suit, but he rarely aimed for it. If anything, it was simply the outcome of a man dedicated to reality. Everything he wrote was real. Everything he said was real. If he told someone he would show up at 5? He would show up at that precise moment.

The moment the clock marked the 10th hour, he was already knocking on the door to the Naomi estate.

&quot;Buongiorno? Buonasera? Buon pomeriggio?&quot; Verga asked, knocking thrice before stopping. &quot;It&#39;s Verga. Here for the usual meeting. It&#39;s been a month.&quot; He smiled as he tapped his sunglasses, waiting for someone to answer his call. <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span>

In the time before opening the door he had to prepare himself for <em>him</em>. Getting the grimacing out of his system before opening the door with a forced smile. 

“Ahhhh Signore Verga. Welcome to <span class="mention">#the-naomi-estate</span>! The lady of the house had an exhilarating day the day before.” He spoke, the smile still being forced as he gestured Verga into the room. “Please come in come in.” 

The jaded man turnt away and walked back into the den. “We have some wine if you’d like, or coffee.” His voice carried as a stirring was heard from above. “Looks like she’s awoken.”</span>

The Holy Mother waltzed downstairs to the arrival of her most devoted fan. “Verga dearest! Welcome welcome!” Her smile was bright as she continued her descent.

Hand gingerly outstretched inviting the traditional greeting Ruth expected.</span>

&quot;Ah, madame!&quot; Verga licked his lips for a split second before leaning towards Ruth&#39;s outstretched hand. He gave a quick kiss, grazing the woman&#39;s hand with his stache and beard before retreating.

&quot;As youthful as ever, I see. I can&#39;t remember the last time I met a lady who got <em>younger</em> with age. Truly, you are a feast upon the eyes.&quot; Verga exclaimed, adjusting his glasses, as if implying that he was getting a good view.

&quot;Alas, I am not here for pleasure alone, as much as I wish it to be so.&quot; He brazenly took back Ruth&#39;s arm, nudging it towards his chest. &quot;Shall we go somewhere a little bit more...private? My next words are meant for you and you alone.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span>

Ruth simply traced her fingers along the caster’s chest. “Ooooo please continue with the flatteries!” The Holy mother playfully giggled before her hand glided up towards his face. 

“Yes of course dear.” Her head turned towards Jayce who already understood the request. “Jayce, honey, do treat yourself to a bottle of something on your way out.” 

The man left the estate. Whilst Ruth guided Verga up to her personal chambers. “I hope you do not mind, but we can chat as I get <em>dressed~</em>” The woman spoke whilst winking opening the door to the opulently decorated room. 

She doffed the over robe, then began to speak. “So what business must we discuss? A new article about what my congregation is doing against the invaders? 10 beauty secrets to keeping yourself as youthful as I have?  Hmmm?” The cult leader mused, gliding into her closet before going completely nude. Meticulously picking out her outfit for the day.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ruth fully reveled in her appearance. Why would she not? In her eyes, her beauty was unparalleled. Other people&#39;s eyes would say the same. Verga definitely agreed, as he glanced at her at every occasion. Were it not for his thick shades, she would have been able to see his eyes pop out from her naked form. The luxurious room was nothing compared to the spectacle unfolding in front of him.

Were he younger, he might have tried some moves. Were he older, he might have <em>doubled down</em> on it. However, he was fortunate enough to have been summoned in his prime. There were some things that only a man in the eclipse of his lifespan could notice. Beauty that went beyond flesh and pleasure. The beauty of the heart.

And how great it felt to rip one apart.

&quot;Oh, do not fret, bella.&quot; Verga chuckled. &quot;I write my articles in advance. Just like how there is more than one way to skin a cat, there is more than one way to transcribe your magnificence in words alone.&quot; He laughed while staring at her shapely rear.

&quot;I am merely here to be <em>given</em> news, for once. After all, our relationship has been nothing but give and take: I advertise your congregation and you indulge me with your...pleasures.&quot; He grinned. &quot;But, there is a different type of reward that I would like today. Let us start with something simple.&quot;

He took a seat on one of Ruth&#39;s many chairs. With the amount of suitors she had around, her room was nothing but accommodating. He then slowly removed his shades, letting his foxy eyes shine through. This man had a goal in mind, one with a glint of madness in it.

Allowing the lustful gaze of Verga to remain trained solely on her magnificent body. Enjoying every single moment of it.  Before Ruth began to dress herself. 

“Ah to be given news, by me?” The woman giggled still in her playful manner. “What a novel idea coming from you~” 

Then her demeanor changed. No longer the flirtatious woman. Now a serious force to be reckoned with, as she turned to face Verga. Front side still as bare as the day she was born. “<em>This third batch…</em>” Venomously she spat those words from her mouth. 

“They are… interesting so far…” She recalled her own encounters with them so far… That fire boy with his Archer… Ace Colin and his Berserker. “Things have not escalated to a breaking point. They are still just as <em>foolish</em> as their predecessors. Their means of leaving this land is all but destroyed. It’ll only be a matter of time before they are all hunted down and killed. As for their numbers…. Low. Those who made it off of the boat probably number in the dozen. Not counting what servants may have been summoned.” 

She then turned back again whilst placing her undergarments. The pencil skirt and cropped top blouse remained hanging up. “Why do you have such an interest in these matters, Verga? Is it to make up for what that hack Shakespeare did on the day of the boat’s arrival?” Ruth’s head cocked over her shoulder looking back towards the servant.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Over time, one would be capable of noticing Ruth&#39;s subtle changes in demeanor. Verga was one of the first Nirvanans to notice, since his acute eyesight was a force to be reckoned with. He took joy in feeling the anxiety in the woman&#39;s face. Some traits were far more arousing than flesh and blood alone.

&quot;Oh? What about Shakespeare? I can&#39;t say I heard of that.&quot; Verga replied with a smirk, much to Ruth&#39;s surprise. He had approached her without even knowing about the bard&#39;s intervention?

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing about it from your lips, of course.&quot; He snickered. &quot;But I would rather get my say first.&quot;

He lazily placed his arms on the chair&#39;s sides. Just like the tone of his voice, his body looked nothing but relaxed. &quot;Do you think I didn&#39;t take notice of the little skirmish at the forest? Along with that ghastly being you call your Servant? I wonder where you got her from. Coincidentally, I haven&#39;t seen lady Rosemary in a while.&quot; He rubbed his temples with a wicked grin on his face.

&quot;The lady I know required no Servants for the first and second batch of investigators. This third one, however, has managed to corner you into summoning one. I wonder why. Perhaps Shakespeare really had something to do with it, or perhaps, my dear-&quot; Verga&#39;s head leaned forward. &quot;you simply got <em>complacent.</em>&quot;

A wave of pressure washed down on her. Gravity had increased threefold. Her body felt more naked than usual. <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span>

I would&#39;ve expected him to sing just like my little <em>birdie&#39;s</em> pets.&quot; This made the woman mildly confused, knowing what she did of that boisterous servant. It was a surprise Verga had little clue.  

 Then another... more upsetting phrase passed through Verga&#39;s lips. &quot;My servant, is a beautiful thing. As for Lady Rosemary... She had what I wanted.&quot; It was interesting to see the anxiety mix with the love she once felt for the Druid. Perhaps it was guilt. 

Finally, the silver fox spoke the killing words. <em>&quot;You simply got Complacent&quot;</em> 

Ruth felt the weight of the world upon her shoulders. Losing her edge, losing that sensation of her confidence. &quot;I. Did. Not... The... The Servant. She is but a useful tool. <em>It</em> is a useful tool. These new invaders, I simply wanted to deal with them fast. A... A servant was the best route to accomplish this.&quot; Her hands curled into fists, threatening to break skin and bleed from her palms.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Verga listened closely. The different intonations of Ruth&#39;s voice. Her demeanor slowly changing with each tidbit of news. It was a delight to witness, like unfurling each page in a book and fully absorbing its contents. There was no artform that could replace people, that much Verga had admitted to himself.

Or at least, there wasn&#39;t <em>yet.</em>

&quot;I see. I&#39;m quite a fan of tools, don&#39;t get me wrong. Typewriters, computers, tablets, you name it! All of those are inventions I wish had existed during my lifetime.&quot; Verga said with a smile. &quot;So, if a Servant makes things easier for you, then go ahead! Use them to your heart&#39;s content. But...&quot;

&quot;Why not earlier? I find it hard to believe that no one on the island would be willing to give away their frames to you. It&#39;s been years since the first batch of outsiders. You had more than ample time to get a frame.&quot; The writer pointed out with a curious expression on his face. The math didn&#39;t add up, and he knew that Ruth knew that.

<strong>&quot;Are you running out of time?</strong> Is that why you are rushing? I wonder, what exactly are you looking forward to? Is there a party going on that I haven&#39;t been invited to?&quot; He rested his head on his fingers, crossing his legs as he moved one of them up and down. <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If there was one thing Verga excelled at, it was being able to manipulate Ruth. Read her expression. Prod further and further beneath the surface, and not awaken that beast she held within. 

The Gentleman knew the math was not adding up, The lady did as well. “I didn’t choose to summon one for those <em>others</em> to summon one <em>earlier</em>… Because it did not suit my wishes at the time.” The Holy Mother spoke, thinking it was the truth but the silvered words of this fox cut once more. 

<strong>”Are you running out of time?”</strong> The metaphorical stake struck through the vampire’s heart. 

She was defenseless to this singular truth. <strong>”I AM NOT.”</strong> 

Ruth lashed out like a wild beast, striking just above Verga’s head with a bolt of electricity. Leaving the man’s magnificent facial hair statically charged. 

It took a moment for the cult leader to regain composure. Deep breaths were all that came from her for that moment stretched into infinity. Her fists finally relaxing, leaving deep indents within her palms. Forcing herself upright as much as possible. “I am not <em>running</em> out of time Verga. If you truly want to <em>know</em>. This servant… was a long time coming. 

“It was to be the next step to my utter dominion of Nirvana. Then the rest of this world. <strong> My Key to ascendance.</strong>” Ruth stepped forwards, whilst more composed now… her eyes held a ravenous madness. It was clear her <strong>hunger</strong> was gaining a better footing upon her being. “That will be a party you will be given a v.i.p invitation to.”

Verga felt a jolt run down his spine. His hair was frazzled, sticking out at various areas due to the sparks that had coalesced upon his head. He started patting down the edges, adjusting his hairstyle as Ruth droned on about her ambitions. Most people were attracted to Ruth for two things: Beauty and power. She had plenty of the latter, and even more of the former. Verga, however, was unique. To him, the most beautiful aspect of the lady in front of him was her ravenous hunger. An aspect that she had never spoken of out loud, of course.

But he would be blind to not see it. Her subtle body language. The murderous aroma in her words. It made him quiver in anticipation. He pulled his stache and twirled it around, patting out the inconsistencies spawned by the sparks as Ruth explained her plans for total global domination.

&quot;I understand. Wine only gets sweeter with age, after all.&quot; Verga chuckled as he stroked his beard. &quot;And you&#39;re quite the patient woman. However, I think there is a difference between patience and hastiness.&quot;

&quot;In Italy, we often say, <em>chi coglie il frutto acerbo, si pente di averlo gustato.</em>&quot; He said with a smirk. &quot;In layman&#39;s terms, grabbing a fruit while it isn&#39;t ripe simply makes hold even more bitterness towards it. I can sense that bitterness from you rising.&quot;

<strong>&quot;But I don&#39;t dislike it.</strong> In fact, I would say I am rather fond of it.&quot; He followed afterward, throwing a curveball in Ruth&#39;s line of thought. Did Verga just say that he enjoyed seeing her hunger in plain view? &quot;You should be honest to yourself. How long will you keep being hungry? Are you truly a God if you wait in line for things to go your way? Gods don&#39;t choose. <strong>They take.</strong>&quot;

His face shone brightly as he grinned past his cheeks, letting his pearly whites blind Ruth completely.</span>

Verga then spoke of a proverb. Showing his infatuation with the <strong>hunger</strong> Ruth held in her being. This was an unusual thing to grace the woman&#39;s ears. Yet, it was welcome and unexpected compliment to hear. &quot;You find this <strong>consuming</strong> nature... Beautiful? Perhaps I was right to keep you so close...&quot;

&quot;These points you make are excellent. I should keep taking <em>what I want</em>. As I did with Rosemary. As I will do to the rest of this island. As I wish to do with the World.&quot; The words fell from the cult leader&#39;s mouth. As if she was salivating over the thought of a hunger that could always be satisfied. &quot;I suppose I am waiting for <strong>nothing</strong>. These new invaders will be shown they are nothing, but a nuisance. Those who will not join, shall sate my <em>hunger</em>. Become the foundation of The Holy Mother&#39;s rise... The Bones used to build the throne of a <strong>god</strong>.&quot; 

Those crazed eyes only intensified as she took a step forwards to Verga. The line between Ruth and the thing known as Ruth Naomi was blurred. He had broken her down. Then subsequently rebuilt the woman. Into a form that more emphasized her self destructive beauty. 

Another step forwards. &quot;If gods, like myself, do take. Then I would love to take of your being. <em>Verga</em>.&quot; The Holy Mother&#39;s gaze ate through the gentleman, clear with its intentions.

He listened closely to Ruth&#39;s declaration, watching her succumb to unhinged temptations as she was already envisioning the far, far future in her mind. A monster in sheep&#39;s clothing, that would raze the land and poison the soil. A beast far more sickening than a plague.

The aroma of death that followed Ruth was like sweet nectar. An aroma that not even she could escape from. A normal person would attempt to sway her from this road with no good ends, but not Verga. If anything, he wanted to see how worse it could get.

Ruth then asserted her will, proposing herself to Verga. The writer smiled, putting back his shades as he twirled his mustache. &quot;You flatter me, dear. However, you can&#39;t expect <em>me</em> to be satisfied with being taken at this stage of your life.&quot; He pointed out.

&quot;Would you rather devour me right now or at your peak? Think about it. What sort of pleasures would I give you now, besides satiating you as an afternoon snack? I&#39;m sure your good friend Jayce is more suited to that.&quot; He stood up, a grin on his face as he stretched his arms and tapped the floor with the soles of his feet. He was itching to get out.

&quot;I am a greedy man, Ruth. I won&#39;t be satisfied unless I&#39;m eaten by a true <strong>monster.</strong> I find you cute. An adorable kitten. But I&#39;ve always been more into cougars.&quot; He fearlessly walked in front of her, towering over the woman as his face was now mere centimeters away from her. He then grabbed her arm, pulling it towards him as he placed her wrist on his lips and started slowly kissing downward, moving up to her elbow.</span>

&quot;This is mine. This is also mine. These limbs will take me once your work is done and rip me to shreds. But until then, I won&#39;t accept this mockery of yours. If you plan to eat me, <strong>you better do it right.</strong>&quot; He proudly declared before placing her own arm against her neck, almost choking her.

&quot;Gods may take, but it is humans who give them power. A God that is not worshipped might as well <em>not be a God at all.&quot;</em>

With that, Verga relaxed, giving Ruth air to breathe while he stroked his beard.

&quot;Do you have any cigars? I was planning on having a smoke before I left. On your bed, of course.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii(Fairy(Derogatory))</span></span>

Her arm was taken into his hands. Fearless of the Holy Mother in front of him. &quot;A true <em>monster</em> I shall become... At that point I shall have less use of you as well. Your only purpose to sanctify this body with your <em>essence</em>.&quot; The woman leaned in as kisses were placed from her arm up to her elbow. 

Then Ruth&#39;s arm was wrapped around her own neck. Reaching the point of strangulation. Verga giving a lesson on God-hood to the Holy Mother. Something she was familiar with, but having a teaching from the Silver-tongued fox made it seem new. Exciting, and Novel. Then she was released, as he backed away. 

&quot;Ah... of course, I always keep a stash in that dresser right there.&quot; She turned from Verga and finished dressing. &quot;Do help your self to more than one.&quot;</span>
