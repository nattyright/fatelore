            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A tropical jungle designed to host exotic animals, ranging from monkeys to tigers and poison frogs. Since it is one of the more dangerous reserves, a lot of protective Magecraft and surfaces have been applied to the area, stopping tourists from exploring off-limits areas while keeping the animals safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seems like the system hasn’t been maintained in a long while, leading to the barriers falling as animals started to prey on each other. It is recommended to approach this area with caution, lest an anaconda coil up to you and gobble you up.</div>

Octavius used a similar path that he used previously when he traveled to the merch store alone. Thankfully it seemed as though there was less traction on this end of the island than other areas, or so it seemed. Unlike the little look around he did outside of the merch store where it seemed as though the inhabitants of the island frequented, the tropics was a calmer trip indeed. Aside from the escaped wildlife that they ran into from time to time, there were no distinct problems that they faced. Octavius saw a few exotic animals on their trip, such as a few monkeys, a large snake, a lone tiger with a monkey in its mouth, it was a sight to behold. 

For most of the trip, he carried Dante to increase their speed of travel and to not risk being stopped by anything. Especially after they found an investigator hanging from a tree at one point, this slowed down their travel speed a bit in for caution and traps. As they passed, the emperor didn&#39;t even cut down the dead investigator, he didn&#39;t want to find out if it was a trap or not. If there was time and the body was still there, he promised to himself that he would cut the body down and bury it himself. Octavius for certain didn&#39;t want to be caught unaware in this new area. Any rest stop was done either in deep coverage such as in a hole covered by shrubbery and foliage or in the treetops. This saved them once as he and Dante narrowly missed a few identically dressed Islanders that passed just below them as day turned into night.

Occasionally to save time he would wait for him to fall asleep to then continue to carry him further into the tropical district. I&#39;m the early morning however, they made it near what seemed to be near some sort of containment area for animals to be treated or some similar function. While looking at the building from the safety of a tree branch, Octavius was startled as he heard a set of screams off in the distance. It was either those figures that passed by them earlier, perhaps being set upon by the wildlife, or something worse. Octavius turned to Dante and put his hand on his shoulder. &quot;My hunch might have been correct, it is possible he is near. If not him then those screams were caused by some other creature or inhabitant. Either way we&#39;ve come a long way to not investigate right?&quot; He said with a semi reassuring eyebrow raise that phrased the question into a rhetorical one and made the entire situation seem as if it wasn&#39;t that big of a deal. &quot;After this battle, we are going to take an actual break from life and death encounters.&quot; He muttered as he turned back to the direction that he heard the screams. He could have sworn as well he heard a roar along with the screams of agony.</span>

The body that had been strung up as if it decorated the limbs of trees, the animals that populated the area, and the colors of the flora that grew around them. Had it been another location without its gruesome amenities, he could have thought this would have been a trip. He’d had enjoyed it. But, this current show of dangers, each one had been a deterrent to remind himself that though the island was beautiful, it’s origins were shrouded in mystery and much more, stained with blood.</em>

<em>Still, he tried to keep his silence around his servant when unneeded, though he thought at times that maybe being silent could have also been a reason he was deemed incompetent in such a situation. He hadn’t spoken at all really. When the servant had ordered him to complete something, he felt that he was supposed to do it, that or he’d be left alone in the island. Or, that’d they’d both meet an untimely end. He didn’t want to die, but he specifically didn’t want to alone in such a place. So nothing was fought, only giving brief answers that showed his compliance. During the night, if he were truly in a deep sleep, he’d find that the saber would have continued forward, moving about until he woke up in a different place when he woke.</em></span>

Dante instantly looked toward the saber, hoping he’d had heard the same as well. Had it been of animal or human origin? With the things he had seen. . . It wouldn’t have been surprised had it been either. Octavius’ suggestion was elicited by a head nod of Dante. They’d have to investigate. . .

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The tropical reserve had been left untouched, and for good reason. Whatever protective barriers and containers that had been put in place for the animals were now long gone. All that were left were remnants of signboards, partially covered by overgrown flora as Dante and Octavius marched onward. They caught glimpses of the descriptions, which described animals from the old world. Snow leopards, snub nosed monkeys, ostriches and kangaroos. Creatures that they had only heard of in books at most. To see them in the flesh was one of Nirvana&#39;s main attractions.

To see their corpses, on the other hand, was the most grave disservice one could be offered. Dante felt sickly upon witnessing the disheveled bodies of animals littering the path in front of him. Anything from lions to elephants was sprawled at his feet, either as a whole body or as smaller pieces. Prey and predators were slaughtered alike. What was worse was the fact that Octavius couldn&#39;t discern what did this. He hoped that it had been Vortigern, but he knew for a fact that the Berserker would have slaughtered beasts in a far more ruthless manner. There were no signs of slashes nor burns on the dead creatures. Instead, there were bite marks, bumps and scratches.

It was obvious what had happened: The creatures had preyed on each other, as if driven by an insatiable hunger. In all of his years governing as an emperor, he had never witnessed such cruelty amongst animals. Survival of the fittest was one thing, but this went beyond that. It was aggression for the sake of aggression. Anger held for no purpose besides that to destroy.

He held that thought once he finally found a clue leading to his actual target: One of the beasts had a faint scorch mark on its flesh. Third-degree burns that reminded him of his own fingers when he gripped Vortigern&#39;s sword. A trail of blood followed the felled creature.

Either Vortigern was injured, or he had slaughtered enough to leave a trail.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius grimaced every single time he saw a new creature that had been mauled by another. It was unnatural and it made him sick. He wanted to figure out terribly why this island was as insane as it was. The circle of life was out of balance, cults were wandering around undeterred, the Investigators that came here to gain new information for both selfless and selfish means were hunted and slaughtered alike. This island truly was a pocket of hell itself and whomever or whatever caused this needed to be cured and destroyed. Octavius couldn&#39;t accept that this was caused by anything remotely natural or humane. What could be done or sought after in a tourist trap like Nirvana to make things end up like this? A place more savage than the various enemies of Rome that he faced in his time. <em>What foul experiments or magic happened that caused such chaos?</em> 

He turned to Dante and nodded before grabbing his master and hopping down to the floor of the forested area next to the burned corpse. The Emperor knelt by the animal, running his hand along with the beast and checked the wounds, and studied the burn mark.

&quot;It seems we have a trail Dante and a direction. Hopefully, this trail is the blood of the berserker, which hopefully means it&#39;s still as injured as our first encounter with him. That&#39;ll make this easier eh? Even then, we can&#39;t let our guard down, we don&#39;t know what other abilities Vortigern has at his disposal besides his swords. For all we know, the feats he pulled off were the passive abilities of them.&quot; He said and stood back up, turning to Dante with a skeptical look to make sure he followed and began walking and following the blood trail, summoning Auram Pax into his right hand just in case of an attack, whether it be Vortigern or any nearby wild beast that wanted to try the emperor.</span>

<em>It had seemed as if the deeper they traversed, the more violent and gruesome the deaths had become. At first he assumed it had been natural selection, things died, be it because couldn’t survive in the tropics, or because something had to prey on them. But this had been clearly different.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Now that Dante mentioned it, it was suspicious that Vortigern hadn&#39;t healed yet if this was truly a blood trail of his. While it was true that they gave him a run for his money in their first encounter, it took him three days with his master&#39;s help and use of Pax Romana to fully recover from his injuries. If this was truly a trail of the berserker&#39;s blood, then that meant that it hadn&#39;t healed much at all in these three days. If they were right in their speculation that the mad man had no master, then it was safe to assume that they would encounter a much weakened Vortigern, which was mostly wishful thinking. In any case, this meant that Vortigern was still recovering. As this trail meant he had dragged a corpse to feed on in substitution for mana months r his blood. This was good, if he had been at full strength then they would truly be in trouble. 

&quot;It&#39;s a shame if he doesn&#39;t have a master, less Intel that we can gain, but it&#39;ll make it easier to get rid of Berserker if he has no mana support. When we do find and battle him, any damage we do to him will be a lot more substantial than any done against us. We can recover, he can not.&quot; At saying that, the Caesar gave a confident smile back at his master as he spin his sword in his hand cockily, but there was more to his casual expression. After the spin, he gripped his blade tightly in his hand. A wild dog let loose on this island. That fact made this situation all the sourer for Octavius. If Vortigern had a master, the Saber could have understood the rampage and the attack. Now, however, if there was indeed no Master, they needed to end Vortigern and find out why this wild dog has appeared now of all times. Koji had seemed confused by its existence back at the morgue, so it was a natural existence to be free on Nirvana. Something or someone wanted Vortigern loose and he wanted to find out why. His drive to find out the cause of Vortigern, kept him moving along the trail at a determined pace.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The trail of blood seemed unending. Likewise, the more they followed it, the more they felt like the burnt carcasses were piling up. Surprisingly, it felt easy to accept animals being slaughtered by Vortigern. Far easier than admitting that they might have killed each other out of nothing but pure malice. Octavius had already grown accustomed to the evils of man in his past, but Dante was a mere chick. He wouldn&#39;t know how to compute such obscenity in front of him. The emperor, wise as he was, was quick to remind Dante of their mission. Not only to get things back on track, but to also dissuade his partner from thinking too much about unnecessary things. There was no room for reluctance in a battle.

<em>fssssssssss</em>

Their pace quickened once they heard the sound of sizzling in the air. Like a pot boiling water or the smell of beef on coals. It was hard to miss it after their firsthand experience back at their home base. Without a doubt, Vortigern&#39;s flaming sword was nearby. Octavius&#39; grip around his blade tightened as he made sure that Dante was behind him. If his Master went down, not only would he lose his partner, but his mana source as well.

The trail of blood went cold, with nothing but droplets remaining. The two were forced to continue onward with nothing but their wits and ears. They followed the source of the sizzling until they found it: The twin blades, embedded on a rock that was practically melting from the sheer heat of the sword. Vortigern had most likely placed it there to avoid burning the whole forest down.

But where was he? Why would he toss his weapons aside?

They looked around, inspecting their surroundings as they noticed a lake just a few paces away from them. It was small and knee deep, ideal for baths and retreats. A perfectly common sight, were it not for the black blob lurking in the middle of it.</span>

It was fully healed. Whatever injuries the Berserker had sustained recently, they weren&#39;t from him. This meant several things: Vortigern had gotten injured by fighting someone else. As for the other...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern remained immobile as a rock, half of his body covered by the lake as blood kept oozing out. His skin was pallid and his arms looked frail, yet Octavius knew just how strong the beast was. The fact that they weren&#39;t reacting to his presence at all raised alarms in his head. Should he take the chance to strike now?

Before he could make a decision, the mad tyrant reawakened. Perhaps he was dreaming. Perhaps he thought this was a dream. But his movements were unmistakably sharp. He raised his head, peering ahead as he finally caught a whiff of Octavius and Dante in the distance.

&quot;Uoooooh....&quot; He murmured softly, a tone which almost reassured Octavius. He had never seen the beast act so docile before. It made him wonder if it could be reasoned with. Trained like an animal. Anything but be an enemy. For a moment, he felt tempted to open his mouth and speak.

His hopes were dashed, however, once he noticed the water. The lake started rippling, yet today was not a windy day. The air felt heavy and agitated. He could notice a nervous shaking in Vortigern&#39;s arms.

&quot;Uoh......&quot; The tyrant grunted, cracking his neck. Then he cracked it again. And again.

&quot;Uoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-&quot; He cracked it repeatedly, shaking his head like a turbine as it spun around in a frenzy. It was as if his eyes had awakened and put two and two together. He recognized Octavius as &#39;that man&#39; from earlier. He stood up, water dripping from his clothes as he revealed the lower half of his body.

Dante shivered as he saw the beast&#39;s condition: His legs were almost disheveled, having sustained intense injuries. A battle must have occurred, one fierce enough to reduce Vortigern to this state. It was a miracle he could even stand.</span>

&quot;-oooooooooooooooooooooooooh!&quot; Vortigern kept screaming, not making any moves as he let his head adjust itself and put it back into place with his own two hands. He now faced the two head on, no longer slouching nor sitting. His height struck fear into their hearts.

&quot;Youuuuuuuu....&quot; The mad king grumbled. &quot;Are you...Scots or Picts?&quot; He asked. A confusing question. One too logical for a beast, yet too vague to be from an intellectual. The two remained silent, and silence was enough of an answer to the Berserker.

&quot;...No matter. Invaders...&quot; He clenched his fists, shaking them with fury that Octavius had rarely seen in his life. He had witnessed countless armies, mighty generals and various assassins. But few of them held such rage. Such contempt. Such sorrow hatred.

<em><strong>&quot;...ALL OF YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em>

<em>SPLASH SPLASH SPLASH SPLASH SPLASH!</em>

Faster than lightning itself, Vortigern charged head on. Water splashed around them as they saw the tyrant run on all fours, resembling a wolf hunting its next victim. The ground cracked with each step, causing ripples in the waves as it rained down on Dante and Octavius, hindering their eyesight as Vortigern became hidden in the cloud of mist and water.

Saber was quick to form stratagems in his head. He instinctively started to protect Dante, knowing that his Master was the weak link. However, he wondered what Vortigern would do first: Would the king attempt to grab his swords or fight while unarmed?

<em>clang!</em>

It seemed it was the latter, since Octavius felt something heavy crash into Auram Pax. As the water rubbed off his eyes, he saw Vortigern snarling at him. The king&#39;s fists had collided with Auram Pax, sending ripples down his arms from the collision. Were they mad?! Fighting Octavius while barehanded?</span>

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> Vortigern screamed again, raising his other fist as he delivered an uppercut. Octavius parried that as well, but there was a lot more force behind that blow. He would be sent flying to the air, floating around thirty or so feet above the ground as Dante stared in shock and why wouldn&#39;t he? It took only one of Vortigern&#39;s punches to propel his Servant up there.

The tyrant followed suit, crouching for a second before jumping behind his target. He soared through the sky, colliding with Octavius and grappling at his sword.

&quot;This...sword. This...&quot; Vortigern repeated, staring at Auram Pax with beady eyes. Even Octavius felt disturbed by such an act. <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating Brain</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Emperor didn&#39;t expect the mad dog to cut the distance between them in such a short distance. His defense was down for just a moment when he was examining the berserker&#39;s healed and new wounds. Who healed him? What fought him afterward? And if it was recent, how could Vortigern not lose a drop of its combat ability? As well fr the moment it spoke and the moment the beast was upon the Caesar, it was much too fast for him to move or counter attack, he could only parry his blows. As well this foe seemed eager for the fight, not even taking up his weapons. Did it have some reason or was it filled with such bloodlust and blind madness that it simply wanted to engage as quickly as possible? Either way, Octavius couldn&#39;t get locked in a metaphorical corner like before, he had to deal as much damage to the beast before he took up his blades, which meant either to awaken his arms or focus his already damaged legs. When the grapple came from Vortigern, he could smell the rotting mass that was the mad dog and weirdly enough taking this moment for a reprieve from the earlier onslaught. As he looked at the berserker he could see him gazing at his sword with a disconcerting look, which made Octavius&#39;s face sour. He realized that Vortigern had recognized or is in the process of recognizing who this sword belongs to or potentially belongs to. That spelled trouble for the battle ahead. With that in mind, Octavius brought his legs inwards towards his chest before leaning forwards to flip them where he was above Vortigern and Vortigern&#39;s back was facing the ground. When the angle was just right, he bucked out his legs into Vortigern&#39;s lower stomach to kick the mad dog into the ground beneath them and disconnect the pair from their deadly dance of an embrace.</span>

Octavius&#39;s kick launched him as well, albeit with a more sideways angle as he slid and skipped and stopped himself in the lake that Vortigern had previously been wading in. Octavius&#39;s strategy was to take out one arm at least before going for his legs, as well as to play keep away with the berserker&#39;s swords. Speaking of... 

&quot;Dante!&quot; The Emperor called out to his master, guard Vortigern&#39;s weapons, make sure he can&#39;t get to them without some sort of effort. I can somewhat match him in speed, any slowing of his momentum is key to our victory!&quot; He stated before launching himself from the lake, sending a tidal wave of water behind him from the launch as he launched himself at Vortigern with a downward diagonal swing from Auram Pax aimed at Vortigern&#39;s right shoulder, intending on trying to cut as deep as possible into the right shoulder to hopefully catch an early advantage or bare minimum put them at more equal footing by trying to impair an arm.</span>

To think he’d had been here, simply bathing and lying in the water. Had he been not as large, he’d look normal. . . From the distance, Dante could almost see the calm before the storm, but that didn’t seem to last. The storm itself had seemed to find them immediately. The way the king had became animated once more after he noticed the duo was enough to make Dante stumble back in fear. In a brief flash of confusion, he saw the arm that had that had once been almost severed off before back on its holder, the idea of it somehow still being there made him question his previous theory. Had he been healed by someone? But who would have ventured out here to this tropics? And why would they have left their servant so far away without much to protect them?</em>

<em>The king’s question was an odd one, how he questioned their origin, both the words having little to no effect on Dante. A scot or a pict, he knew little of. He didn’t even know what type of things they were, a group of people? A class? Dante shook his head in a moment to try to disagree, but before he could even begin such a thin, the beast had already drawn its own conclusion. To him, they were invaders. Regardless of origin, regardless of background.</em>

<em>Its speed was almost unnoticed, had Octavius not gotten in front of him, and the king decided to strike at him first, surely Dante would have been but another investigator carcass on the tropic floor, but fortunately it didn’t happen. His fist clashing against the steel blade still made the Roman falter if not a little bit, and quickly Dante reached for his own way to help the saber, however the replay of what happened last time made him simply not go complete his first thought.</em></span>

<em>The doctor nodded and skittered towards the rock, covering his face as the heat that was being emit from such a weapon threatened to warm and burn anything too close to it. He needed to block those, but how in the world was he to defend against Vortigern had he switched his attention over towards him!?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern and Octavius were locked in the air. There were various moves that the tyrant had at his disposal. Even Octavius knew that, for he had experienced the beast&#39;s erratic movements himself. Headbutts, lunges, tosses and throws. There was nothing that his opponent <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do with that grotesque body.

However, they remained complacent, focusing solely on Octavius&#39; sword. Auram Pax glittered like gold, inspiring hope in the heart of the Romans. But Vortigern was no Roman. To him, that glint reminded him of something far more painful...

*&quot;I came!
I saw!
All that&#39;s left now is to conquer!
<strong>Crocea Mors!&quot;*</strong>

That blade was unmistakable. Its origins were clear. Not even Vortigern&#39;s rage could make him forget that blade.

&quot;Rome...Roma....ROM<em><strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em> Octavius felt like he had been buffeted by a blizzard. He quickly raised his legs and kicked Vortigern away, lest the beast drag him down to an abyss. The emperor landed near the lake as he gave Dante a few key orders before resuming the fight.

Judging by Vortigern&#39;s screams, the tyrant had clearly discerned Octavius&#39; origins. The fact that the beast was still howling like a dog in the night was not a good sign. Whatever relationship to Rome this person had, it certainly didn&#39;t seem like a pleasant one.

Vortigern spun his body around swiftly, causing him to land on the ground on all fours as he dug his fingernails to keep his balance. He crawled around like a creature of the night, one that myths and legends would warn you about. &quot;You...abandoned...&quot; He spat with contempt as he glared at Octavius&#39; blade.

<em><strong>&quot;YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU&quot;</strong></em> His howls echoed in Dante and Octavius&#39; ears. The emperor had enough as he launched himself towards his target. His sword was poised and ready to come down on Vortigern&#39;s arm. If the blow were to strike, it would easily result in the total dismemberment of the limb.</span>

<strong>clasp</strong>

To his shock, his blade stopped. It didn&#39;t collide with stone, nor steel. It was mere flesh, as the droplets of blood confirmed. He stared at his front and realized that Vortigern had intercepted the sword with his <strong>bare hands.</strong> A technique of sword fighting that had been developed far beyond his era, yet one so risky and suicidal that only a few actively practiced it.

And yet there it was: Auram Pax between Vortigern&#39;s gigantic palms. Of course, the impact was still there, resulting in harsh cuts appearing on the tyrant&#39;s hands. But he didn&#39;t care. The pain was nothing compared to his rage.

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; Vortigern screamed, using this chance to grab at Auram Pax and forcibly push it downward, carrying Octavius down with it. The emperor&#39;s knees buckled as they crashed into the wet, muddy terrain. He lost his balance and his grip, causing Auram Pax to fall for a split second.

A split second was all it took for Vortigern to hastily grab at the sword&#39;s hilt, flipping it over as he attempted to stab Octavius with his own sword!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It would be an understatement to say that this situation had gone south quickly. To think that Vortigern had a history with Rome, unsurprisingly a poor one. As well he caught his blade in his own hands and forced him to his knees. This fight had gone downhill immediately, but he couldn&#39;t simply roll over and let this mad dog kill him, he&#39;d dealt with many adversaries and those that had claimed Rome the greatest offense against man. Although he wasn&#39;t responsible for Vortigern&#39;s pain or madness, he would take responsibility, not like he had a choice in the matter regardless as the mad dog had made it clear to Octavius that he wanted him dead. It was very clear that the berserker claimed him as his father, Julius Caesar.

He was already moving as soon as Auram Pax was ripped from his hands, moving forward at first to take hold of his sword once again... Only to see his blade in the hands of the brute... And the blade heading towards his face. Due to the hastiness of the stab, however, Octavius had options. First Saber brought his right hand forward and lifted, slamming his palm upwards at the pommel of Auram Pax to change the trajectory rapidly to the point that the sword instead of sinking into Octavius&#39;s body, it instead scrapped against his shoulder and safely past him. With this maneuver, Octavius then stood up to further push Vortigern&#39;s arm past him while using his right hand to hold Vortigern&#39;s sword arm before bringing his left arm up and slamming his fist into Vortigern&#39;s side with punch after punch, throwing all of his strength into about five blows before sinking his fist in as far as possible to grab anything on Vortigern before turning and using his strength and as much of his position to pick up and launch Vortigern away from him. He didn&#39;t want the Berserker to be next to him for long for any amount of time. To win, especially now that he was agitated, he couldn&#39;t slug it out especially with how eager he was to maim and kill the emperor.</span>

<em>Somehow, he had managed to find the emperor’s place of origin, the fact that he hailed from Rome. . . Dante looked at the tyrant with disbelief. How had he been right? He his brain raced at the idea of it. Had he been allied with them? And what did he mean by abandon? It had seemed as if his discovery of Octavius’ descent had made his strikes more and more vicious, forcing the emperor to be send towards the lake with a sizable splash.  He held a grudge. . . One that was almost comparable to the evidence of the animals that lived within these tropics. And with his rage, he was able to grab hold of Octavius’ prized weapon, easily able to use it to his own will, forcing Dante’s saber to go unarmed for the moment. Okay, maybe now he couldn’t have sat there. . . Yes, he was to guard his enemies’ weapons because he would have been weaponless, but now he had exactly what he should have! The doctor looked around sporadically to find a solution.

He’d just have to move it, if he could move it, then maybe it’d be enough. He just a few yards. He could do it. He hoped. And so, he readied a ball of paper, he’d need just enough force from the chains to pull the swords out of it and send it. It’s be a pain, and definitely a drain from him, but it was that or death, and the latter had been looming since they decided to go to such a mission.</em>

<em>Dante took a steady breath, trying to fill his lungs before he launched the paper towards the battle, and in a bright array of lights, the chains had sprouted from them. Last time, they had been ineffective against vortigern, but he wouldn’t be aiming for him, in a brief attempt, the chains wrapped around Auram Pax’s hilt. The other end of the chains wrapped around the hilt of vortigern’s flaming weapon, the golden chains burning a lively orange before the tyrant would have went to send Auram Pax‘d blade down against his owner. Dante may not have been strong enough to pull the blade out of the stone, but he’d use the tyrant as leverage. He’d use what he could and  force Vortigern to pull his own blade.</em></span>

He’d have to be fast, the blade having enough velocity to be dangerous to slice a limb had it not been caught, but with how Vortigern had gone about his attention, focusing on Octavius , it’d be a little late, and even had he noticed, it’d be hard to catch, but best best was to dodge it! As for the emperor, it was something he could have seen since he’d be facing it. The blade would be coming soon, he’d need to catch it, something!

But that did not happen, for he was an emperor, one who could not be felled by such a crude attack. With his elegant maneuvers, he slammed his fist on the blade, changing its trajectory as he whizzed past it and felt the steel scrape slightly at his shoulder. He paid it no mind, for he leaned forward and gripped Vortigern&#39;s arm to restrain his movements. He then raised his other fist and pummeled the beast&#39;s stomach with blows.

His fifth punch had his entire weight behind it, causing several rib cracks as Vortigern would be sent flying...Unless?

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; In an act of rage, the tyrant refused to budge. His toenails dug into the ground, gripping with force that would rival bulls. Octavius could see his opponent&#39;s toes stuck in the mud, blood and bone matter dripping out as it took the entirety of their strength and balance to keep Vortigern attached to him. Despite all odds, he had succeeded in sticking around.

&quot;You...abandoned...&quot; Vortigern whispered as he now gripped Auram Pax with both hands, making sure to grip at one of Octavius&#39; palms while doing so. &quot;You...<strong>BETRAYED!</strong>&quot; The combined force of Vortigern&#39;s arms was swiftly overwhelming Octavius, who watched in terror as Auram Pax was forcibly descending upon him. Slowly and methodically.

<em><strong>&quot;BETRAYED BRITAIIIIIIIIIIIIIN&quot;</strong></em> Vortigern howled, letting Auram Pax fall as it plunged into Octavius&#39; chest. It wasn&#39;t a full stab, since his arm was still holding the blade up and resisting, but he could feel the blade start to dig through his armor and poke at his pectorals. <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating Brain</span></span>

All of this together meant that the force that the emperor used to try and throw Vortigern had amounted to nothing except cracking his right hand that grappled Vortigern&#39;s. He let out an exasperated breath as he was yanked back down in front of the mad king. As new ideas and plans raced through his head, none of it mattered when Vortigern bared his own blade down towards him. He struggled as hard as he could, using their already entangled grip as a means of halting Vortigern&#39;s advance, adding his other hand around the Auram Pax to slow its momentum. He could feel the blade slice through his gauntlets and into his left palm. He could slow the descent of his sword, but he couldn&#39;t stop it.</span>

The sword that was made from the metaphysical torch that his father passed down to him. The memories of Rome that coalesced into one blade that spelled out the prosperity of Rome. The evolution of Crocea Mors, Auram Pax, The Golden Peace, was slowly digging through his armor and agonizingly methodically sliding into his chest. When the sword penetrated his skin, he let out an agonizing, short yell He could feel every inch of his sword as it cut through the muscle of his right pectoral muscle. Octavius&#39;s grip wained as Vortigern was getting his way, was getting his revenge. As he was killing him... Was it Octavius&#39;s turn to pay for the mistake of his people? Would this be the atonement that Rome never truly received? Right here, the first Emperor of Rome, being felled by his own sword. A blade used to kill the Romans and enemies of Rome alike. The culmination of the Will of Rome itself? Would he pay his life as Penance? As the sword edged deeper and deeper into his body, Octavius couldn&#39;t find the answer, his mind was going blank, he couldn&#39;t think he couldn&#39;t...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That&#39;s when it happened. The flaming sword turned sawblade that Dante had hastily thrown at the pair in his gambit to save Octavius. He saw it clearly as it sliced right through Vortigern&#39;s right shoulder and Auram Pax was yanked back slightly from the counterweight. Vortigern&#39;s sword giving its original owner the same cauterizing burn wounds that he inflicted on other people before flying down and stabbing into the ground next to Octavius. The Caesar stared at the blade for a moment before looking past Vortigern, past the earlier debris, to the heavily breathing Dante. The doctor had saved him. He almost couldn&#39;t believe it. 

This distraction and damage gave the emperor all he needed to push back against the Berserker. With new vigor and the thoughts and feelings and doubts that he had burned away from Octavius&#39;s mind like Vortigern&#39;s smoldering shoulder, the Saber pushed back against the mad dog, taking Auram Pax out of Octavius&#39;s and subsequently launching Vortigern back against a tree. Octavius then stood with a new determined look on his face as he walked over and picked up Vortigern&#39;s sword out of the ground and pointed the sword at Vortigern.

&quot;Vortigern. I know not what betrayal that my countrymen did to you or your people, but you have turned my sword against me and she&#39;d my blood. That blade you have there has killed many people. Egyptians, the Goth, all manner of Mediterranean people, and even other Romans. It is the combined will of every single individual that claims Rome as its home and its identity. It stands for the Peace that I spread across Rome and abroad and my will to give every person a second chance at Peace and community. While wielding that sword I am the Caesar, a just emperor, a dutiful ruler, and a fair man. My sword is used to bring forth the prosperity of Rome and its people, not a weapon of revenge or anger.&quot;

He then backstepped before jumping forward again as Vortigern tries to block with Auram Pax, except Octavius wasn&#39;t aiming for another chest slash as he slams into Auram Pax with the flat of the flaming sword before sliding the blade down and cutting along the back of Vortigern&#39;s hand and forearm. After a spin, Octavius uses his new momentum to release on hand on the large sword to grab the hilt of Auram Pax and stab him in the stomach with his own flaming sword, the force obliterating the tree behind Vortigern. With another battle cry, Octavius shifted his weight and hold of the flaming sword to the pommel of the hilt to push the sword and Vortigern away, using him as leverage to yank Auram Pax from his hand and launch Vortigern deeper into the wooded area. After the maneuver Octavius retreats over to Dante before falling to one knee to take a breather, the blood from his chest wound seeping out of the cut in the armor and flowing down his chest, making his armor more.red than it was before. 

&quot;You did good Dante, thank you. I am grateful for the assistance. &quot; He said as he turned and gave a pat on the back to his master in between breaths before standing once again to face Vortigern. &quot;All right then, oh great representative of Britain, show me what constitutes fury amongst your people.&quot; The Emperor finished as he readied another defensive stance.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The raw killing intent could be felt in the air. Had things remained as they were, Octavius would have most likely perished by his own sword. It slowly pricked his body, like a needle accessing his most vulnerable point. It was a surefire victory, until Dante tossed the blazing sword back to Vortigern.

<em>stab</em>

It pierced his right arm, digging into his body as the scorching flames threatened to burn him.

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; The beast howled in pain, allowing Octavius to take advantage of this and extract the blade from his fleshy mantle. A display of elegant swordplay then followed suit, Vortigern being afflicted with more and more blows as Octavius sent him flying. The spirit of Rome would not fall. The spirit of Rome was <em>unbreakable.</em> No tyrants nor beasts would fell this kingdom today!

That is what Octavius wanted to convey with his sword.

&quot;Uoooooooooh!&quot; Vortigern screamed, attempting to counter with Auram Pax, but a true sword was only loyal to its owner. Just like how Auram Pax rejected to protect Vortigern, the flaming sword stopped Octavius from dealing lethal blows due to its unbalanced weight. They were perfect for each other.

Knowing this, the emperor embedded the flaming sword inside his opponent before sending them flying away with a swift motion, allowing him to pluck Auram Pax from the fiend&#39;s hands. Vortigern crashed through trees, his screams echoing across the tropical forest as a burning smell soon followed. The forest had caught fire, causing a visual spectacle of flames and smoke fanning the area.

Octavius took this as a moment of respite, congratulating Dante and readying himself for round two. He blocked the path to the second sword. The purple one. Vortigern would have to make due with the flaming sword that was currently embedded inside of him.</span>

That is, if he was even alive. His body was mangled and singed, third degree burns scalding his flesh as he could barely move his limbs. The sword kept burning at him as he felt feverish and pale. His sword was warm, but death&#39;s embrace was warmer. For once, he felt like closing his eyes.

As he blinked, he dreamed. A country at war. Scots, picts and saxons at each others&#39; throats. Kings scheming amongst each other. Rowena comforting him. His reliable soldiers betraying him. A treason of a thousand knives. Santiago. Santiago. Santiago. 

Why did he do this earlier as a king? Why didn&#39;t he perish after his first failure? Why did he insist in witnessing the nightmare of Britain, a war torn island where everyone wanted him dead?

The answer was so simple: It was for <em>her.</em> A single woman. Rowena.

Would she be happy if he died? What would she say if she saw him now? Probably mock him and deride his sorry state, before nursing his injuries. Was she even alive? He wished to see her, but dying gave him no answers. If there was even a chance that she was still alive in this world, then-

...

He couldn&#39;t leave. Not until he was absolutely sure that Rowena was no longer of this world.

Reluctantly, the tyrant rose. Not for power. Not for his nation. For something far deeper. He dragged the sword out of his body, like Excalibur from stone. It shone a bloody red, his blood boiling on its tip as it eventually vaporized.

By all means, he should be dead. His legs were giving out and he had a gaping hole in his body. His branch-like wings were also aflame, yet he emerged from the burning forest as if nothing were wrong in the world.

Octavius narrowed his eyes as he saw the grotesque figure walk towards him. There was no fear in Vortigern&#39;s eyes, only rage. A more refined rage, one that was neither animalistic nor beastly.

Simply human.</span>

Vortigern closed the distance in the span of seconds. He switched to all fours as he rushed Octavius with his sword dangling from his mouth like a dog.

&quot;My name is...<em><strong>VORTIGEEEEEEEEEEEEERN!</strong></em> UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;

With a triumphant roar, the king crashed straight into Octavius. The flaming sword clashed with Auram Pax as Vortigern gripped at Octavius&#39;s legs with his remaining limbs, hindering their movements as he dropped the sword from his mouth. The sword fell down to Octavius&#39; knees, allowing Vortigern to catch it with his free arm before he attempted to slash at Octavius&#39; legs with it. <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating Brain</span> <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius braced himself for Vortigern&#39;s charge. He studied the mangled mess of a berserker stumble out of the now flaming forest. The mad king&#39;s grumbling put a smile on the emperor&#39;s face. This was new energy from Vortigern, the look that he gave was intoxicating to the Roman. He hadn&#39;t felt this kind of thrill for the fight in so long, even when he was alive. This excitement that he was feeling, reminded him of his youth when he went by another name. The memory played for him like a vivid movie in his mind. It was as clear as the day it happened over two thousand years ago.

<em>&#39; My fellow Countrymen! Charge through them, this landing might not be ideal but we have to make our way through!&#39; Octavian called out to the soldiers under his command as they exited from the landing spot on the Mediterranean shore. The details were fuzzy for the emperor, he had been in many battles such as this in his time. This one unlike any others defined him as the warrior and leader that he would eventually become. Outnumbered by the forces of Marc Antony it was slim to none chance that he or his forces would fight their way back to the main force under his father, Julius Caesar. It was a fierce and blood slog through other well-trained Roman ranks, but he had made the impossible possible. When they reunited with the first Caesar, that was when his destiny changed forever. The large imposing figure of Rome&#39;s first Emperor paved the way for Octavius to excel and make Rome into the Empire that existed for a thousand years. 

&#39;You&#39;ve done well Octavian, once this is over, and we&#39;ve defeated the enemy, I want to personally meet you again.&#39;</em>

The mad king&#39;s image and the surrounding landscape shifted back and forth from the Mediterranean battlefield back to the burning tropical forest. When Vortigern charged at him with his own battle cry declaring his name to the Roman, the Emperor had to return in kind. 

&quot;While you have no kingdom to rule or people to protect, you fight on regardless. I commend that my worthy foe. I would be disappointed if you rolled over and died Vortigern. I&#39;ll fight you till my last breath mad king, I&#39;ll give you the battle you deserve with every respect that I can give as Emperor of Rome, <strong>Gaius Octavius Caesar</strong>!&quot; He then charged forward to meet Vortigern&#39;s charge head-on, launching from his place in front of Dante, cracking apart and destroying the ground beneath him as he kept to meet the Berserker head-on. The clash from their red blades sent shockwaves across the landscape of the tropical forest, creating a crater underneath the two servants. After a moment of struggle, Vortigern&#39;s newfound rage and resolve were greater than Octavius&#39;s excitement for the fight as he pinned the Saber down into the ground. 

When Vortigern went to slash at the emperor&#39;s legs, Octavius swung his blade down, slashing Auram Pax against Vortigern&#39;s flaming blade, while it did block the blow, Octavius couldn&#39;t block the entire strike as the flaming blade&#39;s edge still dug into his waist, burning through his armor. While grimacing from the pain, with his other hand, he swung his fist into Vortigern&#39;s face before grabbing hold. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t putting me down so easily with the same trick you bastard!&quot; He called out as he put his entire weight to his side and flipped Vortigern onto his back, slamming him into the ground with a buck from Octavius back to help push their pair, now pushing Auram Pax back and pushing Vortigern&#39;s flaming blade</span>

Octavius&#39;s armor was damaged from the onslaught, he now had a new wound in his leg that made his right leg feel weaker and his chest burned from the earlier stab from earlier. Regardless he had a smile on his face, not of sadistic pleasure or the fact that he turned the tables of battle again, but of the pure excitement of the fight itself.</span>

<em>For a walking corpse, the beast’s speed was still unrivaled, his blade in his mouth, he aimed to at least maim the emperor.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern watched as his blade started to gradually burn through Octavius&#39; armor. Of course, it wasn&#39;t a one-sided battle: For every strike Vortigern performed, the Roman replied in kind, punching at the king&#39;s face before slamming them down to the ground. A clash of swords occurred as Octavius held his footing, pushing Auram Pax on Vortigern&#39;s blade and gradually pushing it downward.

&quot;Uooooooh!&quot; Vortigern screamed, trying to push back, only to feel chains drag him down. He had forgotten that Octavius wasn&#39;t alone, for Dante was still around him. His holy chains tugged at the tyrant&#39;s wings, forcing him down as Octavius continued his vicious assault. The flaming blade dug deeper into Vortigern&#39;s chest, until-

<em><strong>&quot;ROMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;</strong></em> Vortigern screamed, tussling and scuttling as he rolled around like a mad dog, contorting his body into hideous shapes as Octavius felt like his opponent had broken all of his bones in his frenzy. His gesture was mad, yet genius: By breaking his own bones, Vortigern&#39;s misshapen limbs were able to slink past the chains, almost like a cat.

Dante watched as his chains were not broken, but merely phased through as Vortigern then stuck his bones back into place, raising his sword upward and dragging Auram Pax alongside it. The two blades were now at a standstill as Vortigern released one of his arms and grabbed Octavius by the neck. He choked him hard, before delivering a last sprint with his injured legs as he bounced off the ground and soared into the sky, dragging Octavius along.

The change in scenery resulted the two dropping their weapons, Auram Pax and the flaming blade plummeting to the ground as they stabbed the floor and remained embedded. Meanwhile, Vortigern and Octavius continued their wicked dance in the air, with Vortigern having the upper hand due to his monstrous physiology.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius was about to press his original attack thanks to Dante&#39;s chains binding the monster, but of course, Vortigern still had his tricks. His damn ability to contort and morph his bones and body at will was annoying to overcome, it seemed like no matter how you sliced it, the only way to fight Vortigern was a head-on assault, which was the double-edged sword since Vortigern was undeterred by everything you threw at him. Although seeing how much effort he had to use getting out of the restraints, instead of simply breaking them apart, made the emperor&#39;s mind kick into a higher gear. Dante might be the key to putting Vortigern down. Before he could think further about this, the mad king was screaming again and locked their blades together, this would have been an easy push for Vortigern, but now the tide was turning... That is what Octavius was thinking before the Berserker contorted one of his arms to grab the Saber by his neck. Instinctively, Octavius moved one hand to Vortigern&#39;s choking hand, but he should have been worried elsewhere as Vortigern launched them both into the air, their loose grips on their weapons sending both into the ground below. As suddenly as they rose, Vortigern was sending them back to the earth in dramatic fashion. No amount of leverage could help Octavius as he tried his best to break Vortigern&#39;s hand with punches from his now free hand. After the third blow, Octavius accepted the crash and braced himself for the collision. The pair slammed into the ground with enough force to shatter the earth, sending shockwaves in every direction. The crater they made dwarfed the previous clashes by a large margin with a thick cloud of dust kicked up from the concussive force of the landing.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius was dazed and broken. His armor was broken and shattered, especially the back of his armor. His chest plate was covered in cracks and he had blood at every point of his body. His actual injuries were similar in scope. He could feel that he had broken a few of his ribs and possibly fractured a few bones, he had pain at every point of his body and his left eye had closed as blood covered that part of his face. He didn&#39;t take any permanent damage however as his armor took the majority of the damage, with the main damage being concussive and blunt. Still reeling from the fall, Octavius knew he had to get up. After all of the words he spoke earlier, he couldn&#39;t lie down and die here. His body began to emit fire once again as he brought one of his legs up and kicked Vortigern square in his chest, launching him away from the Caesar as the Roman slowly stood up, taking deep breaths as his throat was no longer in a death grip. He then jumped out of the crater, making his way back to his sword and ripping it out of the ground. This battle needed to end soon, he didn&#39;t know how much more damage he could take. He could see Vortigern once again after the dust settled as he took a stance and held his blade in front of him. 

&quot;This ends now Vortigern!&quot; Octavius said with labored breath as Dante could feel the artificial circuits in his eyes itch as he could feel Octavius take mana from him. Mana began to radiate out of Octavius like heat from a flame, the red from his sword and the remainder of his armor glowing bright and his hair flowing like a burning bonfire. <strong>&quot;Wars, both civil and foreign, I undertook throughout the world, on sea and land, and when victorious I spared all who surrendered before me. Yet, you still stand against me? Well then, you deserve no quarter Mad King of Britain!&quot;</strong> Octavius was building up energy for his Noble Phantasm!</span>

Even with how relentless Octavius had tried to keep his opponent at bay, Vortigern defied whatever laws he could to bring himself back up to fight. The doctor’s legs begged to move forward, to attempt to find himself any sort of strength to move towards the fight to prevent what he could, even as the beasts body broke itself to get out of the spells the doctor had tried keep him in. The longer he stood, the more he could see how bloody this fight would become. He could see how the strain was coming about with Octavius’ battle. The cracked and crushed armor he held, the colors bruises that shown themselves, the blood spilled from his wounds. Any longer and he’d collapse. This fight had to be brought to a close soon, little time could be spared between them.</em>

<em>The chains that tried to restrain the beast fell to the ground with a rattle, the sound of metal clanging against them before they dissipated in their golden array of lights. Vortigern had easily freed himself, and had taken no chances to launch the two upward, how quickly he had managed to bring the battle into the air was a spectacle in its own, the tyrant’s grip against his saber only symbolizing that he’d be the first to plummet toward the earth. Dante’s heart dropped from such a sight, the fall could have been lethal. It may have been, but the sight of a silhouette that had been shorter than the beast had only eased the nerves he had. He had managed to survive. . . Relief flooded his body, but only for that, even if Gaius had managed to live through that, it didn’t mean they’d have won, especially since the beast had still be there ready to continue. His saber trying his best to create distance in between them.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Dante’s attention went strictly to Vortigern, trying to see what he could do without having to go in there recklessly, but everything he could think of seemed like a failure. He couldn’t hold off his wings, he’d just break himself as if a toy. There wasn’t much options he could give himself. Nothing seemed to work, nothing seemed to go ideally. How was he to even put down a foe who simply had eluded death whenever he could? He simply couldn’t. Not unless Octavius had done something that could have felled him entirely. Dante looked around for a solution, but behind him was simply a burning forest, the flames feasting on the trees that they could reach, smoke turning the sky black and it’s cloud blackened the sun. There was nothing much he could do.</em>

<em>Then, in a crude moment, his eye twitched. The slight moment of it only making Dante’s eyes look towards Octavius. He was slowly overworking himself. He had mana, but even through what he was doing, he could feel himself overworking the circuits in his eyes. However, the cowardly doctor hadn’t given up. He knew what would be on the other side of this, the idea that Octavius had been taking mana from him for good reason, and while he didn’t know for what for specifically, he knew it’d be something that would be able to at least attempt to stop the tyrant named Vortigern. And so, Dante, steeled himself too. He’d have to try an attempt once again as well. He simply needed to allow Saber to go about it. The doctor fumbled in his pockets, finding the final current scripture he had before his good hand balled it up tightly, compacting it’s gospel into the ball he needed and dropped it, allowing the chains to sputter out from it like a geyser. Even from such a move, the world slowly blurred itself from Dante. A sharp pain felt as if it scorched through his nerves, and for a moment, he thought he were crying, a thin line of blood seeping from his ducts.</em></span>

The other, which had only shown the bodies of the other two combatants had began to blur madly slowly was trying to transition along its partner, however, with what little he could use, he found himself trying his hardest to keep his vision in it. The chains that had spurred out were methodical, and if not methodical then entirely outnumbering. For moments he’d been using what he could to conserve mana, but that didn’t seem to be the case here. The golden restraints were swift in their points of attack, one attempting to wrap around the Tyrant’s neck as if a leash and the others around his waist and limbs. The other ends to them hand found themselves digging into the earth under them and onto the base of the stumps of trees the duo had destroyed.</em>

<em>This time, the grip soon became Vice like, the chains around the tyrants neck had they gotten to him would have dug into flesh, threatening to crush whatever windpipe the beast had. The others pulled his arms backward, forcibly trying to contort his body while the last at his legs pulled back as well, as if trying to bring him towards the other end of the chains. Dante could feel his breaths become labored, the one moderate eye having specks of grey in it dance about aimlessly. He just needed to restrain him. Even if it meant blindness, he’d attempt to go about it. He couldn’t truly see where the chant had come from, but it sounded familiar, the commandeering voice that had scolded him on being cowardly. On not putting effort. On taking the easy way out, he knew it had to be Octavius. And to his declare against Vortigern, Dante muttered a slight prayer under his breath, the urgent need to have this king be once again return to the throne if he could.</em></span>

Octavius felt the brunt of Vortigern&#39;s impact, the tyrant&#39;s feet lording over his chest as his armor broke and his spine felt cracked. The mad king towered above him, until Octavius regained his bearings and kicked his opponent aside. Vortigern, who had his bones broken, a hole in his chest and injured legs, seemed to be running on fumes alone. The kick should have sealed the deal, but he refused to fall down. He landed right next to his flaming sword, then watched as his opponent started to charge up huge amounts of energy. Auram Pax was glowing as bright as the morning sun.

But Octavius was a fool if he thought Vortigern would stand still and take it.

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; The mad king screamed, extracting his own sword and chasing after the emperor. His flaming sword was raised as he prepared to decapitate the Roman before they could charge their Noble Phantasm.

<em>rattle rattle rattle rattle</em>

It was then that chains started to tug at Vortigern&#39;s body. His legs, his arms, his neck. He felt like a fly trapped in a spider web, not knowing that the chains had been boosted by Dante expertly tying them together to leftover tree stumps. By reinforcing their foundation, he had made a net that was sturdy enough to last at least a few seconds against the Berserker.

A few seconds were all that Octavius needed to charge up his Noble Phantasm. Even Vortigern could understand that. The tyrant desperately flailed around, trying to free himself from the chains. But he couldn&#39;t, for his body was already past its limit. The amount of injuries that he had endured was finally taking its toll. The situation seemed hopeless for him.

Until he finally realized one thing: He had landed at the perfect spot. Right to his side, was the rock where he had embedded his blades. The purple blade was peacefully resting.</span>

&quot;Uoooooh....&quot; Vortigern said in a trance, extending his arm past the chains as he extracted the purple sword.

The Emperor was too slow with the rate at which he was charging his Noble Phantasm. Even with taking mana from Dante, it wasn&#39;t going to cut it, that damn Mad King was already on him again even despite everything that had come before. He was going to lose. That was until he saw the chains from Dante arrive in force to wrap around Vortigern, every limb had been held tight like a fly in a spider&#39;s web, the number of chains that had been woven together held the unstoppable tyrant at bay.

<em>That many chains.</em> With that thought, the Emperor turned his head to look to Dante in worry and concern as he stared at his master and his bleeding eyes. He gasped out a word, yet choked it back down. <em>No, he is fighting this battle as hard as I am, I won&#39;t belittle his efforts now. Thank you, Dante.</em> Soon enough his look of concern turned into resigned pride as he nodded to his master and turned back to Vortigern. Octavius&#39;s mana was exploding out now, the blood on his body burning off and turning into an immense aura that surrounded him like a mist trail that exemplified his building energy. 


<strong>&quot;We write our names in the sand. Then the waves roll in and wash them away.&quot;</strong> He began to chant as Auram Pax glowed brighter.

Vortigern was reaching for his purple blades to corrupt the scriptures. This was it, death or victory depended on this moment!

<strong>&quot;The tales of our exploits will survive as long as the human voice itself!&quot;</strong>

His body was moments from breaking, but he couldn&#39;t falter. The Caesar&#39;s knees buckled and threatened to collapse, but he stood tall.

&quot;Vortigern. I pity you. I know not what transpired to make you into this monster, but I can&#39;t let it stand. I, <strong>Gaius Octavius Caesar</strong> will send you back to sleep. I suppose that&#39;s what you&#39;d want, to die on your feet rather than roll over like a dog. I respect you, King of Britain, but this is where we part ways. I&#39;ll bring peace to this wretched place, if for nothing else than to honor your memory.&quot;

Vortigern had reached his blades now, there was no more time for talk anymore. It was time to finish this.

Auram Pax glowed with a bright red and orange light as it expanded into the sky of the decimated tropical forest, the beam of light could be visible for miles from the point of origin as Octavius now had a new grin on his face despite his injuries. Once activated, he felt his adrenaline spike rapidly as he brought both of his hands on Auram Pax&#39;s hilt as he finished the chant.

<strong>&quot;I came! I saw! Therefore the only thing for me to do is declare Peace through Victory! AURAM PAAAAAAAAAAAAX!&quot;</strong>

As Octavius called out the true name of his Noble Phantasm, Octavius brought the blade down in a slight dramatic flourish, slamming the immense beam down upon the mad king.</span>

There was no hope of stopping Octavius&#39; blast. Even if Vortigern had managed to extract the purple blade, which he did, there was a limit to the amount of Magecraft he could deflect. Auram Pax most definitely went past that limit.

But he wouldn&#39;t perish. Not without a fight. And as Auram Pax&#39;s gigantic blade descended upon him, he raised both of his blades to fight back. The purple one to parry. The flaming one to counter.

The light fully enveloped him.

<em>&quot;God...Protect me from this Holy Sword!&quot;</em>

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

By the time the dust had settled, Vortigern was long gone. Dante and Octavius got a fright, seeing the tyrant&#39;s legs slowly emerge from the cloud of smoke, still standing tall.

...And only his legs, mind you. The rest of his body had vanished, being launched back to the burning forest as they finally took notice of Vortigern&#39;s corpse in the distance. Even in death he was like a phantom. His legs refused to fall and his hands were still clenching at his swords. He was nothing but determined.

<em><strong>And then his body moved.</strong></em></span>

&quot;Uooooooh....&quot; It started off as a quiet whisper. Then, the rattling of blades followed suit, before Octavius shuddered as he saw Vortigern regrow his legs. His flesh. His injuries. All of them gone. The king had been reborn, his old skin being discarded as he felt like a chick hatched out from an egg.

The reborn Vortigern stared at Octavius and Dante from afar. He tilted his head, casting a curious glance to the two before noticing the swords in his hand. He stared at them in awe, as if he had witnessed them for the first time.

He looked like the same Vortigern, but his mannerisms were different. He felt too...<em>human.</em>

&quot;Well fought.&quot; Vortigern said with a subtle nod. In perfect English, with no lisps, stutters or groans. Dante went cold from shock, having never heard the beast speak so calmly before.

Octavius went cold as well, not because of the words, but because Vortigern had just closed the distance between the two in a flash. He couldn&#39;t even perceive his movements, all he knew was that the tyrant was now standing behind him. A Vortigern that had regained both his body and sanity.

Three slashes occurred, followed by three stabs. Blood oozed out of Octavius&#39; stomach as it poured out on the grass, wetting it with his mana. He felt tempted to fight back, but his injuries were so severe that he could barely hold Auram Pax anymore. He did notice one thing, however.

None of the slashes were lethal. The stabs felt like gruesome acupuncture at most. If it took talent to strike an enemy&#39;s vital spots, then it took double the talent to avoid the enemy&#39;s vitals. Vortigern had spared him on purpose. But one thing was clear.

<em>The king&#39;s swordplay far surpassed his own.</em>

&quot;The only reason you remain alive...&quot; Vortigern muttered, sounding like a different person. &quot;Is your code of honor. One worthy of a champion.&quot; He said, turning around and acknowledging the Roman with a glance.

He then disappeared, running off in the distance. It was like a mirage. It took a few seconds for Dante to compute it, but he eventually realized that he and Octavius had narrowly avoided death. <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Deteriorating Brain</span></span>

He let out a sigh of relief when he saw the legs of Vortigern, albeit they were still standing which unsettled the Emperor, but at least the mad king had been destro-

That&#39;s when Octavius saw the Berserker regenerate. His entire body all at once, although he looked different. The words he spoke were normal as well. Was this a hallucination from the amount of stress and pain in his body? Either way, if the king had stood up once again, albeit, in this new form, he had to fight once more, he couldn&#39;t take the risk to see if this was a trick or not from the mad Berserker. Octavius took a step towards Vortigern, but a step was too slow. In the instant that he took the step and brought his sword back up to meet Vortigern, he heard his voice behind him. 

&quot;I-&quot; Octavius&#39;s words were choked out as all at once the attacks landed on his person, the slashes and stabs piercing his body. At first, he thought he was dead, but his brain was still functioning enough that he realized that he missed his vital organs on purpose. &quot;So... This is the actual king of Britain huh... I think we can call this... A draw...&quot; The Caesar said as he fell forward into the cracked dirt in front of him, Auram Pax dematerializing into light next to him as the First Citizen of Rome fell unconscious from his wounds, laying down in a bloody mess. 

Octavius had never called himself lucky, not once in his life. The only luck he was afforded in his tenure as Emperor was the fact that no coup was made against him or no assassin tried their own luck. 

At this moment,t however. Octavius was glad that he was lucky that his opponent was crazy.</span>

&quot;Have I played the part well?&quot; He asked his heir.

&quot;Yes, but you still have more acts to play. Your story is not over Father.&quot; His son said with a solemn pat on his hand. &quot;You have to rise. You have to get up. You have to-&quot;</em>

<strong>GET UP</strong>

Saber jolted awake from his unconsciousness as he could see Dante stumbling towards him, his eyes leaking blood. He truly had overworked his circuits. At that moment as well, Octavius felt the heat from the flames that engulfed the forest around them. <em>&#39;This was no place to die. Not yet.&#39;</em> With that thought, the Emperor struggled to his feet, blood from his previous wounds seeped from his body, but it didn&#39;t matter. He had to get Dante away from here. When he stood to his feet, he stumbled over to Dante, using the remainder of his mana that wouldn&#39;t kill him to heal his most drastic wounds. Blood loss wouldn&#39;t be what would put the Caesar down this day, nor some fire. 

&quot;Dante, I&#39;m here! I&#39;m alive, we have to get out of here.&quot; He said as he caught up to and caught the doctor, putting his hand on his shoulder for stability as he looked around for a path. Almost immediately he saw a path along the water which he practically pulled Dante along immediately towards. &quot;I&#39;ve found a path, let&#39;s go and don&#39;t let go of me!&quot; He ordered with the utmost of stern tones as he limped along with Dante in tow.</span>

Octavius simply pulled Dante along in the direction away from the flames and the carnage from their previous battle.

&quot;Yes, we won Dante. I defeated Vortigern thanks to you. You were a great help in the battle, without you we would have lost.&quot; He told Dante as they walked on through the tropics

. . .

A few hours passed as the pair made their way through the forest, passing unnoticed through the brush as they continued to walk without seeing a soul in sight. As they passed by one particularly strange area. It was a large complex that seemed relatively new for what they had seen previously and it was covered by vines and other plant life, however, from further observation, there seemed to be people roaming the inside of the complex. Octavius mentally kept a tab of this location for a later survey as this place seemed important enough for a later sightseeing adventure, but not now, at least in their current condition. The pair then left in a new direction as they became more lost in the tropical forest.
