Verga panted. He was never great at sports, for he saw no joy in training his body. If anything, he was completely impartial to his appearance, focusing more on the beauty in the mind.

He was a safe distance away from the store, albeit he was worried more about the condition of it following a full on scuffle by Alex. The last time he came back from one of these &#39;incidents&#39;, it took a full week to clean up.

&quot;I suppose I might as well pass the time by-&quot; He searched his pockets for anything to busy him with, and found...

<em>wrap rustle rustle</em>

A neatly folded newspaper that once opened, reminded him of the atrocity that was today&#39;s issue of the Nirvana times. The headliner was an eyesore.

&quot;Grrrr.&quot; He gripped the paper with force, squeezing it as he groaned in annoyance. 

&quot;...I suppose I&#39;ll have to make do with rereading my article. It takes me an average of 25 seconds to skim it, 48 if I read it, a minute and a half if I do so out loud.&quot; He pondered while scratching his beard. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

A plump blue shadow zipped by the feeble critic, missing his immaculately trimmed mustache by mere inches as it hurtled towards the <span class="mention">#merch-store</span>, leaving a leafy, grassy storm in its wake. It chirped in excitement as it saw the news rack on display, then made a steep dive for the topmost stack that read <em>The Nirvana Times</em>-

<em>s m a c k</em>

-only to slam itself into the glass door, leaving a circular mark of light dust as it bounced off the surface and disappeared in the curbside grass.

<strong>&#39;Chirp! Shut the door, won&#39;t you! Open the door! Right away!&#39;</strong>

A pale blue dot emerged from the grass, blazing with indignation as it took to the air. 

It was a parakeet!

<strong>&#39;Open the door! Open the door!&#39;</strong> The bird continued to attack the door, but no amount of pecking or slamming left so much as a dent in the glass. After a few tries, it gave up and started circling the front of the store...

Verga&#39;s mustache would quiver in fright as it sensed impending doom. He felt a rush of wind, then the bird was upon him, tugging on his mustache with its beak and dragging him towards the store!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It took until the fourth reread of his article that even Verga had enough. He wasn&#39;t enough of a narcissist to keep staring at his own work forever, tempted to toss the paper aside and move on with life, until he felt a strong tug at his fabled stache.

&quot;Hnnng!&quot; He stood still with great force, asserting his firmness as he felt something try to pull him back. Back to the store. He wondered what it was, and then stared at his nose...

A bird. Normally, an innocuous animal. But after living in Nirvana for years, he already knew that appearances were quick to deceive.

&quot;Silence!&quot; He shouted vicariously, his mustache gaining sentience as it slapped the bird silly, sending it flying a safe distance away. Thankfully, not far enough for Verga to lose sight of it.

&quot;This is barely amusing, Mr. Koji. Why not show yourself instead of sending such pesky messengers?&quot; Verga asked, adjusting his glasses. He wanted to assume Koji was there, but who was he kidding? This wasn&#39;t the first time he had seen the good doctor send his birds for faraway errands, since the man themselves couldn&#39;t be bothered to leave their home.

Or to be more accurate, they <strong>couldn&#39;t</strong> leave their home. Not without great effort at least. It all started with that odd hobby of theirs-

&quot;Oh!&quot; A figurative lightbulb manifested itself in Verga&#39;s head. &quot;Tell me, little birdie. What has your master been up to? Is the recent string of news true?&quot; He asked, much to the bird&#39;s confusion, as the writer shoved an issue of the Nirvana Times™️ into their face.

The headline could be seen. Something about Koji and Scylla being...a couple.

Even the bird could sense the raw dishonesty emanating from that paper.

&quot;Well? I&#39;m all ears, my plump, little friend.&quot; Verga chuckled, albeit he wondered if he was starting to go insane for chatting up a bird. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Verga&#39;s mustache was a menace! The poor bird was sent flying...wait, it was already flying in the first place! With a great flapping of wings it stabilized itself, then dived upon the writer with double the speed.

<strong>&#39;Danger! Stranger danger! Open the door! Or else!&#39;</strong> 

The bird fought like a knight in shiny blue armor as it parried the mustache&#39;s blows bravely. Verga could feel the end of his mustache becoming more frazzled as time went on. The hairs were beginning to lose their luster. 

No! His identity as a literary Servant!

Fortunately, the mind of Giovanni Verga was sophisticated and sinister. In an instant, he managed to devise a scheme into which he hoped to drag the fierce parakeet. Instead of indulging the bird in more violence, he decided to wield his greatest weapon and manipulate the bird with wordplay!

It worked.

<strong>&#39;Master Koji! Newspaper for Master Koji!&#39;</strong> The bird went ballistic at the mention of its owner. It continued to chirp, its beady little eyes resting upon the stack of papers Verga had so graciously shoved in its face...

<strong>&#39;Newpaper!&#39;</strong> It shrilled with delight. In that moment, all its grievances towards the writer were forgotten. It stopped yanking Verga&#39;s mustache, then folded its wings as it rested on his hand and started pecking at the newspaper.

<strong>&#39;The Nirvana Times!&#39;</strong> It recognized the title. <strong>&#39;Date! February fourth!&#39;</strong> Oh good, even the date! <strong>&#39;Headline! Breaking news! Mr! Naoharu! Koji! Engaged!&#39;</strong>

<strong>&#39;...chirp?&#39;</strong>

The bird turned to stare at Verga, its head slightly tilted as it gave a quieter, confused wail. 

<strong>&#39;Engaged. True? Breaking. True! Pink fool! Through the windows! SMASH!&#39;</strong>

The bird produced a series of sounds that mimicked glass shattering.

<strong>&#39;Pink fool! Broke! Shattered! Newspaper shredded! Nest warm!&#39;</strong> It danced happily on Verga&#39;s hand.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Verga had to give Koji credit when it was due. His birds were surprisingly easy to understand, thanks to their mimicry of common sounde and expressions. No wonder the doctor kept so many around: They were better conversational partners than anybody else at the writers&#39; guild!

&quot;A crash? Like glass? Pink? Oh, don&#39;t tell me.&quot; Verga chuckled, displaying a wide grin as he pictured the head image of William being flung through a glass window.

&quot;That&#39;s what happened, correct? Good. I would even go as far to say that it was entirely deserved.&quot; He stated. No wonder William had decided to slander Koji yet again. Something must have happened at the <span class="mention">#mountain-lodge</span>. Enough to get William punted and cause him to write a vindictive piece.

But Verga wasn&#39;t satisfied. He wanted to know more. As he stared at the bird happily dancing on his hand, more inquisitive thoughts crossed his mind.

&quot;You want the paper? Go ahead, it&#39;s all yours,&quot; He said, gradually bringing the paper closer to the bird, before abruptly retracting it.

&quot;so long as you answer one more question: Who is this lady involved with Mr. Koji? Your boss isn&#39;t the type to keep close friends, is he?&quot; He adjusted his glasses. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Indeed, as Verga extended the newspaper towards it, the bird&#39;s attention was snatched as it traced the paper with expectant eyes. It flexed its wings, opening them up and stretching them as far as they can, then reached out for the paper with its talons...

Snatch! And miss!

<strong>&#39;Liar! You are a terrible liar!&#39;</strong> Blue feathers stood out from the bird&#39;s body, like an angry cat with puffed up fur. How dare this shriveled old man lie about the reward! It started chasing after the newspaper, but Verga was already one step ahead, swinging the newspaper this way and that and keeping it barely out of its reach.

Infuriating!

<strong>&#39;GIMME!!!&#39;</strong> Giving up the futile chase, the bird decided to switch tactics and go after Verga himself instead. It started a series of relentless assault and pecked the old man on the ears, face, anywhere it could get to with its tiny but sharp beak. Ow!

<strong>&#39;No newspaper, no answer!&#39;</strong> So persistent, so stubborn! Who did it take after?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At first he thought that he and the plump bird had come to a mutual understanding. From the shared disdain towards William to the interest in Naoharu Koji&#39;s life. Of course, the difference between the two was that Verga owned a copy of the newspaper in his hands, while the bird didn&#39;t.

That was enough to tick off a rather short tempered budgie. Not only did its chirps now start to sound like war cries, but it started to peck at Verga with triple the intensity than it did previously.

&quot;Ow! Ow ow ouch! Stop it!&quot; Verga screamed like a disgruntled grandparent, covering his nose and mouth as the bird kept poking ferociously. He was a Servant, so it was unlikely for him to be injured by this flurry of blows, but that didn&#39;t mean that the pain wasn&#39;t real!

&quot;Agh!&quot; He exclaimed in fright as the bird started pecking at his sunglasses as well, threatening his fine eyesight. That was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back as Verga covertly sneaked the newspaper behind him, gradually rolling it up with both of his hands as it gained tougher properties, until-

<em>THWACK</em>

A newspaper roll to the face, swatting the bird to the ground like a fly. The budgie felt the after effects of the concussion, but thankfully its wings were in a good enough stat-

<em>CRUSH</em>

Until it felt the full weight of Verga&#39;s foot down on it. Its wing bones were crushed into a pulpy sludge, but Verga had softened the blow, as if aiming to purposefully keep it alive.

&quot;Tch. Look what you made me do.&quot; Verga sighed, wiping feathers off the newspaper. &quot;What? You <em>can</em> pick yourself up, can&#39;t you? Unlike these old bones of mine, you have the blessing of continuously braving death. Don&#39;t go wasting such a gift now.&quot;

He said while sliding his foot further down, stepping on the bird&#39;s delicate tail.

&quot;Hmph. No joy in witnessing the suffering of a beast over man.&quot; He stated, dropping the newspaper in disinterest in front of the bird. He was handing it over.

&quot;I was hoping you would give me any new ideas, but</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Do not underestimate the might of a newspaper bird! The bird advanced as Verga retreated. It was dominating the fight! What a miracle to have a Servant cowering under the relentless pecking of a plump, fearless budgie!

<strong>&#39;Newspaper now!&#39;</strong> It chirped happily, emboldened by Verga&#39;s submissiveness. It was now using its wings to smack him in the cheeks too! Verga could only wish he hadn&#39;t teased the bird so-

<em>SMACK</em>

And the tide of battle was suddenly turned. Verga finally bared his fangs and displayed the quality of man that helped it dominate every other species in the history of mankind.

The making of tools.

Who&#39;d have thought that a few pages of newspaper, when rolled up tightly, could turn into such a dangerous weapon of mass destruction? Certainly not a talking budgie who had been trained and engineered to focus single-mindedly on the purchasing and retrieval of newspapers!

The bird dropped to the ground.

<strong>’New-&#39;</strong> It could barely make another sound before Verga graced it with the bottom of his shoe. And what an expensive pair of shoes it was, with soles as hard as steel and easily crushing the bird into a pulpy sandwich spread. Verga had gotten his revenge. He continued to torment the bird to his heart&#39;s content...which lasted all but a few seconds.

It seemed that the suffering of mere <em>birds</em> wasn&#39;t nearly enough to sate Verga&#39;s appetite. He dropped the newspaper in front of the meaty stain on the road...

<strong>&#39;Newspaper!&#39;</strong>

The stain <em>spoke</em>. A beak protruded from the ground, before the rest of the pulpy flesh started putting itself back together. Broken bones stacked on top of one another like pieces in a puzzle, strings of muscles and sinew sewing themselves back onto the bones before being covered by the plumage. The few pieces of feathers Verga was twirling between his fingers broke free as well and reinserted themselves onto the bird&#39;s feathers.

It went over to the newspaper roll and snuggled the freshly printed papers with such affection that made Verga feel like a third wheeler.

<strong>&#39;Purrrrr.&#39;</strong> The bird let out an uncharacteristically feline sound that it must have picked up elsewhere. It then tilted its head and looked up to Verga as if processing his words for the first time.

<strong>&#39;Lady friend?&#39;</strong> It seemed to be thinking, its head tilted to an impossible degree. <strong>&#39;Lady. True!&#39;</strong>

Verga would be relieved to know that he wasn&#39;t so insane for communicating with a bird after all. It seemed to have registered his words. The answer was on the tip of its tongue as it opened its beak one more time...

<strong>&#39;Ruth Naomi!!!&#39;</strong> It let out a high-pitched shrill that was enough to pierce Verga&#39;s eardrums. <strong>&#39;Zap zap, bad! Wine and dine, yummy!&#39;</strong>

...Not quite the lady friend that Verga had asked for. But an unexpected bonus?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When it came to persistence, humans were often far superior than animals. While mere beasts were content with simply living and surviving, humanity&#39;s desire to constantly progress and innovate was what led them to evolve from the creation of the wheel to the conquest of the stars.

But that was all a load of rubbish, for the bird Verga was facing was about as tenacious as any human being. Instead of collapsing into a fine pulp, it reassembled itself, courtesy of its master&#39;s peculiar Magecraft. Verga glanced away in disgust, annoyed at the creature&#39;s resilience. Suffering brought him joy, but only when done in a <em>humane</em> manner. There was nothing human about seeing a creature put itself back together with no effort.

He watched as the bird ignored the writer and instead focused on its primary target: The newspaper. Cuddling with it like a longing lover, one could sense the aura of pride that exuded from the little budgie.

It hadn&#39;t forgotten its manners though, since it tilted its head and proceeded to give Verga an answer. Not the one he was expecting.

&quot;Lady Ruth?&quot; Verga raised an eyebrow, twirling his mustache as he analyzed the bird&#39;s words carefully. 

&quot;Wine and dine. Oh, I see. No wonder she is trying to sink her claws into doctor Koji as well. I swear...&quot; He grinded his teeth for a bit. Was that jealousy, perhaps? Or maybe he felt envious at the fact that he was unable to witness the interaction between the two.

&quot;Not that lady, little bird.&quot; Verga exclaimed in a sigh, before stomping the newspaper right in front of the budgie&#39;s eyes. Was he doing it out of spite?!

Well, he most likely was. But the kick also served a different purpose.</span>

A description of her being similar to a mermaid. To the point she had &#39;fins&#39; and &#39;tails&#39;.

&quot;Fins and tails? Doesn&#39;t sound like a bird to me. Does it to you?&quot; Verga tilted his head, wondering if the bird could even differentiate between the two. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>&#39;Not lady Ruth?&#39;</strong> The bird was physically unable to tilt its head any further in its current confused state. What was this wizened old fool talking about? He&#39;d asked about a lady friend, and a lady friend was what he got. Hmph! The gift of language is wasted on humans!

<strong>&#39;Chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp!&#39;</strong> Obscenities were exclaimed in a tongue incomprehensible to Verga, but their disturbing nature was perceived by those well-versed in the avian tongue. Chirping and squawking noises rose from the nearby trees, as if their feathery residents were perturbed by what they&#39;d just heard and felt obligated to correct their foul-mouthed kin.

The budgie turned a blind eye to the accusations of its kin. It wasn&#39;t about to lower itself to the level of an uneducated finch! It groomed its feathers as if it had just finished a grand performance, before hopping onto Verga&#39;s shoe with dainty steps. 

Thankfully, Verga was kind enough to outline the keywords and phrases with his impeccably shiny shoe. The bird lowered its proud head and began to read, one outrageous word after another, one salacious slander after another. The writing was enough to make a cultist lose their religion, but the budgie remained unaffected. It didn&#39;t even blush or hide its face behind its wings out of secondhand embarrassment!

...Most of the writing just flew way over its head, didn&#39;t it?

Verga was beginning to wonder for the second time whether he had gone insane when the bird suddenly spoke up once more.

<strong>&#39;Mermaid?&#39;</strong> It uttered, dipping its head to nibble on the letters. <strong>&#39;Lady friend. Mermaid?&#39;</strong>

It started pecking the newspaper with newfound fervor.

The bird was drilling holes into the newspaper where the word <em>mermaid</em> had been mentioned, not unlike a teacher trying to emphasize a key point on a blackboard by rapping on it with a stick!

<strong>&#39;Food!!!&#39;</strong> It corrected Verga. <strong>&#39;Yummy, yummy, in my tummy! Lady, not food. Bride, food. Idiot!&#39;</strong> 

Despite the bird&#39;s heated words, Verga had a feeling that it wasn&#39;t doing so to spite him. Quite on the contrary, what he had just heard was perhaps the wisdom of nature that was lost to the advanced brain of man. Could the budgie have been correct all along...?

No! His dignity as an intellect!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At this point, Verga was unsure on how Koji had trained his birds in the first place. While calling the doctor a likable individual would be an overstatement, they certainly didn&#39;t seem like the type to teach their birds to purposefully act impish. The budgie had either picked it up on their own, or Koji&#39;s attempt to neuter William was to make birds as annoying as the pink menace.

Regardless, he didn&#39;t care. All he cared about was the information, which the bird thankfully delivered, in its own roundabout fashion. It ranted about a mermaid, comparing her to food while simultaneously taunting Verga for being unable to figure it out on his own.

&quot;Food?&quot; He thought a bit, thinking about what a bird would eat. Seeds and fruits were out of the question, since Koji wasn&#39;t deranged enough to go for those. Mermaids then...

Fishes?

Whatever Koji had awakened, it was most likely of aquatic origin if the budgie were to be believed.

&quot;I see. Has karma finally decided to bite him back, I wonder?&quot; Verga giggled as he started piece two and two together. Naoharu Koji was far too stubborn of a man to look for other women. He could only imagine why he was currently tagging along with a sea creature of all things.

He needed to meet the doctor again at all costs.

&quot;Thanks for the assistance.&quot; Verga replied back to the bird, kneeling down to better communicate with it. He then slowly lowered his arm and grabbed the newspaper lying on the ground, much to the bird&#39;s surprise.

&quot;Guess there is no need for this anymore.&quot;

He said, immediately shredding the newspaper to pieces and letting the wind carry them away. The pieces that remained were all littered around the budgie, a grim reminder of their failure.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? I thought your master only needed papers to tear them up? Well, I just cut out the middle man and expedited the process. No need to thank me, my small fellow.&quot; Verga laughed, twirling his stache in malevolence. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The budgie was starting to grow impatient as Verga took his sweet time putting two and two together. How much longer was he going to take? It needed to deliver the newspaper right away, or half a day would&#39;ve gone by. But this leathery old coot didn&#39;t even have the decency to let go of the newspaper! 

<strong>&#39;Move! Move!&#39;</strong> The bird started pecking Verga&#39;s shoe, reminding him that he still had his foot on the newspaper. It flinched when Verga finally crouched down and extended a hand towards it...

Was it going to receive a pat?

The bird watched Verga&#39;s hand with anticipation, until it went over its head and straight for the newspaper, pulling it out from under his shoe...

<em>rip rip riiiip</em>

And the newspaper was torn to shreds in the blink of an eye!

The bird could only watch in disbelief as the flurry of torn papers scattered to the wind. For a moment, it remained silent, all frozen in shock. Its poor mind was unable to comprehend the atrocities Verga had just committed. What kind of evil mastermind would find joy in bullying a bird?!

<strong>&#39;Chirp...&#39;</strong> The bird was so appalled that it even forgot how to speak human. It regarded Verga with an air of disgust before taking wing and leveling with his face.

<strong>&#39;Fishbrain.&#39;</strong> It spat at Verga with so much audacity. <strong>&#39;Bananabrain. Toastbrain!&#39;</strong> It hurled a few more insults at the writer, then ditched him and circled back to the front of the <span class="mention">#merch-store</span>. Blood feud aside, it still had a job to fulfill! 

Verga would no doubt feel an immense satisfaction knowing that he had shattered the heart of yet another creature without so much as spending a dime! Had he even paid for his own newspaper? How did it feel to shred his own article alongside William&#39;s, knowing that one of them was irredeemable trash?

He started walking, before noticing a few pieces of paper stuck adamantly to his shoe. A few globs of white and brown peeked out from under the paper.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Satisfied by his handiwork, Verga could care less about the budgie&#39;s flurry of insults. The few words that he had understood barely made any sense. Not surprising, considering a bird&#39;s limited vocabulary.

He watched as the bird flew away, most likely in search of another copy of the times. He chuckled, wondering if he deserved any form of retribution for ruining the life of a little bird.

Of course not! Something as lowly as an animal was insignificant in the face of a man. There was no point in feeling guilty about his actions.

With that knowledge in tow, he started to walk away, before feeling a sticky sensation underneath he soles. A paper trail was glued to his feet, and as he raised his shoes in order to flick the pieces away, he noticed splatters of white.

His smile turned into a frown as he reluctantly started grinding his feet on a nearby wall. Slowly and thoroughly. Had to make sure every little bit fell off.

&quot;It appears that I wasn&#39;t cruel enough.&quot; He murmured to himself, already knowing what he would do next if he ever met Koji&#39;s little companion again. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
