The beauty that was cultivated here, would fade with time. The memory of Rosemary would too. Beginning with the remains of the most faithful yew tree, finally succumbing to ash. 

Whether it made a noise or not, is of much debate. Now the garden was without its centerpiece, leaving the scene more… somber.</span>

All that mattered was throwing her body closer to Ruth&#39;s estate, no matter what trifling injuries she might accrue from the journey. She was a corpse after all, she did not feel pain or exhaustion.

Laying her to rest was a hazy memory for the Banshee, members of her cult tending the estate flocked to her naked form like a goddess of beauty had descended to bless each one of them and each recoiled in a reverent daze of awe and horror as the &quot;angel of death&quot; pushed them aside. She could not recall any of their words, nor the passage she took to Ruth&#39;s personal quarters nor what her delirious master whispered to her. A dull sensation in the back of Berzerker&#39;s skull had started to creep down her back and out into her eyes.

She knew not where to go but perhaps she needed to follow the advice she had given her own master. Rest and meditation were necessary, even for one who had wrestled themselves out of death&#39;s grasp. But she would not sleep in such a place. So for once, she let her whims guide her raw feet.

Within minutes, Banshee wandered into the dense foliage of the jungle and came upon a familiar greenhouse. A Yew tree within beckoned to her even as her feet felt increasingly cased in lead and her legs numb.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee forced herself to take the few more steps necessary to step inside the Greenhouse and one more before she found her body froze. Before her stood someone she had not sensed at all. Its transparent form was surely not alive yet she did not find herself compelled to care for its corpse for none could be found. Neither did that magnetic force that had demanded the earlier archer&#39;s dispersal motivate her armored hands. But that only left the impossible and she could not accept the impossible. 

Banshee took another step forward and moved an armored finger through the apparition before her. She could feel nothing, no disturbances in the air, no rise or fall in temperature, nor otherworldly sensation running through her palm. Her eyes widened as the being before her defied all definition, an anomaly to her rules, her duty. And there was nothing she could do to remove it.

&quot;Impossible, impossible, impossible... one who should not exist... GO AWAY!&quot; Banshee cried out, attempting to take a step back only for her legs to give way and send her collapsing onto the floor. She did not believe herself to be tired yet her body would at most sluggishly respond to her commands. Her hood fell down revealing the hellish patchwork quilt of bone and flesh that had knitted itself back together shoddily and been worn down to near-failure by its master. 

She tried blinking her eyes for that was all she could do yet the ghost before her persisted even as her vision started to blur on the periphery.

&quot;What are you doing to my body, apparition? Why do you take the form of the departed?&quot;

Berserker called for her to leave this place, leave what gave her form. “Dear…. I’m afraid I am this place. I cannot leave the confines of this garden without succumbing to a <strong>true death</strong>.” 

A sensation was felt as the apparition knelt down, wiping away  the tears forming within the specter’s eyes. “We are the departed, yes. But we are also not the departed. Her memory lives within us, and is still experienced by us.” Vines, that is what the sensation was. Vines had worked their way over and was clearing away the sorrowful and confused tears. “It’s wonderful to feel something other than cold dead iron and steel. She would have loved to see you in a living form.” The vine then brought a bloom of Rosemary towards the servant. Nestling it within her hair.</span>

&quot;You have the means to dismiss yourself but you have not done so? How cowardly,&quot; she shook her head, eyes closed in disapproval. It felt good, oddly so to close her one remaining eye and feel the thoughts within her mind begin to dissolve. Yet that was a luxury she could not take. Clearly it must be the work of the  spirit in front of her. &quot;A specter such as yourself... should end their own preternatural purgatory... when possible...&quot;

Speech was becoming harder to manage, the dull sensation now engulfing her body. It was unwanted and unnecessary. Couldn&#39;t her body see the curse being laid upon it and resist it?

&quot;I-I command you to... walk into the oblivion... and never return... she who wears... the memories of the depart...ed...&quot; Banshee did not resist the embrace of the vines nor could she properly register what they were in her state. Her voice trailed off as her eyes fluttered and her body finally gave out, collapsing backwards onto the grassy floor.

&quot;I do have those means, if left unattended. We will wither and fade away. But, we do not wish to suffer such a fate. <em>She</em>does not wish to suffer such a fate, not yet.&quot; The vines began to form a bed around the failing body of the berserker, catching her now passed out form within their clutches. 

Carefully, gingerly, the bed moved itself further into the garden. Rosemary&#39;s image began to search through the garden, looking for something that could suffice to give the specter of sorrow. Finally settling upon a pomegranate. 

The vines plucked it downwards and brought it over to Banshee. &quot;Oh mourner of the departed. Allow this fruit to grace your lips, let it give you some strength to heal your weary form...&quot; The fruit was then cracked open by the vines, before pomegranate seeds fell upon banshee&#39;s mouth.  

Whilst plants did not carry nearly the quantity of mana that animals tended too, these particular fruits of the garden had been cultivated with a rich network of magical energy. Each piece in itself a miniature magical battery. 

&quot;Please do not fade from this earth just yet, servant of the Morrigan. Accept our offering.&quot; The vines moved to mimic chewing for the weakened spirit and they ceased their work once it was thought to be sufficient. They left the body of berserker alone.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee drifted off, not into that endless ocean, but a void overflowing with bliss and peace. There was no apocalyptic vision to be witnessed or cryptic dream, just a space where her mind could wander and rest. The ghost of Rosemary would notice the corners of the berserker&#39;s mouth turn up and her taut form release from its rigor mortis. 

Yet it would be hours until her body moved faster than the plants around her. The roots embedded in the soil could feel that earthen matrix disturbed and shift upward. For every embedded stone absorbed by the resting corpse, a laceration or puncture would fill in. For every clod of dirt, exposed bone and flesh would be covered anew. For every grain of sand, a bruise would fade away. 

When the moon was at its peak, Banshee&#39;s eyes opened again and she rose to her knees gingerly. Her armored hands glided over her body and examined the new flesh and mended fabric. Her gaze would turn to the patient specter still present by the yew tree and tears began to redden her eyes again.

No longer blinded by fatigue, Banshee saw the garden bed radiate from that ghostly form and sliently cursed herself as she came to an epiphany. She had, in her delirium, blasphemed against one of the very things she swore to protect. She had almost erased the memory of the dead, the innocent soul who had given her unlife once more and another chance to serve in the Morr&#237;gan&#39;s name.

&quot;Forgive my impudence, absolve me of the disrespect I committed against her name. The living already seek to cloud my judgement, what does the memory ask of me to mend this sin of mine?&quot; She cried, as she brought her body down in genuflection before the ghost&#39;s feet. Tears of regret fell on the soil and evaporated into the dust of apprehension.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Druid&#39;s ghost remained by the fallen yew tree. Patiently staring down at the bed of vines which the servant rested upon. Her hand would attempt to caress its carcass. But nothing was felt. 

So instead it stared in fascination as Banshee reformed her body, making it strong once again. Sand replaced by actual flesh and muscle. Knitting itself up once more. 

The moon hung overhead. A variety of more shy flowers were now in bloom. Not assaulted by the harshness of the sunlight, it allows for them to show their delicate interiors. Peppermint leaves of Night Phlox, The fullness of the Moonflowers, the ethereal colors of Brugmansia, along with plenty of others. All now let themselves be known to the world. 

The figure turned towards its guest again. &quot;Dear, there is no need to apologize like so. You were harmed, and a harmed brain never functions properly.&quot; Her smile shone down upon the mourner, as vines rose up to have their faces meet. 

&quot;If you so wish to mend your sin against her memory, help tend to our being. Do not let her great work be destroyed. And perhaps, make a cup of tea for yourself. She had a wonderful batch of hibiscus picked out just for you.&quot; Her voice let out a little chuckle, seeing the comedy in this situation. &quot;But this sin you see, is not so grievous.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Banshee did not believe the garden&#39;s answer. How could something grown on such a false polluted island still harbor such kindness? Perhaps a reflection of its previous master&#39;s disposition, to give back what it had received so reliably for years. There was a time to contemplate its nature but Banshee felt overwhelmed by its pureness of action and lack of duplicity. This is who perhaps who her master could have been if fate were not as cruel as it always was. Such a realization only made the tears rolling off her face fall like rain.

She  was damned as she always had been, there would never be a life of her own to pursue, duty would always find a way to triumph over her own wants, insignificant as they were. All had to fall by the wayside for the dead had to be mourned and their memory --  their memory had to be preserved. The tears thinned in number.

&quot;You say Rosemary&#39;s great work is in risk of destruction? We can not condone such work to dust, not when it honors the dead and marks their bed of repose. My duty is not to only mourn the dead but to honor their memory as well,&quot; Banshee&#39;s face was still wrought with sorrow and wettened by penance but her eyes and words were steeled with a new purpose, one she could use to chase that past that never was meant to be. Perhaps this could be the start of nurturing her own selfish desire buried under layers of obligation and guilt. &quot;I will make this estate my own, the burial mound needs a lady and so I shall be its as according to my status..&quot;

&quot;Yet before we start with grounds keeping, I would ask you, as the sum of the dead&#39;s memory, what is the significance of this sliver of stone? I know not its name nor its purpose yet it calls to me in a way no other stone does...&quot;

Her own smile only grew three fold upon seeing this. “Welcome as the lady of the estate, Banshee. Servant of the Morrigan. Mourner of the deceased and holder of their memories.” The image gave a deep bow to its new care taker. 

“We shall help you in whatever way we can. She would be very happy to know that one from the homeland has given her home such a blessing.” The image reached out and gave a hug to Banshee, but all she felt were vines wrapping themselves into a comfortable embrace. Then letting the servant go. 

Berserker then had a question about the stone. The necklace at the center of Rosemary’s plan for summoning a servant. “Ahhh…. That is an artifact from the homeland, of Ireland. A piece of ████████” Words were spoken… but they sounded painful. As if it were a swarm of hornets themselves replacing the sound, the name of whatever this stone is did not want to be known to banshee.</span>

Something about her words felt right, the way they sunk into her soul and bound her to the land. She now had ownership not just of a burial mound, which all her kind guarded but an entire estate. She could not explain it but it was as if she had come back onto some long lost home, such was the feeling of belonging. She gave a regal nod in response to the ghost.

&quot;Rosemary was of Gaelic blood? It seems E&#237;re has found me again in some little way. There is no way I shall abandon this estate now,&quot; Her mind swelled with excitement in a way she had not felt before. How could fate reward her in such a way? How great must her coming misfortune be that it gave her a taste of home to hide the taste? Such questions lingered in the back of her mind for the garden embraced her with tendrils and vines that carried the warmth of the earth in them. 

&quot;An artifact? That would explain the affinity I have for it, but could you please repeat its name? I could not catch its name the first time...&quot; She said, learning closer to the mass of vines and plants

“Ah of course, berserker. It is a piece of ███ ███████ █████.” The words were more clear, but still it’s name evaded the specter. Less painful to the ears. More akin to the gentle bumbling buzz of a bee. 

“I say we should celebrate, but it wouldn’t be much of one if only one participant can truly indulge.” The image chuckled slightly, smile still beaming as they surveyed the garden they called home. “But surely you would still like something?”</span>

Banshee had thought that it had drowned with her for the memories she had extended scarcily before the whole land drowned from two floods. Clearly she had much to ask of this ghost.

&quot;Hmmm, so it is...&quot; She nodded her head sagely, feigning understanding of the stone which so sought to evade her knowledge. The topic would be dropped or the moment would likely be ruined by her futile prying. 

&quot;To celebrate? I do not usually partake in feasts, it is outside of my obligations. However, as Lady of the Mound here, perhaps I should survey the land and what it grows. I will not require much, a plate of what you take the most pride in will suffice,&quot; For the first time since Banshee had been summoned, she felt at home, her muscles relaxed and her mind at ease. In her heart, she wanted to keep this moment going as long as possible even as soul and mind knew such moments would be over far quicker than the morose minutes of her charge...

“But yes, our best fruits….” Rosemary scratched her chin for a moment before the vines began their work. Inspecting the garden’s many fruits before once again settling upon a pomegranate, a vividly green apple, a mango, and a dragon fruit. “These were some of her favorites as well. Enjoy, lady of the mound.” The vines presented the fruits to their new caretaker as the image bowed and backed away, returning to her position at the side of the fallen Yew tree.</span>
