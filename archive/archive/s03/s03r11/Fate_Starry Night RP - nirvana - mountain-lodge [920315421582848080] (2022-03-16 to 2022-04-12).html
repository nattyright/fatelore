He unstrapped his arm. A second later, the drip needle had been pulled and the adhesives ripped off his arm, before being roughly tossed into the trash bin. 

Koji stood up and stretched. His body felt heavy and lethargic, dense but full of life. He looked down at his arm. The skin where it had been pricked by the needle looked pristine and smooth, as if nothing had ever happened. 

He breathed a sigh of relief and dragged his body out of the cabin, glad to be released from the confinement of his chair. A blast of cold air hit him in the face. Snow fell into the crack between his neck and his shirt, slipping down his neck and making him shiver. 

The air smelled fresh. It felt good, better than the stale hot air he&#39;d been breathing under the roof of the Naomi estate. It made him feel alive. 

&#39;Scylla?&#39;

He leaned over the railings of his porch to check the nearby lake for a splash of red. With any luck, he&#39;d spot his Servant at the lake, enjoying a swim...?

Say, what had Scylla been up to the last time she took time off?

He realized he had no idea.</span>

Heavy footfalls from her lumbering golem slowly began to falter, as the soldier made of fungus grew more and more lethargic as the steps brought them closer to the frigid air of the mountains. Locusta herself, cradled in their bosom, fought hard to keep her frame from succumbing to the new bite that flowed from the top of Nirvana&#39;s ice laden regions. Her Master had done well to point where to go...but she didn&#39;t make mention of how tumultuous the terrain might be...

&quot;Please...my darling, we need to keep going. For her sake...I have to know...&quot; 

The trip was only made longer with Caster&#39;s frazzled mind; she had simply told Ashley she needed to talk to her &quot;Dad&quot; about the attack on the Holy Mother...the lie nearly tore Caster apart, leaving a metaphysical bleeding hole in her chest that was only matched by the physical punishment she inflicted on her own stomach. Claws, scratches, and the faintly beaded droplets of blood seeped through her dress, the same one from the meeting at the Naomi Estate the day prior, and dyed it a dark burgundy. She took the liberty of slashing her very clothes as well, more punishment for hiding the truth from her Emperor...but the hard truth was that this was nothing more than cosmetic.

She cowers deeper into her golem&#39;s club like arms, the figure wrapping her tighter and braving the most of the cold as it continued, laboriously, towards the cabin. Her Master...Ashley...the Emperor of the world...a thought had entered deep into her mind. More than once, Locusta had considered killing Ashley, but these were passing thoughts and dim laden dreams. No, now was different...now that she could see her Master changing...how she acted, her desires laid bare...Locusta couldn&#39;t stop the thought trapped in her skull. <strong>Is she truly my Emperor?</strong>

&quot;This is simply...a byproduct...something has happened to her...the father, he can clear it up...tell me she&#39;s acting out of line...&quot;</span>

The golem rises above the Crest of the hill, spotting the lodge in the distance, tucked away in a corner far from the rabid civilization of hunger, mania and mystery coiling below. Caster was nuzzled deep in its arms, fidgeting and biting back against the nightmares haunting her...

&quot;<em>...My emperor...my emperor...Nero...do you...</em>&quot;

Emboldening itself, the golem presses forth, unbeknownst of the beast that prowls the waters, or the watchful eye of the doctor within...</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">As Koji turned his eyes to the lake near his cabin, he would find it to be, oddly enough, empty. That was strange. Normally, Rider was happy enough to waste away her free time there, be it by swimming about, floating aimlessly, or anything of that sort. But today, it seemed she had elected to forgo that usual routine. In fact, judging by the intact state of the dirt by the lakeside, it seemed she hadn&#39;t even ventured near the water in about a day or so. 

So, with the obvious answer impossible, the next line of questioning came to the forefront: Just where had Scylla gone? 

It was unlikely she had ran away again, no. After a rocky start to their relationship, they had mostly settled into smooth sailing. Then, had she gone off to hunt? If she had, then she was being very conservative with her mana, seeing as Koji could feel no great fluctuations in his circuit. That made it evident she wasn&#39;t exerting herself in the slightest. But, she was nowhere near the cabin. How curious...

But there&#39;d be no time to play detective, hell, not even enough time to send a curious prod across the telepathic link before the mystery would quickly begin to solve itself.

As Locusta and her golem began to approach the cabin, she would feel a sudden shift in the atmosphere, as though the air around her had suddenly grew more damp. Her ears would catch slick squishing noises behind her, growing louder and louder with each passing second. She&#39;d begin to smell the aroma of saltwater as it flooded into her nostrils. And then, as the source of these stimuli caught up to her, she would be brought face to face with a monster...</span>

It was barely larger than her in height, and somehow even scrawnier. The only reason she had to crane her neck up to look at it was because it floated, and even with that natural advantage, it struggled to look even remotely imposing. In fact, the mere idea that this thing could be intimidating was laughable.

It swam around in the air for a moment, before it positioned itself in front of Locusta and her golem, hovering in place as blubbery tendrils shifted about. After an awkward pause, the anomaly would finally break the silence.

The golem looks up, it&#39;s blank visage somehow giving an air of surprise as the creature looks upon some manner of marine life...floating in the endless sea that was the air between them. It&#39;s soft, gentle nature beheld a series of tendrils hanging limply from a bulbous, gelatinous body, of which the mushroom could scarcely contain its curiosity. The way they hung so lifelessly, how the light catches and shines from the bubble like head...the golem had no choice. It&#39;s master&#39;s mission was important, but it&#39;s base urges could be denied no longer, no after that delightfully curious sound it made...

Slowly, shifting the weight of Locusta against its shoulder, like a babe against its mother, the golem extends a stubby appendage, wishing for one thing alone...<em>to poke the strange creature.</em> It didn&#39;t give off the impression of danger, and with its master in (frenzied) slumber, it had nothing to hold it back...

<em>blub</em>

It&#39;s club like arm lightly presses against the creature, it&#39;s body motionless as it prods and rolls its arm along the length. What a joyous sound! It presses its arm again, a little firmer, to get a bigger sound.

They didn&#39;t seem particularly keen on covering their tracks, though it wasn&#39;t as if the snow-covered mountains offered much in the way of camouflage. Whether it was William&#39;s obnoxious pink hat or Ruth&#39;s honey-colored fur coat, most visitors would give themselves away long before reaching the cabin, providing him with sufficient time to decide whether to present himself or pretend not to be home.

This time, he went with the former. The golem bothered him, as he recognized it as a familiar belonging to the puppeteer&#39;s Servant. But the translucent creature bobbing up and down in front of the golem bothered him more. Grabbing his coat by the door, Koji flung it across his back and ventured into the cold outdoors to meet his inhuman visitors, who had caught themselves in a most unusual exchange of interspecific greetings. 

<em>Glub glub glub.</em>

<em>Prod prod prod.</em> 

<em>Glubglubglubglubglub.</em>

<em>Prodprodprodprodprodprodprod-</em>

&#39;Enough.&#39;

Koji hooked the aquatic &#39;menace&#39; with his cane and pulled it back, stripping the golem of its newfound joy. He turned the jellyfish-like creature over in his hands, examining it closely.

&#39;...Is that you, Scylla?&#39; He had trouble convincing himself that Rider had undergone yet another transformation into...a mascot. Yet the evidence was all there. After all, for what other reason could a creature of aquatic nature have for roaming the snow reserves, if not his own Servant?

Though if that were the case, then it was very bad timing. Koji stood back from the golem, giving it a wide berth as he cautiously eyed the petite form slumbering in its cradle. &#39;Servant,&#39; he called out, his voice falling flat across the blanket of snow all around him. 

He spoke again, louder this time. &#39;What brought you here?&#39; He asked, reprovingly. &#39;I don&#39;t recall leaving you an invitation.&#39;</span>

<em>BlubBlub</em>
<em>Gluuuuuuub</em>

<strong>Servant</strong>

The stern reproach wrestles Locusta from her dreams, eyes fluttering open as snow falls against her face, leaving it more pale than usual. The golem&#39;s cap drops slightly as it&#39;s plaything and friend was dragged away, arm hanging limply while the other reaches back and gently drops Locusta to the ground, the Servant sinking ankle deep in the powdery turf, something she wasn&#39;t altogether pleased by...

&quot;Calm it, calm it...Koji? Naoharu? Am I saying that right? Sometimes it&#39;s hard learning the Japanese names, I&#39;m not inherently used to it...&quot; 

The Caster takes another firm glance around, noting just how truly secluded Koji must be from his fellow Nirvanans. All he had to his name was a humble little lodge surrounded by a blanket of ice, snow, and dense, dark, stretching forestry. She supposes its not much worse than her own Master&#39;s current abode, but it was slightly more deliberate in how separate and isolated it was...

&quot;I came...to...to ask a few questions of you...about my m-m-m-massssster...&quot; The cold was suddenly getting to her, Caster having spent the last few days in the tropics of Nirvana, a temperature that was familiar and homely for her. This...was anything but <s>was fucking cold.</s>

&quot;L-look, I don&#39;t mean harm and I&#39;m not here to take or ask anything immediately regarding you or...th-that thing, so can I please...please...PLEASE ask that we go inside? Doesn&#39;t the fact that I&#39;m Ashley&#39;s Servant give some form of security?&quot;</span>

The odd creature would let loose a shriek(?) of surprise as it was caught by the cane of the doctor, dragged away from the odd session of poking and prodding, and brought face to &quot;face&quot; with Naoharu Koji. This was certainly the second most odd aquatic monster that he had seen thus far, which depending on how one viewed it, was either encouraging or discouraging.

Still, the question remained - Just who was this thing? Could it be, just as Koji hypothesized, that this was a new form of Scylla?

<em><strong>PSHHHHHH!</strong></em> His answer came in the form of a spray of water, spat from the creature&#39;s mouth directly into Koji&#39;s face. The jellyfish would remove itself from the end of the cane, blubbering dismissively at the doctor, before, holding up two of its tentacles towards the doctor.

<strong>&quot;Glub, glub. Glub? Glub.&quot;</strong>

With that explanation(?), the jellyfish would begin to float towards the direction of the cabin, quietly blubbering glub-curses to itself as it went along. Well, at the very least, he could take solace in the face it wasn&#39;t hostile.

It was a bit of a dick, though.</span>

I&#39;ll know when I&#39;m called.&#39; He wasn&#39;t very particular about the pronunciation of names. After all, many of his patients had flubbed way worse and lived. 

Though it seemed that this Servant in particular, was on the verge of death simply by...existing. His gaze gravitated towards her state of dress, the dark red stains on her ragged dress, which looked as if they had been mauled by a small beast. On top of that, she was shivering, her body clearly unattuned to the frigidity of the frozen tundra.

Well, neither was he. Koji was shivering under his coat as well. The only thing that prevented him from showing it was because he had something to occupy his hands. 

Namely, the jellyfish that was currently being squished like a large stress ball.

The creature clearly did not like it. As Koji brought it up for closer examination, it retaliated with a blast of cold water right in the face. Koji drew in a huge gulp of air, gasping at the shock of the temperature. Water dripped from his hair, turning into mini ice crystals before they&#39;d hit the ground. 

He really <em>was</em> freezing now. 

Teeth chattering and unable to speak, Koji turned to his cabin and motioned for Locusta to follow. Of course, the invitation didn&#39;t extend to her golem, as there was no way a familiar of that size could ever fit through the cabin&#39;s door. It would need to park itself outside or downsize significantly. 

By the time the trio made it back to the cabin, Koji almost couldn&#39;t feel his face. He dove into the kitchen to boil some hot water, leaving Caster and the jellyfish to their own devices in a living room that looked both empty and cluttered at once.

Her golem, however, noticed the rather small entrance, it&#39;s cap bristling as it tested whether or not it would make it inside...there was no chance of that...

It did the one thing it really could do. Taking one of its club-like arms, the familiar smashed itself to pieces, crumbles of fungi and mushrooms falling all over Koji&#39;s well-laid porch, rubble being all that was left behind...before a rustle indicated something new approaching...something...

&quot;<em>Ooumph</em>&quot;

A much smaller golem emerges from the pile, no taller than even Locusta&#39;s knees, quickly running after its master before the door could shut on it. 

The first thing the Caster took into consideration were the birds. The birds...each of their beady black eyes fixing on her and staring deeply at the tattered, ragged clothes donning her back. Even the brim of her hat wasn&#39;t enough to shake off the feeling of their gaze, the Caster quickly making herself at home on one of the chairs, praying incessantly that they wouldn&#39;t pry into her hair...

&quot;...Your home is...I haven&#39;t see anything like it,&quot; she says, not knowing of any particularly pleasantries to fit upon her surroundings. It was a comfy feel, most definitely, but even in spite of the pres3nce of so many animals (and one squishy jellyfish...thing,) it had the distinct impression of solitude. And not all of it deliberate. Emotions rest their weight into the soul of possessions, whether they be architecture, birds, even Servants. It was almost as if...well, that was none of her business, and rightly nothing she should care about.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">There was a quiet moment, Locusta sitting in the cluttered living room, Koji trying to free himself from the chill that had invaded his bones. It made for a quiet moment, though one that was nevertheless louder than the usual ambience of the mountain lodge, thanks in part to their unwelcome guest.

Glub, glub, glub, always with the glubbing. Glub this, glub that, glub here, glub there, glub glub glub! Was this jellyfish even talking, or was it just making noise for the sake of making noise? What an irritating little lump!

Still, they were stuck with it. Stuck with it floating aimlessly about, dripping water onto the floor, giving funny looks to all the birds sequestered about, and the like. No doubt, it intended to pull more funny business, causing yet more headaches to tumble down and complicate this meeting. You simply couldn&#39;t trust a jellyfish to leave well enough alone.

But, thankfully, the endless stream of nonsensical glubs would finally be interrupted by the sounds of the cabin door opening once more.</span>

<strong>&quot;Oh.&quot;</strong>

There was an awkward pause as Rider remained frozen like a deer in the headlights, her head just barely poking through the living room doorway, the only part of her visible from a reasonable angle. It was curious, to see the fearless and impulsive beast suddenly gain both caution and restraint. 

<strong>&quot;What are</strong> <em><strong>you</strong></em> <strong>doing here?&quot;</strong>

Her eyes flicked between Locusta and the jellyfish, back and forth, back and forth. Who was she even talking to...?</span>

Did this man have a thing for the aquatic? Or bubbly, bouncing masses? 

&quot;Well, well, three bulbous, fleshy nuisances,&quot; Locusta bites back, offering hostility back to the rude introduction by Scylla...if it was directed at her. The monstrously sized woman seemed to be just as infuriated by the blob as Locusta was, while the miniature Golem, now resting on its masters shoulder, merely mimicked both Servants, though it was just randomly flicking its head at everything in the room. 

&quot;I&#39;m here to speak with your Master, Servant, so there&#39;s no need to strain yourself with forming intelligible sentences. It might be too hard for your brain to keep up, after all, and we wouldn&#39;t want that.&quot; Locusta crosses her arms, averting her gaze, sinking further into the seat as the green shade of envy rises once more in her cheeks. How useless this container of Caster was sometimes...

&quot;So shoo, shoo, go fetch a squirrel, rabbit or deer to gnaw on.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Koji emerged from the kitchen to witness a <em>slaughter</em>. 

No one had died, mind you, but the inhabitants of the living room had effectively doubled. Caster, her mini golem, the jellyfish, and now, standing at the door and towering over every other creature in the room, stood Scylla in her summoned form.

The room was starting to feel cramped. The jellyfish was also contributing negatively to the chaos by dripping water all over the polished wooden floor. With an exasperated sigh, Koji headed back into the kitchen, then reemerged a moment later with a towel and a mop. 

He thrust the mop into Scylla&#39;s hands. &#39;I assume that this jellyfish is one of your creations. In which case, clean up,&#39; he gestured towards the water puddles on the floor. &#39;We&#39;ll need to have a serious talk about bringing pets indoors.&#39; 

He wrapped the towel around the jellyfish next. With its identity no longer shrouded in mystery (for now), Koji felt little remorse about treating it like a pet. He dragged the creature into the kitchen and dumped it into the sink.

&#39;Stay here until you&#39;ve learned to stop spraying water all over my floor,&#39; he said sternly. &#39;Or I will have Rider mop you up with the rest of the stains.&#39;

He returned to the living room, electric kettle in one hand and a few mugs in the other. He set the mugs down on the coffee table with more force than was necessary.

&#39;Coffee, or tea?&#39; He asked Caster, his voice rising in pitch. &#39;Did you come here to ask about Ashley, or to pick a fight with my Servant? If it&#39;s a fight you&#39;re looking for, take it outside. I&#39;m not looking to repair my house a second time this month.&#39;</span>

Servants taking order from masters, aquatic creatures confined to the water, the laws of nature being followed to a tee. The only disruption to the usual order was Locusta, like a thorn piercing into the delicate skin of the hand holding it.

Rider did not like Caster. There was something about her that was irritating, like salt rubbed into a wound. It was as though the diminutive poisoner had looked upon the sea fiend and simply decided she did not like her for some arbitrary reason that the taller of the two could not derive. Worst still, she had now been made welcome in her den, the place she called home, and there appeared to be nothing that Scylla could do to excise this rot.

Looking at the mop that had been pushed into her hands, her face shifted through a rollercoaster of emotions, most of them too vague to decipher, but all of them none too happy about the circumstances. But, it was too late now.

Accepting the mop, Scylla would step out from behind the doorframe she had been so keenly hiding herself behind, revealing that instead of her usual bodysuit-esque attire, she was wearing a long, flowery white dress. Did it fit? Just barely. Did she look good in it? That depended on one&#39;s point of view. Where did she get it? Much like the jellyfish, another of life&#39;s great mysteries. 

With that unfortunate reveal now out in the open, Rider would set about quickly and quietly mopping the puddles on the floor, doing her very best to avoid eye contact. But, one would not even need to look at Scylla&#39;s face to tell that it was redder than the ends of her hair. How very, very unfortunate...</span>

A mop for Scylla, a sink for the...thing. All with the restrained air of a professional, without a hint of a smile, a scowl, or any betrayal of stoicism. He clearly wore the pants in this relationship. 

Of course, Scylla&#39;s attire only struck another cord, the Caster&#39;s face reddening as she saw the beautiful gown and how it only served to accentuate and mark Rider&#39;s beauty. <em>Of course</em> she looked amazing...beautiful in whatever she wore. Of course she had that...

The clatter of the kettle and cups broke Locusta from this envious inner ramblings, her breath hitching as she struggles to recall what the man had just said...

&quot;I...I have no use for petty squabbling, no. No, I&#39;m not here for that, I&#39;m here for my Master, of course. I simply wanted...perspective.&quot; She hangs on the last word, hands gripping the tattered hem of her dress and wringing the fabric. Her head was bowed, both to avoid seeing how perfect Rider looked, but also to keep the doctor from seeing the hot shame of her next question. Well...there wasn&#39;t much she could really do to avoid it...

&quot;...She considers you and that woman as parents. There&#39;s some form of attachment there, so I figured...because she never...I&#39;ve asked her several times about her past, and I&#39;ve never gotten the answer. I am doing a small betrayal against her. She knows I am here, but not the reason. I came to ask what kind of person was she as a child. She considers you a father, so you must know what she was like...how she came to be the way she is now. These puppets...this fatigue...<strong>why did she turn out like this?</strong>&quot; 

An accusation. She hadn&#39;t meant to come here and point fingers, but clearly someone had to be blamed...surely her Master&#39;s mania and utter disregard for her own best interests lie with someone...</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&#39;...Perspectives aren&#39;t always accurate.&#39; Koji mused. He poured hot water into the mugs, one for each of the human(noid)s in the room. Not the golem though. The golem was left to wander the cabin alone, under the watchful gaze of the birds.

As Locusta had no preference over the choice of drinks, Koji made the decision for her. He reached into a nearby cabinet for a box of what looked like teabags, but they weren&#39;t the store-bought kind. They were thin papers filled with an assortment of herbs and folded over at the top.

Straightening up, Koji turned to Scylla. &#39;Do you-&#39;

He stared. And Scylla was made acutely aware of said staring, as an awkward hush soon fell over the room. Master and Servants alike stewed in their own thoughts, accompanied by the sound of the mop being pushed back and forth across the wooden floor. 

It took no time at all, but as Scylla cleaned up the final puddle, she no longer had anything to occupy herself with. Thus, she was forced to raise her head...

Koji cleared his throat, and gave the tea box a little rattle. &#39;Tea?&#39; He asked, even though Scylla could feel dozens of other questions bubbling up from within him. Why was she in a dress? Where did she get the dress? <em>How</em> did she get it? ...And why was she so damn proficient at mopping the floor?

But for now, Koji spared her embarrassment. He brought the tea box back to the table and popped a teabag into each of the three mugs, then pulled one towards himself and waited for Caster to finish collecting her thoughts. 

There was a lot to go through. But as he listened, his expression gradually turned to that of confusion. As Locusta&#39;s tone became accusatory, his eyes narrowed in spite as he prepared to challenge Caster&#39;s words. But he remained silent. With a faint scowl, he began to stir the teabag, squashing it against the side of the mug and forcing the flavor out.

&#39;...I am not her father, if that&#39;s what you&#39;ve been led to believe.&#39; Koji replied with a level tone. It wasn&#39;t wholly friendly, but he managed to keep it professional. &#39;I&#39;ve never married,&#39; he revealed. &#39;My relationship with Ruth is strictly business.&#39;

He picked up his mug, cupping his hands around the hot ceramic for warmth. &#39;Ashley had her own parents. I worked with them for a while, but it didn&#39;t last very long. Some time after I backed out of their project, they were gone, and it was around that time that Ashley started calling me <em>dad</em>.&#39; 

He stared at his tea, his expression unreadable. Where <em>had</em> that come from? Because he&#39;d indulged Ashley once or twice, made himself available when she&#39;d been sick? But those had been years ago. Ashley had grown into an independent woman, and thus any lingering obligation he had towards her real parents had been absolved. 

Yet, it seemed that Ashley&#39;s mental state had regressed as time went by. Koji had no idea. He was far too busy with his own work to mind someone else&#39;s business, and Ashley was not his kid. 

&#39;I believe what you&#39;re looking for is a psychiatrist.&#39; He picked his words carefully, slowly. &#39;I am not one myself, but I can refer you to one whom I know and can vouch for. Obsessions are never healthy. I can&#39;t tell you what it is that made her this way, but...&#39;

&#39;...well...&#39;

Koji looked up from his mug. Caster kept her face downcast, her expression hidden, but he could see her body language plainly. She was distraught, to put it simply.

&#39;You are obsessed with your Master, aren&#39;t you?&#39; He quietly observed. &#39;And why is that?&#39;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Caster didn&#39;t answer the question as she was waiting for a third option. In her time, it was quite normal to offer it, a glass of wine; but when it became quite clear no wine was coming, she reluctantly took the cup of tea handed her way, watching Koji carefully as she mimics his movements with the tea bag. The scent that came afterward was...curious. A tentative sip later...

Caster tries her best to restrain the grimace that follows, not wishing to insult the only source of information she could possibly have on her own Master. But the taste...that was just flavored water! Barely flavored! How could <em>sip</em> anyone <em>sip</em> stand such <em>siiiiiiip</em>...

&quot;...What magecraft is this,&quot; she mutters under her breath, amazed that she kept going back for more. However, that wasn&#39;t what was important...although she would have to find more of these tea bags later. She turns her attention back to Koji, keeping her head bowed while listening intently. Not her father...even if it wasn&#39;t by blood, then why...

It crossed her mind how selfish the thought must be. Surely...surely he would have felt some responsibility. Surely he must have left some profound impression for this level of dedication from her...but even then, he was utterly disconnected from her plight. Was this a dead end, as well? Was this just an impasse at who she was? What she meant...

Then he asks her a true question. One she was not prepared for. A reciprocation that left herself at a loss. She strains to put on a smile once more, turning her head to glare at him...the famous &quot;Caster stare.&quot; Enough to put someone at unease, to cease their prodding. It only works when the face is consistent, however...something Caster realizes as she could feel it falling, the woman turning away once more as she takes another sip of the tea, the beverage strangely calming her. 

&quot;I am? Is...is that not the purpose of a Servant? Devotion to their Master? No matter the shape or form it takes,&quot;</span>

She glances back to Scylla once more, glancing at the third cup on the table. One never remembers their time outside of the Throne...indeed, all of the experiences that they share, that they ever will share as representations of legend, gone when they return. For what purpose does such fleeting moments in time have? But strangely, as she stares at that cup, at her own, and a thought occurs. It seems so foolish, such a naive, immature, childish notion, especially at a time like this. But she can&#39;t help but think that she&#39;s never had a cup laid out for her before...Ashley has treated her to wine before, but only when she asked for it...almost like a tea party...a tea party with-

&quot;I simply want her to...be happy, I suppose. Her smile, it&#39;s...it&#39;s beautiful. Intoxicating...that&#39;s my purpose, you know. I just wish to see my Master smile, to watch my Emperor grow. To lead them to their true potential...&quot;

<em>What are you doing here, you vile thing? My daughter have time for a filthy creature like you? Guards, bring her back down; if she steps from that workshop once more, break her ankles!</em>

&quot;...I am her Servant...I serve...why shouldn&#39;t I be obsessed, Naoharu Koji? Is that not what Masters seek in a Servant? Your desires...your ambitions. They become our own.&quot;</span>

&#39;Do they?&#39; Koji stared at Caster, unblinkingly. &#39;Do you really mean every word you&#39;ve said?&#39; He leaned forward, searching her face for a momentary glimpse of trickery. &#39;Had I been the one to summon you and told you that your purpose is best served in death, would you willingly give up your chance at a second life to make me happy?&#39;

He watched Scylla retreat to the kitchen with her tea, her face almost rivaling it in its shade of red. He sighed. &#39;What I just told you is what I said to <em>my</em> Servant on the night of her summoning. But, well, as you can see,&#39; he shrugged, then brought the mug to his lips and sipped, allowing the warmth of the liquid to soothe his throat.

And he continued to lounge in his seat, casually enjoying his tea despite the bombshell he&#39;d just dropped on Locusta.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">She was bleeding. Every word from this doctor jammed its bladed edge into her chest, twisting into her as she shrinks back from him. Even as she turns away, that gaze of his was worming through in her mind, only showing her those dulled eyes once more. 

&quot;...that&#39;s why it kills me, Naoharu Koji.&quot;

<em>sriiiiiiiiiip</em>

Her dress rips, slightly. Her hands twitch as she resists the urge to beat her own skull, too laden with embarrassment and shame. &quot;If what you say is true...and yet she still stands beside you...it only makes me hate you both more...&quot; 

<em>plip plip</em>
<em>plip plip</em>

Small tears, almost imperceptible from under the brim of her hat, fall and trail against her arms. The grime that had settled on Caster in the span of her trek made way for snaking trails of pure white along her arms. &quot;Because...even she...and my dear Sister stuck with the holy mother...they are...needed...adored...respected...because they&#39;ve earned that right. Their legends make them worthy of such devotion...

&quot;And your words towards me...what you would have told me...it&#39;s the only worth my legend brings...&quot; 

<em>How many times must I tell you, Locusta. You cannot be seen, you cannot be heard. My mother was right...it&#39;s the best for Rome. You and I...we make Rome the principle the world strives to! I in the light, you in the dark. It is how you are most worthy to me!</em>

&quot;I wanted to be her shadow...so she could be the light. Two parts of one hero,&quot; she whispers, trembling as she takes a long shot from her cup, careful not to spill it. There was still much she needed to ask...

&quot;I just need...to know...can she...do you think she can truly <strong>love</strong> something? She...she seems to care for you...in spite of you not wanting it...do you think she loves the puppets she makes?&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&#39;And why should my opinions matter? Why should I care whether <em>your</em> Master is capable of love or not?&#39; Koji raised an eyebrow at Caster. &#39;I have my own life to live, and neither you, nor Ashley, nor Ruth can play any part in it. I am a doctor, Servant.&#39;

It struck Locusta then, that throughout their whole exchange, Koji had never asked her for a name. Not her True Name. Not her class container. Not even a moniker. Just &#39;Servant&#39;.

But Koji didn&#39;t seem all that bothered by it. &#39;I work with patients. I diagnose them. I heal them. I provide services for a fee. But it&#39;s not my job to change the patient&#39;s mind,&#39; he shook his head. &#39;No. What you wish to believe is ultimately up to you. Do you wish for her to love? Do you wish for her to reciprocate your fixation? Or are you content on simply being the shadow to her light?&#39;

He set down his mug.

&#39;It&#39;s impossible for me to realize how devoted to her you are. That&#39;s the sort of thing that nobody but yourself can understand. I will say, however...&#39;

He fished around in his coat pocket and brought out a packet of sunflower seeds. He tore the wrapping open, then leaned over and placed it in Locusta&#39;s hand.

The air behind Locusta stirred. The birds perched behind the diminutive Servant fluttered to her lap, intent on feeding on the seeds in her hand. Those that couldn&#39;t fit on her lap scurried around her chair, all the while looking at her with expectant eyes as they begged to be fed.

Some birds seemed smarter than others. Instead of pecking at her hand, they started snuggling up against their humanoid companions, burying their feathery little heads in the fabric of her torn dress, nuzzling against her grimy arms. They seemed to be quite used to such tactics to gain the attention of their would-be feeder.

&#39;Affection is easy,&#39; the doctor explained, shattering the therapeutic scene he had built around Caster. &#39;Anyone is capable of showing it. So long as you still have something of value to offer, that is.&#39;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The birds swooped in, their apathy and blank stares suddenly replaced by chirps, coos and gentle nuzzling, each of which rang hollow and left a dark brow over Locusta&#39;s countenance. The gentle pecking at the seed in her hands slows as the birds gather what they needed, several flitting away and leaving the Caster alone once more. Statuesque...that was the best way to describe her, the figures eyes hidden away as the doctor gives her a harsh reality lesson. 

&quot;...Value...&quot; 

<em>She slaughtered on Nero&#39;s behalf, bring her to the colosseum!</em>
<em>Split her in half!</em>
<em>Drown her in her own toxins</em>
<em>Pit her against lions!</em> 

&quot;...Your analogy works for your own servant,&quot; She whispers, with what little seeds remaining in her hands falling to the rug below, the birds in her lap immediately diving for the crumbs left behind. &quot;I see now how you&#39;ve managed to fare. Do you feed her affection when she needs it? Do you give hints at understanding? Or do you turn up that cold glare so that she&#39;ll pine for some attention from you...&quot; 

She desperately hopes for the words to bite, but the sting is lost as Caster sinks further in her seat, her mind spacing and flitting between past and present, her thoughts torn and twisted as she wrestles with what Koji has put in her lap. 

&quot;...A Servant that is your sword...that is a Servant to keep, i think...a sword to cleave through your enemies. I suspect she&#39;s like that...brawn and beauty...deserving of praise...of respect.&quot; 

<em>She was her closest confidant, ring her neck!</em>
<em>You pathetic pile of flesh, your name won&#39;t even come within a breath of my daughter&#39;s in history!</em>
<em>Please, Locusta...my sister...I need you!</em>

&quot;But only a powerful figure of resounding conviction can hold such a sword...only one who can wield it against those that would stand before them without remorse. Only one...with a purpose...

&quot;Do you have a purpose, Naoharu Koji? Are you worthy of your Servant?&quot;</span>

Locusta sits straight, her head bowed as she drains her cup, setting the cup down on the table. She shudders, her breath coiled and shaking as she collects herself...her hands gripping each other now, tightly. &quot;You need each other...bring out the best in each other...I should say, perhaps you both respect each other...that is a form of love, I think, however slight. And I...I hate you both for that. I hate her...because she is wanted. Needed by you...whether you deserve her or not...

&quot;But do you see the use or respect in a rug beneath your feet, Naoharu Koji? Does a rug lift you...make you better...serve a purpose beyond decoration? Or is it simply...replaceable. Is it simply an afterthought in your home...&quot;

Tears form once more, Locusta turning away again, determined not to let Naoharu Koji see her turmoil. This apathy...it was what she needed. She nodded affirmatively at the notion, wiping an arm across her eyes. &quot;I love her...but what love is there in a doll? In a rug? I...I cannot help her. She does not want my help...the great Nero at least needed my help...but even then, how much was I truly needed? I...I wanted to at least be a tool...but I&#39;m simply a doll...a doll lost in a sea...all of which simply drag her down into further mania...&quot; 

There it was. The hard truth...she could not help Ashley. She was not her Emperor...perhaps, she never had one.</span>

Whether I&#39;m worthy of my Servant isn&#39;t for you to decide. I don&#39;t need someone to bring out my best. I&#39;ve always been at my best, but it&#39;s not enough.&#39;

He straightened up and sighed, looking a bit worn out for a moment as he rubbed his brow. 

&#39;Why am I telling you this?&#39; He asked Locusta. &#39;What are you looking to get out of me? Why should my life matter to you, unless you&#39;re looking for some kind of guidance - in which case, I can confidently say that I may be the least qualified to do so. In fact, I will prove it to you right now.&#39;

He flexed his mental connection to his birds and commanded a few of them to go scrounging in his room. They returned with a canvas bag, dropping it onto the table with a heavy thud and spilling its contents all over the wood. At first glance, they seemed to be marbles. Extra large, discolored marbles made of some type of metal. The size was just right to fit in one&#39;s palm, about as large as a fist, and perfectly smooth. They seemed like the type of stuff you&#39;d get at the local toy stores.

&#39;Each one of them is a deactivated Servant Core.&#39; Koji spun the orbs around absentmindedly. &#39;In other words, a Servant&#39;s heart.&#39;

He kept his eyes on Caster, watching her every move with a hint of caution. &#39;I&#39;ve deactivated many Servants, more than I can count. Some of them let me do it willingly, others less so. A few of them chose to commit suicide, and I couldn&#39;t even recover their Cores in the end. But regardless, I terminated them. Not because they weren&#39;t powerful, not because they were no better than a doormat, but simply because they lacked the knowledge that I seek. They couldn&#39;t help me achieve my goal.&#39;

Talked to the dregs of their memories through his subconscious. But some things were best heard from his own mouth. Koji didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d felt the need to explain; hadn&#39;t things always worked out fine till now? What did it matter if Scylla had gone her whole (second) life without seeing the full brunt of the damage he&#39;d inflicted to the heroes of the Throne?

Though, in some twisted way, the process relieved him. It felt as if he were granting her a proper introduction for the very first time, that this was the kind of Master she was forced to bond with. Koji continued to fiddle with the deactivated Cores. Their bond remained dormant. Their telepathic link remained silent. It felt as if he was giving her another chance to change her mind.

He turned his attention back to Locusta. &#39;<em>Rider</em> can&#39;t help me achieve my goal. In that regard, she is replaceable as far as Servants go.&#39; He told her truthfully. &#39;Admittedly, I tried to deactivate her. She tried to reciprocate the favor,&#39; he chuckled darkly, as if remembering some kind of joke. 

&#39;Her will to live led her to rebel against me. Meanwhile, your alleged love for your Master has only led you to self-pity. What are you really? A doll? A rug? In my humblest opinion,&#39; the doctor spoke in a quiet tone of sarcasm, &#39;a Servant who doesn&#39;t even know their own worth should simply stick to the role they&#39;ve been given. Do as your Master wishes, or, simply cease to exist. I can help with the latter.&#39;

He rolled up his right sleeve, exposing a length of arm full of burns and scars on top of a latticework of pink lines. His artificial circuits.

But you won&#39;t need to agonize over your self worth any more.&#39;

Doing naught but listening, though if one were unkind in their assessment, they might instead call it eavesdropping. But, nobody was here to pass judgement in such a manner. The only thing that could was a certain jellyfish, but it was too busy splashing about in the sink, lathering itself in soap suds and glubbing merrily. 

Was it normal for Noble Phantasms to just... Do that? Develop their own spectral bodies and personalities from nothing? Or, was it just the nature of borrowing a Noble Phantasm in such a manner, that a fragment of Kharybdis clung to her nevertheless?

She didn&#39;t know, and she wasn&#39;t eager to find out. Not right now, anyway.

No, her attention was firmly towards the conversation happening in the other room. Like a shark circling underneath the water, waiting for their target to grow weak, she waited and waited, watched and watched. She didn&#39;t like all that she heard, but she listened nonetheless. After all, it wasn&#39;t like there was much else she could do.

But it was not purposeless. No, she was waiting. Watching the thought processes play out. Waiting for a conclusion to be reached...</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Is there truly any kindness in death? The past few moments with this man, this Naoharu Koji were enough to make the Caster question such a notion. This offer...these cores...her own hands limply holding one of her fallen Heroes in her hands...or...was she even worthy of being called a hero? Here she was...pouring her heart to a man that clearly did not care...

&quot;...And then the cycle would begin again. I would return, awaiting the day that I&#39;m called forth once again. Forgetting all such trivialities such as doubt...despair, longing...

&quot;I came to you not for guidance. I thought to lie to myself to make it easier, Naoharu Koji. I should have assumed someone like you would quickly see that no one would ever bother you over matters of Ashley. Matters of anything besides a split bone or a deep scar. I know that you could offer me nothing...and I came anyway...perhaps to confront the truth of what I truly am. Not a teacher, an advisor, or even a Royal assassin...but to simply be the doll needed of me. To fit the role as one of her replacement family. Nothing more...nothing less...&quot;

She looks back to Koji&#39;s arm, fingers curling as she grazes and graces across each noctal pattern and patch of seared flesh, her own lips curling around a word. 

&quot;L...lo...c-c-cu...&quot;

Her name seeps between her lips, her body trembling at the choice made subconsciously. Was this truly so easy to utter her name, to die? To forfeit it all? To simply forget? She sighs, dropping the core back on the table, rising from her chair. &quot;...You sacrifice many...I hope the goal is worth it. And despite your wishes...despite my hatred...I truly hope you are worthy of your Servant. She has found a purpose in this second life...and I want to find the same.

&quot;<strong>My name is Locusta of Gaul.</strong> Poisoner for Nero Claudius. I tell you this not to die, Naoharu Koji...at least, not yet. But because...this pain I feel. This doubt. <strong>I do not want to forget it.</strong>&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span></span>

He mentally filed away her identity. A poisoner. She would be of no help to his goal. 

Unless...?

&#39;I could offer you some things,&#39; the doctor mused, wondering how secluded the Drakin family must&#39;ve become if a perfectly good Servant who specialized in assassination couldn&#39;t even find a purpose in her summon. With so many outsiders on the loose, shouldn&#39;t Servants like Locusta be in high demand?

&#39;Your poisons,&#39; he tapped the table as he asked, &#39;why you don&#39;t make some for me? I can provide you with mana batteries in exchange, if you ever decide to go rogue like Verga or William.&#39; He scoffed, as if finding the notion of Master-less Servants ridiculous.

Nevertheless, he offered. Mana batteries were easy to come by as a Master, but potions brewed by a world famous poisoner could go a very long way. It was a good deal no matter how he sliced it.</span>

Thank you for...well...I wouldn&#39;t call assisted suicide help...but at the very least being a set of ears. I will remember this...and I hope you do too,&quot; she says, dusting her dress and dabbing at the corners of her eyes as she makes her way to the exit...catching Scylla being oddly stiff in the kitchen...as if she was waiting for something. 

Her golem had been playing with the bubbles squirming from Koji&#39;s dish soap, swatting and spinning its club like arms at every floating sud to pass the time. The jellyfish was fun to poke, but when it couldn&#39;t really respond, it was something that quickly lost its luster. At the sight of Locusta, however, it hurriedly scurries across the counter...only to fall into the sink. It would take a moment for it to climb out...

Locusta waits by the exit, her back to Scylla, her mind racing to think of what could be said...she hadn&#39;t truly had a moment like this with another Servant besides her &quot;sister&quot;...she had been truly alone and separate. 

&quot;...I guess you listened to our talk...,&quot; she says, hands fidgeting, wondering just what was taking her damn golem so long. &quot;...If you are wondering...I truly meant it. I hate you...because of your purpose. I suppose I hate my other sister as well...for the direction you both have. Is he...do you feel complete here? Does he give you a purpose outside of the Throne?&quot;</span>

The pathetic wretch called Locusta continues to exist, while Naoharu Koji continues on his path, carrying the same pace. Nothing has changed. The status quo is maintained. It is like stagnant water in a dirty puddle.

Rider was not sure how to feel. Happy that this stranger found some reason to keep on living? Saddened that her master&#39;s shadowy past, suspected but never confirmed, was dragged out of the shadows? No, there was no true name for the sense of swirling unease, uncertainty and ennui that occupied her thoughts. Emotions were difficult in that way, slippery things, impossible to truly grasp, to eloquently describe.

But, even in the face of that bubbling whirlpool, when Scylla looked upon Locusta, there was one emotion she was sure of.

<strong>&quot;The feeling is mutual.&quot;</strong>

Sparing Caster only the briefest of most disdainful glances, Rider turned away from the girl, instead looking out of the cabin window. Not at anything in particular, but rather, just to avoid looking at Locusta. She did not question her hatred of the girl. No, in the complex maelstrom of her thoughts and feelings, a simple instinct for a simple servant suited her fine. She did not even need to question it.

<strong>&quot;I do not need a discarded murderer to pass judgement on my purpose. I will warn you only once, Locusta of Gaul - We are allies only by necessity. We share a common foe, but that is all I am willing to share with you. March out into the snow, turn your bitterness to the investigators, and never bother us again. And, if you find yourself so eager to give up that you must again ask Naoharu Koji for assistance, I assure you--&quot;</strong>

<em>CRACK.</em> The sound of breaking, a grotesque sound, not of subtle poison but of brutal beating. Though it is not exactly clear where it had come from, there is no doubt that Scylla is the cause.

<strong>&quot;--There is more than one way to return to the grail.&quot;</strong></span>

He picked up the mugs and took them to the sink, where the jellyfish was still happily splashing about in soapy water. He hesitated for a moment, then grabbed the creature by a tentacle, hoisting it out of the water.

&#39;So.&#39; He turned to Scylla, holding the jellyfish out to her. &#39;What is this thing? It doesn&#39;t seem to...do much,&#39; he said after some deliberation, as he couldn&#39;t feel much mana drain, if at all, from having the pet around.

&#39;Do you intend to recall it at some point, or should I start considering getting a fish tank?&#39;</span>

Despite how confidently she spoke on the subject, there was an undeniable sense of unsureness within Rider&#39;s voice. Not a lack of knowledge, per say, but a lack of context. Knowing the answer to a question without really knowing what the question even was. It was difficult to describe the seven foot servant as anxious, but this was about as close to that indistinct emotion as she could be.

All because of a blubbering little jellyfish. Or, well, it&#39;d be more accurate to say a <em>glubbering</em> little jellyfish.

<strong>&quot;It is a... Parasite? Symbiote? Hitchhiker. I cannot recall it now it has been set loose, unwilling as it was. It poses no real danger, but destroying it would cause no ill eff-&quot;</strong>

<em>&quot;GLUBGLUBGLUBGLUBGLUBGLUBGLUBGLUBGLUB!!!&quot;</em>

Suddenly, the creature would throw itself out from the sink, pathetically prostrating itself before the pair, waving around its tendrils in a state of pure panic. There was no doubt that the creature was begging for its life, grovelling for the privilege of continued existence. A bold move, considering it had already insulted Koji once. But was there such a thing as mercy in the doctor&#39;s heart?</span>

They twisted themselves into a perfect prostration, as if to ask the Master and Servant for forgiveness for its sins. 

However, the only thing Koji saw in those tendrils was how they were splashing droplets of water all over the kitchen. Before the creature could do any more damage, he slapped a kitchen towel on its head and began to dry it like a sopping wet dish.

&#39;To be between you and this...creature,&#39; he said, casting a dubious glance at Scylla. &#39;Well then, almighty hound of the Messina Strait, tell me. Which one of you should I fear more?&#39;

Despite his demeanor, there was an air of amusement in his voice. Koji lifted a corner of the towel and pitched the same question to the jellyfish. &#39;Well? What can you do besides spraying water in a wooden cabin? You&#39;ll have to make yourself useful in some way or other to earn your keep around here.&#39;</span>

One could hear the smile upon Scylla&#39;s face as she spoke, just barely managing to hold back a derisive snort or mocking chuckle at the jellyfish&#39;s expense. They certainly weren&#39;t the pair of monsters that they had once been, though, it was easy to say which of them had gotten the worse end of the bargain.

A great bloated beast, who could drink deep of ocean and spew forth whirlpools capable of reducing whole ships to splinters... Reduced to the level of a common pet. Or, perhaps common <em>pest</em> would be more accurate? She wasn&#39;t quite sure yet.

While she was mulling that over, the phantom Kharybd-kun had a much graver situation going on. Indeed, it was practically fighting for its own survival! It had to make itself useful, or it was kaput!

<em>&quot;Glub... Glub... GLUB! Glubglub!&quot;</em>

After a brisk search, the creature would spot its out - a lone sock, one that had likely been pulled away by a bird trying to make a nest. Freeing itself of the towelly net, it would rush for the sock, frantically scrubbing it with its wet tendrils, making emphasised <em>glub</em> sounds as though to suggest it was somehow doing something valuable. It would take a few seconds before that realisation actually set in.

A glorified washing machine, huh...</span>

Of course, it was quite difficult to connect the glubbing jellyfish to its legendary portrayal. The glorious maw that could suck up bellyfuls of seawater and create devastating whirlpools had been reduced to nothing more than a squishy spray bottle.

A desperate spray bottle, it seemed. As the other inhabitants of the cabin cracked jokes at its expense, the jellyfish started dragging its slippery body across the floor, leaving a slick trail in its wake as it rushed towards...an old sock? After a moment&#39;s befuddlement, Koji realized that the creature was using its tendrils to mimic the motion of washing clothes with a scrubbing board. It was bargaining for its survival with house chores!

Well, house <em>chore</em>, and not one that desperately needed doing. After all, they were in the 22nd century. Washing machines were commonplace, even on a sequestered island such as Nirvana. Arguably, the only thing a Kharybdis brand washing machine was good for was cutting down water bills...

But it was trying so hard! Had its human companions no mercy?!

&#39;You two seem to be equally matched in terms of housekeeping skills, at the very least.&#39; Koji made an extremely astute observation as he watched the jellyfish&#39;s nimble tendrils at work. A mop and a washing machine...quite a bargain from the Throne!</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><strong>&quot;I suppose that&#39;s one way you could look at it.&quot;</strong> Scylla stifled a chuckle as she looked between the unimpressed Koji and the pleading Kharybdis. What a pair the two made! Surely, if comedy double acts were a hot commodity on Nirvana, the two would have surely sold out all the theatres on the island. <strong>&quot;But I won&#39;t take offense to it. After all, both of us were far different, once. And more different even before that...&quot;</strong>

Reaching down, Rider would scoop up the jellyfish into her hands, cradling it like one would a cat. What an odd little reunion they had on their hands. She couldn&#39;t put her feelings into words. So much time to think, and yet so little to show for it. Maybe if she was a gnashing little eel creature looking up at the human form of her once-sister Kharybdis, then her thoughts would be clearer. Alas, for better or for worse, their positions were concrete, unchanging. 

A slight sigh escaped from her lips, as her mood shifted gears.

<strong>&quot;We have one more hunt in sight. Granel Mason and his Saber. If you want to gather your research, and I want my revenge, then that time must come soon.</strong> <em><strong>Something</strong></em> <strong>is coming, and we cannot let it interfere. If I must be the beast of my past to do so, so be it.&quot;</strong>

With a grimace still upon her face, Scylla would stride off, glubberly little friend still in hand as she left Koji to his own devices. For a moment, she turned back to look at the doctor, before carrying on once more. She could not allow herself to doubt.

For the final days of Nirvana were upon the horizon.</span>
