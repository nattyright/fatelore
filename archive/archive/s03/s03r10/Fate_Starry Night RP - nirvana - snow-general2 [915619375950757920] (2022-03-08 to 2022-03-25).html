            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">The frozen tundra is the heart of Nirvana’s laboratories, meaning that it hosts the least amount of animals in order to give researchers peace and quiet to work on their projects. The most you will find here are penguins and seals, relatively docile animals that aren’t a threat to humans whatsoever. Unfortunately, the weather dome around the tundra seems to be in a status of permawinter, meaning that temperatures are incredibly low and that people without proper equipment will suffer from frostbite in a matter of minutes. The animals also behave rather aggressively for some reason, with penguins trying to peck at people’s eyes while seals attempt to shred their legs. Could this be related to the presence of the labs?</div>

Verga trudged through the snow, caring not about the amount of whiteness on his trousers as he dug himself even deeper. By the time the other three had left the lab, Verga was now standing knee deep in snow. He waved at them from afar before pointing towards an icy surface. A tiny lake that had frozen solid, it seemed.

&quot;Take a closer look. Keheheheh.&quot; He giggled, causing them to widen their eyes as they stared at the area he was pointing at. A crystal clear lake, frozen like an ice cube in a freezer. A perfectly normal sight, until...

A face could be seen through it. Someone was frozen inside of it. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="DrakinGP#2895">@DrakinGP</span></span>

Rider leaned down, tipping his hat up to get a better look. 

The reaper remained silent for a moment. It was a truly bizarre thing to see. Ankou had seen many deaths in his lifetime but being stuck in ice wasn&#39;t something he saw a lot. “I see…” Ankou stood straight up, turning back to Verga and the group. “What do you say we dig them out?” Ankou asked the group; his scythe gripped tightly between his fingers.

Donald shivered as they trudged along, through the snow that never seemed to stop. The man waved them over to a specific point, almost to his bum in the white powder. 

As Verga pointed, he groaned loudly. “Ye really need to werk on yer tendencies, er at least contextual awareness. It makes me shiver more than this tundra ever could when ye giggle like that.”

Nevertheless, they peered into the frozen miniature lake. This… was a joke, right? There wasn’t a single thing in that puddle. Just a big heap of ice and–

Oh.

Donald finally saw what that man meant by ‘missed a spot’. A new face stared back at them, as lifeless as the other two they found inside the freezer. Certainly not more dark or twisted than the other two, but sickening all the same. He wondered just how many more there were scattered about this frozen hellscape.

So, what the hell was the point of this visit? They found a few sorry souls, killed long before they should’ve went to those pearly gates above. Found a bunch of machinery that meant absolutely nothing to the lot of them. Found a creep that giggled at anything dark or dour. Unless those other two found something in that storage room, this was almost a waste of time.

Almost.

Without a single word, Donald flipped his pistole around, Frigid metal stuck to his skin as he raised the weapon high above his head.</span>

“<strong>HRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</strong>”

<strong>THUD</strong>

<strong>THUD</strong>

A cascade of strikes against the frozen cage. Wood slammed repeatedly into the ice, each one with an angry yet desperate grunt. It chipped away, yet it felt like there was no progress at all. This small block had become a mountain underneath his weight, yet he continued his assault with reckless abandon. 

After a solid minute of hits and breaks, Donald sat back on his ankles. Heavy breaths in and out, a stream of white fog with each one. The cold had retreated to the environment, an already frozen bead of sweat along his brow. His lungs were pricked a million times over, and his nose had a trickle of snot that dripped into his mustache.

Donald glanced back at the other three, still deeply breathing, “I ain’t… leavin’ ‘em ‘ere to freeze er rot. Any of ‘em. I ain’t sure why that bastard Shakespeare told me to come ‘ere but… I refuse to let this trip be in vain. They deserve a proper burial. Not... <em>this</em>. No one does.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Donald kept tapping the ice with repeated pistol whips. Every blow caused one more crack on its frigid surface, eventually releasing streaks of cold air and water. He couldn&#39;t tell if his pistol was that durable or if the ice wasn&#39;t as strong as he had thought. If he were to take a closer look at this surroundings, he would notice similar cracks on a nearby mountain, as if something else had recently broken out of its icy prison in the past few days.

<strong>CRACK</strong>

Not that he would care, since the body soon emerged from its frozen cocoon. Due to the sheer cold, it had been preserved perfectly. Aside from the now pallid skin, the clothes were intact and any signs of injuries were gone. He observed the corpse for a bit, dragging it away from the site of recovery and analyzing the person&#39;s body as a result: A male, young 30s, outfit that seemed rather different than what he was used to. A cross around the neck and a strange tattoo in the chest. A prayer book in the right hand pocket, followed by ID.

Yet another member of the investigation team. Except this card dated far earlier than the two lasses from the lab. A member of the first or second investigation teams, perhaps?

<em>flap</em>

He was so engrossed in his findings that he didn&#39;t notice a nearby bird. It flew towards the corpse with an objective in its eyes, as it plucked something from the body and flew off in the span of a millisecond. By the time Donald raised his head and recognized the winged beast in the air, the bird was already a hundred or so meters away. Eventually, it just became a blip in the sky.</span>

&quot;Nah. He&#39;s far too busy of a man to care about our snooping around. I trust you appreciate what you found, at the very least?&quot; He laughed, staring at Donald with amusement written on his face.

&quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen many men around the city dressed like that.&quot; He pointed to the corpse. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="DrakinGP#2895">@DrakinGP</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">His labor did bear fruit, if darker than he liked. A corpse was unearthed from the frozen coffin of ice, and was quickly dragged out from the hole. Only when he was fully out did Donald begin his examination. A male, younger, bore a cross. A peek at his chest did not yield an actual wound, but a tattoo. That was… vaguely useful? 

His pockets didn’t reveal too much more. A prayer book confirmed his suspicions about this being a priest, and an ID card confirmed they were more than likely part of a previous investigation team. Another tally to the growing number.

Meanwhile, a bird set out to accomplish a heist. With quick beats of its wings and an even quicker descent, it closed the distance in no time at all. By the time Donald knew what was going on–

<strong>Clink!</strong>

<em>Flap, flap, flap…</em>

He looked up and around. There was nary a soul in sight besides the four of them. Did one of them just take something off the body?

No, there it was. Now nothing more than a fly in the sky, it flew farther and farther until it might as well have not ever existed. A frown imprinted on his face, and a lack of thoughts invaded his mind. What… the hell was that?

Verga found the whole situation hilarious. Donald squinted at the man, “Yes, although that begs the question of what was on this man that’d get a bird&#39;s attention like that. Somethin’ shiny, maybe?”

“An’ I’d have to trust ye on that,” he turned back to the dead man. “Doin’ The Lord’s work in some way. The only strange thin’ is a tattoo on his chest. Never seen anythin’ like it.”

He revealed the mark to the others, “Well? Does it ring a bell?”</span>

He had figured he could have gotten the body out of the ice pond, but with it frozen solid his water powers were a fair bit stifled, the whole thing being far to big and heavy for him to do much of anything.

&quot;It also begs the question of what got Mr. Preacher her the icicle treatment while the two ladies inside were... Uh, it could have been tied to the purity thing we read about in the storage room though, here let me take a closer look see if there&#39;s a match at the very least, or if it&#39;s some kind of rune.&quot; he spoke up kneeling down  moving some of the holy robes to get a full view of his chest and try and identify the tattoo.

They were already dead, why did it matter where their bodies ended up? Ankou wondered if Donald would find some kind of comfort in letting the corpses rest. 

Ankou stepped forward to peek at the corpse over Donald and Galvin’s shoulders. Somehow a bird managed to swoop in and steal information before the trio could get a good look. Were they being watched by someone? The bird was quick, it must’ve been waiting for the right moment. In that case, whatever the creature took must be important to someone. 

“Is it possible someone was watching us?” Ankou asked turning his head towards Verga. “You’re suspiciously nonchalant and seem to know more than us.” Ankou had very little to say to Verga besides making his feelings known. The amusement drawn on Verga’s face and his chuckles gave Ankou a bad vibe.

Ankou turned away from Verga addressing the rest of the group “What we do know is that this man was put here deliberately. You don’t just fall through ice this thick. Considering both this body and the ones from before are all frozen I’d like to think the same person is responsible, though there&#39;s no way to know for sure. And Im not sure Galvin… The purity experiments mentioned injections of some sort… There were a few signs I couldn&#39;t really make out on the paper maybe they match the tattoo or mention it.” 

Ankou stepped next to Galvin, pulling out the documents he tucked away in his coat, he would scan the documents to look for any clues.

Not like it mattered compared to the importance of the corpse itself, which caused the remaining three to question the man&#39;s origins. 

&quot;I found them lying in that icy prison while I was loitering around.&quot; Verga said as he slowly started to light up a cigar, which seemed to be more of an excuse to warm himself up in that frigid cold. &quot;Even better, seemed like he wasn&#39;t the only one who woke up.&quot; He pointed to cracks in the mountains, followed by a smattering of rocks surrounding another half frozen lake. Something else had woken up in the past few days. In a way violent enough to create collateral damage.

&quot;Though, I suppose you three wouldn&#39;t know anything about that?&quot; He started asking his own questions, much to Ankou&#39;s annoyance. Judging by the writer&#39;s smile, it seemed as if he had purposefully deflected Ankou&#39;s statement with one of his own.

While Galvin inspected the documents for purity, he couldn&#39;t really find any sort of correlation between the corpses and those research files. It seemed as if humans hadn&#39;t been tested on at all, only animals. Donald, in the meanwhile, held the corpse&#39;s ID tag firmly in his hand, along with the man&#39;s holy cross. He started reading the inscriptions on it, realizing that they were genuine. He then went back to the ID, skimming it again and noticing a particular word.

In fact we&#39;re only here thanks to some tip off we got about, &#39;the Nirvanan heart&#39; whatever the hell that&#39;s supposed to mean.&quot; he exclaimed letting out a deep sigh before taking in a breath feeling the biting frigid cold air fill his lungs, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to be here with the same tip would you? Perhaps we can share notes and run into the next dead end or vague clue leading us to a pile of corpses together! Doesn&#39;t that sound just wonderful?&quot; he added despite the lack of a smarmy tone the sarcastic remark was apparent through the irritation that laced his voice.

With that settled, he looked at where the newcomer pointed. He muttered a few immediate curses at the sight of it, as no normal human being could ever hope to cause damage like that. Even after death. If that wasn’t a possibility, that left little else to the imagination.

“Looks like someone either woke a sleepin’ dragon, er you’ve got a runaway <strong>Servant</strong> on yer hands,” he rubbed his beard. That was bad. A monstrous enemy to deal with, on top of being outnumbered and outgunned themselves? He’d have to kick Granel’s shins in a few times for getting him into this mess. 

He left it at that, not in any particular mood to think that thought through any longer than necessary. Instead, he returned his attention to the cross and ID card. It was a beautifully made piece, that was damn sure. There were carvings all along the wood, made with a steady hand and even steadier mind. 

To his surprise, they weren’t just perfectly made replicas of words or runes or whatever. They were way too good to simply be fake. This was no technical priest– instead, this guy had to be a real serious one.

The ID once again confirmed it, in a way. Written right next to the role of this individual was another word: Executor. That was… probably something to do with a Church, right? Granel had something of that sort on his own, as the Lead Security guy. People don’t throw stuff like that on official ‘documents’ for no reason. Maybe Granel would know.</span>

For now, he stuffed the card and cross deep inside his pocket, careful not to squish the forgotten cockroach that had snuck in there for warmth. Maybe that’ll keep Cameran content til they got back to somewhere warm. 

“Perhaps not important to us,” Donald knelt back down, “but someone’ll know a thing er two about what we got. Don’t ferget that symbol, show it around. I’ll talk with Granel ‘bout our ‘Executor’ ‘ere. Now, help me get this guy back to yer carriage.”

He grabbed hold of the arms and started to drag the corpse across the deep snow. This guy was fully serious about ‘not leaving the dead behind’. How would three corpses even fit into the carriage?</span>

Not to mention the the insult to Ankou&#39;s intelligence, however, he chose to hold his tounge. Some battles weren&#39;t worth fighting. 

Ankou tucked the papers back under his coat, unfortunately they didn&#39;t mean anything to the dead man. &quot;Don&#39;t undermine our progress Galvin. It&#39;d be good to work on the muscle in your head instead of just the ones on your body.&quot; Ankou stood up with a sigh. Despite insulting Galvin, it would be nice if the answers all fell into place. Now there was also the mystery of the cracked ice, perhaps  whatever broke free was in the ice for the same reason as the corpse.

&quot;I assure you Donald that man has already rode my carriage to his final destination.&quot; As Ankou gave his cryptic reply to Donald his carriage would manifest in front of them. It seemed no carrying of bodies would be needed. &quot;If it helps Donald, I will see to it once the bodies are in my carriage they receive a proper burial... Murder is a rather foolish thing, if this helps you cope with that evil then so be it.&quot;  For once a slight inkling of sympathy was in Ankou&#39;s voice, he really did hate when someone&#39;s life was stolen

“Name…”

He was already well on his way. The Scot could’ve swore that his wretched laughter was still well within earshot, but the winds and ambient snowfall made it hard to discern. Perhaps that was another mystery they’d never solve without outside help.

He shook his head. Focus! Get the body into the transportation. The very tiny transportation that looked not at all big enough to hold him, the other two, and three more still bodies in need of a final resting place. Even with Ankou’s reaffirmation and promise, that didn’t leave enough room. Unless this thing expanded, one of them would have to go alone.

Bollocks.

“Right, well,” Donald wiped the accumulated snow from his facial hair, “looks like you lot’ll have t’go back in an’ grab the other two. I’ll need as great a head start as I can get if I’m t’beat ya back to the cottage. Don’t much fancy a ride on yer horses, considerin’ what almost went down in yer carriage itself.”

The two would watch him start a series of stretches, which started with a few twists and shouts. This guy was both serious and willing, and it was hard to pin down the worst of the two poisons.</span>

Rider tipped up his hat, helping Donald fix the body into Ankou&#39;s carriage. &quot;Donald do not insult the capacity of my carriage. I said you could take the trunk before didn&#39;t I?&quot; Ankou would then pull a black cloth form the back of his carriage. A&#160; waivering black pit would appear between Ankou and his steeds.&#160; A black hole from which both Donald and Galvin could feel the despair of millions of displaced souls. 

&quot;A grim reapers gotta have a place to put all of his souls afterall. Think of this like purgatory Donald. It&#39;s where I put souls when they don&#39;t know where to go yet... But for you I&#39;ll let you have an extra ride just this once. Otherwise feel free to run back.&quot; 

Much to Donald&#39;s surprise Ankou really wasn&#39;t joking about the trunk. If The Saber wanted he could hitch a free ride in the land of the dead, surely that would fix the space problem.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Donald’s eyes went as big as softballs when Ankou revealed his dastardly ‘trunk’. More like <em>actually literally hell</em>, if that feeling he got from the space was any bit true. Despair-inducing was a nice way to put it, but he much preferred the term ‘soul-crushing’. Well, credit where it’s due, at least he was serious about this. <em>And</em> willing to back it up. 

“No thanks,” Donald waved off his offer, “I’ll take the long way back.”

Where did he need to go, exactly? They had taken nearly the straightest path back. Probably… opposite of where the front entrance to the lab was? That would have to be good enough, until he got lost and forgotten on this accursed island. Wouldn’t be much fun then.

“An’ Ankou… I appreciate ya doin’ this. Really.”

Saber took the Rider’s hand suddenly and shook it as hard as he could. Even if they hadn’t gotten along perfectly, at least they could do each other a solid from time to time. He’d have to take a rain check on his half for now, though. 

There would surely be a time to pay it back. Right?

Before Ankou could fully consider this idea, Donald was on his way back. A brisk pace, much faster than the bulkyman had any right to have. It wasn’t long before he too turned into a spec in the distance, and then he turned as big as the snowflakes that flew around them.

The faster he ran now, the earlier he’d be out of this cold.</span>
