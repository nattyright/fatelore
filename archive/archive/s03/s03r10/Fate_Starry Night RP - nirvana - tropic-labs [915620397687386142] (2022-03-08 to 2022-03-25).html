They had went from a safe haven back into the animal infested tropics, where bodies of carcasses both human and creature littered the forest floor. It didn’t seem smart at all to wander about aimlessly, and with how they met Rosemary. . . It would be rare if they were to run into an islander that seemed any sort of sane.</em>

<em>However, the more they traversed into the tropics once again, after trying to sneak past the now dangerous areas they found themselves back to where they been before. . . Where the dilapidated gates had been, buildings more and signs abandoned and flora taken over. There had been gates, but for what reason? They were gates as if they were trying to block things away,  not at all like a gate home, but rather gates that reached high above, as if they intended to keep things inside. . . But what could they keep inside now? The gates failed to do much now. Dante paused a little, looking at the old place before he looked back at the saber.</em>

“I think we should begin our search again. . . Here is a good place, but there are multiple. . . We should split up a bit, cover more ground and try to meet back here when we’re finished. If you find anything don’t engage it. Just try to get away, as me, I’ll do the same. Okay?”</span>

Fighting the good fight against a mad king, kicking rabid monkeys and squirrels while they slept, meeting a dead woman&#39;s memories in a tea party, good times. While the Emperor sarcastically rolled over their current situation, they stopped at another large building out in the tropics. Seemed to be another set of labs like the ones they found previously. As he was about to open his mouth to speak, Dante, for the first time in seemingly their entire visit to this island, spoke first. Octavius was quite astonished that he couldn&#39;t speak for a moment before answering.

&quot;Oh ho ho Dante, what put the iron in your spine? Splitting up is very risky you know.&quot; He said playfully, but also very seriously. They had not come into contact with any other investigators yet on the island if they even were alive and Dante wanted to split up and search for clues? &quot;You know if things get desperate, you&#39;ll have to rely on your power if the time comes, don&#39;t you? We don&#39;t have any support out there, it&#39;s just you and me. If either of us gets into danger, we&#39;ll be on our own.&quot; He said plainly as he set a hand onto Dante&#39;s shoulder. &quot;As you said, don&#39;t engage, as for me, I&#39;ll try to behave.&quot; He gave a bit of a cheeky smirk at the end of his sentence. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll use my speed to cover the ground that we can&#39;t usually together. I&#39;ll head back to the workshop and move from there.&quot;</span>

But the words nonetheless were almost ready to defend himself from the jokes the emperor made. What could have causing him to feel so defensive? So guarded? He didn’t remember much that could have led to it, but the feeling slowly seemed to blanket him. Dante shook his head again, trying to find the right words.</em>

“J—just be nearby, you don’t have to follow me, but check out the other places around. . ”

The wildlife and environment of the island were growing more turbulent. He could hear the faint sounds of screaming in the night, every night. If they didn&#39;t find out anything useful about the island before they were forced to exit off of the island, this entire operation would have been for nothing, the lives of everyone that has died would have been for nothing. They would have nothing to show for all of these people&#39;s sacrifice. This was the only course of action for them. What is done well is done quickly enough. 

Dante had grown a bit since they had first stepped foot on this island as well. He couldn&#39;t fathom Dante from their first few days on the island ever speaking as he had. Sure he was the still sheepish, cautious mess that he had always been, but he had grown despite it. That was something new to think about for Octavius. Despite not changing in the conventional sense, Dante was becoming a better version of himself, certainly better than a few days prior. He was proud of him.

&quot;We&#39;ll meet again later, be safe and stay smart Imperator.&quot; The Emperor said as he turned around, giving Dante one last nudge in the back with his fist before walking in the opposite direction.</span>

Maybe someone had forgotten to hang up some air fresheners, or maybe the janitor hadn&#39;t shown up in a while, but it was clear that this lab was in a state of disrepair.

Vines hung from the doorframe that he walked through, on the reception desk, on the magazine display, where copies of <em>The Nirvana Times</em> lay dejected. Was there even anything here? The place looked positively abandoned.

However, it was too late to turn back now. Octavius had went back the way he came. It was just Dante and his internal monologues. Not the greatest combination in such an unwelcoming place.

What if he were attacked here? Could Octavius rush back and save him in time? Could he fight back? What would happe—

<strong>Thud.</strong>

What was that?

<strong>Thud.</strong>

These footsteps... Was it his imagination, or did he recognize these footsteps.

<strong>Thud.</strong>

This feeling... Was it...? 

&quot;<strong>UUUUUOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!</strong>&quot;

Oh no. Only one being could make a noise so loud it sent magazines rattling to the floor, and made Dante&#39;s bones rattle: <strong>Vortigern.</strong> If he was here, then Octavius had to have heard that bellow, right?

Yet he couldn&#39;t run. It was like his bones had turned to jello, wiggling and wobbling.

<strong>Thud.</strong> A shadow appeared behind Dante Colt. Was this the end? The shadow raised two arms...</span>

Granel was as large as ever, and as loud. He seemed just as clean and uninjured as when Dante had last seen him on the way to Nirvana, as if he hadn&#39;t been injured.

&quot;<strong>Oh, sorry.</strong>&quot; Granel said, releasing Dante, allowing him to breathe again.

THE Octavius, from Anthony and Cleopatra?</strong>&quot; Granel said, scratching his chin. Those words meant nothing to Dante, but to Granel, it meant that Octavius was an angry, blond man cast in a sappy romance.

Oh well, that was irrelevant. He had found Dante! A stroke of luck, admittedly, but he had still found him. Maybe Donald was rubbing off on Granel&#39;s luck.

&quot;<strong>Who is this &#39;Vortigern&#39;? Is he a Nirvanan Servant? An ally?</strong>&quot; A thing? If Dante was speaking of something as an object, it was probably nothing good. Especially if it made Dante quiver in his boots. 

Then again, a lot of things did.

&quot;<strong>My Servant? He is off doing recon. I am looking into the labs around the island. I figured I&#39;d start here, and work my way back to my workshop.</strong>&quot; Granel explained, crossing his arms thoughtfully as he consumed Dante&#39;s story.

&quot;<strong>Nonetheless, you were quite hard to miss. Your Servant stands out, see. I wanted to come and meet you both, but your Servant left before I could announce my presence. We shall have to investigate this lab together, Mister Dante.</strong>&quot;

Granel glared into the darkness of the lab, skin crawling. That journal felt hot in his pocket, as if it was burning the skin. Granel shuddered in anticipation. Could he take the step into the abyss alone?

But he wasn&#39;t alone. He had Dante with him. That feeling gave him strength.

&quot;<strong>Do not worry, Dante. My job contract has not changed since we landed. I will keep you safe, both as a coworker and a...</strong>&quot; Ally? Investigator?

&quot;<strong>...friend.</strong>&quot;

Granel have a wide smile as he folded his sunglasses into a suit pocket, and led the way into the lab.

<em>Dante looked at Granel confused on his second question, the question of who was vortigern. He hadn’t know him! Had they only been able to meet the monstrosity? The doctor’s eyes widened. So he really wasn’t a servant that everyone had met.</em>

“He’s a servant! I don’t think he is on our side or the Islander’s servants. He attacked me and another islander’s servant. . . Last we saw him, he was around here. . . Though I have so many questions. Is it normal for a servant to regenerate grievous wounds entirely? Limbs being remade? From what my servant said. . . He sounds not of a servant but like he is just an undead being.”

<em>His voice sounded more unsure than ever, he couldn’t figure out the anomaly of the thing known as vortigern, but the more he did the more the rabbit hole of his seemed to become deeper. Soon enough, he was almost too lost in his own head he almost missed that the Security Investigator had started on about his servant and absence. So they had the same, splitting up and trying to find ways to solve the mysteries of this place. . .</em></span>

<em>He had been assured a bit by the man’s words. They’d be exploring together, and from what he could remember from the things before arriving, Granel was quite the good person! Dante nodded at him with a smile, before his eyes went back to the corridor they were in. The darkness engulfing that entire latter half.

Who summoned them? Why? What was the point? Granel wasn&#39;t going to complain. Maybe they could lure it into town and have it wreak havoc on Nirvanan supply lines.

<em>Zombie</em> Servants? Granel had fought with and against Servants multiple times, but one that simply put itself back together? It was almost as if the Servant was like...

&quot;<strong>Me.</strong>&quot; Granel growled, leaving Dante to ponder what Granel meant by the random single word. The only other person with capabilities like that was that bird doctor. What was his name? Koji.

&quot;<strong>Oh, I don&#39;t suppose it took out their Servant, too? Who was this other Servant? Their Master?</strong>&quot; Granel asked as the duo came across a locked door. He gave it a rattle, before groaning.

&quot;<strong>I&#39;ve been a lot weaker since getting struck by a Noble Phantasm, but I believe...</strong>&quot;

<strong>Thud.</strong> One strike.

<strong>CRASH!</strong> Two.

&quot;<strong>There we are. Watch your step.</strong>&quot; Granel said as his knuckles turned into a bloody mess of bones and bruises. He barely even blinked at the pain as the duo stepped deeper into the lab.

Immediately, Granel began poking around. Desks, cabinets, and random post-it-notes. This wasn&#39;t his first rodeo in researching things. At least this time, he had an actual brainiac, and not a grumbling Scotsman.

&quot;<strong>If I can be honest with you, Dante.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he flipped open a file and skimmed the contents. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m shocked you&#39;ve lasted as long as you did. You&#39;re a great &#39;doc and all, but this place is brutal. Are you doing okay?</strong>&quot;

Granel flipped another page of documents, only to get blood all over a page. He blinked, before looking at his hand. It was still bleeding. Wonderful, it was going to be one of <em>those</em> days. He really needed to get Palamedes&#39;s Noble Phantasm cured one of these days.

<em>Dante looked back at the man as he said something about himself. Him? He was what? Why him? He didn’t know. The doctor began his walk, hoping they’d be walking together, gathering his thoughts for the next question.</em>

“Oh! The Master was a doctor as well, he . . . He had a strange thing of birds, and his servant was that of a woman! A nasty brutish one at that. . . And she had tentacles! Like an octopus! I don’t know a servant that was such a look, but she was as fierce as any servant I’ve seen! The two didn’t seem to fit one another, other than the blunt rudeness they showed.”

<em>Dante could go on and on about it, how the doctor had been such a problem when they first met Vortigern, and how he trapped him down in the morgue, threatening Dante’s own servant to fight for his master’s life on the line. Two mysterious islanders. They seemed like more strange foes to fight as well, a pair of both precise and almost cold people. It made his skin prickle. But not as bad as Granel’s revelation that he himself had gotten into a fight, and somehow, had been able to survive a noble phantasm from another servant.</em>

“You’ve been hit by a noble phantasm?! And you’ve managed to survive? Are you okay? Any injuries? Any impairments? Maybe you should sit down, I’ll inspect you and see if any damage has occurred.”</span>

“Granel, while it is good you are strong your arm is not indestructible. You shouldn’t do such a thing!”

<em>He said with a nervous sigh, reaching in his pockets for small things he had taken from the workshop he had been so absent from. . . He wondered what went on there. No, he had to focus now, Dante pulled out a small thing of gauze and small adhesive tape. Holding it in his hand. And soon was quick to grab the man’s wounded hand and try to bandage it, moving the documents from his grip in order to not only focus on his hand, but also so he could read them. This was a lab. . . He was a doctor, it had to make sense for him to understand it, no?

He hadn&#39;t set up those alarms for nothing. Simple tripwires they were, he&#39;d fixed them to door frames, window panes, and the few lockers he&#39;d used to store his possessions. The wires were thin, transparent, offers no resistance, and evaporates under the slightest touch. They weren&#39;t meant to keep anything out. They weren&#39;t meant to alert anyone but himself.

After all, it would be bad new if anyone, any<em>thing</em>, realized that there was still someone alive inside the labs.

But now two of those wires had just been tripped, at once, as if some humongous beast had burst through the doors. ▅▅▅▅▅▅ grabbed his knife. He located the nearest exit. He shimmied down his bunk, which he had fashioned out of a stack of cabinets, and landed on the floor just in time for the third wire to trip.

A beast. Definitely a wild beast. 

He could probably take one on.

He grabbed his coat off an overgrown vine on the wall and left his cot by the greenhouse. The journal weighed heavy in his pocket. 

It was time to defend his shelter.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Koji. The name echoed through Granel&#39;s mind. A birdbrain with a monsterous Servant. If that wasn&#39;t the good Nirvanan doctor, Granel would pull the spike out of his chest and use it to clonk Koji on the head before dying.

Why was it all going back to him? Vortigern. Dante. His healing factor. If only he had died on the ship, then Dante and the others wouldn&#39;t have had to deal with him. Rookie mistake. Granel should&#39;ve snapped his neck like a twig when he had the chance.

But he did save Dante during that fight with Vortigern... Right? But he was <em>Nirvanan</em>.

&quot;<strong>Hm?</strong>&quot; Granel blinked, coming back from his stupor. He wasn&#39;t holding the file anymore, instead there was Dante fussing over his arm. He shook his head. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m fine, Mister Dante. It&#39;s second nature for me to use my strength for the good of the team. I&#39;m just under the weather, please...</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s voice trailed off as Dante worked, wrapping and binding his patient&#39;s arm with years of expertise and skill.

As he finished, Granel looked at his hand in wonder. &quot;<strong>You are probably the first doctor to have looked at me in years, Dante. But this is excellent work. It&#39;s art-like. It&#39;d be a shame to remove it.</strong>&quot; The man said, trying to flex the fingers slightly. Dante&#39;s design allowed for excellent mobility, for the extent of the damage done. To make matters better, he did it with random laboratory objects.

Dante&#39;s search would find nothing. No blemishes. No scars. It was like Granel was in peak physical health. No, it was as if he had <em>never been harmed</em>. Granel coughed awkwardly as Dante continued his examination.

&quot;<strong>Lower abdomen. Right of the navel. I got struck by a Lancer&#39;s Noble Phantasm, and it has yet to heal. I believe that is still there, despite being there for a week. It&#39;s taking a surprisingly long time.</strong>&quot;

A <em>week</em> was a long time for something to heal? In what universe? Had Granel never suffered anything worse than a stubbed toe before?

“While even the strongest are needed, they’re useless if they can’t use a bandage. Remember that Granel, that is something I tell patients similar to you.”

<em>He hadn’t had much of a streak for bravery, but he did seem to take his job quite seriously. Dante stepped back see his handiwork, how Granel could easily move his hands and yet the bandages kept his wounds underneath them. He did well.</em>

“Well, I do not suggest going about such a lifestyle. . . You’re strong but still human. Unlike our servants. . . Our lives are still current.”

<em>Dante’s voice was almost an unblanketed truth, nothing could hide it. They were mortal, much like their servants when they were alive. However their servants now survived on mana, and nothing else could be done for them that the servants couldn’t live through. His attention shifted to the lower abdomen where he expected an injury to be, his eyes trained on the location as he thought of ways to address it.</em>

“A week? Has it healed or stayed stagnant? Have you used any sort of medical labs to treat yourself? A lancer servant doing this to you, you’d be insane to not go to a doctor immediately!”</span>

They were two sides of the same coin, each with the same task: protecting lives. Dante did it through healing people of their wounds, Granel took wounds in the place of others.

It was a strange sort of kinship, though not an unwelcome one. All Granel had was his physical might. He was not blessed with knowledge like Dante.

Except in this one scenario, that is.

&quot;<strong>Ha.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Hahahahaha! Mister Dante, you&#39;ve never seen me in action, have you?</strong>&quot; Granel laughed as Donald hovered over him like a fussy parent. If that were possible, of course. Granel towered substantially over Dante.

&quot;<strong>I suppose that makes sense. We never fought together, and I never got hurt on board the Canopus. There is no need to worry, Mister Dante. Allow me to explain:</strong>&quot;

Granel leaned towards Dante. He took a deep breath. &quot;<strong>I cannot die. </strong>&quot; The security guard unbuttoned his shirt. Aside from a corded and muscled frame, there was one thing that would send Dante&#39;s medical eye to DEFCON 1.

A metal spike, impaled through Granel&#39;s heart. Granel tapped it.

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s a Mystic Code, see.</strong>&quot;

What kind of Mystic Code made its user immortal?

Even after Saber fought Vortigern and we lost, it still took him days to recover! So, it matters not if you are built for the task, but to take care of oneself even after the task is done—“

<em>His words were getting faster, almost too fast to comprehend. He was quite passionate about his duty as a doctor, but it was so odd to know that outside of helping, that passion easily fizzled out like a drop of water on a hot plate. On one side, he was quite good as a doctor someone who could quell even the more fearful of patients in the operating rooms, on the other he was like a meek mouse he didn’t want to be caught in life’s traps. But, no matter what he had seen in hospitals, or in Nirvana with Vortigern, he didn’t exactly expect another person, a magus, no less, to admit he had gotten ahold of immortality. The doctor looked at the print and his face blanched.</em>

“Immortal? You’re immortal Granel? Almost like Vortigern!”

<em>Almost instinctively the doctor went closer to observe it, mentally measuring the location to see it was exactly where one’s heart should have been. Had he no way to physical live, but no way to die? He didn’t even know that was possible!</em>

“I’ve never met someone besides that being, a—and that woman, Rosemary who said they lived through death! But you, you can’t die either? You’re almost an anomaly, and through mystic code no less. . .”</span>

Plaster flaked off the ceiling, dust floating like fairies in the shafts of light that shone through the cracks in the wall-

<strong>&#39;Ack-&#39;</strong>

<em>&#39;-choo!&#39;</em> He sneezed, barely able to muffle the sound in his sleeve. Thankfully it did not travel far, courtesy of all the greens covering the walls like noise absorbing panels. Though this tiny stroke of luck hardly lifted his spirits: what he had just heard was not the voice of a beast, but that of a <em>man</em>.

No, scratch that, and make it <em>two</em> of them. Damned souls. Scavengers. Here to steal what he had worked so hard to possess. 

Quietly opening his blade, ▅▅▅▅▅▅ started placing his foot down lightly, rolling from heel to the balls of his feet as he approached the main lab. Shouldering the back entrance open just a crack, he peeked into the room, and saw a midget fussing over a hulking giant of a man, both of them seemingly fixated on something on the larger man&#39;s chest. 

He couldn&#39;t tell what it was they were looking at from the back, but what he did see was a perfect opportunity to strike. The element of surprise was on his side, and the <em>anchors</em> he&#39;d drooped all over the building...

He flexed his artificial circuits and located one just across the room, drawing a perfectly straight line from him to it with Granel caught in the middle. He lined up his knife with the large man&#39;s back, before pouring mana into the blade and letting it fly.

<em>ziiip!</em>

As if pulled by an invisible string, the knife&#39;s edge whistled in the air, finding its mark in Granel&#39;s back as it plunged deep into his flesh. Now he had two metal objects running through his chest, one on each side, and perfectly balanced. 

How great was that!

His black hair wasn&#39;t tied properly and reached halfway to his neck in wild, messy locks. He was dressed in a worn traveler&#39;s outfit that had definitely seen better days, though his eyes were bright and alert, and his body was upstanding and full of vigor. 

&#39;I won&#39;t repeat myself a second time. This here is my turf. You go get your own. Anywhere but here.&#39; He withdrew another knife from his belt and brandished it threateningly.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&quot;<strong>Excuse me?</strong>&quot; Granel cocked his head in surprise. Being compared to Vortigern wasn&#39;t what surprised the large man, but being compared to a woman who &#39;lived through death&#39;. That didn&#39;t sound right. When people were killed, they died. Was she a ghost? That didn&#39;t sound like living. &quot;<strong>There are GHOSTS on this island?</strong>&quot; Granel wasn&#39;t scared, but he couldn&#39;t exactly punch a ghost.

&quot;<strong>I&#39;ve heard that one before.</strong>&quot; Granel muttered at the word &#39;anomaly&#39;. He didn&#39;t like being compared to this so-called Vortigern. It meant he was similar to Koji, and Granel would rather choke on a bullet than be compared to someone like him. &quot;<strong>It&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. I think it is, anyway. It&#39;s very hard to test the different ways that something can kill you when you only live once. I&#39;m not a cat, Dante.</strong>&quot;

Granel had never actively tried out his power upon receiving it. It was just something that happened, like rain or a hot day. He would get shot, struck with lightning, and so on, and just didn&#39;t fall. A pretty sweet power.

But the spike made him sick. It was made from the corpses of friends. Was he using them as fuel? Granel never stopped thinking about that when he was shot. Could his immortality even run out? Would he be shot one day, and simply not recover?

Maybe this is what Lancer&#39;s curse did. Instead of shutting down Granel&#39;s healing, it made it sporadic. Weaker.

&quot;<strong>If you can cure the curse from a dead Servant&#39;s Noble Phantasm, be my gues—</strong>&quot;</span>

Years of experience flared up in Granel&#39;s body as he held Dante close to his body, facing away from the threat. The guard looked around, before noticing a glass lab set, filled with beakers and various other scientific instruments. He made a grab at it, and in a fluid motion, turned back towards the attacker.

&quot;<strong>NIRVANAN SCUM!</strong>&quot; Granel bellowed, before flinging it with the force of an all-star baseball pitcher.

It missed. Phooey.

Glass rained down on Anthony from Granel&#39;s haphazard throw. He hadn&#39;t blinked, and he had almost missed the projectile&#39;s speed. It would&#39;ve hurt like hell if it had landed. How many bones could it have shattered?

&quot;<strong>How long have you been here? Did you follow us? I&#39;ll rip you apart, filthy Nirvanan. Where is your Servant hiding? Let&#39;s get this over with. I&#39;ll take both you and your Servant on, and I&#39;ll <em>fucking win.</em></strong>&quot; Granel snarled as he stepped in front of Dante, hiding him from more knives.

“I meant that you’re something that no one sees every day! You’re no cat, but a person, I apologize if it came out rude. . . It definitely wasn’t my intention. . .”

<em>His voice went to its sheepish tenor, the quiet and yet only brave thing about him when it came to making mistakes. But fate had found him a way to redeem himself, he had said it was a curse? A cursing noble phantasm, and of a servant! Well it wouldn’t be easy but the doctor knew plenty of curses, and it so happened he was cursed as well!

“I—I think I can help you with your issue! We j—just need a small moment to prepare, but after that we shoul—“

<em>The sound of flesh being struck sent a chill down his spine, and soon another voice entered the room, it’s fervent sound alerting the doctor of the person’s appearance. He could only catch a glimpse of him before his body was tugged away by the Granel’s hold to be protected. However, unlike Granel’s blunt and dangerous threats, Dante had different words to say.</em>

“W—wait! We aren’t trying to fight, we didn’t know you were here! We didn’t know!”

<em>His cries shrilled for a moment, he wasn’t one to fight at all, he had told his own servant that! How was he to fight now and when Granel was mildly injured from the wounds he had?!</em></span>

That they came all the way out here to hunt him down.

And <em>they</em> had the audacity to call him scum.

<strong>&#39;The feeling&#39;s mutual, bud!&#39;</strong> He called out to them as he lurched for the nearest desk. His long arm swiped across the surface, causing its dusty contents to fly off in all directions. Papers, books, and apparatus scattered, haphazardly at first, but soon their trajectory changed. As if pulled by an invisible string, they flew towards the investigators in a jumbled mass, obfuscating their sight and disabling their aim.

Anthony ducked under the desk and slid out from the other end. He circled the investigators, making sure that there was always something between him and them - especially the large one, as he couldn&#39;t make heads or tails of his abilities. A spike and a knife through the chest and still breathing? Now that, was abnormal.

&#39;You know, I&#39;ve always wondered how long it&#39;d take for you to find me. Which part of the island did you guys hail from? Who are you working for? The <em>&quot;Holy Mother&quot;</em>?&#39; He flicked his knife back and forth, first at Granel, before settling on Dante, who looked much more susceptible to a knife wound or two. 

&#39;Don&#39;t lie to me,&#39; he accused Dante. &#39;<em>No one</em> ever comes through those doors if they can help it. You&#39;d either be a wild beast, think like one, or you&#39;ve been sent here on a mission to kill. Well have I got some bad new for you,&#39; his voice lowered to a growl, his eyes darkening perceptibly. &#39;If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;m good at-&#39;

No Nirvanan was going to spend time hunting for someone like him. Besides, why would you hunt someone down when their entire skillset was dedicated to not getting killed?

A flurry of thoughts ran through Granel&#39;s head as his view was obscured by a flurry of papers and office equipment.

To an experienced soldier, what was this but a gloried smokescreen? With careful steps that contrasted sharply with Granel&#39;s massive frame, he stepped in a circle around Dante, only barely keeping an eye on Anthony.

<strong>CRASH!</strong> The ceiling collapsed, and the files Granel was going to dig into were crushed under rubble. Wonderful. He&#39;d have to pick through rubble in the desperate hope for something good.

If this guy didn&#39;t escape first, anyway. Filthy Nirvanan. Overconfident magus.

&quot;<strong>What&#39;s a &#39;Holy Mother&#39;? Some sort of Nirvanan queen? What kind of shitty name is that? As if anything on this island could remotely be considered holy!</strong>&quot; Granel snapped amidst the fluttering off office supplies. 

&quot;<strong>Hold onto something, Mister Dante.</strong>&quot; Granel advised, before feeling magical energy bubble in his legs. With a firm <strong>slam</strong> of the foot, the walls rumbled, and the rubble that Anthony weaved between rolled out of place, causing him to stumble to the ground.

<strong>THUD!</strong> Granel grinned turned towards the noise. &quot;<strong>Gotcha.</strong>&quot; He rushed forward, leaving his fellow investigator to his own devices.

Legs flailing, he scrambled to get his feet under himself, but Granel was already across the room, heavy footfalls pounding the floor like thunderclaps as he charged towards the Nirvanan.

Anthony turned to look at him. There was no panic in his eyes. His lips quirked into a smile, a knowing kind of smile that made Granel feel as if he&#39;d just been caught in some carefully laid trap-

<strong>crack!</strong>

The floor gave way beneath the security guard&#39;s foot. His leg sank through the hole, catching on the hinge of his knee and making him fall splat on the floor.

&#39;Should&#39;ve looked at where you&#39;re going, big guy.&#39; Anthony stood at the top of the trash pile like a king, mere inches away from Granel&#39;s grasp. &#39;Unlike you, I know this place like the back of my hand, so fancy a tour?&#39; He teased as he skidded onto the floor, adding a few more cracks to the tiles around Granel&#39;s trapped leg, &#39;the basement is a pretty good place to start.&#39;

Dante&#39;s plea fell on deaf ears. Anthony scoffed at the doctor&#39;s words as he raided another desk, sending a few more books crashing into the latter&#39;s face.

&#39;Yeah, right,&#39; he said, disbelief coloring his voice. &#39;Like I&#39;ve never heard that one before. You the good cop then? Pretending to be some outsider to gain my trust? Let me guess, next you&#39;ll say you&#39;ve been sent here on a rescue mission to take me home! <em><strong>Hah!</strong></em>&#39;

All the laughter faded from his expression.

&#39;To hell with your mind games,&#39; he glowered. &#39;The last guy who tried to trick me has already become fertilizer for Rosemary&#39;s garden, all thanks to the <em>monster</em> that likes to roam this place. If you know what&#39;s good for you, you&#39;d go back the way you came before he comes back. There&#39;s nothing for you here.&#39;</span>

No magus would go out of their way to <em>dig</em> pit traps. There was an elegance to their egotism. They would rather send somebody up in a smoke with a fireball rather than use a gun. Why would they rely on a pitfall trap rather than something more deadly?

This man was crafty or desperate. Maybe both. His circuits weren&#39;t fried, either. All this confirmed what Anthony had said: he had been here for a long time.

&quot;<strong>How dare you! I&#39;m no animal! Do you think I&#39;m just gonna tear my own leg off to escape? Stupid Nirv—</strong>&quot;

Granel&#39;s eyes widened as Anthony rambled and spat. Wait. Wait Wait. That didn&#39;t add up. Granel was angry, but he was <em>not</em> stupid. A trick? Possibly, but he had to make sure.

&quot;<strong>—WAIT!</strong>&quot; Granel shouted, causing the floor cracks to widen through sound alone. &quot;<strong>Shut up. Shut up right <em>now</em>! I don&#39;t care about a monster. I&#39;ll kick its ass myself.</strong>&quot;

A rescue mission? Why would a Nirvana want to be rescued? Was he disillusioned from living on corrupted land? Maybe, but that wasn&#39;t in line with any of the Nirvanans Granel had met. That would mean the only type of person asking for release had to be...

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re from the second team...</strong>&quot; Granel said, awestruck. &quot;<strong>Quick.</strong>&quot; Granel said, as cracks began to form like latticework. &quot;<strong>What ship brought you here? What was it called? ANSWER ME!</strong>&quot;

He kept well away from Dante as he started moving back the way he came. Granel shouted after him, each syllable sending dust flying off the ceiling and onto his head, coating his dark hair in a muddy gray. Dust particles tickled his nostrils...

&#39;Dear god! You are loud!&#39; Anthony turned around with a grimace. &#39;Anyone ever tell <em>you</em> to shut...&#39;

&#39;...up.&#39; His hand froze halfway to the door handle. He opened his mouth, but no words came out. It seemed that Granel had successfully managed to short circuit him. 

That, or he was trying so very hard to process his words.

Eventually, he spoke.

&#39;You&#39;re nuts.&#39; His voice shook, though it was hard to tell whether it was out of excitement, or fear, or both. &#39;You&#39;re out of your mind. I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&#39; 

He clamped his mouth shut and yanked open the door, before stepping through and slamming it shut. The echo of footsteps grew faint as it traveled down the corridor...

...then returned, loud and fast, until Anthony burst through the door again, almost tearing it off its rusted hinges.

<strong>&#39;Bellerophon!&#39;</strong> He shouted furiously, his voice almost matching Granel&#39;s in volume. <strong>&#39;It&#39;s Bellerophon! And it&#39;s none of your goddamn business!&#39;</strong></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&quot;<strong>Bellerophon.</strong>&quot; Granel said, tasting the name. One of two children to spring from Medusa&#39;s decapitated corpse. Two children. Two. Suddenly, a flashback to the debriefing Granel had when he was originally hired for this job.

<em>There have been two separate expeditions to the Nirvana nature preserve: the [] and the Bellerophon. The latter was dispatched less than a year ago. Neither have returned.</em>

This man was unstable, and why wouldn&#39;t he be? He had been trapped here on an island that wanted him dead for a <em>year</em>. The fact that Anthony was still kicking was a testament to his ability to scurry around like a rat. Besides, according to <em>shshshsh&#39;s</em> diary, this land made people strange. What would extended exposure do to a man who watched his entire team get slaughtered?

He would bend, then break. Hopefully Anthony hadn&#39;t broken yet.

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s exactly my business. Now shut your mouth and let me think.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he felt the floor groan slightly. Where would this take him? Didn&#39;t Anthony mention the basement? The feeling of falling a floor down wasn&#39;t even a worry to Granel. He could heal, assuming Lancer&#39;s curse didn&#39;t bite his ass.

&quot;<strong>Listen to the doctor, we&#39;re from the third investigation team. If you&#39;re from the second, then that means...</strong>&quot; Granel swallowed. &quot;<strong>You must have a full year of information regarding Nirvana. Noteworthy Nirvanans, places of note, stashes, Servant records. You could be the key! We need to get you out of here. Back to your family, your friends, your...!</strong>&quot;

Granel took a deep breath, and his tone became conversational as his thoughts began to race.&quot;<strong>Also, how far down will I fall? I need to estimate my chances of surviving if I don&#39;t land on my head, see. Unless you can save me, of course.</strong>&quot;

<em><strong>CREEEEEEEEEEEEEAK!!!</strong></em> The floor groaned even more.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Dante&#39;s wide-eyed gaze irritated Anthony greatly.

&#39;I&#39;m not running, this is <em>my</em> place,&#39; he said angrily, despite having just stormed off a moment prior. He stifled a bark of laughter at the mention of a third investigation team, but Granel immediately followed up with the topic of evacuating the island once again, and he couldn&#39;t contain it anymore.

He laughed. The sound jarring but wonderful in his mouth.

&#39;Don&#39;t get too comfortable.&#39; He spat the sentence through gritted teeth, his fists clenched. &#39;It&#39;s been a year. I&#39;ve gone on living here for a whole year. When did you guys get here? A month? A week?&#39; He eyed Granel suspiciously. &#39;You don&#39;t even know about the &quot;Holy Mother&quot;, have you been living in a cave?&#39; He said, unaware of how ironic that sounded coming from him. He didn&#39;t even know about the third team until now! Who was the real caveman here?

But Anthony continued without a care. &#39;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting yourself into,&#39; he wagged his knife at the investigators. &#39;The things I&#39;ve seen. The things I&#39;ve experienced. You won&#39;t believe how...&#39;

&#39;...how...&#39;

His fingers fidgeted, itching for a pen, until he shoved them into the pockets of his coat. 

&#39;It&#39;s not that simple.&#39; He inhaled deeply, taking a second to mull over the thoughts in his head. &#39;No. That&#39;s not the issue.&#39; He shook his head, seemingly agitated by something. The fact that Granel and Dante were from the third investigation team did nothing to soothe his psyche. In fact, it seemed to be bothering him greatly, his eyes flitting between the two men with such watchfulness, as if suddenly aware that he was confined in a small space with two dangerous animals.

Eventually, he seemed to arrive at some conclusion.

It&#39;ll smell, but you&#39;ll get back up no problem. There&#39;s another exit in the basement. It&#39;ll lead you right to the swamps. You can build a raft and leave from there.&#39;

He fidgeted harder.

&#39;No one&#39;s going to keep tabs on you if you take the swamps. Hardly anyone goes. And the capybaras are nice.&#39; He took a step back as Dante inched forward, insistent on maintaining his personal space. &#39;Don&#39;t,&#39; he warned the doctor, jerking his knife towards the doors Granel had busted through. &#39;The exit is that way.&#39;</span>

Not that the idea disgusted him—rotting bodies were the worst—but dead bodies didn&#39;t faze him. He had seen more people die than Anthony had stable screws in his head.

That was to say, not many. That wasn&#39;t really an apt comparison, but there wasn&#39;t time to come up with a greater example.

&quot;<strong>Mister Dante, there is a non-zero percent chance that I will snap every bone in my legs. With my weight and luck, I&#39;ll probably smash through every bone on the way down.</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s tone was still conversational, but strained. It wasn&#39;t his normal tone in the field. Dante knew firsthand that Granel was emotional, but this was inconsistent with the current situation!

Then it clicked: <em>he was trying to keep his comrade calm</em>, as if he was simply telling Dante that he was going out for milk.

&quot;<strong>I will be back soon. Goodbye Dant—AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s pitch increased by several octaves as he fell into the abyss.

His first thought: <em>this wasn&#39;t like the movies</em>.

<strong>SNAP!</strong>

The second: pain.

It was as if someone had inserted a red-hot iron into his right leg, tearing bone, tendon, and muscle alike. The sensation was almost familiar, if the pain wasn&#39;t so <strong>annoying</strong>. It was hard to perceive it as anything but, after years in the field.</span>

Stop.

Dante&#39;s voice distracted him from this train of thought, for better or for worse. Granel didn&#39;t want to think about it. He didn&#39;t want to accept the implications. He <em>couldn&#39;t</em>.

&quot;<strong>I am fine, Dante. I&#39;ve shattered my tibia, and it feels like I&#39;ve cracked my fibula. Those will mend. Our friend&#39;s mind, hopefully. He requires more attention than me.</strong>&quot; 

Granel said as he attempted to rise, before grunting in pain. &quot;<strong>After I recover, of course. Afterwards, we&#39;re going out there. He mentioned an exit to the swamp? We are not taking that. That man needs our help, and I have some questions for him.</strong>&quot;

Granel said as he leaned against a pile of bodies. Goodness, the <em>smell</em>. It was as if someone vomited on battery acid mixed with rot. He would have to breath through his mouth.

Instinctively, Granel reached towards his pocket, and his blood ran cold.

<strong>The journal was gone.</strong>

Up on the floor to the lab, by Anthony&#39;s foot was a rotten journal that looked all too familiar...

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&#39;Help yourself to the door then.&#39; Anthony replied to Dante with barely leashed civility. He didn&#39;t seem to be all-together mentally. Was it the months of solitude doing him in, or was there something else at work?

Dante hardly had any time to finish his assessment. With a shuddering <em>CRACK</em>, the floor collapsed under Granel&#39;s weight, taking both investigators with them as darkness swallowed them whole. They fell through the floor...

<strong>CRASH!</strong>

...and touched down on a bed of moss and rotten flesh. Yuck. 

Granel had it worse than the doctor. His well-built frame worked against him, being more of a burden than a cushion as he felt his leg shatter under his own weight. Dante really had his work cut out for him.

But that wasn&#39;t even the worst of it. As Granel regained his bearings, he realized that he had left the main floor of the lab with fewer possessions than he&#39;d started out with: not only had he failed to grab any lab papers before Anthony dropped a chunk of the ceiling on them, his pocket also felt lighter than usual. Where was that blasted-

&#39;Where&#39;d you get this?&#39;

Anthony&#39;s voice rang from above, laden with surprise. His silhouette appeared over the edge of the hole, sending dust and gravel down into the basement as he bent down to pick up the journal that had fallen out of Granel&#39;s pocket. He dusted off the cover.

There was a momentary silence.

Then it stretched on. And on. Only the sound of pages flipping could be heard. Anthony stood rooted to the spot, his face unreadable as he perused the journal that had led Granel on this wild goose chase. He remained quiet, uncharacteristically so, but perhaps that reaction - or lack thereof - would shed more light than his erratic behaviors from before.

<em>rrrriiiiiiiiiiip</em>

Bits of paper fluttered down the hole, before falling to the grimy floor like some flat, grubby snow. 

&#39;What a load of crap.&#39; 

Anthony commented offhandedly as he tore out page after page from Granel&#39;s hard-earned clue. There was no remorse in his voice. Perhaps, a hint of anger that had long since boiled beneath the surface. 

&#39;Should&#39;ve burned it a long time ago.&#39; He muttered in disdain, as if he were talking about the work of some heretic.</span>

Anything could have been better than the silence of the basement they’d been sucked into. However, something peculiar began. . . Not many would have been able to see such a thing, but the doctor’s arm glew a lively color, the mark over its ashen color beaming a bright purple. Clearly, these words were not for show but rather something important.</em>

<em>He didn’t know exactly what this curse was, but it was a curse nonetheless. He’d been cursed, his family cursed too, and they specialized in them regardless of the damage done to them. No curse was safe from him touch, not servant nor magus. . . Unless you were the one that had given him this curse before the great flood.

His bones and muscles reknitted as if they had never been broken, good as new. Only a user of Magecraft could accomplish something like this.

But only a man with a good heart would invest energy into learning Magecraft like this.

&quot;<strong>Thank you, Mister Dante.</strong>&quot; Granel breathed, fully healed and raring to go. It was as if a weight had been taken from his shoulders. He felt <em>good</em>, something he hadn&#39;t truly felt since landing on this island. If only Donald was here to share in the moment.

If only he and Dante weren&#39;t sitting on a mound of the damned. Yeah, they were dead. They were all messed up.

Not as messed up as Anthony, evidently. As Granel&#39;s eyes adjusted to the dark, he felt sprinkles of paper dust his head and shoulders. Paper he recognized from hours of incessant turning of the pages. His clue, his glimpse into Nirvanan life... It was being mauled before his eyes.

He wanted to rage. He wanted to smash the foundations of the lab until Anthony came crashing down into the same pit that he and Dante were confined to. He had to pay for this. Why was he actively hindering the investigation? This stiff resistance... This illogical reasoning...

Think later. Act now.

&quot;<strong>That&#39;s fine, Dante.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted loudly, enough for Anthony to hear. &quot;<strong>It&#39;ll take a while for me to heal, anyway.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he took off his jacket, and placed it on the shoulders of a corpse next to him. It was dark in the pit, but the color was bright enough that it could just barely be seen by someone looking down into the pit.</span>

Granel stood up, muscles ripping. He beckoned Dante close, and whispered into his ear. &quot;Dante. Keep talking to him. Stay here.&quot;

With that, Granel saw the outline of a doorway. Not the one mentioned by Anthony, that would lead to the swamp, but back into the lab. Perhaps there was a stairway? Now that he knew that this was a workshop, Granel had to be extremely careful. Especially against one of Anthony&#39;s temperament. 

He moved slowly and deliberately, hoping to avoid traps, disappearing into the darkness of the lab, leaving Dante alone.

There were no more pages to rip. No more words to read. Because he&#39;d read them all and they didn&#39;t mean what they had used to. And when those very same words were no longer worth reading, what then?

A moment of tranquility came over him. Anthony ran his fingers along the piece of soft leather in his hand, which was the only thing that remained of the journal. The pages had all been torn and joined the investigators down in the basement. With time, they would decay into organic matter and become nutrients for the greenhouse&#39;s plants.

With a sigh, Anthony looked down over the edge of the hole...

<strong>&#39;Why haven&#39;t you left yet?!&#39;</strong> His anger flared up again at the sight of the investigators&#39; silhouettes struggling against the pile of corpses. &#39;With all those cushions you&#39;ve got down there, a fall from this height could hardly kill. Do you need some help getting up?&#39;

He raised his hand and made a throwing motion. Dante heard a wet popping sound next to him as a knife came spinning through the air, before lodging itself into a corpse under his butt. 

Immediately, the corpse started to move. Not in a zombie-like fashion, but as a lump of rotten meat that seemed to be pulled along an invisible trajectory. At first, it pushed upwards, forcing Dante onto his feet in his feeble state. Then the trajectory changed, and the corpse started heading towards the Granel dummy, as if trying to rouse it from its &#39;slumber&#39;.

If Dante didn&#39;t do anything soon, Granel&#39;s cover would be blown in <em>three, two...</em></span>

They’d have to taken him. . . Be it on his own will, or by force itself. And so, under the darkness they had, Granel had made himself a dummy, something Dante would need to act as if it were the real breathing person. He would try, but he didn’t know the result of it.</em>

<em>Anthony’s question was returned with a panicked sound Dante made, a mixture between a squeal and a cry. He had to think of something, he wasn’t much to give a good lie, but he could think of something right? Even when the Real Granel had left to venture up once again. Dante cleared his throat, trying to make the worry in his voice fade away like the curse he had just broken on Granel.</em>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Granel moved through the laboratory with such smooth precision that it would make a Genevan soldier blush in envy. This was now serious business. He was in combat with a magus in an urban environment. Memories from his time as a police officer flooded back. It had been a day just like this when he had became immortal.

Upon reaching a doorway, Granel picked up any random piece of debris—he had accumulated a large quantity of bone fragments from Anthony&#39;s death pit—before tossing it into the doorway, hoping to trigger traps. Anthony was unstable, and as such, had to be viewed as an enemy. He would incapacitate him, if possible.

If that failed, Anthony would have to die.

The thought didn&#39;t surprise Granel as much as it should&#39;ve. His emotions felt inconsistent. Riled, yet dampened. He had killed people before. It was part of the job. Why was this to be any different?

<em>He&#39;s an investigator. You don&#39;t need to kill him</em>

<em>He destroyed evidence. He&#39;s in direct violation of the contract.</em>

<em>He&#39;s been through a lot! It&#39;s not his fault.</em>

<em>He could destroy a clue that could lead to Nirvana&#39;s schematics, meaning this was all worthless and the Canopus crew died for nothing.</em>

With that in mind, he elected to kill the <s>investigator</s> Nirvanan.

Murderers. Murderers. Murderers. Anthony was in their way. He was part of the problem. Part of this inhospitable world that refused to accept the investigation team&#39;s mission.

Scum. Scum. Scum. Scum. Scum. Killing should be avoided. Granel&#39;s job was to protect people. Not to harm. He had left behind his days of violence and carnage.

Yet the land fed on Granel&#39;s hatred for the unavenged, for the injustice of Nirvana. It fed on him, and it seeped into his bones slightly.

And thus he climbed the stairs towards the ground floor. Towards Anthony.

Towards the answer of this question.

What did it mean to be Nirvanan?

He will die there, just like the rest of them.&#39; Anthony said, as though the decision were the most natural thing in the world. &#39;You&#39;ve already committed a grave sin anyway. It will matter little if you commit another one.&#39;

He tossed the journal cover down the hole, a piece of worn leather that smelled faintly of sweat, leather oil, and dust. A remnant of a past that felt like a another life. But here, now, in this abandoned lab he had called home since, he had finally been set free. 

&#39;I suppose I owe you a favor now for bringing me <strong>my old journal</strong>.&#39; He watched Dante wrestle the lump of dead meat, half annoyed and half amused. &#39;If you can&#39;t even best my magecraft, what makes you think you can take on that monster? That&#39;s right, his name is Vortigern. That&#39;s what that William bastard calls him too-&#39;

He froze. Alarms rang in his head as he felt the tripwires he had set up in the basement snapping one by one. Another intruder had entered the lab!

Immediately, Anthony threw himself on the floor and pressed his ear against it. He couldn&#39;t discern the precise location of his tripwires unless he was in their vicinity, but several of them had been tripped at once, which meant their newest intruder was either huge, or fast, or both.

<strong>&#39;Shut up!&#39;</strong> He snapped at Dante. &#39;Stop talking!&#39; He lowered his voice to a hiss. &#39;There&#39;s something down there. You hear anything?&#39;

He hadn&#39;t realized that Granel had been the one to trigger his alarms. Dante had made a good show of defending the dummy, making him believe that the security guard had never left. 

But oblivion worked both ways. Unfortunately, Dante had no idea how Anthony&#39;s magecraft worked either, and Anthony was scaring the living daylights out of Dante by warning him against some unforeseen danger.

&#39;Stay still.&#39; He whispered into the hole with fake concern, his eyes trained onto the whites of Dante&#39;s lab coat. Slowly, quietly, he lined up his third shot...</span>

“N—No! I won’t leave him to die, I wouldn’t do that to anyone!”

<em>He said back, hoping that the real Granel would have been close by now. . . He was coming impatient, anymore waiting and he’d have likely known that they just refused to move! He had to keep him there, at least till Granel could go about it. That was his job, he had to do his job! His insulting questions made the doctor feel a twinge of pain. No matter what he was doing, it seemed the man just wasn’t cooperating with them, but even in his insults he gave answers needed. So his name to him was Vortigern, and someone named William. . . Had associated himself with him. William? He hadn’t even heard of such a name. Was that a master? A servant? A nirvanan?</em>

<em>Dante was going to ask another question when he was told to stay silent and then cursed with the idea that something had been down there with him. That. . . That couldn’t have been right, right? Granel had left to go up and capture this man. . . But could something also be down there? The idea of it being a non-zero percent was unnerving, even if it was simply his teammate causing these conversations to go about this way.</em></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">As Anthony became extremely intimate with the floor, he felt more and more of his strings snap on the ground floor. He couldn&#39;t determine what the object was, either. Even if he could, it wouldn&#39;t help. A pen snapped a string. A paper, another. 

Granel himself snapped several that he was unaware of, not that it mattered.

<em>Snap.</em>

<em>Snapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnapsnap</em>

More and more strings tore and broke in the lab. Each one was closer and closer to Anthony than the last. Something was coming from the door he had entered from. 

The former investigator&#39;s mind raced. Did he run now? Kill Dante first, before leaving the body to Vortigern? What about the big guy? Did Anthony kill him too to be safe?

All it took was a moment of indecision. After a moment, Anthony elected to throw the knife. One moment too late. Outside the door that Anthony entered from...

<em>snap</em>

<strong>CRASH!</strong>

The wall next to Anthony cracked and broke apart, raining plaster on top of the former investigator. Standing before him, shirtless, with a cruel iron spike stabbed through the heart:

Granel.

Without even a word, he grabbed Anthony by the neck and hoisted him up like a kitten being held by the scruff of the neck. However, this was not a playful gesture. It was emotionless, cruel, and brutal. This wasn&#39;t some graceful fight. This man was not the individual who had been relatively polite in the face of adversary, or the man who wept tears of joy upon seeing one of his fellow team members.

His eyes flicked to the knife in Anthony&#39;s hand. &quot;<strong>What were you doing with that knife?</strong>&quot;</span>

How long had his comrades been on this island, working to retrieve Nirvana&#39;s schematics and get a confirmation on the fate of the Bellerophon&#39;s crew?

Over a week, and it felt like years.

Yet this man... This <em>investigator</em> actively destroyed clues that Granel had worked his ass off to fine. Inconsiderate, scornful, disgusting. No human would not actively sabotage the work of others, for no logical reason.

Ergo, Anthony was Nirvanan. To the core.

Granel just wanted to protect his coworkers, his <em>friends</em>. He failed back in the force, and he had failed on the Canopus.

He would not fail here.

And so he squeezed.

&quot;Why?&quot; Granel whispered as he crushed Anthony&#39;s windpipe. &quot;Why are you people like this? Why would you tear up that person&#39;s journal? It wasn&#39;t a threat to you. I just want to get my men off this island with our contract fulfilled...&quot;

He squeezed harder.

&quot;and yet.&quot;

Squeeze.

&quot;<strong>You people keep getting in my way.</strong>&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">How na&#239;ve the doctor had been. Anthony pitied him, as he couldn&#39;t fathom how Dante had been able to survive until now with such an inexperienced mind. He had witnessed mages teleport out of wormholes, Servants emerging from walls and shadows. Magecraft. Servant abilities. There were endless ways to enter a building without having to go through a conventional entrance. Whether a swamp or an inferno lay at the other end of it mattered very little.

In that moment, Anthony was grateful to have met the doctor. Fear had clouded Dante&#39;s better judgment, making him vulnerable, the perfect decoy for whoever had decided to grace-

<em>The ground floor?</em>

The tripwire that had just snapped right now, it hadn&#39;t come from the basement. The faint thudding of the footsteps, the slight tremor in the ground...

<em>Snap!</em>

Anthony jerked his head up, his eyes wide with alarm as he felt another wire snap dangerously close to him, close enough for him to tell that the intruder was outside the room, with nothing but a wall and a few desks between them and him. Why had they decided to come up? Dante had been raising a huge ruckus downstairs, why had he been ignored?

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Plaster and debris rained down on him. Eyes wild with alarm, Anthony rolled out of the way, his arms instinctively going up to protect his head-

From behind the rubble emerged a giant shadow. It sprang upon him at once, and before he knew it, hands were on him in a flash, digging into his neck and hoisting him off his feet. He hung there choking. He looked into the cold eyes of his executioner, and realized his mistake.

A rookie mistake.

Frantically, he activated one of his remaining anchors in the room. Granel felt a pull from within his body. As though attracted by a strong magnet, Anthony&#39;s first knife, which had been impaled deep into his flesh, began to pull itself out of his chest.

<em>CRACK</em>

Deep lines crawled along his skin, forming a web around the knife wound, like fissures during an earthquake running through soil. Piece by piece, his skin and flesh crumbled and fell to the floor, until the right side of his chest was hollowed out and oozing blood like a fountain.

For a moment, relief washed over Anthony. But soon that elation turned into horror as he realized that Granel was still standing, and the pressure on his windpipe kept building. 

Anthony began to thrash wildly. He brought his arm up, burying his third knife into Granel&#39;s hand. Twisting, grinding the bones in his fingers, trying to break free.

&#39;Fool!&#39; He croaked, his words coming out garbled and crushed. &#39;That journal belongs to me!&#39; He sank the tip of the knife into the knuckle of Granel&#39;s ring finger, severing a tendon. &#39;You&#39;ve been tracing my steps, and look where it got you!&#39;

He desperately clawed at the arm choking him. 

&#39;I warned you,&#39; He gasped. &#39;I warned you not to come. That journal,&#39; his nails dug into Granel&#39;s flesh, leaving streaks of blood running down his arm, &#39;this place, belongs to me.&#39;

<strong>&#39;Don&#39;t take it away from me.&#39;</strong>

He clutched Granel&#39;s hand as his eyes beseeched him through tears of pain.</span>

In the end, Granel Mason wanted to save people.

He was not blessed with the power to work miracles. He was not a great mind capable of solving the problems of the world. He was no great hero of old, capable of inspiring others from beyond the grave. He was simply human.

A human can only protect other humans. This is the reality of the world. Those who were greater became something more. They embodied something greater, and their values were something brighter than the muck around them.

But Granel was human, so he protected other humans. He saved their lives, fought the battles nobody else could fight, and survived wounds without as much as a scar. He knew he could not protect every person, but he still tried.

He failed, over and over again.

How many investigators had died here? How many could he have protected? Have saved? If he had been on the first two investigations, could they have ended differently? 

<em>I should have taken the job offer sooner.</em>

But he hadn&#39;t, and now he was here. He was a man singlehandedly focused on protecting his comrades, while violently opposing the people who threatened them.

<em>Nirvanans.</em>

They had killed the last two teams. There was no other way. It was them, and it was something Granel had wholeheartedly accepted when viewing the reports on Nirvana during his debriefing. 

<em>Nirvanans.</em>

What cruel monsters were they? They didn&#39;t even give the investigators time to leave! They could&#39;ve forced them to leave somehow. There had to be a way?</span>

&quot;<strong>I don&#39;t know.</strong>&quot; Granel muttered as he crushed the life out of Anthony.

There was only one way it could end. An investigator who had abandoned all hope of rescue had gone mad. Anthony had abandoned hope, through his own choices, and had become an enemy to his comrades. He had chosen this, and he would have to die.

<em>Nirvanans.</em> 

What did that word mean again?

Enemies. They were people who opposed the investigators for no clear reason. Foes that refused to give required information to the Investigation Team. People who became monsters of their own free will.

<em>&quot;That journal belongs to me!&quot;</em>

Granel&#39;s hand slipped in surprise, before squeezing harder, causing spots to appear in Anthony&#39;s eyes. Yet a flash of recognition appeared in Granel&#39;s flat expression.

This was the author? What had happened to him? Suddenly, a light flashed in Granel&#39;s mind. A memory clawing its way to the surface, past the wrath and scorn.

<em>Don&#39;t you ever try to come to Nirvana. This place is mine. Ours.</em>

&quot;<strong>WHY?</strong>&quot; Granel gasped, as if he was on the verge of tears. &quot;<strong>You were...</strong>&quot;</span>

<em>Nirv▅an.</em>

How did someone go from the man in the early days of the journal to the wreck currently dying in Granel&#39;s grasp? How did one fall that far? How did one become a complete and utter wreck?

Nir▅▅▅.

The journal. The journal. Thejournalthejournalthejournalthejourn—

Wasn&#39;t this land supposedly cursed? Wasn&#39;t Granel wondering about this back with Donald? Those times were only a few days ago, but to Granel, they felt like months. Years. 

▅ir▅▅▅.


Something shifted within Granel, deep in his heart. He hated violence. He hated doing this. This wasn&#39;t correct. This wasn&#39;t supposed to be happening.

Granel Mason was supposed to save people.

▅▅▅▅▅.

What did that word mean again?

As Anthony begged for his life, and Granel held someone&#39;s life in his hands, fueled by a storm of conflicting emotions that he didn&#39;t even truly understand, it clicked:

The word meant nothing. It was a simple label for his hatred towards his foes. He wanted to protect people, and so people who harmed others became his enemies. He had envisioned Nirvanans as scum, inhuman monsters.

But as Anthony begged, Granel realized that this was not the case. By his own definition, if Anthony was Nirvanan, he would be inhuman. Yet he wept for his home, even if that home was misplaced.

The word for Nirvanan collapsed under its own definition. As Granel&#39;s gaze shifted to Dante&#39;s expression, his heart shifted, and memories resurfaced. Enemy, friend, and Servant alike had said the same thing:</span>

<em><strong>When you try to kill and maim people of this island, everything is just fine. But one of your own mates dies, everybody loses their minds!</strong></em>

<em><strong>Tell me, do you believe in an eye for an eye? You told me that you preferred using fists, but it seems to me like you&#39;re more inclined to jump the gun.</strong></em>

Granel was everything he claimed the locals to be. As such, he wept. &quot;<strong>I could never take it from you.</strong>&quot; He whispered.

<strong>Thud.</strong>

Anthony fell to the floor in a heap, gasping for air. Granel made no attempts to pursue the former investigator. He simply stood, blinking as he cried.

There was something wrong with this island. It was indiscriminate in its victims. First, the natives. Then, Anthony. Finally, for a moment, Granel.

So he took a seat next to Anthony, held his head in his hands, and wept for a long time.

He crawled to his knees, his vision dimming, his strength failing. He fell onto his back, and the sensation of drowning intensified. 

The front of his shirt was warm. Anthony touched it, and his hand returned red and glistening. His hands shot to his neck, feeling around it, and touched something straight and narrow sticking out from the front of his neck.

It was his knife. Granel had released him, and he fell on his own knife, impaling himself with it. 

Had karma finally caught up with him? Was he being punished for succumbing to a momentary weakness, for begging mercy from his enemy? He&#39;d vowed to be strong. He&#39;d promised to rely on no one. But in the end, he couldn&#39;t become like <em>him</em>.

He couldn&#39;t...

He promised...

&#39;Ri...der.&#39; Garbled sounds crawled out of his throat. With trembling fingers, Anthony grabbed his knife and tried to pull it out. The act agitated his wounds. He could feel blood gushing out even more rapidly than before, dyeing his shirt and pooling on the floor beneath him.

His eyes flitted to the investigators. His lips moved, a raspy, hollow voice came out, almost unintelligible against Granel&#39;s sobbing. &#39;Gauze.&#39; He wheezed, pressing his hand against his neck wound. A warm light began to glow under it, a gentle stir of mana in the air as he tried to suppress the bleeding with magecraft.

But it wasn&#39;t enough. Whatever Anthony had specialized in, healing was not his forte. He coughed, spitting out more blood that threatened to choke him. 

&#39;Gauze.&#39; He gasped again, his face growing pale.</span>

What did Granel do now? The realization he had reached was not a happy one. All such a realization did was bring him sadness and misery. He was a hypocrite and a monster.

&quot;...<em>granel</em>.&quot; A far away voice echoed, as if coming from a long corridor. It was quiet, too. Maybe it wasn&#39;t real. Maybe he could ignore it. Maybe it would go away. He didn&#39;t want to be looked at. He didn&#39;t want to be seen. He didn&#39;t want to be—

&quot;<em>Granel.</em>&quot;

*I know. You don&#39;t have to remind me. I know what I&#39;ve done is wrong. I know my character is compromised. Please, just let me sit here.

&quot;<strong>GRANEL!</strong>&quot; 

Eyes flickered open as Granel raised his head, looking towards Dante and Anthony. He saw Dante desperately trying to save the man Granel himself had maimed. He couldn&#39;t bear to look at Anthony&#39;s face.

And yet...

He wanted to protect people, his friends and comrades. Anthony was, by extension of their similar jobs, a comrade. Temporarily, at least.

&quot;<strong>Right.</strong>&quot; Granel&#39;s voice rattled, before he lifted his massive frame. &quot;<strong>We shall protect this man, Mister Dante. We shall protect him from death.</strong>&quot;

Each step ached, but he took it, running around the lab, gathering various supplies. He didn&#39;t know what he was grabbing, but if it looked vaguely useful, it ended up in his grasp. He unceremoniously dumped a pile of vaguely useful items next to Dante, before holding Anthony&#39;s neck.

&quot;<strong>Yes, at once. Hurry, Dante. I know my own strength. He will not last without your assistance.</strong>&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Anthony continued to shake, a combination of fear, blood loss, and massive jolts of adrenaline. The healing magecraft he&#39;d been applying to his wound was elementary at best. Despite the pressure the investigators applied to his neck, blood seeped through the fabric, staining it red.

The sight was horrific. Granel was used to saving lives. Taking bullets for his clients, punching the lights out of his enemies, that sort of thing. But right now, his fists failed him. He had nowhere to use his brute strength, as the dressing of Anthony&#39;s wound required accuracy and delicacy, neither of which he possessed in his frazzled state of mind.

To him, it seemed that Anthony was at the end of his road. He continued to pressure the wound, but the bleeding hadn&#39;t stopped, and his hands were slick with the former investigator&#39;s blood. Was he really helping? Was there even a point? He had long forgotten what it was like to heal. Heal normally, that is, as his body had long ceased to be human.

But Anthony stubbornly held on. Like a cockroach that refused to die, he took one wheezing breath after another, even though the process was strenuous, nearly suffocating, and seemed to cause him immense pain. He tried to stay still as Dante added more fabric over the blood-soaked bandages. He held onto their words as he channeled more and more mana into his healing. 

After what felt like eons, after Dante had nearly exhausted every suitable piece of fabric he could get his hands on, the out layer of dressing over Anthony&#39;s neck was finally able to stay dry and unblemished. He spat out another mouthful of blood, which was mostly dark with blood clots. It seemed that his bleeding had stabilized.

But what of his psyche?

Anthony touched his neck, feeling the layers of dressing held firmly over his wound. He opened his mouth, and hesitated for a moment.

You are sick, and are free to live life to the fullest.</strong>&quot; Granel said, voice booming from behind Dante. He blinked once, before shifting awkwardly. Eventually, he sighed. &quot;<strong>If you deem that this is how you want to live your life, I cannot change your mind. You will remain here.</strong>&quot;

It was phrased like an order, as if Anthony would consider leaving the lab on his own accord anyway. Old habits died hard.

&quot;<strong>I will be blunt: you are in our debt. I may have harmed you, but because of us, at this moment, you are alive.</strong>&quot;

With that declaration, Granel&#39;s eyes caught the impression of a book in Anthony&#39;s pocket. The man loved to keep journals. Truly, old habits died hard. Granel reached down and pulled it out of the former investigator&#39;s pocket.

And his lung promptly fell out.

&quot;<strong>Oh, right.</strong>&quot; Granel said breathily, looking down into the hole in his chest made by Anthony. Slowly but surely, it began to hiss, knitting flesh and bone back together.

It looked like it hurt like hell, but Granel never complained.

&quot;<strong>Hm.</strong>&quot; Granel murmured, flipping through the journal. Lots of plants. &quot;<strong>Last question: you called out your Servant&#39;s name. They must be long gone. I&#39;ve read your journal. You know they&#39;re dead, in your heart of hearts. Yet you called on them to save you.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>That is commendable. He must have been quite the hero to move you. Who was he?</strong>&quot;

Unknown to Granel, this was one of the biggest questions of all.

He glared at the security guard.

&#39;I owe you <em>nothing</em>,&#39; he said reproachfully, his hand flying up to intercept Granel from stealing his journal...only to receive a handful of <em>lung</em> fresh off the security guard. 

&#39;...&#39;

Anthony was stunned. He squeezed the organ, speechless, giving Granel plenty of time to examine his spoils. Anthony looked back and forth between the two investigators, as if noticing for the first time how utterly ridiculous these intruders were.

A doctor who looked as frail as a leaf, and an immortal man with a spike for a heart. They were practically perfect for each other, which unfortunately spelled bad news for him. 

He could pop all the traps in the building and still wouldn&#39;t be able to kill either of them.

&#39;You are vultures. Both of you.&#39; He muttered in disbelief. &#39;Why don&#39;t you ask me to fix you something to eat too? Doesn&#39;t mean that I will,&#39; he added quickly, pulling himself up and away from Granel&#39;s thieving hands until his back leaned against something solid. A desk. 

He absentmindedly massaged his neck as he watched the investigators flip through his journal. &#39;I don&#39;t know what you want with William and Vortigern, and frankly, I don&#39;t care. But if I were you, I&#39;d be running in the other direction soon as I seen them, and count myself very lucky if I got away. These two are always together. Vortigern is William&#39;s Servant-&#39;

He held up his hands, as if to quiet them.

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">&#39;-I know what you&#39;re going to say. William Shakespeare, a Servant, summoned another Servant? Absurd, right? But my eyes don&#39;t lie. Vortigern follows William around like a dog, always screaming about some Rowena that playwright promised to find for him. They&#39;d bicker, and Vortigern would end up tearing a few walls down, not unlike your friend there-&#39; he shivered a bit, remembering how Granel had almost buried him under rubble.

&#39;They&#39;d come here to spend the night on Saturdays. Never missed a single week. I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on them so that I know when it&#39;s time to make myself scarce.&#39; 

Anthony sounded quite confident. His journal seemed to corroborate his claim as well, as Granel found a few pages on the back that were full of dates and times. 

<em>February 7, 2105. 7pm.</em>
<em>January 31, 2105. 4pm.</em>
<em>January 24, 2105. 6pm.</em>
<em>...</em>

The list went on and on, the dates going all the way back to April 14, 2103. The date coincided with that of the second investigation team&#39;s disappearance, as well as the last few entries of Anthony&#39;s old journal. Things were falling into place.

&#39;I&#39;ve seen William glue papers to Vortigern&#39;s wings, and his mana signature would skyrocket. What happens after that, I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care, because I&#39;ll already be far away by then.&#39; He admitted easily. &#39;I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t have a death wish.&#39;

He looked at Dante and shrugged. &#39;I can&#39;t heal like your buddy there. And I&#39;ve lost my Servant. A long time ago, you see. But Rider,&#39; He made a soft humming sound, as if remembering something fondly. &#39;If Rider were here, he&#39;d singlehandedly smite them down. Neither of them would stand a chance-&#39;</span>

His sense of timing had rarely failed him, be it when it came to gardening or keeping track of the events outside. Of course, outside elements were beyond his expertise. Deep down, he was still cursing himself. Cursing himself for falling into such a rough pile of trouble. Hating himself for being cornered by two bumbling, yet powerful, idiots. It was like a mouse being at the mercy of a playful cat.

If only he still had Rider with him.

<em><strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em>

Once that drum shattering shriek reached his ears, Anthony&#39;s blood froze as he remembered that even he could make mistakes at once. Even the most pristine flower could wilt in a lapse of care. Just like that, even the timely schedule that he had gotten used to could be broken by just one odd day.</span>

The tripwires he&#39;d set up all over the building picked up a mana signature so strong that a few of them melted away before they&#39;d been caught.

He knew that feeling. It was an alarm that never betrayed him when danger was near. And there was only ever one presence that could cause such a reaction from the wires he had set up in the lab.

<em><strong>&#39;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&#39;</strong></em>

The scream made Anthony&#39;s blood run cold. He jerked towards the direction of the scream, just in time to witness the lab&#39;s well-insulated walls crumble for the second time of the day. The intruder barged in, reeking of rot and decay, and turned towards the (former) investigators with their swords held up.

&#39;No...&#39;

Anthony&#39;s eyes went wide with fear. &#39;It can&#39;t be!&#39; He groaned, hands shaking openly in his lap. &#39;You aren&#39;t supposed to be back for another four days!&#39; 

He scrambled to get up, but fear tangled his legs. He fell on his butt, tried to scoot away, and succeeded for a few feet. Then his back touched the wall, and his escape was brought up short.

&#39;S-stay back!&#39; He stammered, breaking out in cold sweat as Vortigern pointed their sword at him. His eyes flitted to the investigators. &#39;Take them instead!&#39;</span>

Some dates were written in a pristine font, while others, namely, the ones where Vortigern had made an appearance early, were frenzied, as if they were penned during a panic attack.

As he prepared to read more of Anthony&#39;s private logs, the line about William got his attention. He snapped the book shut, and the sound reverberated through the lab.

&quot;<strong>That&#39;s absurd! Servants don&#39;t follow Servants. Maybe they&#39;re allied. Maybe their <em>Masters</em> are allied.</strong>&quot; Granel scratched his chin thoughtfully. Anthony said this had been happening for years. If William or Vortigern had Masters, surely they&#39;d have mentioned them during conversation, and Anthony would&#39;ve picked up.

They&#39;d have to take his word as truth. For now.

&quot;<strong>Your Rider... The schema—</strong>&quot;

<strong>CRASH!</strong> The wall came down, and Granel got his first look at this supposed &#39;Vortigern&#39; that had shaken Dante and Anthony to their very cores.

He did not disappoint.

Granel had towered over every person he had met on both Nirvana and on the Canopus. Even among Servants, Granel was massive. He had only been towered over thrice in his adult life.

This made it a fourth.

He took a step back, then two. He wasn&#39;t even focused on Granel or Dante, but Anthony. Even with him looking the other way, Granel felt like a nervous wreck. He took a rattling breath, and then towards Dante.

Dante... He had to be strong for his comrade in arms.

And Anthony. The former investigator was going to die. Even if he was absolutely out of his mind, he was still a person under the contract of the Bellerophon. Meaning Granel was obligated to protect him as well.

But he would&#39;ve done it anyway.</span>

He turned towards the Canopus doctor and blinked. &quot;<strong>Run.</strong>&quot; He told Dante, before pushing him into the pit, relying on the corpses to cushion the fall.

After that, he turned to Vortigern, and took a hasty breath, and...

&quot;<em><strong>UUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</strong></em>&quot;

...screamed in his face.

The sound was <em>loud</em>. It was the loudest Granel&#39;s vocal cords could manage, and even attempting to match Vortigern in a shouting contest left him out of breath. The Berserker would <em>have</em> to turn to face him.

And that was what he was betting on. As Vortigern turned to face where the sound originated from, Granel ran behind Vortigern, snatched up Anthony like a kitten.

&quot;<strong>I should kick your ass for trying to throw me and Dante under the bus.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted as he hoisted Anthony over his shoulder, before making a beeline for the pit and jumping in.

He was almost tempted to comment his with these vultures, he had a chance at life again, but chose to stay quiet. The time he waited for was here.  William. . . William and Vortigern, Together? He didn’t even know who this William was, but supposedly, he was a servant himself. That. . . Went against the laws of how a relationship of servant and master was to go. Against it all. Dante was quick to nod at Granel’s observation. Servants couldn’t become masters. Masters couldn’t become servants.</em>

“He’s right, are you sure you’re being honest. . ? And if this William is helping vortigern, does that he could also be the reason why he was able to revive himself? He managed to come back from a beam like Saber’s. . . Then it’d either be his master or William providing help, but from what you say, William alone is able to cause such feats to him so it’s safe to assume that if we find this William, Vortigern too could likely have to deal with his own things. . . B—but who is—“

<em>His sentence was cut short by a loud crashing of wall, almost as if the wall had given up against the beast, and it’s signature cry had familiarly rattled the doctor’s body. It didn’t take Dante to look back to know who it’d have been, Vortigern. Dante was quick, he had already gotten up, his body ready to run the farthest away from him, when his brain registered the other two, how Vortigern had bogged down the sights of Anthony, ready to add him to the next collection of bodies the man clearly had made. They had to escape, but he couldn’t leave Anthony to die. . . Even when he knew had the roles been reversed, he’d had been left to be executed.</em></span>

<strong>&#39;HEY!&#39;</strong>

Granel&#39;s vision darkened as Anthony&#39;s boot swung up, almost kicking him in the face. The former investigator flailed his arms and legs wildly, giving Granel much unneeded grief as he struggled to break free.

&#39;Let me go!&#39; He cried out in panic as he realized where the investigators were going. Why did they opt for the swamps?! He didn&#39;t like it there. He didn&#39;t want to leave! <strong>The lab was his home!</strong></span>

A loud scream, loud enough to drown Vortigern in a cacophony of noise. Hurried panting, panicky shrills and the sound of shoes tapping down the concrete. He was disorientated for a split second at most, but it was the most embarrassing moment of his life.</span>

It led to the swamps, and while the two weren&#39;t looking forward to muddied waters, leeches and mosquitoes, it was far better than being turned into mincemeat by a crazed Berserker. 

Unfortunately, one of them had other plans, deciding to struggle and twist around in vain as they refused to leave their home. Anthony protested. Even in death, he felt uncomfortable about having his choices be made for him. A foolish thought, for Vortigern slithered towards the three like a snake preying on mice.

&quot;Uoooooooooh!&quot; The king screamed, elbowing Granel. It was a mere love tap, yet strong enough to crack more than half his ribs. The investigator would be launched forward, leaving through the exit and landing right in a pile of muddy water. His eyes burned and his clothes were indistinguishable from dirt, but besides that, he felt great. A very odd sentiment to have, until he realized that it was his body alerting him to the fact that he was no longer encumbered.

He had dropped Anthony mid flight, causing the man to land somewhere near the exit. They were sprawled around the floor, one arm covered in light and reaching for the swamp while the other remained in the shadows. Split between the desire to live and die, only to realize that they never had the choice as they felt Vortigern drag them down by the ankle.</span>

&quot;Ruoooooooogh!&quot; The tyrant screamed, inching closer as his flaming sword stabbed into the floor below, right next to Anthony&#39;s face. He felt the flames sear at his sides and left ear. The Berserker got closer, snarling at his prey as his veil covered face was now merely a lips&#39; worth of distance away from Anthony himself. He felt spit and anger spray across his face, giving him a mixture of fear and disgust as he averted his gaze, only to give in and stare into the eyes of his would be murderer.

That&#39;s when he saw it. Saw them through their veil. That all too familiar face. Disfigured, yet still the same.

Anthony had only nanoseconds to parse it, as a malicious glint appeared in the Servant&#39;s eyes. The brow furrowed and the limbs quivered. He felt thick, rough hands grasp at his neck as his body lost its perception of gravity. He felt weightless, thrown across the room like a ragdoll before feeling the sudden wetness of an afternoon swamp. His perfect hair and carefully cared for clothes were ruined, but he had no time to mourn as another splash could be heard within earshot.</span>

&quot;Uoooooh!&quot; He charged him head on, with no room for tactics or manuevers. Not that he needed him, but still, it felt odd to say the least.

Dante could only watch in terror as the Berserker continued its assault. Granel was further away, safe from the tyrant&#39;s harm. But he himself was stuck between a rock and a hard place, wondering on what to do. Was Anthony worth saving, or should he leave and save his own skin? There was nothing stopping Granel and Dante from abandoning Anthony and running away, safe to live another day.

What to do?</span>

Nothing could stop them past that, they’d be able to split or even distract the beast, but he had to make it out first.

“Y—You’ll die there if you stay! Stop and just let us help you!”

<em>He screamed into the void, knowing he couldn’t even look at Anthony but he knew who he spoke to. Everyone would. But, no matter how much he could scream and yell at this, his claim would seem false, Vortigern was catching up, at an exponential rate at that. The light though! He could see it, he could feel it, it’s natural sunlight, the mugginess it made from the swamp atmosphere. . . He was so close. They had a few more meters. A few! In seconds he could see how Granel had been sent flying, his body crash landing in the swamp water while another had been in the marshes of it, half of Anthony’s body being bathed by rays of light while the other kept into the darkness of the labs.</em></span>

He could run, he could go and find his servant, but to leave was to let Vortigern take a life he had tried to help. Anthony was still alive. He had witnessed the events, and though he posed fights with everything the two had tried to help him with, he was still an investigator. He had information.

<em>He . . . What would he do? Dante looked back towards Granel, his eyes widened like a deer in front of headlights, how his manic features had done nothing but enunciate his shaky thought process. He was insane too. He’d be deranged to have gone and attempted it, but before the Security Guard could have taken his breath, the doctor had began his run towards Anthony.</em>

<em>The water felt heavy, everything was against him. . . The mud was attempting to suck in his feet to keep him still, his brain wracked over questions and answers as to why he would even do such a thing. Why was he choosing to even save him? He had answers. Would he even give them to them? He didn’t know. Everything was a double edged blade when he tried to think of it, but in the end, Anthony was someone he had to protect.

Granel&#39;s legs barely registered the impact of falling as he felt a corpse&#39;s femur crack under his weight. Combined with Anthony, Granel was extremely heavy. Despite this, Granel kept kept running alongside Dante.

&quot;<strong>Keep going! Keep going, Dante!</strong>&quot; Granel encouraged as Anthony flailed against him, breaking his nose. His face hissed as it knitted itself back together.

That healed quickly, unlike Vortigern&#39;s love tap. Granel was sent flying, dropping Anthony in the process. Muscles acted as a cushion, but Granel still felt the wind get knocked out of his lungs. He hacked as he got to his feet, only to watch Anthony get dragged away. They had to save him! Granel took a step forward, before stopping.

He swallowed.

Anthony had sold them out. He would&#39;ve gladly tossed Granel and Dante into Vortigern&#39;s arms if it would let him live another day. He was sick, living on the island in constant fear of annihilation. If Granel and Dante met Vortigern in combat, they would both die, and Granel valued Dante more than Anthony.

There was no other way. That was that. Save the people you love. If Granel could, he would&#39;ve gladly saved Anthony, but it simply wasn&#39;t meant to be. He shook, before swallowing again.

As Dante prepared to square up with Vortigern, he felt a large hand on his shoulder jerk him away from Vortigern and Anthony. &quot;<strong>No, son. Just... no. Sometimes you leave a patient to die so he doesn&#39;t infect others.</strong>&quot; Granel swallowed, his mouth dry. It felt like he was swallowing sawdust.

&quot;<strong>We need to go, Dante. It&#39;s over.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he scooped Dante up in his arms gingerly. Even as Dante beat against the man&#39;s chest, Granel gripped him tighter. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m sorry.</strong>&quot; He whispered.

He would not lose another comrade today.

Which is why the two Canopus investigators fled, leaving the only known survivor of the Bellerophon to die.

When Anthony came to, he was lying in a heap on the dusty floor, unable to do anything but grimace in pain. Sunlight hurt his eyes. He squinted his eyes and averted his gaze, setting it upon the cool, dark interior of the labs.

A flaming sword drove itself into the floor, mere inches from his face. Heat seared his lungs and scorched his cheek, singing the ends of his hair and clothes in an instant. A cry caught in his throat. Fear carved into every inch of him as he saw the silhouette of the monster who had been haunting his dreams. 

<em>No. No. Nononononono-</em>

He threw up his hands as Vortigern hunched over him, snarling like some vicious beast hell bent on destruction. &#39;S-spare me! Please!&#39; He stammered, trembling like a rat caught in a trap. Desperately, he thrust out his hands and clung to the mad king&#39;s face, digging into the rotten flesh underneath their veil and-

<em>Riiiiiiiiiiip</em>

The veil tore like paper, a flimsy piece of fabric that couldn&#39;t have come from anywhere but the discount section of the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#merch-store</span>. For a second, their eyes met, the cool violet of his gaze against the bottomless pits of violence and death, devoid of morals, ethics, or humanity.....................

...?

It was only a spark. A short flash of memory, lasting only an instant. And it was not a clear memory: he vaguely remembered jumping from a ship moored in frigid waters, protected by a pair of strong arms and swords that could cut through steel and sorcery alike. He remembered staring into those eyes, two brilliant pools of darkness that flashed with the sharpness of a battle-hardened knight. There was pride. Hope. Trust. Zeal. The scar hidden beneath his hairline, which had now been concealed by a crown.

The memory faded. His consciousness returned as pain took hold again.

Anthony landed in the swamp in a wet splash. Vortigern had nearly wrung his neck as they flung him into the wilderness, tearing open the wound the investigators had worked so hard to treat. He coughed, feeling the warmth leave his body as his blood tainted the muddy water a dark shade of crimson. 

&#39;Please,&#39; Anthony sputtered, scrambling to get up as Vortigern began their advance. They landed on top of him, crushing his legs, squeezing the breath out of his chest. Anthony flailed uselessly, gasping as water drenched him from head to toe. 

&#39;Rider, <em>my champion,</em>&#39; he pleaded, a mixture of fear and awe. &#39;You came back for me.&#39; 

He broke into a smile, blood dripping down his chin. &#39;I&#39;ve been trying so hard,&#39; he said between gasps. &#39;Trying to live the life you wanted me to. I tried everything I could to stay alive.&#39;

He stared at Vortigern with mist filled eyes. He looked happy, relieved, and absolutely terrified. He glanced at the swords poised over his body, the flaming steel of <em>Tizona</em> vaporizing the moisture in his clothes.

&#39;Have I done a good job, Rider?&#39; He inquired his Servant. &#39;Are you here to tell me that I&#39;ve done a good job?&#39;</span>

The entire world had gone silent, to the point he couldn&#39;t even hear the hurried splashes of Granel and Dante running away in the distance. Minutes passed, and at the end, it was just him and Anthony. Alone.

His knees were on top of Anthony&#39;s own, crushing them and preventing escape. The brunt of his weight was impressed on the man&#39;s body, as if Vortigern were their personal tomb. Despite that, there was no fear in Anthony&#39;s eyes. He made no attempts to escape, his face curling into a desperate smile as he started to speak with exasperation.

<em>&#39;Rider, my champion,&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;Are you here to tell me that I&#39;ve done a good job?&#39;</em>

He remained silent and distant, yet his mind was brewing a storm. The glow of his second blade darkened.</span>

&quot;You...Did good. Rider says.&quot;

His body grew closer as he left Anthony no room to escape. He dropped Tizona in the swamp, letting the flames sear the mud as a boiling, brown mist covered the two, giving them the utmost privacy. No one would be able to see what unfolded next, save for those three.

Anthony felt Vortigern&#39;s long and bony fingers grab at his arms, pressing downward and keeping him restrained. They were far bigger than Rider&#39;s, yet felt familiar all the same. Despite his monstrous appearance, this was no doubt his Servant. Most likely, how they had looked in their last moments before death.

Vortigern sniffed the man&#39;s blood, knowing that they didn&#39;t have long to live. There was no fate worse than dying without accomplishing the one thing you needed most. He struggled to envision a world without Rowena. Therefore, he knew that this man deserved mercy.

&quot;You did well. You made me proud. Rider loves you, like Rowena.&quot; Vortigern said bluntly, like a child. His emotions were incredibly sincere.

<em>&quot;You deserve to die by her hand.&quot;</em></span>

<em><strong>STAB!</strong></em>

Anthony puked blood, feeling an enormous blade plunge at his stomach, piercing his entrails as he sprayed blood around the swamp, bathing it in a crimson ret. It jettisoned from his body, like the water from a fountain. It bathed Vortigern&#39;s clothes red as well, since he made no attempt at distancing himself from the gruesome sight. Instead, he got closer, plunging the purple blade even deeper as he hugged Anthony tight, caressing at the back of the man&#39;s head and whispering muted <em>ssh ssh</em> in his ears.

It was no different than how Vortigern approached his son&#39;s corpse back during their rebellion, yet it felt sadder all the same. Tears trailed down the Berserker&#39;s face as he moaned into the sky, hugging Anthony so tight that the man&#39;s bones were breaking. He was in excruciating pain, yet he could not help but feel joy for a brief moment.

But this wasn&#39;t enough. Vortigern knew that he was a pale imitation of the real deal. He was far from being the Rider in Anthony&#39;s dreams, and yet he wished for the man to meet their hero. For a brief moment, just a few seconds at most, he gave in. He relinquished control, forging a pact with the hero inside of him to deliver their last words.

&quot;Master...&quot; El Cid spoke through the Berserker&#39;s carcass, rubbing Anthony&#39;s head and holding their neck tight. &quot;You did exceptionally well, to survive here. You lived more than me. You followed my teachings to the letter. <strong>You were a true survivor.&quot;</strong>

&quot;My only regret is that I was not able to join you here. Forgive me for that. Do you think we will be able to try again in another life?&quot; He chuckled, his voice sounding as soft and puerile as ever. Even in this monstrous form, he was still the Rider he knew and remembered.</span>

&quot;Sleep now. Forget it all. You&#39;ve suffered so long, you deserve some rest.&quot; He hugged him tight, cracking the last ribs that Anthony had as the pain returned to his body. His spine started to crack, starting a timer on how long it would take for him to lose consciousness. His arms went limp as he realized that even if Rider stopped now, he would be unable to escape at all. This was his fate.

All that he could do was accept it with open arms. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Nat#6572">@Natcracker</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnugget</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbo</span></span>

<em>Granel’s apologizes wouldn’t soothe him, his body stayed still, lifeless even, as Granel  traversed through the swamps. Anthony had died because they needed to survive. He had died because of Vortigern’s ruthlessness. He had died because they couldn’t save him. After about an hour or so, Dante had quieted down, his once again skittish and controlled atmospheric silence had once again began. He wouldn’t speak. The sounds of only Granel’s heavy footsteps hitting stagnant water being the only comfort they got.</em>

<em>When his mind wasn’t on his failings, it was on his servants location. They were leaving the labs entirely, and he hadn’t the faintest idea of where Octavius would have been. The doctor let out a long audible croak, trying to find his words in the middle of it.</em>

“W—We . . . We should find our servants. If Vortigern is still after us, we’ll end up. . . end up exactly like <em>him</em>.”

<em>He couldn’t even say his name, they hadn’t asked his name at all. Another injustice that Dante could feel claw at his spine. He couldn’t even honor Anthony at all. But, that wasn’t what he needed to focus on, they had left in order to live to see another day, but that was going to be unlikely if he hadn’t had his own servant to fight for him.</em></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Anthony Asturi, 24. Demolition expert. Boasting excellent mana circuits and a keen eye for detail, he had been recruited aboard the Bellerophon for demolition work and guard duty. 

His magecraft was well-suited for the expedition. Metals that he had personally tempered were turned into anchors that could ruin the structural integrity of anything they touch. Nails hammered into the wall, piercings penetrated in the flesh...the list goes on. His expertise in the <em>deterioration</em> of objects also allowed him to place nearly undetectable wires over a wide area that snapped under the lightest disturbance, granting both him and his crewmates some much needed peace of mind at night.

It was no wonder that he had managed to last this long. Plus, he had the blessings of Rider, who mentored him like his second son and taught him invaluable survival skills for the wilderness. He had put many of them to use in his lonely expeditions on the island, the ability to hunt, trap, chop wood, build fires, and dozens of other simple skills that had gone extinct where Anthony had come from. 

He wasn&#39;t a natural-born survivalist. But he tried and tried and tired, until these fundamental activities had been committed to muscle memory. Until he no longer had to overthink on which foot to place in front of him when climbing a tree or scaling a wall. Until his drive to survive took over his brain and he became a creature of instinct, run, hide, forage, sleep, then wake up and repeat the cycle over and over...

And over and over...

His journal was the only thing he could fall back on. Like carving lines into tree barks to count the days, Anthony founded his own religion. He established his own faith, that in the keeping of words on a page that wasn&#39;t likely to deteriorate, where he could safely discard a piece of his mind, the part that wasn&#39;t necessary for survival, until one day, he would feel safe enough to embrace them again.

Eventually, he stopped mourning.

His crewmates became a distant memory.

He closed his eyes, and his mind fell into deep slumber.

...

The sound of a shrill, piecing scream jolted Anthony&#39;s mind awake. He tasted blood in his mouth, saw his entrails spilling out behind him. They burned as they caught on Tizona&#39;s flaming edge, filling his nostrils with the acrid smell of foaming, burning flesh. 

<em>Where am I? What was that noise?</em> He soon realized that it was his own voice. A deep, guttural scream that came from some deep, primal place in his soul and worked its way outward, filling every crevice of his being, filling his lungs until they were bursting, filling his throat until they were cracking, clawing, tearing, breaking, ripping him apart.

&#39;Rider...&#39; Trembling hands placed themselves over the purifying blade of <em>Colada</em>, clasping the fine steel as they slid deeper into his stomach, until the cold hilt of the moonlight blade rested against his skin. 

He was no longer in a condition to support himself. Rider gathered him up and wrapped him in their decaying arms, hushing him like a child and squeezing him so tightly as if they wanted to knead him into their very being. They hugged him until his bones cracked, and Anthony screamed again.

<strong>&#39;Stop!&#39;</strong> Tears began to stream from his eyes. <strong>&#39;I can&#39;t bear it any more!&#39;</strong>

His body began to give in. His life began to wither. In his final moments, he was spoiled until his skin was torn to shreds, until the last drop of blood in his body was squeezed out, until his bones fell apart. The whispers of the undying champion sounded like a sweet lullaby that hushed his anguish and dulled his senses.

He forgot about his journal. About Nirvana, and the expedition. Behind his eyelids, he saw the vast, rolling landscape of sand dunes stretched to the horizon in every direction, the wind hot and dry against his skin. He saw the lone, exiled knight standing in a ring of corpses, their armor chipped and worn, the enemies&#39; blood dripping from the tips of their legendary twin swords. 

The knight turned to face him. 

<strong>&#39;Would you like to join me, Master?&#39;</strong> They spoke, their voice metallic and muffled through their helmet.

Anthony felt a lump growing in his throat. &#39;Can I?&#39; He asked, squinting at the distorted visage of the knight under the blaring desert sun. &#39;Have I earned that right?&#39;

<strong>&#39;Plenty.&#39;</strong> The knight laughed heartily. <strong>&#39;You have proven yourself worthy to stand by my side.&#39;</strong> They stabbed the flaming sword into the sand and held out their hand. 

<strong>&#39;Take my hand,&#39;</strong> they insisted. <strong>&#39;Let us walk where the kings have trod, where the saints have said their prayers. Let us journey down this road, not knowing where it started nor where it will end. Wherever you set your sights, I will accompany you there. You have more than earned that right.&#39;</strong>

Anthony nodded, then reached out with his own hand. It was torn and bloody, battered and bruised. He smiled his last smile as he walked towards his beacon of hope.

&#39;Don&#39;t mind if I do.&#39;
