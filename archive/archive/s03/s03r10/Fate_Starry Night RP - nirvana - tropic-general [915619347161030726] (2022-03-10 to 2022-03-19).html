Since it is one of the more dangerous reserves, a lot of protective Magecraft and surfaces have been applied to the area, stopping tourists from exploring off-limits areas while keeping the animals safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seems like the system hasn’t been maintained in a long while, leading to the barriers falling as animals started to prey on each other. It is recommended to approach this area with caution, lest an anaconda coil up to you and gobble you up.</div>

The rest he had at the garden and the conversation they had with the long passed caretaker had sparked a new flame within the Emperor. He would set things right. Even if he and Dante were the only investigators left on the island, they would find a way. He had time while Dante searched those labs. He would be damned if he didn&#39;t find anything while they were separated.

During his travel, it was lightly uneventful. The Saber traveled along the treetops for the most part. Staying away from wandering beasts that would attack without a moment&#39;s notice. Truly living like a king. 

Without Dante with him, Octavius moved quickly across the tropics, his idea was to search his battle site against Vortigern for any clues before heading back to the workshop. He wanted to compile anything he found to put into Dante&#39;s journal. Just in case. In a short amount of time, Octavius was back at the destroyed landscape from his battle against Vortigern. He was elated to see that the fires had subsided since the battle. He could feel the fire from the battle still on his skin as he relived the fight from the sidelines. The mana in the air might have been thinner since the battle, but there was still plenty of evidence of their battle.

However, Octavius could sense another presence. A servant no doubt. Similar in scope to... Him. Alarm was present within the Roman, if it was the mad king, he was alone. The mad king was faster than him, even if he ran now there would be no outrunning him. They were close enough that without a doubt the other servant would be aware of his presence. The Saber jumped up into a nearby tree to  The Roman held his sword in his hand, knuckles white as he clenched his hand around the pommel.

Confrontation was inevitable.</span>

For a time things were to simmer down. Perhaps they managed to evade detection. Then Octavius saw it. 

A tall, gaunt figure pushed aside the bush and stood into view. They stood taller than Vortigern, even with one of their antlers atop on their skull helmet broken. Frost was left behind in their path. This cold felt familiar. Were they one of the Servants who assaulted the Canopus that day? 

There wasn&#39;t much time to think upon that as Berserker&#39;s head swiftly snapped towards the Octavius&#39;s presence in the trees. Whatever it was, <strong>they</strong> saw Saber. Their piercing blue bots glared into his soul as the temperature dropped around Berserker.

&quot;<strong>▂▂▃▃▃▃▂▂...</strong>&quot;

A low rumbling was heard from them as the grip on the tree Berserker held onto increased until it broke in their hands. The growl seemed to serve as a threat towards Octavius, but actually it was to warn another pair out of sight...</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Entrapped in the thick vegetation, the two Genevi hiked through the tropics. Barely an hour in that environment was enough to understand the severity and the level of danger the area boasted. Impracticable terrain, unfathomably hot and humid air, rabid animals and unusual plants lurking around every corner. This place was no walkover, and truth be told, the man hadn&#39;t even seen half of the beasts they encountered thus far. Giant snakes, dotted felines, <em>all manners of exotic birds</em>. He might&#39;ve even felt a mild curiosity about the things, if not for the fact they tried to <em>rip their limbs off half of the time</em>. His military knife had already seen some extended use merely an hour in. Damn place.

That aside, the trip to the Forest&#39;s scientific facilities turned out better than expected. It seemed like William didn&#39;t mislead them, nor did he send the two right into a trap. Not this time, at least. It was reassuring to have made progress towards their goal of retrieving the island’s blueprints. Though, the veteran couldn&#39;t help but wonder about the Servant&#39;s motive. The reason as to why he would help them out. Was this a game for him, the investigators struggling and fighting? Investigating the dangerous island, chasing answers that might not even exist? Was this all just <em>entertainment</em> to the playwright?

He didn&#39;t know for sure. He <em>couldn&#39;t</em> know for sure, but it still pissed him off. In fact, just <em>thinking</em> about William pissed him off. That rosy prick. Next time they would meet, he&#39;d be sure to question the playwright <em>properly</em>. He wouldn&#39;t slip between his fingers a second time. To be so jovial, so cryptic, so nonchalant when his and the rookie&#39;s life as well as the success of their mission was on the line…

<em>▂▂▃▃▃▃▂▂...</em>

Wendigo&#39;s low growl interrupted the soldier’s thoughts. The man looked up, spotting the thin silhouette a few paces away. The beast stood deathly still, calculating, looking out towards something the two Genevi couldn&#39;t make out just yet. Ace learned over the last week that Wendigo didn&#39;t randomly stop for no reason. When it did, it was either because their acute senses picked up on dangerous animals nearby, or because it spotted...

&quot;People,&quot; The man said, striding towards the spirit of hunger. He gestured for Emeilia to follow him, towards Wendigo&#39;s side.

Facing the same direction the beast did, the man could make out the shape of a man armoured in gold. A Servant?

<em>Ally or enemy?</em> Ace&#39;s mind instantly jumped to the question. If that which he was looking at truly was a Servant, the man wondered if he could be on their side, or at least not completely against them, similar to Alex or William&#39;s situations. There was also the possibility that he belonged to a late investigator, but even if he did, the veteran might not have been able to tell. Many Servants had been summoned on the Canopus after all, his memory wasn&#39;t good enough to recognise all of them.

<em>But he knew of someone that would be able to</em>.

“That guy,” The veteran whispered to Emeilia, pointing to the armoured man with his thumb. &quot;Recognize him?&quot;</span>

That servant looked like death itself. Certainly, it reminded him of Vortigern with how it looked. The chill that the Emperor felt from the beast, the thick, indistinguishable aura of a Berserker it gave off, Octavius remembered this feeling on the Canopus. Down in the lower decks during his fight against Caster, he felt this aura before, and that cold had disrupted Caster&#39;s work. Was this a group of Investigators? Or was it a group of Islanders that had in some way self-sabotaged? Either way, he couldn&#39;t act rash, there was no telling what might happen. He had to be tactful. This was his chance to converse with new people, potential allies. He wished he and Dante looked harder to find other investigators sooner as now, he had no clue whether these were friends or foes.

The best course of action was to talk his way out. Otherwise, if they were hostile, they were already dead. All he had was Pax Romana as a last resort. Octavius clenched his sword and stood tall on the treetop, pointing his sword at the trio, bellowing to make his presence known.

&quot;Residents of Nirvana or Investigators from elsewhere?&quot; He kept his question vague, if they were from Nirvana he could play it off long enough to either activate Pax Romana or make a mad getaway, if they were Investigators, that would be a nice change of pace. The Emperor never let his guard down though, he held Auram Pax in front of him as a warning to the trio, his red hair flowing like a flame in the wind from the forest around them, his eyes filled with a burrowing fire that let the trio know that Octavius at least was ready and capable to fight if necessary, although his stance was light enough to show that he was indeed open to negotiation it looked as though he welcomed it.

&quot;Whoever you are, I mean you no harm.&quot;

This was a gamble, but a gamble he had to take.</span>

All it took was a single action for the tension in the air to snap and then Berserker would be right on top of them. 

As if in response to Saber pointing their sword at them, the other servant responded in kind by raising their own hand and frigid air soon formed on their palm. It appeared that they were going to make the first strike! 

&quot;<strong>▂▂▃▃▅▅!</strong>&quot;

A roar erupted forth from Berserker as a violent torrent of frost and ice tore through the air towards Saber. Anything too weak to withstand the winds broke against the strong winds. Anything that was strong enough was left with a harsh coat of frostbite and ice.</span>

Whether Saber remembered the smaller woman or not didn&#39;t matter. All that did matter was that this person recognized them and saw them as an ally.

The last friendly face they had seen up until now at the very beginning of the expedition, shortly after the Canopus&#39; docking on Nirvana. A whopping <em>9 days ago</em>. Needless to say, the Genevi had lost hope in finding anymore colleagues on the island... or rather, it was the case up until now.

The rookie referred to the armored Servant as <em>Saber</em>. He sure looked the part, Ace could tell that much from his position. He guessed the Servant had been summoned on the Canopus, since Emeilia recognized him as an ally. Quite a few investigators had summoned their Servants on the ship back then, but the veteran didn’t keep track of who had summoned who. Luckily, Emeilia did, and thus allowed for this chance encounter to go smoothly.

Octavius&#39; peaceful words soon came to greet the group, but the fire in his eyes said something else. Open to diplomacy, yet cautious enough to know better than to blindly trust. A fine compromise, Ace thought, the Servant had a good head on his shoulders.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we mean you no harm either,&quot; The man casually smiled, stepping out of the vegetation, towards his colleague. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since we saw anyone from the team, breath of fresh air. Honestly, I was half-expecting you to be a <em>rogue Nirvanan Servant</em>. Wouldn&#39;t have been the first time we met one, too.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><em>It seemed the Berserker was more or less just as negotiable that Vortigern.</em> That was the thought that crossed through Octavius&#39;s head as the Wendigo launched the torrent of ice and cold in his direction. As he felt the area around him grow colder, he launched himself from the tree out towards the open field next to them, looking back at the now frost-covered tree. Just as he was about to enact a counterattack, he soon realized that the human counterparts of the Berserker, specifically the woman had made the ravenous beast stand down. That was certainly a good sign. Wait, they recognized him from the Canopus? As well, that hold was nostalgic of his fight against Caster in the lower decks, that Berserker must have been the reason for the ship&#39;s survival. As everything clicked together, Octavius let the tension drop from his body as he let his arm drop to his side and let Auram Pax disappear in a small glow of red flame from his hand as he sighed relief. These were investigators and he and Dante truly weren&#39;t alone anymore.

&quot;Fellow investigators, it is welcoming to know that we are not alone.&quot; The Saber said as he albeit cautiously walked over to the trio, still giving side glances to the Berserker. The Emperor wiped the right side of his armor of the frost that had formed as he stood in front of the Genevi trio and crossed his arms, looking all three up and down. &quot;It appears that you all are in good health and uninjured, this is good to see. In a place such as this, any injury can lead to a fatal end. I suppose a proper greeting is at hand then as well.&quot; Octavius slammed his fist into his chest as his smirk reappeared on his face. &quot;I am the Saber class servant summoned by Doctor Dante Jeanne Colt, at your service. We have much to discuss.&quot; His eyes grew serious again as he heard the mention of a rogue servant. &quot;Especially information concerning the threats on this island.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Dante Jeanne Colt? The name didn&#39;t ring a bell immediately, but thinking back to the Canopus&#39; hundred name-long registries, the name did feel <em>somewhat familiar</em>. Only further proof that Emeilia was right in trusting him, Saber definitely belonged to a fellow investigator.

But, the man couldn&#39;t help but notice this Colt person&#39;s lack of presence, as only Saber stood in front of the trio. Did he get himself killed somehow? Did Master and Servant split? The veteran didn&#39;t touch on the subject. He trusted that Saber would do that eventually, or that Emeilia would ask this question on her own.

&quot;Ace Colin,&quot; The man answered Saber&#39;s greeting with one of his own. &quot;Geneva OC veteran. This is Emeilia Lewis, brainiac rookie and my colleague for this mission. Judging by your wariness, I suppose you&#39;re worried about Berserker over there. Don&#39;t, he won&#39;t attack you. Also, I’d like to apologize about the... odor. You get used to it eventually.&quot;

Because, if the roman hadn&#39;t paid attention to it up until now, standing closer to the trio would&#39;ve revealed the sad truth of their day-to-day lives: The smell of putrid and rotten flesh that constantly permeated the air around Wendigo. Strong enough to make him wonder how the two people accompanying it were able to handle the stench so effortlessly. They sure built people tough back at this &#39;Geneva&#39; place.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ace agreed with the Roman, taking his shades off. &quot;We have a lot to discuss about, and much to share. We were actually on our way to the <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#deserted-cottage</span> to do just that. I suggest you make the trip with us, we can catch up for a bit while we walk.&quot;</span>

It was putrid indeed, and these &#39;Geneva&#39; individuals stuck around without much of a fuss. He could respect that, however, he&#39;d hoped they at least had an air freshener or something to put on him. The smell of rotting flesh was a nauseating smell to the Roman, mainly because it was an all too well-known smell to him, especially during his altercation with Vortigern. The comparison between regular rotting flesh and burning rotting flesh was more substantial than the Roman realized, now that he had a comparison. For a moment he coughed the scent of Wendigo assaulted his nose but afterward, he was fine once again. 

&quot;Of course, making the trip with you all to this cottage would make conversation easier, who knows what else is lurking in the forest.&quot; On that note, The Saber joined the Geneva crew on their trip to the Deserted Cottage.
