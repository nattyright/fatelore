                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That first day after the fight against Vortigern and the meeting with Koji and Scylla had left Octavius resting within the hospital, specifically one of the nearby clinical rooms to Dante&#39;s New Office. Dante had used his medical knowledge and helped patch up Octavius&#39;s wounds which were regardless of healing from Octavius subtly taking mana from Dante to speed up his process. He hadn&#39;t said much to his Imperator as he wanted his words to be accurate and concise, so he stayed quiet within his thoughts beyond the affirmations about his health and his worried questions pointed at Dante. After the first day of recovery, Octavius had regained use of his right arm, albeit he was still very sore. While he could have used his Noble Phantasm to heal himself and replenish his mana, he didn&#39;t want to send out a mana signature like that out across Nirvana and he didn&#39;t want to paint a target across the hospital that they inhabited. To ease the strain on Dante&#39;s magical circuits, Octavius ate food that he scrounged around for to act as a mana source. Which unfortunately forces him to eat half of the hospitals remaining food supply, afterward sleeping the rest of that day and halfway into the next.
 
The second day was a test run of his body to see how well he would be able to perform with his lightly weakened state. He was slightly slower with his swings as his right arm was still technically healing. To compensate he would have to two-hand Auram Pax in battle until he was one hundred percent. He still wasn&#39;t as conversational with Dante, seemingly deep in thought about the previous battle.

Soon after starting this, the Saber ran at his top speed across Nirvana, making his way to the merch store and seeing the aftermath of the battle that had taken place there. Albeit he mostly ignored it in favor of getting two issues of the Nirvana newspaper and running back to the hideout by the end of the second day.

The third day however after reading the newspaper was when Octavius opened up to Dante again.

&quot;Dante, I&#39;d like to speak to you.&quot; The Emperor says out of the blue mid-morning of the third day while he was seated rereading the same article about the &#39;invaders.&#39; &quot;I want to talk to you about how you reacted back there in the battle against that Berserker, Vortigern and that Nirvana Rider pair. And how we need to act moving forward.&quot; Him saying this was like opening a bottle that was moments from exploding from the pressure built inside of the bottle. It was inevitable. Octavius had been thinking about the battle and their encounter and how much of a bust the entire encounter had been. They merely learned that there was likely a third party on the island and that the Islanders could be talked to. It was more than they had before, although Octavius already ordained the second piece of information himself with the encounter against the spider woman and Caster. And Dante had unknowingly made the job of making &#39;friends&#39; harder.</span>

Cleaning or rewrapping gauze on his arm, helping find a splint that was needed to help recover, even trying to slink about the upper floors to at least find some sort of gear to help with how sore the arm seemed to be. Truly, this was where Dante thrived at, how he had the mindset to know how to help, and what methods wouldn’t  disturb the Saber from his rest sleep while he inspected his arm, or what would help with trying to recover the muscle torn from his fight.</em>

<em>Some hours, he just spent his nights watching the saber try to recover. His brown eyes simply watching from a seat or so, though his knees covered his features as he watched over the body. During the day, eat was essential, and while he wasn’t one to really speak his mind, he did at least have he action that he cared. Early when he was awake before the Emperor, Dante was active, moving quietly as his meek mouse self could to see what he could scrounge up from the upper floors. Small things of bread, a bagel, occasionally he’d find a fruit or so. Occasionally when the Saber woke, he’d find them neatly placed beside his bed as he woke from slumber, the Doctor out of sight and quiet.</em>

<em>It had been about the third day that he finally heard Octavius’ voice, which had surprised him, the Doctor looking up from his seat of the medical records of Nirvana’s last patients. The folders in his hand matching the same pile he had secured on the small desk the duo had secured for their “New Rome” excursion.</em></span>

<em>But when he was going to ask if the Roman were alright, he had quickly shut up. Instead he nodded, hoping that that was all he was to say. He didn’t know how exactly he was to continue the conversation anyways. The doctor before had given them something of value, no matter how much he didn’t want to speak much about the doctor and the problems that had caused previously. And just like that, the silence continued.</em>

<em>The next day was another surprise to see the Roman speaking again. However, his words nearly forced to lurch over in his seat. The fight between that thing. . . Vortigern, and his brief exchange the enemy master. Dante looked around, trying to find something focus his eyes so he couldn’t look Octavius in the face, yet his features had blanched. What he wanted to speak about it was that, wasn’t it? Something in Dante cracked inside, a fear maybe? A confidence? Regardless, he could feel himself falter because he knew what could ensue.</em>

“Of course. Is. . . Is that what you wanted to speak about specifically? W—was there so-something wrong?”

<em>Crack. Another pieces he felt had been broken, he tried to not let the guilt bombard him. He knew he had made mistakes, and yet he didn’t want to admit to them. . . Not yet at least. Or well, not have the Roman bring them up.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Saber stayed in his seated position away from Dante, holding the newspaper in his right hand, clearly still a bit weakly. He looked at his Master with an empty expression, no malice or glee present across his face. Whatever was to be said, was to be said factually and without emotional connection. Octavius leaned in a bit from his chair as he set the newspaper down on the seat next to him, letting the image of the frontline news story of the Canopus be present from the page as Octavius put his hands together and let out a deep sigh. From the two fights and the interactions that he has had with Dante, Octavius had learned many things about the island around them and more importantly, his own Master. A master that was acting unfit to be his equal. Not quite a hindrance, but sliding towards one. It was true that Octavius harbored doubts about his pairing with Dante, while it wasn&#39;t expressly shown all of the time, it was there and he fought through these thoughts night and day to reconcile that his faith in the doctor was accurate. Octavius then spoke.

I get that, I understand that. I understand that you have been made to witness the worst life has to offer in the shortest amount of time, but while saying that, don&#39;t take this as ridicule or scorn or insult. This is a pure matter of fact that you are squandering our opportunities here on this Island and this investigation. You have scorned most of the advice and counsel I&#39;ve given to you in the short time we&#39;ve been together and you have given me little evidence to believe that you are meant to be my Imperator, much less a master. I want results. I want allies. I want to know everything that goes on here because I was forced to exist in this place.&quot; The Emperor&#39;s words were rapid and concise, steady and stern, yet the energy that Octavius&#39;s tone dictated stole the air from the room, making it taste stale like a room with no air conditioner. This was Octavius at his most honest, he had stopped holding his words back from Dante. &quot;I have been trying my damndest to make existing on Nirvana easier for us. While I won&#39;t discredit what you have done, you did heal my injuries and you did take care of this facility. You did grow a backbone against that doctor, but you did it without tact, you made him apprehensive and belligerent rather than calm and forthright, because of you we have lost a lead. A genuine inhabitant of this place. Now I&#39;m weakened, the people of Nirvana know of our existence here and we have learned <strong>nothing.</strong>&quot;

He could already feel the world reel away from him, and he had to train his eyes toward the ground. He was a bad master, much more a bad investigator at that. He was just going to have to have it reconfirmed.</em>

<em>Again, the Roman Emperor spoke, and something about it made Dante want to crumple like the papers he used. To take in as little space as possible. The words he spoke weighed truth, and Dante could feel them pressing against his consciousness. They had been here for a moment, and yet he had no leads. . . No allies. Not even a way to begin. And yet, consistently he had to be reminded that he agreed to be on such a thing. That this was a job he had signed up for, be it a priority or not. But what truly had made him feel horrid, was the statement that he had brought another person into existence due to such job and yet had done nothing of it. That in itself only solidified his failure, and at that, Dante could feel himself then want to be swallowed by the earth.</em>

<em>His ultimatum made Dante shudder, forcing a mixture between a squeak and cry as the Doctor tried to fumble for words. To be left alone meant he’d have nowhere to go, and yet to go forward meant that he had to continue with what he had and accept that he’d still have started from zero. But. . . Even with that, at least he’d have some sort of help. And with that, something about the latter option had been better than the first. A brief flash of pain showed on his face as he nodded his head. He had to give results. Even if he didn’t know how, he’d have to go about it. Because it meant either going about it alone, or going about it with someone else. Because it meant he’d have help. He tried to speak, letting about that amalgamation of distorted cries first as he tried to settle himself.</em></span>

Over and over, those below him would fail to deliver results again and again. Why did he put so much faith into Dante anyway? Because he was summoned by him? Because he saw potential? That potential meant nothing if it wasn&#39;t put to use. The Caesar continued to stare at Dante, continuing to suck all of the air out of the room by looks alone. Dante would feel as though he and Octavius were the only people in existence at the edge of space. He couldn&#39;t take the word of his <em>master</em> anymore. He would have to prove his worth to him. Either by actions or results. Until that moment, Octavius considered Dante as nothing more than a necessity. How long have they been on this island? Five days at this point? They had met three servants and two masters and gleaned nothing except a newspaper detailing the attack on their ship and the names of that doctor that they ran into and his address along with a  cult present on the island. Before Octavius spoke again he snatched the newspaper from the desk next to him and tossed it to Dante&#39;s feet. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think you understand yet Dante. Until you start acting as you came here for a reason then I have no real reason to trust you as a comrade, much less my master!&quot; His voice had raised slightly as his emotions peaked a bit through his stern and calm demeanor, making it semi-clear that Octavius was less angry and more disappointed. Disappointed in what? Dante? Himself? This investigation?  The doctor couldn&#39;t be certain. &quot;I have completed more by finding a stupid paper than you have done while groveling at the feet of this Island. From now on Dante, you will be listening to every word I say, starting with my plan on engaging these Nirvana inhabitants. We are going to be cordial with them. We are going to give them every opportunity to trust and commune with us. We will not antagonize the locals.&quot;

That doctor&#39;s interest was peaked from it. And that woman could have killed you easily, but she marked you instead. Do you know why?&quot; He asked, his agitation waining as he rested back into his seat. He wanted to know if there was something useful that Octavius could glean from that first interaction with the island, he wanted something, anything that could lead them to more answers. So far they had the Vortigern mystery, the address of the doctor, and a cult to work with.

To say that Octavius was angry would have been an understatement, why a Roman Emperor such as he would waste precious time with what was stated in his eyes was useless. It was because there was no other choice.</span>

<em>Each sentence only gave the Roman a nod in response. And yet, luckily the doctor hadn’t gone and cried about it, simply stared forward.  He didn’t know how to respond to it much anyways, the same disappointment he was given was the same disappointment he felt himself, to cry about it would have simply showed how selfish he felt the latter had been. When the Emperor asked of the string, the finger that held it twitched almost as if he had thought to hide it immediately, but, rather he rose his hand, letting the back of his hand show which held the string in a nice knot.</em>

“. . . The woman of the last battle had given it to me, I do remember her saying that others wouldn’t attack me, but she did. . . So I don’t trust that it held much worth. I sort of simply forgot about it then, it didn’t work on Vortigern, so I can’t say it’ll be useful. . .”

<em>He hung his head low, simply allowing the Roman to ask his question. He was too quiet to fight back, much too meek to really want to defend himself anyways against what he said, and on how much the fear of actually going about the investigation had spiraled for the moment.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius clenched his left fist before immediately unclenching. He couldn&#39;t be mad for being left out of that tidbit of information. From his point of view, it could have looked like a sham, a ploy. However, now it was pertinent information. The leverage they could use to move through the island. The Saber gave a sigh of relief which would have probably confused Dante with the shift in mood. This made it clear that Vortigern wasn&#39;t on the side of Nirvana. That left him as either a rogue Investigator&#39;s servant or a third-party entity. Both of which weren&#39;t good, but it helped to narrow it down. With Koji&#39;s reaction to the string and what that woman said to Dante, it might be a good idea to test how effective the string was for other Islanders. They had botched it with Koji, but if they met another native of Nirvana or met that woman again herself, that could help them immensely. As well they needed to meet another investigator to compare notes and to confirm Vortigern&#39;s allegiance. The pieces were falling into place.

That string may work in our favor, we can get more information because of it from other Islanders most likely.  Even if it&#39;s just a reaction to it. We may even want to find that lady and Caster pair again. As well we need to find other investigators to confirm Vortigern&#39;s status if he is an investigator or not. And now we also have that doctor, Koji&#39;s address. Three leads.&quot; The air in the room had completely turned back to normal breathing level as he leaned forward in his seat, resting in his hands. &quot;Did you hear the woman&#39;s name?&quot; He wanted to put more names on the players in this elaborate game of war.</span>

But it felt correct.</em>

<em>Regardless of his praise, Dante didn’t really pay it mind. Too busy brooding over his mistake truly, but also because he could hear it going more towards the string than to the actual use it held. The doctor moved his chair a little, focusing now on the door while he tried to calm the worry inside him. He truly didn’t know what the string could bring, and while he knew it was likely more valuable to at least brought it up before, he didn’t know what it could bring other than problems. But, he wouldn’t leave his servant to only draw conclusions on things alone. He could help. He was useful. . . Even if the him before had been more problematic.</em> 

“He didn’t seem to be more of a rogue investigator servant. . . I don’t think any of them knew who we were exactly. To be a rogue meant that they’d have to really know everyone’s faces, but we didn’t meet many. Not that I know of at least. . . But, it wouldn’t hurt to pay him a visit. . . He spoke about a Rowena, I wonder if that is a person close to him. I’m sure if we find clue on that name we can find clue as to what he is and how he is . . .”</span>

However, what Dante couldn’t help but shudder at was the question of whether the woman who gave him this string had a name or not. He sighed, his good finger picking at the small string that held dearly onto his finger. He knew her name, of course she had introduced herself, however it didn’t mean he liked to repeat it.

They didn&#39;t know where that Vortigern had come from or run to. They would likely have to search the entire island for signs of a raging Berserker, but that was idiotic as the entire Island was in turmoil and conflict at that very moment. If their mission was to find battle sites then it would be easy, but to find one raging beast? Unlikely to just stumble on him. Although the fact that it wanted to find a Rowena... Octavius gained a new idea, not a good one in the slightest, but if it meant finding the berserker again then it was the only way. 

&quot;If we want to meet the creature again then we would have to lure it out. The bad news is, the only thing I can think of to lure the beast is to call out that name, Rowena, I&#39;m sure if we do that then he&#39;ll come running. The only issue is then we would be lying and it would put its anger on us.&quot; Octavius moved his right arm and winced. &quot;And we know how that worked out last time with assistance, with just me fighting the creature we would be destroyed.&quot; Octavius omitted Dante from the formula of the fight entirely. Both times that the doctor helped, both times he was inefficient in combat. Albeit it was because they were against forces that didn&#39;t care for Dante&#39;s chains, nonetheless the Emperor deemed Dante harmless in an actual fight. &quot;We would have to fight somewhere more open, I&#39;d rather not fight in a constrained location again, I can&#39;t use my Noble Phantasm in a tight space without risking unforeseen consequences and damage from structural damage. It would have to be in an open area to give me the option of unleashing Auram Pax&#39;s True Name.&quot; He said as flames erupted in front of him and summoned the sword into his right hand, the blade feeling a bit heavier in his slightly weakened right arm before dematerializing it once again in red and orange flames. It would be a harder fight, but it was possible that he could fight easier in the open</span>

Weirdly enough, she was the easier thought in Octavius&#39;s mind. Aside from Dante&#39;s paranoia, the Caesar realized something about the fight against her and her servant. Their example and Koji and Rider told Octavius that the Islanders could be reasoned with. What Dante saw as someone attacking him, Octavius saw as someone defending themselves and their home. Morality be damned. As well that Caster let him go Scot free, albeit it was after their plan of totally sinking the Canopus had failed from whatever interrupted it. Octavius had the thought in his head that if they were to meet again under different circumstances, a neutral ground, they could come up with a compromise or at least find out more about Nirvana. &quot;We will have to meet them again if we want to get anywhere on this island. Remember Dante, we threatened them and I attacked first. Although they were taking down the Canopus, we did attack them. Even after that she still put a string on your hand, that must mean something. We have to find them again.&quot; He said the words that Dante didn&#39;t want to hear. The Emperor wanted to meet the cause of Dante&#39;s initial trauma again!</span>

<em>He kept quiet about his feelings as he knew that the saber was essentially calling him useless on the battlefield, and while he wished he hadn’t registered it, it was easy to at least feign ignorance over it.

The faster we get answers and gain allies amongst the native population, the faster and easier it will be to destroy those that oppose us and find out the mysteries of this place. Koji knows where we are, it&#39;s safe to assume that he will either come back to finish us when his servant is at full strength or get his compatriots to do the same. He&#39;s seen my limitations as a servant and your ability as a Master, unless we act, we would be better off slitting our throats.&quot; At the last sentence, to punctuate his point he turned sharply to Dante and glared at him. &quot;I know that fight Vortigern alone would be tantamount to suicide, but unless you can think of anything else, then we will have to get allies to fight him or deal with him ourselves so he doesn&#39;t eliminate anyone else on this forsaken island. Can you practice necromancy? Can you gain the secrets of the earth from an island of corpses?&quot; He targeted harshly at Dante, still very much annoyed at Dante&#39;s cowardice. &quot;We are already at a disadvantage in enemy and unfamiliar territory <em>Dante</em>, unless we act swiftly, we will die. Why did you even come here?&quot; After each word, he walked closer to Dante. &quot;Why would you take the risk of coming to Nirvana when you knew it would be certain death for you!&quot; He was in front of Dante now. &quot;You can&#39;t handle death, you can&#39;t handle a bit of terror, you can&#39;t even fathom risk! <strong>Why are you here!?</strong>&quot; Octavius picked up Dante by his shirt and brought him to his level before setting him back down into his seat. &quot;You never did tell me what you hoped to accomplish here and for whom if anyone.&quot; Octavius then went back and say down into his seat. &quot;Go on boy, you have the floor.&quot; He crossed his arms as he waited for Dante to speak. &quot;Don&#39;t waste my time either Dante. Tell me everything.&quot;</span>

He was correct though, to be idle when already someone had known where they had located his workshop would have easily been something more difficult to sit around with. They’d have to leave eventually, or else something would come towards them.</em>

<em>But, to his statements came questions, questions that he couldn’t even appease because he was already at a limit in himself. He didn’t practice magecraft so often, rather what he learned had been through moments before giving up. He couldn’t do necromancy, much less talk to those who had died on the soil here. For every question he tried to get a good answer, the Roman would be disappointed with a shallow shake of his head. No, he didn’t know necromancy. No, he didn’t know how to practice it. Each one only forced him to feel a crack in him, as if with each failure came a breaking of him.</em>

<em>But soon, Dante could see what had to have been anger, and his eyes dropped again. The same questions as on the boat, huh? So much had already happened on the island he had almost forgot about it, or, specifically put it on the back burner. He was going to give the same mechanical answer before he was lifted to see the Roman face to face, and the lie died on his lips. He was here for reasons he wouldn’t understand. . . He could say that right? He could go on and explain that there were things that had to simply be solved on his own, and would take only his own effort to find, no? Because even a chance at it being there should have outweighed death, even though clearly the latter seemed to loom over the former? Dante felt himself put back on the chair, and with a more sense of urgency tried to catch his breath. What was he explain? How was he to?</em></span>

With a good hold he reached for his arm and pulled it from the pocket that sheathed it. The arm itself looked fine, but his hands told a different story. The tips of his fingers were a ghastly black, as if he himself had dipped them in the ashes of the dead and kept them on there, strings like veins followed it up to his palm, decorating it like a sinister tattoo. Dante’s grip tremble. He hated how it looked, as if he’d played with ink and simply stained his limb forever. Of course he’d gone to see people for it, but none could find the answer. Doctors simply thought an idea of paralysis. Even mages who followed in such couldn’t seem to find much of a response to give him. But he knew. He had known the curse that plagued his family for years of their meddling in affairs from others. How little they had cared, and the curses they had inflicted to reach their own gain. And specifically, he knew how though he hadn’t been born to witness it, he was a product of it. A pieces that simply had been collateral damage that the curse gripped onto, and while it had anything to take, it took something he felt would have kept him comfort. His arm. The doctor’s eyes glazed over, trying his hardest to at least keep what expression he could and not ball over, though even that he had been failing at. Yes, he had came here for a reason, but was his reason worth it? To risk death to see if something could fix it? That he couldn’t answer. And frankly, he wanted no answer from anyone. He assumed that it was nothing anyone would need judgement on, because it seemed too trivial to anyone. Too selfish to him. The doctor tried to speak again,</em></span>

<em>He could taste the bile already, the acid ready to be spat at him on such trivial reasoning. A simple thing couldn’t have been so grand. He just wanted the Roman to say it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Emperor watched Dante go through several emotions rapidly as he formed his thoughts into words, he watched and waited for the boy&#39;s answer as he sat patiently in his seat, crossing one of his legs over the other and crossing his arms. When Dante managed to speak, however, Saber barely stifled a laugh after hearing Dante&#39;s reason for coming to Nirvana. Did he decide to go through hell, to risk his life and the lives of others to fix his arm? Not to find the secrets of Nirvana. Not for money or power or status, but to fix his lame limb. Octavius had a new mindset about Dante at that moment, he hadn&#39;t been more wrong about Dante. The Caesar couldn&#39;t hold back his laughter anymore and burst out a polite chuckle as he gave the doctor a slow clap as he leaned forward. After the laugh, he rested his elbows on his knees and rested his chin on top of his clasped together hands as he gave an amused look towards Dante. 

&quot;No wonder I&#39;ve had a hard time liking you Dante, you&#39;re more Roman than you look. You might be a coward doctor, but you... You have the heart of my countryman indeed. You have a problem and you wanted it fixed. I assume by now you&#39;ve tried everything. It must be quite the entrenched problem in your life that you chose the prospect of death without looking at the consequences of weighing your life against your desire. You heard me talk about my Noble Phantasm and knew that it wasn&#39;t enough. So this problem is more than genetic or conventional. Tell me, Dante, why is your arm nonfunctional?&quot; Octavius&#39;s mood was now one of amusement rather than anger, he took a bit of satisfaction knowing more of the truth about his master. No more dancing around excuses and premade facsimiles, it was time for the truth. 

&quot;Go on Dante Jeanne Colt, you&#39;ve already started. Give me your life. Who are you exactly? Don&#39;t worry boy, we have time.&quot; Octavius said with a slight smirk. With all of the nonsense that has already made up the past few days, this would make up for it.</span>

Was he laughing because he found his situation laughable and amusing, or was he to act as if this was a tragic story to be applauded to?

Dante waited, hoping the saber would at least explain why he had done such a thing, if he were to be laughing at him, he would have least wanted such a thing explained so he could have his reason to give up. But, to Dante’s surprise, he simply congratulated him.</em>

<em>Something about the Roman’s boastful comment made Dante instinctively shake his head. He was no Roman. . . He was barely even to be called a doctor. The latter healed sick things back to health, but he couldn’t even help his own affliction. The former, they fought for their cause, Dante knew he couldn’t fight either, so, why had Gaius lied? Why had he said such a thing that Dante himself couldn’t even see? Before Dante could find his next excuse to decline the man’s compliment, Gaius was quick with his next inquiry. He wanted to know the source of it. Again, the doctor tried to speak. His breathing had at least tried to stabilize, but he could still feel the disgust in his own words ready to spat out again.

He was reminded immediately of a flashback of when he inherited the name of Caesar from his adoptive father and all of the trials and tribulations that came from simply inheriting that name. He has taken all of the successes and hate and consequences that came with his name, he had to deal with the stigma of being young and inheriting the name of the most influential Roman to ever exist other than himself. He had to live up to the curse and the privilege of being named Caesar, a decision that he didn&#39;t make and this boy wanted to take the blame for his ancestors&#39; mistakes and correct them like he caused the curse in the first place. How foolish.

Octavius fought to be recognized as his person. Caesar in his own right, his name, his title. He had transcended his father&#39;s legacy by doing what he could not. He became the ideal Caesar, the most influential Roman to ever exist until its downfall. The one who ushered in Peace across Rome of all places, the country that only knew civil war and strife and conflict. He did it with his merit without being held down by his competitors or those that thought they could manipulate him for being young and inexperienced. He rose to greatness and the Throne of Heroes simply because he surpassed everything else that Rome had to offer. He was the ideal Roman. And this Doctor wants to take the hardships and history thrust upon him to the cheek and correct it as if he was the one who cursed his family line.

His face changed back to a neutral, yet slightly disdainful look. &quot;I am laughing at you because you are similar to the countryman that I can to corral and reeducate. You take the burden of your family&#39;s mistakes and triumphs as your own to fix a problem that you yourself never caused? How uninspired. No less you wish to do that without a means of completing such a goal. You simply decided on a whim that coming to this island would be your salvation.&quot; He shifted positions, resting his left elbow on the seat and leaning over, and putting his cheek on his fist. &quot;Tell me Dante, had it ever occurred to you to work on bypassing your limitations first and reaching the heights of what you can do without an arm? Why not be iconic? A world-renowned Doctor that saves lives with one arm? Why do you <em>need</em> both arms to live?&quot; He asked bluntly, making it seem to Dante that Octavius was pushing aside Dante&#39;s trauma of the situation, but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. 

&quot;You are a doctor no? A young one at that. Able to make it without the need for both of your arms to function. Yet you have a lot of improvement to do. That&#39;s why you feel guilt and anguish ever coming to Nirvana for a selfish reason such as fixing your arm because now you know that there is a lot more at stake than your ability to scratch your ass with both your right and your left hand. Instead of becoming the best you possible, you wanted to become an average someone again.&quot; He finished his monologue with a bored expression as if everything he said made perfect sense to Dante, as if it was the objective truth.</span>

Even berserkers had reasons to their madness. . . So why was his reasons to be here not enough? Of course, he hadn’t expected it to be something that the emperor understood.</em>

<em>Even though he wished to end the conversation, the emperor continued, taking his silence as a liberty to go on to speak his mind on Dante’s decisions, only making the doctor recoil from each blunt opinion. He knew he was no cause of the curse, but what was he supposed to do? He came here to see if he could regain what he lost, to be able to relieve his family from had been afflicting them for decades. Furthermore, had it not been for the family, then it’d been for himself. There had to be a merit in it, right? He wasn’t being brash, or he didn’t think he was. He was trying to deal with what life had given him, and it had given him this chance. . . So why was he not to take it? He hadn’t fully thought of the risks, but. . . If he had gotten his arm, then it’d all be worth it. But, Dante within the depths of him, he knew Octavius wouldn’t see that goal for him. Did he see him at all with what he wanted? Unlike the Saber, not everything bestowed was a blessing. It was human to want to correct something that was deemed to be an error. Defective.</em></span>

He had been known for his handicap, and even met another who studied with him about it, but that could only get him so far. That was what he felt had been against him. He could only have gotten so far with such a disadvantage. With both arms he could do more, he could actually feel normal or at least return back to feeling normal. He wanted to take back what fate had taken away, that was human too. But it was selfish. And that’s what broke him apart more. He was selfish enough to take part of an expedition that would risk death, for something he knew others would think little of him for. One outweighed the other, but the latter was something he’d been wanting for years now. He croaked out his response, his tone hoarse and raw yet still almost inaudible.</em>

Unlike those pitfalls, you ran headfirst into? Improve, not because I demand it, improve because otherwise you will die or get me killed without learning even a little about your family&#39;s curse. You hold not just your life in your hands you know.&quot; Octavius said callously as he stared bored at Dante. The Emperor didn&#39;t mean to put down the young doctor, but he had to test the resolve of his master to make sure that he wouldn&#39;t fail again at another crucial moment. He was already two for mess-ups with Islanders, he did not want another failure under them. Was he a bit overbearing on the doctor? Probably. Did he want all of their efforts already made to not be in vain? Absolutely not. If there was even a chance that he could salvage Dante as a potential Imperator, much less a master, he would try. While he was angry with and ridiculed Dante for every single action he&#39;d taken on Nirvana, he wasn&#39;t going to quit on him unless he gave him enough reason to. By that, Octavius means that this was his third chance, and if he fumbled that chance, Dante would leave him hanging out to dry. He was becoming more of a liability to Octavius&#39;s curiosity about this island more than anything and if he kept his level of attitude to failure and cowardice at this level for the remainder of their time on Nirvana whether that meant them leaving or dying, it mattered not to the emperor. If he dies or leaves this island without doing a damn thing, a curse would be Dante&#39;s last problem.

If the pair were to be leaving their hideout for a while it would be nice to be at full power and as well they wouldn&#39;t be simply waiting there, releasing that much power wouldn&#39;t be too reckless if anyone were to check out their place of residence they&#39;d find a pristine base if operations regardless and this desert was a well known enough location that the doctor came here on a whim. They&#39;d be found eventually. As well he simply wanted a feast before fighting that berserker again, call it a final meal before a hard battle.</span>

While he was preparing, Octavius had walked over to their food storage and taken out an old candy bar, took off the wrapper, and munched on it while he waited for his master to finish preparations. He knew he&#39;d been unnecessarily hostile to Dante in this past day, but he needed the doctor to understand that every action he took had an equal reaction to it, words could only bring him so far with the emperor, this entire thing had the hidden goal of figuring out of the young doctor could improve himself or continue to flounder. He wasn&#39;t entirely joking when he said that he would leave Dante behind if he continued to give a poor performance. When the boy had gathered his thing, Octavius finished off the candy bar, crumbling it, and tossed it into the nearby trashcan. While the candy bar was fine, he wanted some real food. And as he stated previously, he was going to get that feast. The Emperor walked to the center of the room and immediately the air around him began to electrify as his mana signature began to raise and then skyrocket. Whatever he was doing, even someone with little ability to sense magical energy inside the <span class="mention">#desert-hospital</span> could feel the immense spike in magical energy. As it seemed that he would turn into some mana bomb, he began to chant.

A bit of time later, Octavius and Dante were at the door to their office, stomachs full of authentic Roman cuisine and both of their bodies feeling as though they had received a month&#39;s worth of rest and healing. The Saber was back at full strength with his confident smirk plastered across his face. He felt like how he was when he was first summoned at absolute tip-top shape, better than ever. 

Dante&#39;s workshop was now changed, however. The walls were now immaculately made marble, there was a new painting that wasn&#39;t present before that looks as though it came straight from Old Rome. Some tables were filled with food and drink straight from Rome, but those quickly vanished into the ether. The ceiling even was now a full-painted recreation of the founders of Rome, Romulus, and Remus. There was harp music that came from nowhere but the wind and the faint sound of celebration that was quickly fading as quickly as the tables of food. The entire room was now the spitting image of an artistic recreation of Rome and while the food and the sounds faded, the marble and artwork remained behind.

&quot;Let us go then, Dante.&quot;</span>
