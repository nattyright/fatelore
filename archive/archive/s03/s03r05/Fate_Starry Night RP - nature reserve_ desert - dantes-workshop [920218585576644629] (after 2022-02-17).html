Within it are a multitude of books that have been stored for the herbs and such that the island may posses, along with strange medical documentations on some patients / animals that were treated. The room itself is mainly used as a Base of Operations for the Doctor, where he helps keep notes on the foliage and wildlife here, while also having kept his main medical tools he could find stored here. . .

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The office and lab that the Investigator Dante and his servant Octavius called sanctuary was nestled deep inside of the hospital, real and fake plants alike have been placed around it to not raise suspicion to the importance of the location. Well, although it was in contrast to the New Rome Sign that was nailed in the door and the marble that seemed to spider out from the bottom of the door. The only thing that actually hid the hideout was the tucked away nature, but beyond that it was easy to spot if looked for. 

As well, a ways away down a nearby hallway towards the morgue, if investigated, it would be clear that a battle commenced there with a hole in the cieling and wall that left that area of the hospital open to the desert itself. It would be obvious that a few days had passed since whatever transpired here as sand had begun to cover the debris from the battle.

Inside of the door, the workshop seemed to carry a different architecture than the rest of the hospital as the floors, walls and ceiling were all authentic marble as if the marble room was sculpted into the hospital. There was paintings and art present around the workshop, a painting of Rome&#39;s founders, Remus and Romulus adorned the roof, a bust of Julius Caesar next to a bust of Octavius Caesar held a spot on the opposite wall of the door, gazing at any visitors that enter the room. The desks and tables that should have been the same make and material as other similar items in the hospital were similarly changed to fit the Roman aesthetic, being made of wood and materials that didn&#39;t exist anymore in this day and age. The only piece of furniture that wasn&#39;t altered was a set of bean bag chairs, apparently ancient Rome didn&#39;t have them.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Another detail to surveying visitors to note is that, unlike the rest of the hospital, this was used recently. There was fresh trash in a trashcan, the cupboards were filled with supplies, writing materials, food and documents. As well there was still a faint mana signature to the entire room as the marble can be easily seen as magical in nature. As well, there was a journal sitting on the main desk with a pen laid next to it. If opened reader could gather that this journal and this hideaway entire belonged to Dante Jeanne Colt. 

Within the journal, it detailed the pair&#39;s adventures and experiences so far, up to the fifth day that the investigation team had been on Nirvana. Detailing the defence of the Canopus against Ashley and Caster, the encounter with Koji and Rider and the subsequent fight against Vortigern within the morgue. And the last note was of the decision of the pair to track down and deal with Vortigern, marking their destination as the tropical area of Nirvana. As well there was a personal note that stated that while the pair didn&#39;t know if there were any other investigators still alive, they held hope that someone would still be out there.</span>

&quot;<strong>OW!</strong>&quot; The sound of head hitting marble could be heard throughout the entirety of New Rome. Even with Dante&#39;s Servant&#39;s modifications, Granel was massive, larger than some of Rome&#39;s biggest people. Truly, a curse that could transcend time and space.

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s too small.</strong>&quot; Granel grumbled before looking amazed. &quot;<strong>What the...? Did we just time travel? It&#39;s like one of those old shows.</strong>&quot; William already forgotten, Granel looked at the two Caesar busts, before looking back to Donald.

&quot;<strong>Kinda looks like you, Donald.</strong>&quot; Granel said simply. They looked nothing alike. The bust did not have a marble mustache. To be fair, it would be foolish to try to out-grow the king of facial hair.

As he continued to look around the room, he came across a note. Granel&#39;s brow furrowed as he read it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald’s first thought when he entered the pseudo-Rome was that it was extremely rich. The marble, the paintings, the very atmosphere of the room, it was all too much for him. Those random bean-bag chairs were the only part that felt comfortable for his simple tastes, and even those felt too luxurious. 

“I’m afraid the island only had the pay fer one building to suit yer height,” Donald quipped. His other remark was right on the money though: this place was certainly not from either of their times. Farther back than even himself, let alone Granel. A window into how the people of Rome lived. 

Those in power, at least.

Donald swiveled on a dime, to where Granel and the bust were. A stranger, in every sense of the word. Didn’t even have a <em>hint</em> of exterior growth around the mouth or nose! As clean-shaven as the very material it was made of.

Donald drooped his shoulders, “Really? Do we got to get yer eye’s checked, too? Even with all that money you got from that one bloke, I doubt we could pay any doctor enough fer the job.”

While Granel continued exploring, Saber himself approached those out-of-place chairs he saw earlier. They looked… comfortable. Too comfortable. And considering that they’d be going through that desert before long, some necessary rest was in order.

He practically threw himself into the lump, and felt it mold into his shape. Yep. Comfortable.

Once more, he reached around and brought the cockroach in front of his face. With every single appendage in some form of movement, Donald once again considered what to call this little guy. His previous idea had lost all excitement, which left him squarely at ground zero.

“Granel, you got any ideas fer a name for this bugger?”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald&#39;s words fell on deaf ears as Granel looked at the odd journal sitting on the desk. Granel squinted in order to read the text. The journal was so small in his hands.

<strong>PROPERTY OF DANTE JEANNE COLT</strong>

&quot;<strong>Mister Dante!</strong>&quot; Granel exclaimed, startling Donald. Hopefully that wasn&#39;t his name for the roach. &quot;<strong>He has survived too! This is wonderful news, Donald. I was worried that he would have a rough time on this island—bless his heart, he always had his nose in a book—but look, he&#39;s doing better than us!</strong>&quot; 

Granel looked around New Rome, chuckling to himself. However, his gaze turned solemn as he looked at the disarray. A massive gap in the ceiling? What had happened here? The security chief looked towards the journal. Hopefully it wasn&#39;t an obituary. Granel couldn&#39;t take another.

Granel opened it and began to read.

&quot;<strong>Cameran</strong>&quot; Granel said suddenly, as he looked up. &quot;<strong>Joe Cameran was the director of a whole slew of shows and movies in the Old World. I heard he survived the Flood, too.</strong>&quot;

Was this the meathead&#39;s idea for a <em>name</em>? Who would name a roach something so random and irrelevant, besides Granel? Stupid pop culture nut.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Mister Dante,” Donald rolled the name over his tongue. “Sounds… french. Poor lad. He’ll need all the help he can get if he wants to get anywhere in life.” 

Jokes aside, Granel was right about that last part. Man had a proper hideout, complete with furniture and the looks of supplies to last him long enough. All they had gotten was a half-built hut with a stack of firewood and a pat on the back. It did make him wonder what he had to do in order to get something a little better to sleep in.

“Cameran?”

That name rang a bell. A very familiar one. It being related to movies and ‘shows’ sounded relevant, but it was hard to put a name to a product. While the gears turned in his head, he focused on the little bug still in his hand. 

Squirmy bastard had tried to leave half a dozen times by this point, and he was getting ready for another go. Not that it was hard to stop him, but it felt disheartening. Wasn’t the comfort and safety of his hand enough? Hadn’t smooshed him yet, so why did he keep trying to leave?

Maybe the critter was hungry. That made sense. Better yet, how the hell had it survived so long inside that wall? Sounded like a gigantic–

“Oh!” Donald piped up. He pointed directly at Granel, “That’s the bloke that made that one thing from the boat! Gigantic!”

Ah, that niggle had been put to rest. Now, he could focus on much more important things: a quick search of the premises. He lugged himself upward and headed for the shelves.</span>

Did Donald have motion pictures during his time? It was a world of Magecraft and monsters, though. Anything was possible.

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s Titanic, Donald. Titanic!</strong>&quot; Granel said, as he looked back into Dante&#39;s dark book of secrets. Secretly, though, he was glad that Donald took some interest in his obsession with old media. It was embarrassing that someone like him was interested in something like this.

Dante&#39;s Little Black Book was detailed in Dante&#39;s journey since he had ended up on Nirvana. Poor guy. He had been through a lot since he had landed on Nirvana, having fought a whole slew of natives and Servants. It was rough. 

Then again, it was rough for all of them. None of the Investigation Team would be doing so hot. At least Dante had his Saber.

Granel flipped to the end of the journal and tore out a page, before scribbling a letter.

<em>To Mister Dante,</em>

<em>This is Granel, the Canopus Security Personal. I hope you remember me, though you often had your nose in a book. You did have a tendency to not watch where you were going...</em>

<em>I digress, I have survived the Canopus&#39;s assault, having summoned my Servant. Nirvana is worse than expected.</em>

<em>I cannot divulge much information in case this is intercepted. I am alive. My Servant is alive. We have a hideout by the lake, though I will not state specifics.</em>

<em>To Mister Dante&#39;s Servant: please keep him safe, along with any other survivors.</em>

<em>From Granel.</em>

&quot;<strong>Let&#39;s go, Donald.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted, tossing the journal onto the desk where it was, before walking up behind Donald, who was pondering the shelves.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Titanic?! Who the ‘ell names whats-it-called Titanic?” Donald said. Whatever, he had about zero stake in the actual name of the movie. Hell, he wasn’t quite sure what it was about anyway. The Throne only went so far when it gave him precursory knowledge of the world he was going to join. It sure didn’t classify Ti-whatever as super important.

Besides, there was something a little more important in front of him: food! His mouth watered at the mere sight of food not drier than the desert they found themselves in or flavorless as the sand from the aforementioned desert. Cameran seemed to agree, if his antennae were a good judge of that thing.

Donald didn’t want to take too much, though. He’d been punished for that well enough in his first life. Instead, he only took two apples snuggled near the back of the cabinet. Their golden yellow and cherry red exterior promised the world and then some. 

“But we just got ‘ere,” Donald complained. “I ain’t sure me heart can take that hellscape just yet. What ‘bout Cameran? D’ya think he can even take the sand?”

His words were nothing more than that, though, as he made his way to the entrance. They both knew that they had to act on their vague leads. 

Maybe the sandstorm had stopped in the time they had wasted in here?</span>

Granel was surprised that Donald had bonded together with the roach so quickly, though there were plenty of signs that pointed to it. When tasked with <em>reading</em>, befriending a roach seemed way more appealing.

&quot;<strong>It was living in that wall for at least several months. I think it can take some sand. Might not even be blowing out there. William got in, didn&#39;t he?</strong>&quot; Granel pondered as he fed Cameran a random crumb from his suit pocket. Wonderful. Even <em>he</em> was warming up to the roach.

He didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry at that development.

With knowledge on Dante&#39;s workshop, along with the history of <em>shshshshsh&#39;s</em> ultimate fate, it was time to retreat, reflect, and mourn. Then, the duo (trio) would decide their next move.

&quot;<strong>The center of Nirvana, huh...?</strong>&quot; Granel thought aloud as he walked after Donald. &quot;<strong>This place is already rotten to the core. Let&#39;s see how bad this infection really is.</strong>&quot; Master and Servant left Dante&#39;s workshop, with Granel turning to look back at it, before following his Servant into the sand.</span>
