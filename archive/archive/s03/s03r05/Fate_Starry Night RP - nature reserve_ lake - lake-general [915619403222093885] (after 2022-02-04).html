It hasn’t been maintained in ages, but the system’s self-cleaning equipment seems to be functioning to this day. The lake has a high density of fish inhabiting it, along with small woodland creatures occupying the grassy areas. Rabbits, toads and cats are very common. Unlike other animals on the island, animals residing at the lake are relatively docile and tranquil. As a result, it is somewhat of a safe haven for the investigators.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A few hours after they&#39;d returned from the <span class="mention">#desert-hospital</span>, Scylla was gone. 

To be more precise, she had stormed off, after causing as much ruckus as she could muster to distract, deflect, and deny Koji of the satisfaction of prying into her secrets and examining her hidden mysteries. She&#39;d nearly torn the door off its hinges as she made her grand escape, and Koji had to spend the better part of the next morning arranging for it to be fixed, along with the broken window from which William had been tossed out. 

What is it with Servants and their unorthodox handling of anything mounted on a frame? Even his birds, trained or otherwise, had more common sense.

It had been two days since then. Scylla was still nowhere to be seen. 

She hadn&#39;t even tried to respond to the numerous prodding via their telepathic link! <em>&#39;Where are you?&#39;</em> No response. <em>&#39;Return to me this instant.&#39;</em> Ignored. <em>&#39;There is an outsider in my backyard. I need you to deal with them asap.&#39;</em> Who was he kidding? He could count the number of people who knew of his home with one hand, and he wasn&#39;t referring to those archaic numbering systems that allowed you to count up to 10 at once. 

It was apparent by this point that Scylla was blatantly avoiding him. As for why that was, he had a hunch. Maybe it was more than a hunch, but he&#39;d been too steeped in the thought of his research to dwell on the skittish manner in which Scylla had danced around the topic of those deep blue flames.

It was ironic how everything connected to his research. Instead of finding a necromancer who could show him the ropes of true resurrection, he had been <em>&#39;blessed&#39;</em> with a great oaf who could regenerate...but only if he were alive enough in the first place; a Berserker that was a blatant hack of his experiments...but with nary a drop of sanity to spare; and the inexplicable restorative capabilities of his own Servant...if only he still had a Servant around to interview!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was really, <em>really</em> hard to hide his irritation these days!

Even the glimmer of the lake&#39;s calm veneer lost its charm. Koji walked along the water&#39;s edge, watching the birds dart and flicker across the water&#39;s surface in pursuit of their next meals. They did this religiously, day after day, their movements fueled by pure instinct. The kind of instinct that told them if they didn&#39;t hunt, they&#39;d starve. 

No birds - no <em>creatures</em> - wanted to starve.

Perhaps he&#39;d been going about this all wrong. Maybe all that he had needed to motivate Scylla was as simple as-

<em>&#39;Oh god, I can&#39;t swim. I&#39;m going to drown. Help, someone help me.&#39;</em>

Koji made a few exclamations via his telepathic link. He focused his thoughts on an old piece of memory, where he&#39;d come back from birding and found his newspaper budgie drowning in its water dish. He did his best to envision what the ordeal must&#39;ve felt like as the bird flailed in the water and tried to beat its wings to safety. 

<em>&#39;Someone, anyone. I&#39;m going to die. I don&#39;t want to die! <strong>Help!</strong>&#39;</em> He channeled more emotion into his head voice as he remembered himself choking on the <span class="mention">#merch-store</span>&#39;s sweet tea, which had more sugar than tea. 

Next, he picked out a flat block of stone by the lake and sat on it, now thinking very hard about how shiny the lake&#39;s surface was. Nirvana had several bodies of water, but only one lake large and deep enough to drown in.

And thus the line had been cast.</span>

It started as faint phantom pains and intrusive thoughts that entered his mind and left just as quickly. Slowly they grew in intensity from ignorable to minor concern. The rustling of the brush from behind Koji alerted him to someone approaching. A slow methodical gait could be heard and a single flashing purple light could be seen in the darkness.

Alex Bondre stepped into the light and onto the shore of the lake. The hole in their helmet had been hastily patched over with what looked like a lead plate and superglue. However, it wasn&#39;t enough to hide the long streak of dried blood that ran down the helmet all the way along the front of their coat. In addition, a large stick was impaled in their right thigh. However, Alex gave no sign of distress or pain.

<strong>&quot;Doctor.&quot;</strong> The mechanical voice calmly rang out. <strong>&quot;I require medical attention.&quot;</strong>

Blood slowly dripped from Alex&#39;s impaled thigh.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Silence. Such was the connection between Koji and Rider, much like the lake upon which his gaze settled. Utterly still, devoid of movement, devoid of activity. Even if he were to cast a stone into it, the resulting ripples would inevitably fade, and it would return to the previous state of silence. 

So, then, this was the trump card. A hook, baited with the prospect of his death, the severing of their connection, the loss of her anchor, and an inevitable death. With such a grim alternative proposed, surely she would come running to prevent it. Surely, his servant would arrive in the nick of time to pluck him free from the water, to prevent him from &quot;drowning&quot;. Surely, that would be the case.

Minutes passed. An understandable delay. Scylla was, after all, rather slow. It was unlikely she would arrive so swiftly under such short notice.

Dozens of minutes passed. Still understandable. Koji could not rightfully say where Scylla currently was, after all. If she was halfway across Nirvana, it would take time for her to arrive. 

Hours passed. Any understanding that the doctor clung to had surely began to wane. What a lousy lifeguard. If this truly was a life-or-death situation, then the would-be drowner would be a bloated corpse floating on the lake&#39;s surface by now. But, it was not all doom and gloom. After all, though he did not catch the fish he wanted, he still caught a fish. Alexander Bondre. Though hardly ideal, perhaps there were still-

<em><strong>GRAB.</strong></em> Alex would find himself hoisted off the ground by the scruff of his coat, held by a certain Rider. Even through his helmet, he would be able to tell her gaze was brimming with rage, enough to bore through stone and steel alike. It did not take an empath to tell she was <em>furious</em>.

<strong>&quot;Cease your suffocation, metal siren, and release Naoharu Koji.&quot;</strong> She growled, a talon tapping against the side of his helm. <strong>&quot;I require him to remain alive. If you do not comply, then I will break you.&quot;</strong></span>

Had her ignoring of him truly reached such a height? Or was she simply that paranoid that she believed a man could drown on dry land? Either way, Koji had reeled in Scylla, hook, line and sinker!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The splash of his fishing line stirred, but the result was far from what he had expected or desired. It wasn&#39;t his Servant, much less one of the scouting birds he had dispatched to look for traces of William. A lone shadow parted the greens behind him with little concern, and Koji tilted his head enough to catch a glimpse of what he could only assume to be a modern art piece in the shape of a large egg.

He turned around, more properly this time, and found himself in the presence of an urban myth.

Which would be a bit of a stretch, really. He&#39;d never have claimed to <em>know</em> the man, per se, but he&#39;d seen him around. Not plenty, but enough. A glimpse at the merch store, a brush of the shoulders at the hospital. He&#39;d never treated him personally, and thus never needed to know him personally. Though there had been rumors that dogged his steps...

&#39;Treatment.&#39; Koji echoed the request of the wounded man. &#39;For you, or a street full of people you knocked out in the middle of the shopping district? Both will cost. But my time cannot be bought. Not today.&#39; He said, absentmindedly rubbing the length of his leg that had suddenly started feeling very sore. Had he been sitting for too long? Perhaps he should walk a bit, get some blood flowing in his legs again.

Nevertheless, his lips thinned into a smile, the type that was neither apologetic nor guilty. A professional smile in the presence of a potential patient, only that he was turning Alex down matter-of-factly, as if he were already preoccupied with something else.

<em>Lies.</em> For as long as the walk took for Alex to approach him, Koji did nothing but sit on the rock and stare into space...Which only made it all the more disconcerting when Alex couldn&#39;t detect a grain of nervousness from the doctor. He <em>really</em> meant what he&#39;d said, being busy and all that. But busy with what? The intensive task of catching wind blowing ripples across the water-

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A bigger presence loomed behind Alex, snatching him up as if he were the bait that had lured her there. 

Koji&#39;s eyes flitted to the face of his Servant, who had shown up fashionably late, but just the fact that she had shown up at all was a good omen. It seemed that his bait had worked, it not a little untimely and a little misguided. 

&#39;Put the man down. You&#39;ll break the heart of every bard on the island if they&#39;d catch wind of their favorite urban legend&#39;s demise.&#39; Koji greeted Scylla in the usual fashion, a slap to the wrist for her behavior instead of a tearful reunion. For all her running and rushing, this was the thanks she would get?

Though his expression didn&#39;t change much, Koji&#39;s mood had improved profoundly. Alex could practically feel relief radiating from the doctor, like a flood of water where a damn had broken. There were also splashes of concern, though he couldn&#39;t get a good feel for whom it was directed towards...

&#39;Where have you been?&#39;

Guess that solved the little problem.</span>

The purple light on Alex&#39;s helmet gazed indignantly at Scylla before turning to look at Koji, perfectly fine and undrowned, sitting comfortably on a rock not ten feet away from them. Alex turned back towards Scylla, then to Koji, then back to Scylla again.

<strong>&quot;Loud...and oblivious.&quot;</strong> The synthesized voice spoke, irritated.

Was she the phantom Servant Alex was seeking? The originator of that horrific shriek that struck Alex to their very core? Alex would have to observe further, it was the main reason they had sought out Naoharu Koji.

Alex tilted their head at the sudden rush of relief coming from Koji at the arrival of his presumed Servant.

<strong>&quot;Wait...&quot;</strong>

Alex then pulled out a newspaper and began to look through it. If she looked down, Scylla could catch glimpses of an article with some extremely sensual takes on the nature of her and Koji&#39;s relationship, complete with numerous statements on her breasts.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thankfully, Koji speaking up was all that was necessary to spare Alex from a rather grim and bloody end. At the sound of his voice, Scylla turned to face the doctor, her expression initially melting into relief, before immediately hardening into disdain. He was not drowning. He was not even wet! Damned liar!

With a low growl, Rider dropped Alex, allowing him to land back on his feet as her ire fully shifted to her master. With her new target in sights, a tendrils snaked its way out of her shoulder, before lashing out and--

<em>BONK!</em> Koji was thwapped in the head, a moist slapping noise filling the air. The blow was not very hard, nor very painful. Was this her idea of a reprimand? Did she truly expect such a limp gesture to bother him after the previous maulings she&#39;d delivered?

No, actually. As the tendril retracted back to its owner, the doctor would be struck by the stench of rotting fish that had just made itself at home within his hair. Had she just...?

<strong>&quot;I was unaware it was possible for a human to</strong> <em><strong>drown on dry land,</strong></em> <strong>Naoharu Koji. You truly are the most irritating man I have had the displeasure of existing around.&quot;</strong>

Scylla had made a point to ignore Koji&#39;s question. But, a keen eye could spot the stubborn flecks of flesh wedged between her bared fangs, the faint stains of red deep underneath her nails. No doubt, she had been hunting. Stalking the investigators? No, she hadn&#39;t used enough mana for that. More likely, it was picking off stray islanders who wandered too close to the water&#39;s edge, savaging gang members and cultists for an easy meal. 

Her attention shifted again, back from Koji over to Alex. Or, more specifically, the papers he was holding. Ugh, speaking of irritating, look at all those words! Just looking at them made her brain begin to tune out. Immediately, her eyes were drawn to the largest piece of text, the title of article.</span>

A shriek tore free from her throat, one carrying even more rage than she mustered when fighting against Donald and Vortigern combined. Such insolence! Her? With him??? What kind of foolishly foolish fool would write such tripe?! And why were they so intent on glamorising her wretched flesh? Why spend so many words on this filth of a vessel? Such a worthless document! It was vile! Vile! VileVileVileVileVILEVILEVILEVILE<strong>VILEVILEVILE!!!!!</strong>

<em>SKRRRRRIP!</em> Yet another tendril lashed out of her body, this one striking the newspaper. But compared to the harmlessness of the one that stroke Koji, this one was anything but, covered with so many barbs, thorns, and spikes that it practically reduced to tabloid to confetti in seconds. Even then, it continued to thrash out at the shredded paper, smashing it at least a dozen times before it slowed to a halt.

The sheer incandescent fury bubbling within Scylla was evident for both men to see. Evidently, a nerve had just been touched.</span>

Hair matted and slick with what he could only presume to be sea rot, the doctor ran a hand through his hair and was rewarded with a slippery, gooey, rotting fish that had started to adopt a foul green sheen.

Koji did his best to look unbothered as he flung the fish away as far as he could. Which was to say not very far, as his grip was weak and his fingers slipped, causing the fish to travel a scant step&#39;s distance before landing in the grass with a wet slap.

He slowly, meticulously wiped his hand clean on the rock.

&#39;Oh, it&#39;s a figure of speech.&#39; He returned Scylla&#39;s scathing remarks with a wry smile. &#39;I was simply drowning in boredom. Though a dead fish hardly passes for entertainment.&#39;

He stood up and moved a good pace away from the now defiled rock, rounding on Scylla&#39;s prize catch instead. A newspaper? Aside from patching up his wounds, this helmeted man came here personally to deliver him newspaper? Now that was unexpected.

He took a step closer. The date on the newspaper read February 4.

&#39;That&#39;s two days old.&#39; The doctor said flatly, his curiosity fading. &#39;I already skimmed it. <em>Twice.</em>&#39; <em>Because William had penned a few articles in it, inevitably giving himself away. The little shit had snuck back onto the island after all. Death threats notwithstanding.</em>
 
Koji stared at Alex more intently now, a tinge of irritation setting in. What was this man&#39;s purpose in bringing him this particular issue of the Nirvana Times? To rub salt in his wounds? They barely knew each other!

&#39;I don&#39;t mean to pry.&#39; <em>Oh yes he did.</em> &#39;But what am I supposed to be looking at-&#39;

A snowfall of shredded paper fell from the sky next, coating his still sticky head and settling on the grass in a small pile. Koji blew confetti away from his eyes while Scylla continued to assault the newspaper&#39;s remains, beating them senseless and pulpy with her tentacles. He took a few measured steps back, putting him safely out of harm&#39;s way. He was getting pretty good at eyeing the lengths of Scylla&#39;s varying appendages.

Meanwhile, the show continued to be downright baffling.

Koji waited for Scylla to calm down.

&#39;...Is this supposed to be your newest attempt at entertainment?&#39; He asked as he combed handfuls of confetti out of his hair, hardly hiding the incredulity in his voice. &#39;It&#39;s alarming at best. Are you allergic to paper and ink?&#39; It was a genuine question, though one that hardly put him in Scylla&#39;s good graces...

Though it seemed that Koji wasn&#39;t the least bit aware of the suffering Scylla was going through. Had he no heart? Or was he truly dense? Instead his attention was captured by Alex, who began to receive a blur of emotions as the doctor&#39;s mood soured.

&#39;I&#39;ve waited.&#39; He said testily. <em>Irritation.</em> &#39;What now? Tell me this isn&#39;t what you had in mind. If nothing else, it paints a dubious picture of your intentions.&#39; <em>Doubt.</em> &#39;Makes me wonder whether it really is medical attention that you seek.&#39;

His gaze fell upon Alex&#39;s splintered leg. <em>Stronger doubt.</em> <em>Hostility.</em>

It seemed that Alex needed to work on his delivery a bit more.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Scylla and Koji felt a brief surge of intrusive thoughts and phantom feelings as Alex tilted their head as they were deep in thought. Even while injured, Alex felt good about their chances in taking on Koji alone in a fight. The real problem was Scylla, Alex was fairly confident that she wasn&#39;t the servant they were looking for. She was emotional yes, but she lacked the primal anguish of that horrific wail. Regardless, she could still tear Alex limb from limb without any effort.

Alex thought deeply, dredging up old memories. Long before they had been afflicted with their cursed ability, before their family reviled them, back when Alex was just the heir to a noble house learning etiquette from their father.

<strong>&quot;I...apologize.&quot;</strong> The mechanized voice spoke awkwardly. <strong>&quot;I shouldn&#39;t pry into your...personal relationships. None of my business. I simply...used the paper to find where you were. I would...normally tend to my own wounds. But...one of the invaders bashed my skull in...maybe...not completely sure. I need...professional help.&quot;</strong>

Alex tried to speak with earnest honesty, however they were acting quite lucid for someone with a supposed traumatic head injury. Although the large streaks of dried blood and damaged helmet did give Alex some credence. They also never mentioned or gave any notice to the stick embedded in their leg. Did Alex even know it was there?</span>

It was unclear whether Scylla&#39;s comment was meant to be directed at Koji or Alex. Either way, it seemed that the one comment of barely repressed seething anger would be the extent of her seething rage towards the two. Probably for the best. Had she truly cared about it, no doubt she would have dealt a more vicious wound to the doctor, likely delivered through the medium of a vicious claw or striking tentacle. A single comment was much preferable.

<strong>&quot;I doubt you can do much for this false Talos. But, if you wish to play artificer, I shall give you ten minutes.&quot;</strong> Rider snarled, looking between Koji and Alex as she did so. Did she believe Alex to be a golem of some sort, an automata? His ominous helm certainly give him that sort of appearance, but no matter the case, the beast did not linger longer than that. Again - probably for the best. 

With that, she stomped off to the lake nearby, walking down the bank as she submerged herself up to her neck. Still within range to hear them, of course, but not so far that the empath could try anything against her anchor without suffering immediate retribution. 

In the meantime, she had plenty of time to &quot;herself&quot;. Time which would be effectively spent seething...</span>

It is as you see.&#39; He gestured at his Servant as she brushed past and skittered to the lake, various appendages and foul mood included. &#39;I pay the bill, and she provides the services that I require. It&#39;s adequate,&#39; he added after a moment&#39;s consideration, as if weighing the costs in his head. 

He was making small talk, exchanging what could almost pass as pleasantries, but Alex could tell that he was far from getting the man to drop his guard. It wasn&#39;t until the mentioning of invaders that he sensed sparks of new emotions in the mix. <em>Curiosity. Excitement.</em> They were strong enough to override the influx of mental interference Alex had fed him, sharp enough that it made Alex wonder whether he had infringed something personal. 

He did. Koji regarded Alex thoughtfully. He scanned his fellow Islander up and down, as if seeing him for the first time, his eyes lingering on the wounds long enough to make Alex feel uncomfortable. <em>Contemplative.</em> Was he trying to figure out the best way to treat Alex&#39;s wounds, or was he studying them for some other purpose?

Then, out of the corner of his eye, Alex saw the doctor close the distance between them, hand raised towards his head - his <em>helmet</em>, he realized with alarm.

&#39;I&#39;ll need to take a look at your skull then.&#39; He heard the doctor say, his inflections betraying nothing of his bubbling excitement. &#39;How did they do it? Magecraft?&#39; He could feel Koji&#39;s fingers on the helmet. &#39;What did they look like?&#39; The barest hint of anticipation touched the doctor&#39;s voice.</span>

They become more on edge the more they conversed, sensing Koji’s intentions. Koji did seem very interested at the mention of the invaders. Alex remembered that the man they encountered mentioned Koji specifically, perhaps they fought before.

<strong>“You can’t have my helmet.”</strong> Alex starkly replied before pulling at the lead plate attached to the helmet, eventually wrenching it free. Exposing the damage and the wound underneath.

Again, the intrusive thoughts and phantom pains came again. This time more violently and noticeable before quickly passing.

A blast of jumbled thoughts hit him as Alex peeled back the crude plating and exposed the hole in his helmet. For an instant his leg lit up with pain, and so did his head, as well as a few spots across his front and back. The locations were eerily similar to what he could perceive on Alex.

Then the sensation lulled. It died as quickly as it came, but the doctor was well and truly disturbed. The locations of the phantom pains mirrored the injuries on Alex&#39;s body. The timing was also impeccable. It was too much to be a coincidence. 

Koji sighed, took hold of Alex&#39;s helmet, and turned it so the hole faced him and the light. &#39;You are not making this easy for me. If you can&#39;t get these projections under control, then you&#39;ll be walking all the way to the hospital.&#39; He said sternly. &#39;Now look at me.&#39; 

He brushed the blood-soaked bangs out of Alex&#39;s single revealed eye and looked at it speculatively, then pulled back his eyelid. &#39;Look up,&#39; he said, then, without pausing, repeated his previous question.

&#39;Tell me who did this to you. Every single place you&#39;ve been, every single outsider you&#39;ve met. Consider it an assessment of your cognitive functions.&#39; He started prodding Alex&#39;s scalp to gauge the extent of his trauma.</span>

The blood, dry and clotted, perhaps a day or two old. Any normal person should&#39;ve been in incredible pain, yet Alex continued to stand there quietly, silently following the doctor&#39;s instructions.

<strong>&quot;I wasn&#39;t part of the initial attack. Too noisy. Moved in at night, after the first wave fell back. Found a few invaders hiding out. Dispatched them without much effort. The one who did this.&quot;</strong> Alex pointed at their head injury. For something to have punched straight through that helmet and into Alex&#39;s skull, it had to have been an extremely powerful blow.

<strong>&quot;Different story. Young man, tanned with white hair. Strong. Absurdly so. Filled with hate. You&#39;ve probably met him if his half-truths have any merit. He was looking for Shakespeare at the <span class="mention">#merch-store</span>. He told me that the trespassing bard assisted the invaders.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Then I will work on you for as long as you can hold it back. Deal?&#39; Koji said as he examined Alex&#39;s wounds more closely. Alex&#39;s eye didn&#39;t seem to be damaged, which meant all of the blood came from the lacerations and cracks on his visibly deformed skull. 

And there were many. Koji&#39;s fingers traced the wounds, which had all but dried after what he could only assume to be a significant amount of time, if what Alex had been saying was true-

With great effort, he whipped his hand back to stop himself from digging into Alex&#39;s skull as the latter started talking about William. Along with a man with features that matched the one he had encountered on the ship. His emotions went haywire for a moment as he tried to recollect himself, but they were too jumbled for Alex to dissect.

But receiving a reaction like that was already telling enough. Either or both, it seemed that Koji had unfinished business with the ones Alex had met at the merch store.

Koji drew a deep breath. 

&#39;Surviving a head wound like yours isn&#39;t unheard of,&#39; he transitioned smoothly into his purported role. &#39;But did you mean to tell me that you&#39;ve been walking around <em>with</em> the injury all this time?&#39; He asked with mild disapproval. &#39;Consider yourself extremely lucky that you didn&#39;t bleed out. Have you taken any drugs?&#39;

He already knew the answer. Alex&#39;s eye responded to light and motion well enough while he examined it. The man was not under the influence of drugs, which could only mean one of two things.

Koji reached for the back of Alex&#39;s hand and pinched the skin there, hard. He studied Alex&#39;s face, eyebrow arched, and tried to look for some sort of reaction. <em>Does that hurt?</em> He seemed to ask, and Alex could see the question in his eyes.</span>

If he hasn&#39;t died yet then he is no doubt still feeling its effects.&quot;</strong>

As Koji pinched Alex&#39;s gloved hand, they didn&#39;t give any reaction to it. Almost like they didn&#39;t feel it at all.

<strong>&quot;It&#39;s been a day or two since the invader smashed my helmet in. Even with your address, it wasn&#39;t easy to get here. I didn&#39;t take any drugs...if you&#39;re going to prescribe painkillers...keep them...Doesn&#39;t do anything for me.&quot;</strong>

The branch sticking out of Alex&#39;s leg continued to drip with blood. A fresher wound no doubt, but did Alex even know it was there?

Alex stared at Koji for a long moment before finally recognizing that their hand was being pinched.

<strong>&quot;I can still feel that...if that&#39;s what you&#39;re curious about.&quot;</strong> Alex informed Koji.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji was somewhat taken aback by Alex&#39;s revelation. &#39;Okay, no painkillers,&#39; he said slowly, not taking his eyes off Alex. &#39;If you insist.&#39;

He let the silence hang in the air for a moment. Then he nodded thoughtfully. &#39;So this is where the cyborg rumors started. Pain inhibitors, I presume?&#39; 

Was it self-inflicted? Involuntary? Was it going to cause complications during healing? Did he care to know?

Of course not. Alex had already vouched for himself. If he wanted to be foolish, then Koji was happy to oblige. 

Besides, he had already heard everything he needed to know. Koji caught himself wondering whether he should start checking the ditches for a larger-than-average corpse in the upcoming days. Would the security guard&#39;s regenerative ability outlast the damage from a Noble Phantasm? It could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to study its effects.

His mouth quirked at the thought. His hands, on the other hand, went back to their business and fussed over Alex&#39;s injuries. Alex felt a prickly warmth against the cracked side of his head. Then the doctor&#39;s thumb was on his forehead, scratching away some of the caked blood before rubbing against the gash itself...

&#39;This one&#39;ll heal on its own.&#39; Alex heard a small <em>hmph</em>, then Koji left his skull alone and crouched to study the branch sticking out of his thigh. 

&#39;I suppose you&#39;ll now tell me that you can feel this branch, but you simply forgot.&#39; Once again, Alex sensed disapproval in the doctor&#39;s voice. &#39;Look at how much you&#39;re bleeding because you insisted on moving around.&#39;

Koji tutted out of annoyance, then turned to the lake. <strong>&#39;Rider!&#39;</strong> He called for his Servant. &#39;Stop sulking and come help.&#39; 

He motioned towards the branch. &#39;Trim the shorter end and pull it out,&#39; he said, reaching for his own cane. A moment later, a mass of thin and supple vines split from the head of the cane and started winding themselves around the length of Alex&#39;s leg, sandwiching the impalement like makeshift bandages.</span>

It didn&#39;t nullify the brewing rampage, but rather, diluted it to a seething sulk. Still, a bad mood was dangerous no matter the circumstances, especially when dealing with a wild animal. One could never tell how much it would take to make a cornered rat bite.

Still, Koji could make an estimated guess, better than anyone else currently on Nirvana. It was with that in mind he called upon his Rider, the woman climbing up the shore and onto land. At first, her expression appeared to soften. Were they finally done with this farcical outing?

No. She was being called to be a surgical assistant. Actually, that was too generous a term. A surgical <em>tool</em>.

The scowl that appeared on her face as she glared at the doctor was akin to the gaze of the gorgon, hazardous to health. Irritation radiated off her, bordering on malice.

But, nevertheless, it was restrained. With the attitude that one might expect from a teenager being made to do their chores, three tendrils snaked out from her crossed arms. <em>SNAP! SNAP!</em> Two clean slices cut the extremities of the branch to splinters, and with one final <em>YOINK!</em>, the body, too, was pulled free, then dropped to the grass below. 

A job well done. Or, well, a job done, depending on how one viewed her handiwork.</span>

&#39;Got the anger out of your system?&#39; He asked as the branch made a final crisp <em>SNAP!</em> against her tendrils, as if she&#39;d broken them in such a way to mimic the sound of spines cracking. &#39;There are plenty of trees around if you find this method of de-stressing to your liking.&#39; He quipped, before turning to examine her handiwork. 

A momentary pause was followed by an inaudible sigh. &#39;...It&#39;s sloppy. You are getting some practice later.&#39; Koji declared finally, but his tone was surprisingly...flat. Scylla had expected more vehement judging, but for once, it seemed that someone else was taking the brunt of the doctor&#39;s annoyance in her stead. 

Indeed, Koji didn&#39;t even mention how her complete lack of caution had tore the wound open, or left splinters in the flesh. He plucked out the few his fingers could comfortably reach, then allowed the vines to finish wrapping over the wound to choke the blood flow.

Alex felt tightness over his wound, then a similar prickly sensation throughout his leg. The bleeding had visibly come to a halt.

&#39;Remove the wrapping after the pain subsides.&#39; Koji addressed Alex, then paused, realizing the issue. &#39;Wait five minutes,&#39; he paused again, then amended himself. &#39;Fifteen, just to be sure. If you insist on moving throughout, add ten more minutes.&#39;

&#39;I don&#39;t have a watch, by the way. So you&#39;ll have to keep track yourself. Usually, my patients come with functioning pain receptors.&#39; He glanced at Alex meaningfully.</span>

As soon as Koji was done with Alex&#39;s head wound they immediately pulled out the lead plate and a roll of duct tape. Alex then quickly covered the break in the helmet and began wrapping duct tape over their head to hold it in place.

As Scylla approached, Alex watched her warily. They could feel the agitation radiating off the servant, not a malicious one but it was anger nonetheless.

<strong>&quot;Oh. That was actually there.&quot;</strong> Alex mused when the branch sticking in their leg was pointed out. <strong>&quot;I fell unconcious a few times on the way here...unrelated to my physical injuries. Must&#39;ve happened then.&quot;</strong>

Alex didn&#39;t even flinch as the stick was surgically removed from their leg. It had to have been an inch or two deep in there. How Alex was unflinching to such injuries and their comment on not having any means of inhibiting pain left a foreboding feeling.

Alex meanwhile relaxed somewhat. Koji and his Servant weren&#39;t the ones Alex was looking for. Unfortunately that meant that Alex had no more leads to the source of that horrific wail nearly a week ago. As Alex pondered however a memory came to mind, one of a nasty and loud woman.

<strong>&quot;Doctor...&quot;</strong> The mechanical voice rang out. <strong>&quot;Do you know a woman by the name...Ruth Naomi?&quot;</strong></span>

The brief but blessed silence of Rider was inevitably broken. Was it a joke? Perhaps, but even if it was a humorous seed, she did not intend to let it take root and become something more serious. Fighting servants was one thing, but really? To be a glorified scalpel? Could he not make do with a kitchen knife? Perhaps a pizza cutter, if her truly felt so slovenly?

<strong>&quot;Speaking of time...&quot;</strong> Rider&#39;s still-wet hand landed on Koji&#39;s shoulder as her tendrils retreated back into her flesh, her grip both a reminder of her presence, and a threat. <strong>&quot;Three minutes. Finish your work by then. If not, your patient will simply have to suffice with what work you have already done.&quot;</strong>

While it was all well and good to treat the sick and wounded, it brought Koji no closer to his goal, and it brought Scylla neither pleasure nor contentment. They&#39;d already wasted enough time. This remainder was the rest she would allow them to waste.

At that, she took a few steps back, her gaze burning a hole into the back of Koji as she manually counted every second that passed in her head.</span>

&#39;Oh dear, I wasn&#39;t aware that I had more appointments waiting today.&#39; He responded scathingly. &#39;What do I have next? A fishing date with my Servant?&#39; 

He straightened his clothes and tucked his cane securely under his arm. &#39;You are an enigma, Mr. Bondre. Any sane person would&#39;ve just booked a house call.&#39; He said in between the ripping sound of tape being pulled off the roll as Alex started fixing his helmet. 

&#39;Though I won&#39;t dwell on your peculiar inclinations so long as you can pay for the service. In light of everything that&#39;s happened...&#39; 

Koji thought for a while. He cast a quick glance at the torn newspapers scattered upon the grass, then ran through the recent memories of his run-ins with Ruth. He did know a thing or two about the woman...

&#39;That&#39;s not an easy thing to answer.&#39; The doctor shook his head. He stirred the pile of papers with his cane, singled out a piece, and tapped on it as if to make a point. It read <em><strong>-dam Ruth&#39;s Su-</strong></em> in bold print. An advertisement for her Sunday Mass. 

&#39;She&#39;s found herself quite the fan at the news agency,&#39; he said, now tapping on another torn piece of paper with the initials <em><strong>G.C.V.</strong></em> with pinpoint precision. &#39;With advertisements like that, surely all of Nirvana knows her one way or another?&#39; 

&#39;So I can only surmise that what you want to know is on a more personal level. Why don&#39;t you be more specific, and I&#39;ll see what I can do? Of course, I will require compensation depending on the questions asked.&#39; He said pleasantly, then glanced in Scylla&#39;s direction pointedly. &#39;Since my newly appointed <em>secretary</em> is holding my free time hostage, let&#39;s make it quick.&#39;</span>

Alex gazed down at the piece of paper Koji tapped and the initials G.C.V. Another potential lead perhaps.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji blankly watched the coins and papers fall to the ground. After a moment his mind made <em>a</em> connection. <em>Gift shop souvenirs?</em>

Alas, he was not a native, and in that moment, the inexperience showed. Working with the hospitals meant that his paychecks had always been deposited directly into his credit account, converted into digital tokens, and widely accepted in every store he could possibly need to purchase goods from. Scylla may be familiar with these trinkets&#39; purpose, but for Koji, who had lived his whole life without ever having been exposed to physical currency, Alex may as well have been performing some kind of ritual.

And so he regarded Alex&#39;s behavior as such, having already witnessed much more eccentric behaviors from him in the not so distant past. No point lingering on it. He tapped the side of his cane thoughtfully as he started constructing his answer.

It took no time at all.

&#39;With questions as broad as yours, Rider will have my head on a platter long before I&#39;m done listing her favorite wines.&#39; He said dryly. &#39;Instead of settling for secondhand accounts, why don&#39;t you visit her personally? See for yourself what she&#39;s like in private.&#39;

The nearby trees rustled. A thrush flew swiftly out of the hedge, circled the Nirvanans briefly, then landed on top of Alex&#39;s taped up helmet. It pecked the metal plating, and Alex heard the echoes coming from his left. Was it trying to give him directions?

&#39;If you start walking now, you could make it to her private residence in a day, but the front gates will be locked. But if you wait until the day after tomorrow,&#39; he gave Alex an amused look, &#39;then she&#39;ll welcome you with open arms. There is an arrangement for a gathering of sorts.&#39;

Was this the one? The source of that horrific noise that so dreadfully disturbed Alex&#39;s well constructed peace? Of course the loud woman would&#39;ve summoned someone like that.

It was a good thing that Alex had gotten all he wanted from Koji, for his (rather ungenerous) three minutes had come to a close. Scylla stepped forward, and like a tired owner picking up a grouchy cat, scooped the doctor up into her arms. Given how she was still soaked, it was a very <em>moist</em> experience.

<em><strong>&quot;Do not lie to me again.&quot;</strong></em> Rider hissed as she looked down at Koji. It was evident she was still upset about the &quot;drowning&quot; charade. Reasonably so, perhaps, but that was another matter entirely. A matter that would likely be handled privately.

With master in hand, Scylla turned to leave, but as she did so, yet another tendril snaked out of her back, this one ending in a crab-like pincer. From Alex&#39;s payment, it picked up all of the prettiest and shiniest coins from the lot, before snaking back, depositing them into her pockets, and leaving the more valuable stacks of paper untouched.

And with that last oddity, the monster marched off, back towards the <span class="mention">#mountain-lodge</span>.</span>
