<em>&#39;Forty-five seconds and counting. How far are we from the ship?&#39;</em>

...

<em><strong>&#39;Scylla.&#39;</strong></em> The doctor&#39;s voice sounded urgent, even a little panicky. It resounded in the back of Scylla&#39;s mind like a cymbal, chasing away her joy of finally being able to swim in a boundless body of salt water. <em><strong>&#39;It&#39;s almost been a full minute. I cannot hold my breath for much longer!&#39;</strong></em>

As if to prove just how close to bursting his lungs were, bubbles began to escape from the doctor&#39;s mouth, signaling the end of his pathetically short dip in the sea. No, this was beyond pathetic. Way past it, and bordering tragic. Was there <em>anything</em> this good(-for-nothing) doctor could do aside from annoying her with birds, toast, and witchcraft?</span>

Granel had abandoned his station as soon as the sea began to transform into a vast ocean of thorns, declaring to all that Nirvana would not allow them to dock. The attempt was vain. Idiotic. The ship would dock, no matter how much damage was done to it.

Granel rushed through the halls as lights lowered to a dull red, signifying the nature of the situation to the entire crew, and still Granel kept running towards his designated S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame, which would allow him to take his position in a way that would make him a threat in a war of Servants.

&quot;<strong>Move! Move! Prepare for impact!</strong>&quot; Granel bellowed to several Canopus crewmen as the ship rocked and groaned, causing Granel to stumble slightly. A few of the addressed crewmen into Granel, which he deftly caught, before letting them get their bearings. He let them go.

He was woefully underprepared. A rookie mistake. He should&#39;ve expected Nirvana to not stand their and wait until their enemies were on their shores.

&quot;<strong>This is security officer Granel.* I&#39;m en route to summon my Servant. Taking my position shortly.</strong>&quot; The guard took large steps, though he was hampered by the sheer activity in the ship. People were running past him, so he was forced to a cautious jog.

Suddenly, he passed a port window right outside his S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame&#39;s storage room, looking through the circular hole out to the ocean. <em>Where was Nirvana? Where is the enemy?</em> He thought, when suddenly...

A whirling typhoon of tendrils tore its way inside the Canopus, ripping up from the bottom of the hull, and rising, whole segments of floor being effortlessly cleaved open. Compared to the wood of the ships of eld, the steel of this modern liner was no different, broken through with as ease, ineffective in the face of the monster. 

The fate of those caught in the crossfire was not much better. Any unfortunate enough to be struck by the flailing tentacles had their body broken at worst, and their life ended at best. Gashes ripped in flesh, whole bones snapped, and the most unfortunate among them having their spines mangled.

Those would be the one that wouldn&#39;t die fast. Those would be the ones who went down with the ship, and died with their lungs full of water, unable to do anything but accept it.

Eventually, Scylla would halt her aggressive ascent, dropping Koji down to the floor. 

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ve carried you far enough.&quot;</strong> Rider growled, dozens of appendages retreating back into her body as she spoke. <strong>&quot;A hunting hound does not make it far when it must carry its &#39;master&#39; on its back. It is not efficient.&quot;</strong>

With that made clear, she would breathe in deeply, smelling the stale air within the ship. Claggy, thick with the stench of oil from the pipes, with hints of blood spilled from severed veins. An intolerable balance. It disgusted the monster inside of her. These grey walls needed to be painted red, the aroma of death omnipresent in the air. A lesson must be taught.

Her neck would snap, through a hole cleaved into the wall, to a wounded man. A survivor of her assault. <em>Unacceptable.</em>

<strong>&quot;THERE YOU ARE!&quot;</strong>

Scylla lunged forth, eager to finish what her tendrils had started. But, unbeknownst to her, this would not be the effortlessly slaying that she had hoped, not at all...</span>

There was little time to act.

As soon as Granel heard the ship&#39;s death throes, he sprinted down the hallway, barreling like a train into to storage room, where his future Servant lay dormant in its locker. The code was complex, and too time consuming to input. 

&quot;<strong>One. Two. THREE!</strong>&quot; Granel bellowed as he reached for his locker door as his muscles threatened to tear his suit.

<strong>RIIPPPPPPPPPPP!</strong> The door came off its hinges.

With a deep breath, Granel lugged his S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame towards the center of the room, where a bucket of paint lie unused, mostly used for the summoning circles by less adept mages. 

Granel wasn&#39;t a mage, so he&#39;d need to take what he could get. He popped the seal off the paint bucket, and dipped his finger into the red liquid.

He was no artist, but he had a distinct memory on what the summoning circle <em>should</em> look like.

Granel sweated as he worked. He had never summoned a Servant for any job like this. He had worked with them, but this was entirely different! What if he lacked the ability to summon a Servant? What happened then?

The security guard&#39;s summoning circle was massive, almost double the size he had seen several of the other investigators make while he lurked on the security cameras. Hopefully it would be good enough.

&quot;<strong>Let steel and silver bind your essence. Let the archeduke of pacts and stone fill your body. Let the four cardinal gates of the castle open and let the crown rotate!</strong>&quot;

The ship continued to groan as the wall in front of Granel was stripped away by Scylla&#39;s ascent. Screams filled his ears.

<em>I couldn&#39;t save you all. I couldn&#39;t protect you. I apologize. I will avenge you.</em></span>

<em>Splatter</em>.

Granel looked down, seeing a massive appendage leave a massive hole in his body. He gurgled in a mix of rage and annoyance. <em>Why now?</em>

He felt his chest. <strong>It</strong> was still there. All was well. The appendage haphazardly left his body, leaving more damage.

That was fine. He could take it. Colors danced in his eyes, and he threatened to tumble over, but he needed to stay active. If he went down now, who knew what could happen.

There was something behind him, but he couldn&#39;t turn around. Not yet.

&quot;<strong>Usher in new power, Seventh Heaven clad with the three great words!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Come forth from the circle, and protect the balance of the world!</strong>&quot;

<em>...and help me bring peace to those that died. Don&#39;t let their deaths be in vain.</em>

<em>Please.</em>

A proclamation of violence, wrath, and spite, fueled by hatred of an enemy he didn&#39;t know. Misguided joy and heroism, walking the line of misguided justice.

The circle sparked.

Then light burst forth.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sure enough, Granel’s desperate plea was heard by the throne. Magical energy burst forth from the husk of the human-like object that had been shoved inside the summoning circle. There were no beautiful colors, nor was it gentle in the slightest. If anything, it was almost as violent as the wish the Master had when performing the ritual. Blinding light exploded from the frame, and for a few moments, it was hard to see much at all.

Those few blinding moments gave the frame enough time to imprint a historical figure. The better question though: what hero would Granel receive? A knight in shining armor, ready to conquer and slay this island? Or perhaps an Anti-hero was in order, to better capitalize on his desire for vengeance? Maybe there was no hero at all. A demon to fight another supposed demon. 

Whatever hope Granel might’ve had was surely dashed against the rocks when the fruits of his labor produced a bulkier individual. A blue cloak was wrapped around their shoulders, which went nearly went to his leather-booted ankles. A white undershirt, leather trousers, and a comically large hat completed the colonial look. A sabre was hung on his left side, with a flintlock pistol holstered on his front, and there was even a feather in–

Was this some embodiment of the Three fucking Musketeers?! 

There was no other person– idea, even– that this person could be. However, this theory wasn’t possible. Why? The throne had brought forth only one person. Sure, that stupid story with <em>French</em> people had a fourth person. Maybe the other three were taking their time?</span>

“Oh ho,” A booming, Scottish voice cried out, “you’ve gotten fortunate– blimey, what in the devils is that?!”

Two things happened at once: the sword was drawn, and Granel’s sanity was saved. For a second there, it was almost like he had summoned a French person! Bullet dodged there. Yet that left about zero immediately recognizable figures for this to be.

This was only some <em>guy</em>. 

Said guy took up a defensive stance. Narrowed eyes met Scylla’s, defiance ablaze within the blue orbs. He wiggled his thick mustache, taking in the thick copper smell that filled the room. Or was that fuel? Probably both, considering the horrid state of the surroundings. 

Things looked dire. Felt dire. Were dire. Great. How long would <em>this</em> expedition last, considering there was a mighty monster and an equally monstrous man with a large hole in his chest? Donald completely overlooked Nauharu, a nonfactor at the moment. Looks like it’d be a short one. Gods be damned, though, if he wasn’t gonna make the most of it.

“Alright, I’ll only ask once: Which of you brought me ‘ere, and why were you lookin’ for a <strong>Caster</strong>?”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Unsurprisingly, perhaps anticlimactically, Koji slid off Scylla and landed on his knees. His sopping wet body shook from the chills as he took great, heaving breaths of air. 

&#39;Safety...over...efficiency.&#39; He said between breaths, unhooking his cane from its accustomed rest on his arm to help himself up. 

It took him a while to reorient himself. His nose was exposed to the thick stench of ammonia, blood, and machine oil. It was unbearable, reminded him of the docks shortly after the trawlers had been abandoned. A putrid, suffocating smell of death within the confines of a giant metal coffin. 

The slaughter had already begun.

But Koji was far from impressed. He scoured his surroundings, eyes trailing over the &#39;path&#39; Scylla had torn through in her wake, men and pieces of men writhing on the floor and crying in pain and fright.

&#39;They haven&#39;t summoned their Servants,&#39; he frowned at the sight, displeased with the waste of talent all around him. &#39;And each one of them had the potential to summon a Servant with the knowledge I need. Do not be hasty, Scylla. From now on, you are to refrain from killing anyone without an accompanying Servant. Do I make myself-&#39;

<em><strong>&#39;-STOP!&#39;</strong></em>

A rush of mana burned through Scylla&#39;s body, empowering her and hurting her all at once. Her blood felt like lava in her veins, and the pain jolted the memory of her recent trauma. It wasn&#39;t enough to disable her, but more then potent enough to shock some much needed sense into her.

<strong>&#39;Did hunger make you deaf to the words of your Master?&#39;</strong> Koji stepped through the hole in the wall, shielding his eyes  from the blinding light in the center of the room. <strong>&#39;Do you not see that this man is in the process of summoning his Servant? You will not kill him until I can evaluate the results of his labor!&#39;</strong></span>

This man didn&#39;t seem like a Servant! If anything, he looked like the type of man Granel would throw out of a bar for loitering and trespassing. A drunk cosplayer, perhaps?

&quot;<strong>Athos.</strong>&quot; Granel said dumbly as he looked at the Servant. If there was any hobby Granel had besides drinking, fighting, and more drinking, it was collecting and watching movies. Three Musketeers came easily to him as a result, due to a certain animated version of the tale played by talking animals.

His mind was rambling. What was he even <em>thinking</em> about? 

&quot;<strong>Which— No. It doesn&#39;t matter.</strong>&quot; Granel groaned as he turned around to see a Servant...

That was no Servant. Granel groaned as he looked at it. That was a <strong>monster</strong>! Then a man entered the room, cane tapping along as he went.

&quot;<strong>You two aren&#39;t on the registrar.</strong>&quot; The man pointed a massive finger towards the man. &quot;<strong>That means only one thing. You&#39;re from Nirvana.</strong>&quot;

That&#39;s right, people from Nirvana were invading the ship. They were under assault. He had momentarily forgotten in the heat of the moment. Now that it came rushing back, Granel forced himself from seeing red.

This person killed the prior investigation teams. 

Nirvana.

Nirvana.

New synapses formed, blood was produced, flesh was grown. Such a massive wound could still be repaired by Granel&#39;s curse, but nonetheless.

It hurt like hell.

&quot;<strong>I summoned you, Servant.</strong>&quot; Granel boomed as his muscles knit themselves back together. &quot;<strong>I summoned you for one reason: we have one job. To fight! Fight! To protect our fellow men from the likes of them!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>You could be a Caster, an Assassin, even a Berserker. Frankly, I don&#39;t care. We have one goal here:</strong>&quot;

Granel reached into his pockets and pulled out a pair of brass knuckles, which shined brightly as he slipped them onto his hands.

&quot;<strong>We&#39;re gonna kick their asses.</strong>&quot;

A lone sailor, already beaten and bloodied, haemorrhaging from the insides. He was as good as dead, milliseconds away from becoming just another carcass littering the floor--

--But then she was stabbed, by two daggers. The second was from the front, the arrival of the enemy servant, this &quot;Caster&quot; who deflected her coup de gr&#226;ce. But the first? The first had been lodged into her back, a searing brand pressed against her Spirit Origin, an undeniable agony that slowed her hand. 

She staggered back, dumbfounded.

There was no shame in being surprised by the enemy, for them to reveal the ace up their sleeve and force you back to the depths. But to be weighed down, by her own ally?

It was a thin line, between symbiote and parasite. The difference between aiding and impeding was fickle, arguably a matter of opinion. In the end, there was no true definition, no exact criteria to be one or the other. It was all a matter of perspective.

Naoharu Koji was an anchor to the world of the living, a supply of mana, both vital elements of her continued existence. But, he was not reliable. There was no promise he would not cast her aside should it suit his desires, as he did now. No promise that he would consider her anything more than a tool to use. No promise that he wouldn&#39;t try and get rid of her again.

To say what came next was caused by Koji&#39;s interruption of her decisive attack was incorrect. The bickering, the criticisms, the commands, the contradictions, the meddling, the intrusion, all of it was bile building in her stomach. This was merely the straw that broke the leviathan&#39;s back.

Another tendril would burst free from her body, this one more well-defined than the others. Three thick talons protruded from the end, clamping open and shut like pincers. But when it lashed out, it was not aimed at &quot;Caster&quot;, not even at Granel.

<strong>&quot;NO.&quot;</strong>

It was aimed at Koji.</span>

The grip was like a torturous vice, tightened enough to cause maximum pain, while barely slack enough to avoid causing any serious damage. It pulled him up off the ground, preventing him from moving as he was reeled towards his servant. 

Her eyes locked onto his, but they were not filled with the fury of a wild beast, not even the malice of a vicious monster. It could not even be called anger. It was disappointment, <em>human</em> disappointment, manifesting itself in the only way her body knew how.

<strong>”Look at them. LOOK AT THEM. They are OUTSIDERS. They are here to RUIN EVERYTHING. You have TOLD ME THAT YOURSELF.”</strong> She shouted, not growled, not barked, not snarled, not howled, <em>shouted</em>. <strong>”We came here to STOP them. That is what you do when one invades your home, tries to disrupt your life, is it not? So why? WHY are you protecting them? Why are you ALLOWING them to arm themselves? They are your ENEMY! They will not HELP YOU!”</strong>

Koji would suddenly find himself dragged away from his own servant and towards another, the tentacle shoving him face-to-face with the Scot. The lower of the talons would loosen just a touch, enough to allow his jaw to move, for his mouth to speak.

<strong>”Well? Go! Evaluate him! Tell me if he meets your oh-so-lofty standards, Master. What will you do if he does? Kick me to the curb, try and claim him in my stead? Hurry up and spit it out, so you can realise the absurdity of your actions!”</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was the insanely muscular man that answered him. He sure was pissed off at the sea monster right behind him, the one that had punctured his body straight through. He’d see plenty of men die from nicer injuries, so the fact that he was still standing was a tad impressive. Hell, Donald himself had nearly died from less.

However, it was soon made apparent that his supposed Master was <em>cheating</em>. Slowly yet surely the wound closed itself, as muscle and blood filled the gaps of where they once had been hidden from the world. Give anyone the ability to heal their wounds in a matter of a minute and they’d be damn hard to kill. 

And he didn’t even have a sense of humor! His words were brushed right off as Granel grabbed his own set of weapons: a shiny pair of brass knuckles. 

So, his Master was a superhuman hell-bent on beating the shit out of the other servant (what the fuck else could she be), he wasn’t funny, and he was trying to tell him what to do. What had he done in his past life to deserve this fate?

Donald groaned, “Don’tcha–”

That’s as far as he got. It seemed the other one was fed up with their own master. The Scot had absolutely no idea what they were quarreling over, but it seemed serious. ‘Grab her Master and shove the bloke right in his own face’ serious. He made sure to shift his blade out of the way, lest he desired to impale a potentially undeserving victim. 

Donald changed his view to the one right in front of him. Maybe this one would know what the hell a ‘joke’ was. Or he was preparing a spell that’d poof his organs to the outside of his vessel. 

“I’d show ya a magic trick, but… I don’t think they’d get it,” he whispered, waving his metal stick at the two others. “Bad timing, too. I almost made me sabre disappear through your chest, though.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Scylla was not an ally.

No matter how you slice it, dice it, dissect it, or even want to admit to it, a monster clad in human skin was far too volatile to be a reliable ally. Scylla was confined to a magical container under an oath, but oaths existed to be broken, and the one between her and Koji was no exception. 

Koji never liked surprises. He never relished using a weapon that was prone to misfire. If he couldn&#39;t fully control it, then he didn&#39;t want it. There were no hard feelings, like returning a defective product to the store. 

But then Scylla came along and threw a wrench into his perfectly orchestrated routine.

And now he was stuck with her. Forced into a stalemate where they each held the other at gunpoint. He had no option but to sustain her, exploit her, because he&#39;d be damned if he didn&#39;t get his mana&#39;s worth out of this walking disaster! 

<strong>&#39;DO NOT USE MY OWN WORDS AGAINST ME!&#39;</strong>

The first words that ripped out of his mouth after Scylla freed his jaw was directed right back at his Servant. 

Not only had Scylla rebelled, she was smarter about it this time too, subjecting him to a slow torture that resulted in zero wounds but excruciating pain. It was so immediately painful that his vision went red, but though his body suffered, his mind remained lucid, and he was forced to savor every moment of it. Anger flooded his mind.

<strong>&#39;Mindless slaughter is not the reason I brought you here. Why would I, when I am perfectly capable of felling a mage on my own?&#39;</strong> He interrogated his Servant, face distorted in a mixture of pain and rage. <strong>&#39;You are not here to do <em>my</em> job. You are here because there are things only you can do, or do I need to spell that out for you?&#39;</strong>

Unable to turn around, Koji had no choice but to direct the full brunt of his rage at the mustached Servant in front of him, making Donald feel as if he had somehow committed a crime.

Donald&#39;s comically large hat was reminiscent of that of a certain pink menace roaming on Nirvana. Though the resemblance between the two stopped there, it was enough for his expectation to hit rock bottom.

<strong>&#39;You have already made two mistakes.&#39;</strong> Koji stated coldly. <strong>&#39;The first was questioning my judgement. The second,&#39;</strong> he snarled, blue eyes boring into Donald with a withering glare, <strong>&#39;was putting me in harm&#39;s way. Is this how you intend to prove your worth? Do you intend to make a third mistake and lose to an imposter at your prime?&#39;</strong></span>

&quot;<strong>Yeah, you Nirvanans don&#39;t need any help with killing and slaughter. You do well on your own.</strong>&quot; Granel fumed, popping his knuckles. &quot;<strong>I figured that you all would have Servants. No way a handful of mages would be able to take out two whole ships and their crews singlehandedly.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Do you even remember them?</strong>&quot; Granel rambled.

&quot;<strong>As if I needed any more proof that you Nirvanans were scum...! Of all the Servants you could&#39;ve summoned, you chose something like THIS?</strong>&quot; He spat at the mass of tentacles and limbs that was supposed to be a Servant, utter disgust on his face.

They couldn&#39;t even summon proper Servants. They were lower than low. Inhuman monstered that had to be purged.

Granel lumbered forward and put a hand on his Servant&#39;s shoulder. &quot;<strong>An impressive magic trick. How about this? A good old-fashioned brawl. <em>Winner takes all.</em></strong>&quot;

The tendril would suddenly veer left, before sharply slamming right, its grasp loosening as it slammed into Granel. Both &quot;friend&quot; and foe were sent flying across the room, putting plentiful distance between both the servants and the masters. Unfortunately, she had to hold back to ensure her anchor did not break, so the damage dealt to both of the humans was minimal at best. It functioned more so to create separation, get them out of her hair.

Leaving her alone with Donald.

<strong>&quot;I do not care who you are.&quot;</strong> Scylla hissed, attention shifting back to the opposing servant, head twisting to face him as though her neck was snapped. <strong>&quot;I do not care for whatever lofty speech you have prepared, or for whatever wit rests on the tip of your tongue. All I care about is destroying you. Fight or die, I do not care which!&quot;</strong>

Four more tentacles burst forth from her body, these ones edging in a sword-like protrusion, white as body, but sharp as a dagger. In unison with the larger claw, they all struck at once, a downward cleave designed to overpower any parry, to cut him in twain with a single blow.

The fight had begun.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Great. Not only was the ‘enemy’ a stick in the mud, his master didn’t even ask what made him a Caster. Not that it mattered, as soon enough the two of them were shoved to the side, thrown by the enemy servant with her monstrous strength and crazy reach. 

That left the two of them. One guy with a sword and a monster from the sea. At least if this fight took them to the water, he’d die swiftly. Oh, what a great guarantee to keep him company in this trying time. 

Meanwhile, he grabbed hold of his trusty flintlock. He rubbed the smooth oak as his opponent gave him the down-low. Fight or die? Oh ho, what a lovely decision to make!

“Silly fish, the speech comes after I win!”

He didn’t have time for anything else immediately, as her attack began in earnest. An overhead and underhanded position, with numerous tentacles coming in to make sure if the big one didn’t do the job, they would. It was almost as if this were a battle of strength and numbers. 

Almost.

Scylla would see the Scot standstill up until the very last moment when death was all but certain. The expectant weapons would find themselves stopped by nothing, missing by mere inches. A near blur, but he stood a foot to the side unharmed. His face lit up in a grin and a chuckle escaped his lips. “Should’ve kept the masters around, would’ve done you lots!”

The clown then placed a foot back, and launched himself forward. Donald close the distance incredibly fast, faster than he had any right of doing. If the two Masters were looking, they’d see no trace of the ‘Caster’ that had once stood firm across from Scylla. 

Speaking of, she’d see him stop a few feet away. An infinite hole an inch across stared her down, firm and ready to fire. Donald stood behind it, still without a shred of seriousness in that face of his. 

“If I’m no Caster, then explain this!”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His teeth was forced to clamp down, biting his tongue and flooding his mouth with the salty tang of blood. If was all he could do to keep breathing, as the vice grip on his head strengthened and sent him flying. When he said he&#39;d take care of the enemy Master, he didn&#39;t mean to attack him with his body! He couldn&#39;t even grow any appendages!

Koji saw a flash of color and a blur of motion, then his body collided with a white wall named Granel Mason and was sent sprawling to the floor. He reclaimed his cane and fought to his knees, coughed, and spat a lump of congealed blood out of his mouth. It landed on the dazzling white suit that belonged to the enemy Master.

&#39;<em>Ugh...</em>&#39; The doctor rubbed his jaw, pressing the ebbing pain into numbness. His eyes settled on the peculiar sight in the center of Granel&#39;s suit. 

He froze.

&#39;How did you do it?&#39; 

Words left him in a whisper. The doctor tapped his cane on the floor. Ivory branches rippled out of the cane, revealing a metallic sheen as it caught the ceiling light. They started entangling themselves around Granel&#39;s limbs, attempting to pin them in place before snaking further up to wrap around the rest of his body.

Koji ran his hand along the massive hole that had been rent into Granel&#39;s suit, followed by the flesh that was exposed by the lack of fabric. There was no hole. No gaping wound. In fact, there wasn&#39;t even a single injured spot. The skin looked smooth and supple, despite the fact that this mountain of a man had just been skewered by Scylla&#39;s tentacles.

Next to them, chunks of flesh, bone, along with shredded organs lay in sticky blood-soaked pools, dispersed across the floor like household trash. <em>There was enough to fill up the would-be hole in his body,</em> Koji estimated. <em>This is no healing magecraft, but something more akin to regeneration.</em>

He gripped Granel&#39;s jaw and turned his head to face him.

He raised his cane and hovered its tip dangerously close to Granel&#39;s eyelids.</span>

Thickly corded muscles softened the fall, but that wasn&#39;t the issue. A Nirvanan was on him. Coughing up blood and vomiting it onto his finely tailored suit.

Disgusting.

As Granel moved to crush Koji&#39;s face with his palm, suddenly, he felt a slither of vines. <strong>Magecraft</strong>. This was to be expected. The Nirvanan had summoned a Servant. He had to be a magus. 

&quot;<strong>Get your hands off me, you backwater hick.</strong>&quot; Granel hissed as the doctor twisted his head with the help of his vines. His regeneration was suddenly the focus of the other man. They gleamed. Knowledge.

He looked away. &quot;<strong>I should be. But I&#39;m not. It&#39;s a curse, but at this moment, I&#39;m glad I have it on my side...</strong>&quot;

Muscles bulged, straining against Koji&#39;s Magecraft-infused vines.

<strong>...so I can rip you apart.</strong>&quot; Vines tore as Granel swatted away Koji&#39;s cane, and by extension, Koji himself. There was a price, as Granel&#39;s limbs were covered in small scrapes and burns where he had torn the vines apart.

<strong>Hiss...</strong> Before Koji&#39;s eyes, those minor wounds disappeared, as if painted over. <strong>Immortality.</strong> 

&quot;<strong>Try me.</strong>&quot;

Granel picked up the locker door he had ripped off to summon Donald, which had been blown back when Scylla appeared. Testing its weight, he flung it, spinning it like a top as it sped towards Koji. Loud thuds followed as Granel ran behind it. A two-pronged assault!

But, a servant could not be called &quot;most&quot;, could they? No, one did not have their name emblazoned on the tapestry of history through mediocrity. Even the most inadequate servant had tricks up their sleeve, advantages they could leverage.

Donald managed to avoid her strikes with a simple sidestep, threading the needle between her blows. But, it was too late for her to correct their path. Momentum carried the tentacles further down, burying them into the metal floor. 

That left her defenceless as he dashed forth and closed the distance, the barrel of his pistol aimed directly at her face, and fired.

<strong>&quot;GAAAAAAAH!&quot;</strong>

The bullet didn&#39;t land directly, mostly thanks to the precious milliseconds she had been afforded to &quot;dodge&quot;. Instead, the bullet only managed to blow off a chunk of her face, her right cheek reduced to a red smear, and revealing the jaw underneath, filled with razor-sharp fangs.

She had allowed herself to be harm, by this oaf? <strong>Unacceptable</strong>. Fury bubbled in her heart, Donald could see her teeth grit against one another through the wound he had made.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m going to</strong> <em><strong>CAST</strong></em> <strong>your body into the depths of Tartarus!&quot;</strong>. It seemed she did not appreciate Donald&#39;s joke.

He&#39;d gotten close. <em>He&#39;d gotten close</em>. No need for her to close that gap, no need for her to screw around. With a mighty howl, she grabbed the pesky Saber with both hands, swinging him like a sledgehammer aimed directly into the floor. He had about half a second to react before his skull would clatter against steel!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Smoke erupted from the flintlock as the shot burst forward. Scylla was no slouch, managing to dodge the brunt of the blow. Instead, there was now a nicely-sized hole in the side of her face. Which revealed a set of gnarly sharp teeth. Jiminy crickets, this whole ‘monster’ thing ain’t exactly false!

It also pissed her off. Greatly. 

“Now that’s the spiriiiiiiii–”

With a curse (that played off his joke, thank the lord), she grabbed ahold of Donald by his shirt. Getting so close was about to be his downfall, as he was hoisted off his feet and swung around like a sack of vegetables. His journey wasn’t going to last long, as that upward momentum quickly changed to <em>down</em>. Headfirst, no less.

She was a smart one. A head blow would kill… just about anyone, come to think about it. He was certainly no exception. But what to do? It was already too late to avoid getting grabbed, considering his vicious spiral towards the hard floor. Another shot wouldn’t stop her, just make his short life have vague evidence that he fought back. 

So he was getting pile-driven, it sounded like. Darn!

The Scot wiggled. Using his own surprising weight and Scylla’s arm as a stop, he shifted the direction his body was going. After all, the grip was strong but not very effective at limiting movement. Now, it was his left side that was being slammed against the floor. Not a great compromise, but it would have to work for the moment.</span>

<strong>CRUNCH!</strong> went his bones. Everything lit up in pain, a spark that caused him to bellow loudly. A stream of curses escaped his lips. However, another feeling welled up inside him: excitement. It’d been too long since he’d been able to really rough it out with a foe. Maybe this weren’t the worst thing in the world!

With his own grit teeth, he pocketed his pistol and raised his sword with one swift action. Now armed with shining steel, he attempted a swing at the hands that had tried to murder him. If they didn’t move, they’d be maimed. If they moved, he’d use the opportunity to pull himself up and away from the dangerous beast. Another compromise.</span>

<em>This man was a victim,</em> Koji realized. <em>The regeneration, it did not belong to him.</em>

An unwilling gift, or a targeted experiment? No, the origin didn&#39;t matter, what mattered was the here and now. Ultimately, it was for <strong>his</strong> benefit - not Granel&#39;s - that the two had met, and it was good the way it was. Granel seemed clueless about his ability, but Koji would be more than happy to study it <em>for</em> him.

He smiled at the security guard. It was quite genuine. &#39;So am I,&#39; he said as he pressed the tip of the cane into the delicate skin on Granel&#39;s face, &#39;words cannot express my gratitude to whoever made you-&#39;

<em><strong>SNAP</strong></em>

The willow branches burst open, snapping like gunshots as Granel broken through them with his sheer bulk. He continued to advance after ridding himself of the restraints and hurled Koji off him, sending him crashing into the locker. 

The locker&#39;s combination dug into his back. It hurt! He yelped, a dull pain settling under his ribcage. Within the time it took for him to recover, Granel had already gone back on the offensive, throwing the broken locker door like a giant frisbee before charging at the doctor like a battering ram. No matter where Koji ran, Granel would be able to cut off his escape route. It was the perfect one-two punch!

Irritation clouded Koji&#39;s mind. &#39;<strong>You are hopeless,&#39;</strong> he shook his head. &#39;All of you. You have a talent, yet you choose to waste it on a pointless fight!&#39; He gripped his cane harder, flesh dragging along serrated edges and drawing an adequate offering of fresh blood.

Bundles of branches swelled from the cane on all sides, each joining with the next as they thickened and stretched outward into an arc, forming a barrier in front of the doctor. The locker door collided with the barrier, sharp corner digging into the thicket of branches-

But that was as far as it went.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;<strong>POINTLESS?</strong>&quot; The man boomed, the word echoing like a proclamation of doom, causing Donald&#39;s mustache to quiver slightly at the intensity.

This fight was not pointless! It was revenge! This person was a Nirvanan! A backwater hermit! A murderer! For Granel to not give this fight every breath he had would be a spit in the face to those who had died here, and had died before.

His pride would never accept that.

The Servant Granel had summoned was struggling against Koji&#39;s monster. In the corner of his eye, he saw Scylla take Donald and attempt to smash him apart. Bones shattered. Skin tore.

Granel grimaced. He had to help his Servant, but first...

&quot;<strong>...hup!</strong>&quot; The security guard rolled to the side towards Donald, attempting to dodge Koji&#39;s counterattack. He was fast, but his size did him little good as the locker door slammed into his shoulder, popping it out of his socket.

Growling, Granel winced as he forcefully popped it into place. Lucky shot.

&quot;<strong>Give me your gun, Servant!</strong>&quot; He bellowed at Donald. Did he not see the struggle the Saber was going through? Or perhaps...

He thought Saber could deal with Scylla with such a handicap.

&quot;<strong>Why do you care? You&#39;re some kind of scientist?</strong>&quot; The security guard pointed at Koji with disgust. &quot;<strong>You call this <em>talent</em>? It&#39;s nothing more than a strike of bad luck.</strong>&quot;

With that, Granel raised his leg, before slamming it against the ground. The ship rattled like it had hit a rock, and Koji felt the grip on his edges of his cane begin to slip away...

As that happened, Granel ran forward, and spun up a punch. Doom.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald was resourceful. That not surprising. One did not get their existence engraved within the Throne of Heroes through folding at the first sign of resistance. All of them faced adversity, and whether they overcame it or succumbed to it, that did not matter. The mere act of standing against it was proof enough of worthiness.

Whatever the case, this &quot;Caster&quot; would undoubtedly succumb to her body slam, just barely managing to position his body so that the neck did not shatter on impact. How cute. He thought he could resist, thought he could fight back.

But, that gun was a giveaway of how outmatched he truly was. The firearm, an invention of the human era, long after the Age of Gods had ended. This fool, they were a small fish in a big pond, and as their S.E.R.V.A.N.T exoskeleton lay rusting away at the bottom of the sea, they would realise just how outmatched they truly were!

The sword swiped at her hands, trying to force the beast to release her prey. But instead, she held on, allowing the biting edge to slice and dice her arms, sanguine blood flooding forth from her skin. And yet, she was unflinching. Her mouth twisted into a vicious smile.

The bladed tendrils from early tore themselves free, and like javelins, they launched themselves towards Donald like spears. Five of them in total, the four smaller ones aimed at each limb, and the larger talon aimed at the head. 

He had succeed in maiming Scylla, but if he did not think fast, then he would end up maimed in kind.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald’s sword did no good. It was naught more than a toothpick against her flesh, cutting and slicing but ultimately pointless. In his defense, most sought to keep their arms free of large scars and the potential loss of hands. Should’ve stabbed the appendages instead.

It wouldn’t matter in a few seconds. Those sharp appendages he had dodged half a minute back were now coming towards him with lightning speed. Ready to cause some actual damage, he might not last long after he was punctured like those dolls people had. 

“<strong>Give me your gun, Servant!</strong>”

Oh, for the love of–

He didn’t want to do it, but it looks like the choices were dire. Instead of continuing his assault at the beast&#39;s arms, he instead went closer to home. With one swift slice, his shirt was cut away. Along with that went Scylla’s stranglehold on him, which let him roll off to the side of the spears. Not fast enough to avoid the ones aimed for the way he rolled, which sliced into flesh like a knife through lard. 

The Scot was free, though. His working arm pushed hard on the ground once he was face down, and his legs finished the job. Now standing with blood oozing from his wounds, a hole in his shirt relieving a chest covered in thick black hair, and a surely worthless left arm, he grabbed the second pistol still holstered with an extended finger. A quick flick with the sausage-like appendage brought it flying towards Granel, a “Don’t ask for more,” flying alongside it.</span>

Meanwhile, the other flintlock lay on the ground. Forgotten where there was a suspiciously shaped him-sized dent in the floor. Getting that was objective one, as his blade wasn’t long enough to warrant the risk of another grab. This was still a battle of knowledge, and so far the list started and ended with ‘don’t get in range of those bloody mitts again.’ 

So, keeping predictable, Donald made a mad dash for the weapon. So long as the large tentacle didn’t try to fillet him like a goose, he could parry and dodge the other four or five noodles with knives stitched to the end of ‘em.

If he and his ‘Master’ survived this, they’d need to talk about throwing him against a sea demon without any warning.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bad luck? <em><strong>Bad luck?</strong></em> Koji was aghast. What a shame, to have a gift bestowed upon a brute who didn&#39;t even appreciate it! 

He sighed. &#39;Well aren&#39;t you a ray of sunshine and positivity,&#39; he said. &#39;Haven&#39;t you ever wondered which way the world might have turned out if you&#39;d just shared this gift of yours? Aren&#39;t you ever curious how far you can push your limit?&#39; 

His brows furrowed as Granel made an effort to dodge the locker door despite his inherent lack of need to do so. Scylla was making quick work of Donald. It was only a matter of time before Granel was alone, and he had just expedited that outcome by demanding Donald to spare his gun, despite how utterly outmatched he already was with both weapons out. The security guard was dead set on putting up a struggle either way, something Koji didn&#39;t appreciate.

A tremor rattled through the floor at Granel&#39;s display of sheer brute strength. Koji lost his footing, the cane slipping free from his hand and clattering to the ground. 

He moved to pick up the cane from the floor. &#39;I suppose we&#39;ll have to find out the messy way,&#39; he tutted quietly. <em>Oh, well...</em>

There was a sound in the distance. It was very faint but very familiar: the sound of fluttering wings. It flooded the corridor, kicking up a breeze of putrid stench as it drew near. 

A shape beat its way into the room, a hurtling white blur. <em>Birds!</em> Many more followed, a flock of seagulls and other varieties Granel couldn&#39;t name. They were all different sizes and different colors. Some of them looked bigger, a whole lot bigger than the ones Granel was used to seeing on the coast of his hometown. He could swear he saw two heads attached to one of them. What had the Nirvanians been feeding them?!

They were trying to eat Granel alive!</span>

<em>Not like a pistol will save it. Besides, I can always summon him back.</em> Granel shamefully thought. What was he, a monster? A true magus? A <em>Nirvanan</em>?

He&#39;d need to do better.

Upon grabbing the pistol, it became clear that this gun was <em>comically</em> small. Granel could barely fire something. Heck, he was afraid he might crush it by mistake. The guard had been trained in all sorts of weapons, but what was this? An antique? He wasn&#39;t some Genevan soldier like Ace!

Right as he leveled the pistol at Koji, something landed on his shoulder.

&quot;<strong>Birds?</strong>&quot; Granel said in confusion, before yelping in surprise. That was <em>NOT</em> a bird! Flesh rotted and oozed, taped to a skeleton by Magecraft Granel couldn&#39;t possibly understand.

It was like one of those old shows, Night of the Living Dead, or whatever?

Nonetheless, Granel leveled the gun at Koji, before firing. From the swarm of birds summoned by the doctor came a metal sphere with his name on it. He couldn&#39;t even see if his shot struck Koji.

&quot;<strong>Servant!</strong>&quot; Granel roared as he swatted away at a four-headed seagull. How did he reload this thing. There was no time to act. He flung it towards Donald. He&#39;d gotten his lucky shot. Now was time to deal with birds.

They nipped at veins and skin alike. For every skeleton that Granel crushed in his palms, two took its place. If that was the case, he&#39;d need to hustle and take down the Nirvanan before the flesh was picked off his bones.

Within the span of an instant, Granel rushed towards the opposing Master, hoping that he could kill the magus before these birds could kill him.

A few glancing slices, hardly the full mauling that had been intended, but Scylla was not impatient.

That was the rule of a hunt. One did not have to end it in a single pounce. A hunting dog was not expected to kill the fox, only to wound it, make it weak. Let the life bleed from it, force it to exert itself, accelerate that loss. Then, when it was exhausted, unable to keep fighting, that was the time to end it.

Even now, birds circled around them, as though waiting to pick through carrion once she was done.

Of course, her preferred prey had been ships and the sailors within, but the principle was the same. Everything had a limit. All you had to do was raise the tide, while forcing the deck into the waters below.

The appendages would retreat back inside her body, merging into herself once more. No point keeping them out longer than was necessary, to waste her energy like that. The hunt was a double-edged blade, after all, and just as it was the hunter&#39;s goal to exhaust the hunted, the hunted could escape through exhausting the hunter. That was all it was, a game of attrition. 

Unbeknownst even to Scylla herself, it was a game rigged in her favour. As much as she despised it, the malign shard of Koji within herself ensured that her reserves would never run dry. Unlike Donald, she would never sink.

As soon as she saw the Saber lurch for the gun, she too would rush forth, though it would not be to reach the spare flintlock. No, instead, she raised her leg up high, and then brought her heel down low, towards Donald&#39;s head. Like the swing of an axe, her kick came down to cleave a great fissure into his skull.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Great news! The whips of pain receded back within Scylla, as if they had never existed. That made life easier, to say the least. Bad news! She wasn’t stupid. As he dived for his weapon, she went for it as well. Instead of a hand, she used her foot. A swift swing with monstrous strength behind it was basically a guillotine in disguise. 

So, Donald sidestepped to the right, continuing his momentum. No sense in having his skull caved in after avoiding it the first time. He brushed against the new arrival of a flock of avians, which had yet to swarm in. Thank the lord for that, cause if all of these birds joined the fray…

Scylla’s hunt would be swift. His duel would be drawn out. And what was a duel without a few flashy tricks before someone ultimately perished?

His Master shouted, and the pistol was thrown back. Already?! Whatever, this would do. His body turned on a dime, the grace of a dancer behind his footwork. His right arm swung into himself as the world spun, and would fly away as he turned to face the monster once again. 

With no hesitation, he <em>let go</em>. 

The sabre spun, yes, but the sharp side was still faced towards the sea monster. Might not have the strength behind it that she had behind her leg, but it was still something to distract. Perhaps the worst of all was the fact that the SABER was chucking his SWORD. Not like it did much good in the situation, though.

His throwing arm continued on, outstretched behind his back. Outstretched fingers soon felt the familiar steel, a firm grip on a warm barrel. 

Dextrous fingers placed the trigger in his pointer, and the weapon was brought forward. Much like before, the barrel was pointed straight between her eyes. The darkness didn’t last long, the hammer striking the pan and sending lead forward.

“Don’tcha count Donald McBane out just yet, I’liv’d worse!”

Ah, the country bumpkin had a name after all!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The birds shrieked and squawked in excitement. They had found a great feast spread before them. Fresh meat, off the bones of a living, breathing creature! It was <em>way</em> better than the canned meats and beans down at the pantry!

There was more than enough of Granel to go around thanks to their oversized prey. Nonetheless, the birds fought amongst themselves, each vying for the most tender cuts. They didn&#39;t even care that Granel had begun crushing their comrades in earnest; the fewer the competition, the more &#39;food&#39; to go around!

Granel disappeared under a hail of talons, wings and beaks. Koji waited with bated breath, eager to see the security guard prove his theory: that his regeneration worked even after its host had perished. 

He felt his pulse kick up a notch. The organic regeneration of flesh was a firm step towards resurrection. There was no need to create an artificial body, no need for the likes of homunculi, familiars, or dolls. The flesh of the original host would create the strongest link to the soul. All that was left was to find a way to summon <em>her</em> soul and bind it to the body...

<em>No</em>, he caught himself, <em>that line of daydreaming would not do.</em> He had spent way too much time dwelling on that twist of fate and what good had it brought him so far? He&#39;d need to observe the results first. He&#39;d need to make sure that Granel was properly dead before making any further assumption-

Out of the swarm of birds protruded the black barrel of a pistol. The gleam caught Koji&#39;s eye, and the synapses in his brain fired as he remembered who the gun belonged to. Granel did manage to borrow the weapon from his Servant after all, and though he couldn&#39;t see all that well, it was hard to miss a shot aimed at a fully grown man a few paces away.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji&#39;s brain had connected the dots, but his body was simply incapable of reacting in that split second after the pistol&#39;s trigger had been pulled. The bullet went though his arm, shattered a rib, then exited cleanly though his back, boring a tunnel through his body and leaving behind a blazing trail of pain. 

The doctor was brought to his knees. Short, raspy grunts left him as he clutched at the gaping hole in his body, feeling his breath being knocked out of him. The bullet had travelled far. His lung was most likely damaged, and it&#39;d take more than a few breathes to fix it back up. 

But a few breathes&#39; time was what he didn&#39;t have. Granel charged at him without missing a beat, letting the birds feast freely on his body while he singularly focused on extinguishing the doctor that controlled them. Koji was tackled into the wall in an instant. Granel had no reason to hold back, and the doctor felt the impact like a truck. He was like a toothpick in the hands of this mountain of a man. Granel would have no trouble snapping him in half before the birds ate him up.

And that <em>frustrated</em> him.

&#39;You regenerate quicker than my darlings could dismantle you,&#39; he heaved deeply. &#39;I seem to have underestimated your capabilities.&#39;

The situation was far from ideal. So far, Granel had proven one thing: that he regenerated way too fast to die in the hands of his birds. At this rate, he would never witness the moment where Granel&#39;s regenerative ability failed to keep up and sent him over the threshold between death and life.

He had no choice but to resort to more drastic measures. 

&#39;Scylla!&#39; He called upon his Servant, who was presumable in the middle of tearing the faux Caster apart. &#39;Strike this man again like you did before-&#39;

Granel met Koji facefirst, and in a contest of pure physical strength, it did not matter what tricks the Nirvanan doctor had at his disposal. Hand to hand, Granel won. 

The man was grabbed by the neck, and slammed into the wall with enough force for the walls to groan and yield slightly. The security guard got up in Koji&#39;s face, breathing heavily as chunks of flesh were ripped free, before regenerating.

Nonetheless, damage <em>was</em> being done, slowly but surely. Perhaps he didn&#39;t have a limit, but he did have a rate.

A seagull landed on his shoulder, threatening to tear out Granel&#39;s carotid artery. Within a moment, it disappeared within his hand.

A snap was heard as the skeleton was crushed.

&quot;<strong>Even birds, too? What next? Bringing the dead back to life? Do you hold nothing with respect!?</strong>&quot; Granel boomed, slamming his fist into Koji&#39;s chest. 

&quot;<strong>The other teams... They had people they cared about too. They&#39;ll never see home again! Did you turn them too?!</strong>&quot;

<strong>Slam!</strong> Bones cracked.

&quot;<strong>You Nirvanans are scum. All of you. Don&#39;t you care about <em>anything?</em> CAN YOU EVEN LOVE?</strong>&quot;

The brass knuckles were glazed with blood, as were the remains of Granel&#39;s white suit, now dirty and matted. The man took a deep breath.

&quot;...Donald, right?&quot; Granel said, voice deflating slightly.

&quot;<strong>I need to put this one down. Just one minute. That&#39;s all I need. Just one more.</strong>&quot;

Granel raised a massive fist...

The lack of a satisfying crunch of bone was irritating, but she had still succeeded in keeping the gunman from his gun. Speaking of which...

A grotesque, sucker-covered appendage would sprout free from her leg, grabbing the pistol. With a whip-like motion, it proceeded to chuck it away, the weapon arcing through the air and down the chasm through which she broke inside. Now, it was well and truly out of reach, unless Donald wished to abandon his master to search the belly of a sinking ship.

But he didn&#39;t. Instead of folding, he doubled down. With a twirl and a flourish, his sword was tossed like a dart, flying through the air and plunging into Scylla&#39;s shoulder.

<strong>&quot;GYAH!&quot;</strong> Rider screamed,  partly born of pain, but more so of surprise. Of all that she expected from this Saber, to toss his blade like it was a projectile, no different than any arrow or javelin? No good swordsman would even <em>think</em> of doing such an idiotic thing! 

But, that was her mistake. Donald McBane was not a good swordsman. He was an <strong>excellent</strong> fighter.

By the time she had recovered from the shock of the steel point piercing inside her, her prey had recovered his spare pistol from Granel. Once again, she found herself on the firing line.

<strong>BANG!</strong>

Just like last time, there was no time to dodge, not cleanly. The best Scylla could do with the instant before the bullet sped from the barrel was to shift her head, craning her neck backwards so far that it caused her neck to pop. As the flash and smoke of the gunpowder faded away, Donald would see the results of his handiwork: A bloody ravine bored straight along the middle of the face, along the chin, the blasted remains of a nose, and the forehead.</span>

Her scowl was so deep it could touch the bottom of the ocean, her eyes overflowing with such malice that it was practically a tsunami. And, as always, the seething insults of Naoharu Koji were the lit match that set off the powder keg of rage.

<strong>”You want to see my Noble Phantasm?”</strong> She inquired, voice filled with so much tension that it was surprising that her spine had not snapped. She would pull herself back up to her full height, glaring at Donald, Koji, Granel, all of them with such utter contempt. <em><strong>”FINE. I shall afford you the glimpse of Hades you so dearly crave!”</strong></em>

Upon that declaration, the doctor would feel an unseen pressure against his arm, the artificial circuit within heating up. Scylla was absorbing great amounts of mana from their bond, using it for… something. Not quite a True Name Release, but close to it. Drawing upon the power of a Noble Phantasm, but not at its full force. 

Then, from nothingness, they would materialise. Two hefty looking cannons, accompanied by a deluge of water pouring down from the thin air from which they emerged. The iron barrels, engraved with a criss-cross pattern akin to the scales of a fish and adorned with ivory spines and fangs, were truly massive, making Donald’s pistol look like a carp compared to a shark. The two would groan as they angled themselves, pointing towards their targets - One aimed at Donald, and one at Granel.

<strong>”NOW DIE!”</strong>

Shortly after that blood curdling howl came a howl of metal and sulfur, as two cannonballs exploded forth. Now, these foolish interlopers would see how it felt to be upon the wrong side of artillery!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Another shot landing almost true. This time the flesh taken was a streak up her face, leaving only the remains of a nose and a trench that streaked nearly the entire expanse of skin. If it weren’t to kill, it was revenge for the lost twin that dropped below the floor. To the depths of the sea, no doubt. 

Scylla did not find this amusing. As a matter of fact, this fight had not been amusing to anyone but Donald from the get-go. Whatever the case, the sea monster was very upset. Her master egging her on did not help. 

So, when Donald felt the rise of a strong current, enough energy for even a magic-incapable person like him to feel, his curt smile dimed. Now scowling, he watched as two massive cannons emerged from the air itself. One reserved for his sorry ass, and the other for the brute behind. With a proclamation of Scylla’s desire, an all too familiar smell filled the air: gunpowder. 

Now this got him scared. Devilish creatures of the night (and day) were one thing, but steel balls traveling faster than they had right with the potential to crush him instantly were no laughing matter. He’d seen plenty of mates perish to them, and likewise watch many a foe be crushed under sheer weight and force in an instant. It’d had been a while since this particular threat had graced his presence. With any luck, this’d be the last time.

For now, there was only action. Unlike the body slam, there was no ‘eating’ this hit. The weight behind the ginormous orb would crush bone and flesh instantly. When his fresh corpse hit a solid surface, it was likely there’d be a nice head-shaped hole in his torso. His Endurance would bring him to the brink of death at best, and there was little to be done with a spine that resembled silk.</span>

 Much like his foe, he could not dodge the shot entirely. Even with a hint of what was to come, a cannonball traveled fast. Despite diving for the safe space to the right, he could feel a few inches leave his side and open mass scorched by the raw energy alone. Opened and immediately cauterized. Painful!

He pushed himself back up, no time to pause and examine the damage done. “We’ve only got borrowed time! Either choke the bloke or spill your guts!”

The Scot didn’t stay still, strafing with what little room available and firing potshots. He took zero aim and hoped that something would land while he approached. It was time to reclaim his thrown weapon the hard way.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji was helpless in a contest of strength. He had never trained for combat. Even if he willed it, his body would not allow it. Wherever Granel&#39;s blows landed, bones would crack and flesh would rip, and he would feel another part of his body cave under the security guard&#39;s mighty fist. 

Was it worth it? The gleam of truth behind Granel&#39;s &#39;curse&#39;, was it worth putting his life on the line? 

He never finished that thought, because doing so was an insult to everything he&#39;d worked so hard for. Therefore, in a situation like this, where he had no choice but to go face-to-face against another, how well he could keep up physically usually boiled down to two simple factors. Resourcefulness, and endurance.

Granel detected movement. From the corner of his eye, he saw the doctor raise his arm and place a hand on his own, the one that was currently pinning Koji against the wall. Slender fingers caressed the back of his hand, tracing the bulging tendons that connected each finger to the muscles underneath. The meticulousness in which the doctor moved, it almost felt as if he was putting down marks for-

<em>&#39;Squawk!&#39;</em>

A seagull swooped down, tearing into the security guard&#39;s hand with its sharp beak. Granel felt his middle and ring finger slacken as blood poured out of the incision. Another seagull dived in for a quick bite, and he lost control to his index finger as well.

The birds were targeting his tendons! For a moment, Granel lost his grip, his hand nothing more than a slab of bone and meat. With a grunt, Koji pushed the hand off his neck. There was still strength in the Nirvanian&#39;s arms, Granel would realize. Despite being shot, pummeled, and beaten to a pulp, the doctor was still standing.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sure, he looked terrible. His body was battered, and held little resistance in the way of Granel&#39;s fist. But Granel was no ordinary man, and dealt no ordinary punches. Say, how many ribs had he cracked? Eight? Ten? Why did it feel like he&#39;d been breaking the same bones over and over ever since the slugfest had started? 

Granel raised his fist once more, eager to finish what he had started-

With a burst of strength that seemingly came out of nowhere, Koji seized the security guard by the suit, gripping it tightly by both lapels and reeling himself in. Granel&#39;s blow whiffed, instead catching him on the side of the head and sliding forward to open a long channel of blood all the way to the back.

Then, before Granel&#39;s eyes, the gash closed up as if it had been stitched together by an invisible thread. Even the bleeding had been minimal, with what little blood that had been left around the wound congealing like jello.

Koji wiped his face clean. <strong>&#39;The other teams?&#39;</strong> He asked, his voice no longer sounding like someone who had punctured their lung. <strong>&#39;Who the hell cares about your teams? I&#39;d have killed them myself to do what I&#39;m doing now!&#39;</strong>

He exerted more strength in his arms and hauled himself on tiptoes to face the other man. <strong>&#39;The things I do, I do it for <em>her</em>. You don&#39;t get to tell me what to do! How would an outsider like you understand, when all you lot do is send people here to snoop around like the pests they are? At least send people with real value so that I don&#39;t waste precious time cleaning up the mess you&#39;ve made!&#39;</strong>

He let go of Granel, chest heaving rapidly with every breath. The contour looked suspiciously normal, as if the bones underneath were no longer cracked.

<strong>&#39;You are needed,&#39;</strong> he said, <strong>&#39;because you can provide that value.&#39;</strong>

His right arm began to heat up.

Quite on the contrary, she was taking vast amounts of mana <em>from</em> him, feeding it into a seemingly bottomless pit that housed something terrifying. Koji felt the stir as an incredible mana signature burst into life. Two cannons emerged behind Rider, one pointed at Donald, while other...

<strong>&#39;Do not move!&#39;</strong> He advised Granel urgently as the air was suddenly rife with the smell of gunpowder. <strong>&#39;Remember, I still need you alive.&#39;</strong>

With a clean hit, the canon would no doubt tear a similarly sized hole into Granel&#39;s abdomen. He could then carry on with his little experiment, as if no time had been wasted between then and now!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Fighting mages was always a chore. 

It didn&#39;t matter how many of their familiars you killed. Most of the time, they were replaceable, easy to mass produce with the wave of a hand. The Impaler had been like that, back in his youth, and many other mages were the same.

That didn&#39;t make it less annoying, however. It would be easier to just snap the mage&#39;s neck, and leave it at that. Or snipe them from a distance. Or blow up their place of residence, or—

<strong>Caw!</strong> The arm went limp. A seagull hissed, its eye falling out of its socket, making a disgusting <em>squelch</em> as it hit the floor. Granel&#39;s stomach turned. The more of these things he fought, the more revolted with Koji he became.

The bird was crushed before it could fly away in Granel&#39;s other palm.

Koji&#39;s body repaired itself before Granel&#39;s very eyes. No, perhaps that was incorrect. The damage was internal. Granel felt Koji&#39;s chest collapse with every blow. He felt bones crack. Organs bend and burst.

He felt that with every blow of his fist. The same feeling. Each time. Even as Koji pulled him forward with a burst of adrenaline, that feeling never changed.

Suddenly, flesh knitted itself together. It wasn&#39;t the magical replenishment of missing body parts, like Granel. It was more surgical. Precise. It wasn&#39;t hard to put two and two together. Pot, meet kettle.

<strong>Koji was like Granel.</strong>

That meant that he&#39;d have to snap his neck or crush his skull. The massive man reached forward. Koji&#39;s head would fit snugly in the man&#39;s one-handed-execution.

&quot;<strong>What&#39;re you babbling about?</strong>&quot; The man spat, blood dribbling from his mouth, despite the wound being long gone. Who was &#39;her&#39;? Another Nirvanan? Did this man answer to some sort of kingpin?</span>

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

Granel&#39;s body moved just enough to avoid having his spine utterly shattered. It didn&#39;t matter how much healing he had. That would take forever to repair, and by then, he&#39;d be dead.

The force of the impact sent Granel careening off to the side, away from Koji. He didn&#39;t feel pain. Shock? Likely. Getting hit by a massive lead cannonball did that to you.

He fell to a collapsed heap, already feeling his body working frantically to regenerate the damage. Still, that took time, and it was likely for Koji&#39;s familiars to try to keep him down. But still, that wasn&#39;t what concerned Granel.

&quot;<strong>Are you stupid?</strong>&quot;

Despite the man&#39;s injuries, his voice was as deep as ever.

&quot;<strong>All lives have value, dumbass. Though I shouldn&#39;t have expected as much from some worthless Nirvanan. I&#39;m surprised you can fight for anything, much less a person. Not that it matters much.</strong>&quot;

The mass began to stand up.

&quot;<strong>Come on! I can do this all day, bird boy.</strong>&quot;

Not only that, but the four members of the ongoing scuffle could sense the temperatures around them gradually drop, as if something else had awakened on the ship to create that chilly sensation.

Vapor and smog mixed with one another, dissolving at a slow pace. Despite that, it didn&#39;t take a genius to see that both Granel and Donald had suffered heavy injuries at the hands of Scylla. Koji could tell quite well, thanks to that hawk sight of his.

This was the decisive moment: To see how Granel would react to a near death situation, or perhaps even one that would result in his death. Could his opponent even truly die? How far did their abilities go? The doctor couldn&#39;t help but stare. Wantonly.

He felt close to a breakthrough, but-

&quot;Very well said, my rather bald looking fellow!&quot;

Claps could be heard, followed by the annoying shrill of a notable pipsqueak. Koji couldn&#39;t forget them, especially since he had heard their cries so early in the morning. Shakespeare was back and out for vengeance.

&quot;Your awful haircut aside, I am rather touched by your performance! Brevity is the soul of wit, and you were nothing but concise throughout your scuffle.&quot; William chuckled, revealing himself to all four as he stepped closer to Granel, cutting him off from Koji as he now stood between the two.

&quot;All lives have value, but have you ever placed lives on a scale? How much is the good doctor worth? How much is your own life worth? Hell, how much am <em>I</em> worth? That is the question you should be asking yourself right now!&quot; He raised his arms excitedly.</span>

&quot;You or them? Them or you? You can&#39;t be strong enough to have it all...&quot; He spun around in a pirouette, turning for a few seconds as he tossed manuscripts in the air like a revolving rose. He continued doing so, before abruptly stopping with a mischievous grin on his face.

<strong>&quot;...Without being strong enough to take it as well.&quot;</strong>

The moment he said that, Koji felt a change in the air. It was no different than how birds could sense alternating wind currents and adapt accordingly, preventing themselves from being caught into storms.

Unfortunately, he was not a bird. They had a choice. He didn&#39;t.

All he knew was that something was coming. That he might not have the strength to avoid it.

The papers flew in the sky, eventually landing on their designated targets. Several landed on Granel, while the others landed on Donald.

Both of them felt a shock rise from their spine to their neck. Their magical circuits both constricted them and liberated them. It was akin to going past a car&#39;s speed limit. Whatever Shakespeare had done, it felt <em>good.</em>

At first, Scylla had gotten the Saber worried. But now, now that he had so much power at his fingertips? He didn&#39;t feel so threatened. If anything, he was looking forward to paying her back for earlier!

Likewise, Granel felt at ease. Initially, he felt like he wouldn&#39;t be able to regenerate the cannonball&#39;s damage in a reasonable time, not even if he were well rested. Such limitations were promptly disregarded once he realized that even his healing had been accelerated.

Koji would not be pleased. Perhaps Shakespeare even knew that, since he cast him a glance and stuck his tongue out.

&quot;I got to say doc, I didn&#39;t take you for a spoilsport. What do you think you&#39;re doing, telling random strangers about <em>her</em> of all people? I thought it was our little secret! Plus, you know, that really ought to be considered a spoiler...&quot; He chuckled, placing an index on his own lips.</span>

&quot;Besides, didn&#39;t you get a new girl already? Or are you trying to eat your cake and have it too? I can&#39;t say I approve of that type of romance. Mhhhm-hmmm.&quot; He shook his head, letting his hat swing side by side.

&quot;But hey, count on me to add some spice to your life. A doctor is at their best if they have plenty of patients to tend to...including themselves. No need to thank me, my good friend!&quot; William bowed, watching with one eye open as Granel&#39;s healing had now tripled in rate.

&quot;Oh, and for the record, this is a mere spur of the moment. It wasn&#39;t premeditated due to a certain lack of hospitality, I <em>assure</em> you.&quot; The bard gave Koji a wink, before turning to Granel.

&quot;Come on, big guy! After I spent so much time hyping you up, are you really going to let me down? Give &#39;em the good ol&#39; one-two punch combo.&quot; William started striking punches at the empty air.  <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#4437">@Magnister Prominence</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The arrival of yet another Servant had Donald ready to throw his hands up in frustration. The destruction of the old world and the normality of ye olden heroes made it more likely to meet them, but this was three in one area within 5 minutes! They didn’t immediately attack anyone, though, so the most the Scot did was steal a glance as he continued making sure that another shot didn’t fly forward.

His words were that of a bard, as well. Potential attention from one who would hype him up was exciting, but he didn’t want any help. This was his fight, damn it! What if the sea beast rubbed in the fact that he needed assistance to make their duel <em>even</em>?!

Unfortunately, his attention was diverted elsewhere when the winds brought over a figurative godsend. Once he felt the flimsy paper on his skin he swatted at them with his mangled arm. “Shoo, shoo,” he muttered, not ready for the sudden burst of energy that invaded his muscles.

To say it felt incredible would be the understatement of the century. Every single cell in his body was alight with potential. As if he’d been given ten gallons of ale, minus the intoxication. He could run faster than light, tear apart metal with his bare hands, shoot a bottle from fifty paces back. His bones didn’t have that same ache present moments before, either. Is this what it felt like to cheat?

Oh ho, he took back whatever bullshite he’d spewed before! More, please! Hell, he’d take the entire library that bard had up his sleeves.</span>

Donald would settle with the tide-turner for now. He wasted no time in closing the distance to Scylla, dodging any attempts to maim him further. The pistol was returned to its rightful position and the sword was stolen back from its temporary scabbard. 

“I’ll be needing this!” he warned. 

It was time to return the favor. 

His assault was much like the way he lead the battle: a blur of motion with the danger of steel. In and out, between any swings of limbs or the re-emergence of tentacles, he dashed. His blade went even faster, slicing and tearing at whatever was available for damage. A few swings at lighting speed was all his foe could register before turning, ready to–

Where’d he go? That large bastard was just –

“You’d never last in the colosseum!”

More pinpricks, but this time on the side she was just facing. Whenever she was ready to counterattack, Donald was gone. Already on a new side, back at it again with his assault. He was fast. Too fast. And the blows hurt a little more than they should’ve. Surely because of that troublesome bard. At this point, it’d be better to swing and hope she got lucky rather than actually aim her blows. 

“Surely you understand? A duelist needs to use anything at their disposal to win,” The man chimed up. “After all , we Sabe– Casters, ain’t as strong as we used t’be!”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The blasts were not direct hits, but when one was firing such a massive piece of artillery, it did not have to be. Even a glancing hit was enough to scorch flesh and shatter bones, leaving even the most valiant foe unable to fight on. 

Under normal circumstances, one might have been afforded the luxury of a respite, time spend restocking and reloading. But unlike a regular cannon, these ones were fuelled by mana. They required no such great labour before they were able to fire once more. No, her plentiful magical energy ensured the next volley was ready within seconds, prepared for the second round.

But of course, Donald did not stay still. Even a roach like him had the good sense to scuttle about, avoiding the line of fire as best he could. But at this point, the bark of his pitiful  pistol did little to frighten the ocean&#39;s hound. Tendrils sprouted out to swat away whatever bullets drew close, as though they were flies. All the while, her cannons would groan as they angled and positioned themselves, forcing the Saber to keep on his toes.

A smile fell upon her mutilated face, a distorted cackle rising out of her throat. She watched her prey struggle, watched it begin to sink, watched the tide come higher and higher...

And then, came that familiar voice. Gratingly annoying, so self-assured that it was a wonder the owner did not choke on their own ego. <u>That writer!</u> What did that bootleg Homer think he was doing, intruding in her business as though he had any worthwhile input? Her face fell into a snarl as she turned to face him, so evidently irritated by his presence. And, that irritation would only grow as he pulled his next stunts.

Manuscripts fluttered about the air, many of them eventually coming to settle upon his body. Instantly, the beast could smell the stench emanating off them, the magical energy that the paper and ink carried within. <strong>He was betraying them.</strong></span>

Begone, you Ephialtes!”</strong>

But in making her ire towards the interloper known, she in turn had taken her attention away from Donald. That gave the Saber every opportunity he needed, letting him close the gap without getting obliterated by a cannonball, allowing him to tear free the weapon of his namesake from her shoulder. What followed was a storm of steel, his blade carving her apart as though she were a carcass, and he were a butcher. The pain was awful, overwhelming, UNACCEPTABLE.

<strong>”GRAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!”</strong>

From every inch of her flesh, tentacles, tendrils, claws and pincers would burst forth, all of them working in tandem to try and attack Donald. But every lightning strike of a slash would slice one of these attacking appendages off, every thunderclap of a stab tore inside her without recompense. She couldn’t even turn her cannons on him, lest she herself get caught in the crossfire. No, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t seem to hit him. No matter what strategy her predatory brain came up with, it would not equalise the playing field.

She couldn&#39;t hit him, while she was landing more hits upon her than she thought possible for a mere human. She could feel herself sinking, feel the tide race to consume her, feel the biting spikes of the slayer&#39;s club break her apart.

She was going to <em>lose</em>.</span>

Did a fellow investigator extend a hand of aid towards the brow-beaten security guard? Where was the Master, then?

No, it wasn&#39;t this simple.

After a few moments of babbling and prancing about, Granel elected to shelve what the man was saying for later. He certainly loved the sound of his own voice. Granel decided that he didn&#39;t like him.

As pages attached themselves to Granel, he felt the words written on them flowing into his body, phrases of heroics, tragedy, loss, and gains flooded into him, and Granel began to rise as the spike in his chest glowed white-hot.

After standing, he took a deep breath.

&quot;<em><strong>OOOOOOOOOOOOOH RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong></em>&quot;

With a yell loud enough to be heard in Geneva, and a massive jolt of magical energy, Granel slammed the flood of the sinking Canopus, causing the ship to rattle and groan, threatening to send everyone, including Shakespeare, to their knees.

&quot;<strong>I feel <em>good</em>!</strong>&quot; The man boomed. &quot;<strong>I won&#39;t thank you, buddy. I&#39;ve been given bad gifts before, and I don&#39;t know a lot about Magecraft myself. Won&#39;t stop me from using this. I ain&#39;t picky.</strong>&quot;

Now that Granel was healed up, it was a lot easier to think. Maybe it was Shakespeare&#39;s interference, or perhaps because of his recovery, but this seemed fishy. This man knew the Nirvanan? Were they buddies?

Was this a Nirvanan Servant? Why was he working against his own partner? For the joke? <em>The funny</em>?

<em>Who is &#39;her&#39;? What&#39;s this guy talking about. Did this doctor guy...</em>

<em>...lose someone?</em> Granel thought, before shaking his head. No! Nirvanans were the enemy. The enemy! There was no room for pity! The enemy must be crushed!

<em>But he&#39;s a doctor.</em>

&quot;<strong>No pity!</strong>&quot; Granel boomed once again, before picking up a locker with one arm, and throwing it at Koji.

&quot;<strong>Hold your post, Donald! Kick that monster&#39;s ass!</strong>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Much to Koji&#39;s chagrin, Granel insisted on moving against cannon fire. He tried to maneuver out of the way, half-assed it, then ended up with an ugly wound on the side of his torso.

<em>He warned him!</em> Koji tutted in annoyance. How was he supposed to gather any meaningful data when Granel had already suffered worse wounds and lived? He would have to line up a second shot.

<strong>&#39;Fire again!&#39;</strong> He ordered Scylla. <strong>&#39;But stay away from his vitals-&#39;</strong>

Then he heard that familiar voice. A flash of pink descended in front of him, blocking his sight with his obnoxiously large hat. The doctor felt his throat constrict, bile rising at the sight of the jester that had waltzed into the room as if he were directing a stage play. 

Papers fluttered. Words flowed from the bard, encouraging to his enemy and infuriating to his allies. Say, does a bard ever pick sides? 

<strong>&#39;WILLIAM!&#39;</strong>

Koji had never wanted to strangle someone so badly in his life. He didn&#39;t think it was possible for him to generate this much murderous intent on an individual he&#39;d known for years. No. The better question was: why <em>hadn&#39;t</em> he killed the bard already? Why hadn&#39;t he buried him ten feet under the day he&#39;d caught wind of his research? Why hadn&#39;t he...why <em>couldn&#39;t</em> he...

<strong>&#39;YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!&#39;</strong>

Too late.

There was a disturbance in the air. It made Koji&#39;s hair stand on end, a foreboding sensation that some type of magecraft beyond his scope had been activated. The manuscripts that stuck to Granel sunk into his body, then his wound began to repair itself, flesh regenerating at a speed that far outstripped anything the doctor had witnessed so far.

William hadn&#39;t <em>just</em> healed Granel&#39;s injuries. What he did was way worse.

It was a direct enhancement to his regeneration. 

<strong>&#39;For fuck&#39;s sake, I told you to cut it out!&#39;</strong> Koji snapped at the bard. <strong>&#39;You are throwing my experiment off!&#39;</strong>

An agonized scream pierced the air. But the scream did not come from William, or Donald, or Granel, or him for that matter. It was a scream filled with anguish, like a wounded beast in their death throes. He knew that voice. He refused to recognize that voice. He tore his eyes away from the security guard and towards his Servant-

There was a flash of steel, and a flurry of blows. Scylla was trapped in a storm, blood spattering across the floor as her body and appendages were caught in a dizzying pattern of sword strikes. Donald was moving too fast for Koji to follow. All he could see was his own Servant, lashing out wildly only to gather more wounds on her own body with each passing strike.

<em>His Servant was on the verge of losing.</em>

Koji felt his blood run cold. <em>No,</em> he thought. <em>It can&#39;t be. It just can&#39;t be. Scylla has everything going for her. She is indomitable on the waters!</em>

But with the advent of William and his poisoned words, everything changed.

<em>Scylla was going to die.</em>

...

Koji gave William a long, hard look. There was hatred in his eyes. 

<strong>&#39;This is the last time you&#39;ll be meddling in my affairs,&#39;</strong> he said. <strong>&#39;If you know what&#39;s good for you, you will not dare show your face in Nirvana after today.&#39;</strong>

A bird fetched him his cane. Granel had returned on the double, trying the same old trick on him with throwing furniture, accompanied by a war cry that was loud enough to make his ears ring. Had humans outside of Nirvana regressed to the more primitive apes within the last few years?

With a scowl, Koji turned the woodwork in his hand, locating its sharpest edges. 

<strong>&#39;The only one who is allowed to &quot;kick that monster&#39;s ass&quot;, as you put it so aptly, is me.&#39;</strong> He pressed his arm against the cane&#39;s bladed side, and let the blood run free.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The effect of such a high dosage of nutrients was immediate. Thick vines burst out of the cane, writhing and twisting themselves into several massive whips. One after another they lunged forward, their bulk casting long shadows across the floor as they whipped towards-

<em>The Servants!</em>

Granel would be spared the onslaught of the whips. They missed him by a wide margin, swinging over his head only to build momentum before slamming towards the only visible Servant in the room like an agitated sea beast. 

Had Koji lost his mind? He would choose to discipline his Servant with Granel hot on his trail? Was he really going to dispose of Scylla here and now because she had outlived her usefulness?!

...It certainly looked convincing, didn&#39;t it!

Not far behind Scylla, the hole she had tore through awaited with its gaping maw. Seawater rushed through the lower decks, rising far above the Canopus&#39; waterline as it dragged the vessel further into its depths. A dreadful, watery grave for the sailors...and a way out for Scylla.

All it took was a momentary distraction from Donald, and a single well-aimed strike. 

It wouldn&#39;t be a painless escape.

Which hurt more, a flying locker, or Granel&#39;s fists? Koji contemplated as he raised his arm and braced for impact. He hoped it was the latter.

<em><strong>SLAM!</strong></em>

The locker sent him flying.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For a bit there, it was almost as if Donald were going to cause a massive upset. The she-beast was no match for his raw speed and buffed strikes. Each attempt at retaliation was dodged or cut to ribbons before it could even act. In a one-on-one duel with a slow, strong opponent (especially if he was pushed past even his own limits), there was only one way for it to end. 

Just another slash, and– wait, he <em>missed</em>?! How did–

Oh. That bloody <em>master</em>. Koji was able to think on his feet, that was for sure. A blood sacrifice and a barrage of vines slammed into Scylla, sending her backward and towards a great big hole in the floor. His instincts cursed the doctor, yet his mind did nothing as he watched her go back, back… and disappear.

It was best this way. Sure, revenge was nice. So was living. It would’ve been a terrible shame to find out the rest of her tricks the hard way, especially if any of them had the potential to murder him on the spot. Besides, it was suicide to chase an animal into their home turf. A cornered beast was another threat in its entirety. 

Donald holstered his sabre, enjoying the still-present power boost and watching his master send his own foe soar through the air. Based on his reaction to the bard, his help was a betrayal in some degree. Fickle things, they were. They enjoy a story and song more than people, sometimes even morals. Best to not think it over too much, lest he consider a scenario in which Scylla had been the receiving end of the magecraft.

Speaking off, they were on a sinking ship. Cold and salty sea air mingled with the symphony of other smells, for it was surely eager to swallow the vessel whole. If this was only one fraction of attackers aboard, then it was amazing they hadn’t already drowned. 

“Master,” Donald approached the brute, ignoring the doctor, “hate t’ interrupt, but how long ‘til we swim off the ship instead of walk?”</span>

Though why WAS William helping them? If Koji knew them, then did the two have a falling out. Was this Servant an investigator sympathizer? So many mysteries. So many things to uncover.

He didn&#39;t know how Koji healed themselves, though judging by his obsession with Granel, his own ability surpassed the mad doctor&#39;s. Did it have a limit? He had to be close, surely!

Granel ducked to avoid the mass of vines that Koji had sent his way, only for them to go past him.

&quot;<strong>Servant!</strong>&quot; He bellowed as he turned around.&quot;<strong>Behind you!</strong>&quot;

Only to see Donald standing there, looking at him in confusion as Scylla was pushed into the abyss. What was this doctor doing, giving up a chip as valuable as his own Servant. Now he and Donald could tear him apart!

Then the ship began to slant, and Granel cursed as Donald walked up to him.

&quot;<strong>I agree. You lucked out this time, doc.</strong>&quot; Granel sneered as the locker fell away, tumbling into the pit, leaving Koji against the wall. He looked around. It was unfortunate to leave the Canopus so soon upon docking. A breach in his contract, even, to insure the safety of the investigation team and crew on the journey to Nirvana.

They had arrived at Nirvana though, so that contract was null and void. That was the end of his short job as Canopus Security Director. He sighed. 

&quot;<strong>Let&#39;s go. We need to get to grab a few things before this place collapses on top of us. Preferably before this enchantment wears off.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Later, &#39;good doctor&#39;. I hope you drown in this ship. No skin off my back.</strong>&quot; The man walked off into the bowels of the ship, disappearing.

And then came the great crushing blow, that which had ended her life. But, it did not end <em>this</em> life.

Vines had latched onto her body, and shortly after, Rider was struck by the thrown locker, as well as Koji. The blow sent both of them flying backwards, out of the reach of the Saber&#39;s saber and the brute&#39;s beatings. Instinctually, what few tendrils she had left wrapped themselves around the doctor, binding him to her flesh like a prisoner in stocks.

It was for his own good. If he was not kept safe, he would die. It was for her own good, too. If he died, then she would die, too. Neither of them could die, no matter how badly they hated one another. That was the truth of the matter.

<strong>&quot;Hold your breath.&quot;</strong> Scylla warned, voice raspy and drained. 

Then, the momentum carried them back down through the hole in which they had first emerged, entrance becoming their exit. At that, Scylla began to swim, as far away as she could. Direction did not matter. All that she wished for was distance.

The monster had lost their confrontation with the hero, but, they had survived, limped away with their life, though not their dignity. Had she not been bleeding so vigorously, she might have found such a reversal of roles funny. Such an uncommon occurrence...</span>

This was exactly the type of inspiration Shakespeare had been looking for! He stared in awe at Scylla and Donald&#39;s confrontation, making sure to write down each passage as he described the fight in excruciating details.

&quot;Let the bloody colors wave! And either victory, or else a grave!&quot; He chuckled to himself, being immersed in free material, until Koji finally took notice of his antics.

&quot;Stay out of this? But doc, I already <em>am</em>. I&#39;m a mere spectator to the grand show you are putting on. Now now, do not disappoint. Keep dancing to my tu-&quot; He was interrupted by Scylla&#39;s animalistic growl, his eyes widening as he realized he was in grave danger.

Two cannonballs threw themselves at him.

&quot;With her bowels full of wrath...This fish could really use a bath!&quot; He was so distraught that he screamed rhymes, interrupting his manic writing as he tossed himself towards the ship&#39;s edge. A risky maneuver, considering that he almost fell overboard.

&quot;Haaa...Haaa...&quot; He panted, Koji realizing that the slippery rat had survived. The good doctor held nothing but contempt towards the bard and made sure to show it, threatening their life.

William wasn&#39;t sure on how to react. He felt rather exhausted after narrowly avoiding death by Scylla&#39;s hand. Not only that, but the prospect of being hunted down by Koji didn&#39;t seem appealing at all. He would rather not be the early bird&#39;s worm if he could help it.

&quot;No worries, doc. I&#39;m going on hiatus!&quot; William said abruptly, waving Koji goodbye as he leaned forward and decided to <em>plunge</em> himself in. A loud splash could be heard as the poet braved the ship&#39;s frigid waters.</span>

Perhaps not as suicidal as Koji had thought, since he just realized that the ship had almost docked. A blessing and a curse, since it at least guaranteed a safe escape route for him. As he let Scylla carry him away, he swore he could hear some haunting words underneath the fresh seawater...

<em>&quot;...Be sure to buy the Nirvana Times&#39; newest issue, available tomorrow at a discounted price...&quot;</em>

Clearly, he was dreaming.

...

If Granel and Donald were to look around, they would notice that the fellow called William had disappeared from the ship. No doubt, they were a Nirvanan Servant, but why would their enemy support them? Either they were a traitor or Nirvana had some infighting of its own.
