                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sound of stretching fibers echoed throughout the mostly abandoned gym as Galvin leaned against the ropes. Bouncing himself a few times on them as he watched his summoning circle take form via use of his water manipulation, large ball coalesced balls of blood treated with some holy water shuffled along the floor and swirled as they spread themselves thin. Moved around the currently empty frame that stood rigid in the middle of the boxing ring, the magus&#39; hands moving with a measured and deliberate finesse. Only stopping for brief moments to pull up the reference image he had acquired before continuing the process again.

Useful, but damn tedious, was about the words Galvin would use to some up most of the more intricate rituals and preparations most magus went through, though he was always more accustomed to solving most issues with his fists, it was quick, efficient and said more about his own ability rather than how strong his magic was. However, as much as he lamented the dull task at hand, he hadn&#39;t gone through the trouble of coming all the way out here and spending his savings on Magic Circuits to not at the very least make use of the resource.

Once the circle was down he stood up off the ropes and grabbed the dusty old pelt he was provided as a catalyst, not caring too much for the details on what he was supposed to do with it he just draped it around the frame.

His face twisted and scrunched up as he tried to force the words back into his mind, even giving his head a few taps with his fist to try and knock the incantation free in his mind and jostle his memory back into order.</span>

Not that I’m complaining all that much” Galvin said, cracking his neck before holding his hand up to the summoning circle, preparing to start the chant, invoking his mana to activate the rune, he took a deep breath to focus, he stumbled through the first part of the chant, pausing and starting over a few times growling in frustration as he noticed the inert responses he got, shaking his head, “I swear I’ll kill that old bastard if I’m making an ass out of myself for nothing.” He managed to find a flow until he hit the part he knew better than the first part.

No… to live was pain, to live forever was despair, Ankou had gotten his wish.

Through the millennia his pain grew but his soul weakened, nothing is forever. Eventually Ankou had faded, there was nothing… But then a light beckoned his way. A light guiding him back to the corporeal world, a chance to die as all men should.</em>

As Galvin finished his chant chaos was already flooding the Canopus. A rather unwelcome coincidence to the process of summoning a servant. Amidst the loud sirens and rumbling of the floors a coldness would engulf the room. The circle that housed a rugged animal pelt atop a servant frame would glow a violent blue

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Cold winds rattled the boxing ring ropes, the turnbuckles vibrating adding the sound of clashing metal onto the boat sirens. The air grew cold and stale, breathing would become hard for Galvin. The windows on the gym doors frosted over as the punching bags swayed from the violent winds. A cyclone of blue flame rose around the servant frame covering it from sight, oddly the flames seemed to give off no heat, instead the room only continued to grow colder. The sounds of commotion from the boat were drowned out by a loud screeching harsh enough to make anyone want to cover their ears.

After a moment the winds would die down, the room would become calm, the cool air causing Galvin&#39;s breath to show in front of his face. A second breath could be heard from inside the cyclone of blue flame. Galvin’s servant had arrived. The flames flickered being pulled into the orifices of the servants face, forming two blue pupils for eyes. At last Galvin could get a good look at his servant.  

In the center of the ring stood a tall and lengthy man. His skin was pale almost like snow. A leather winter coat dropped over his body, his whole attire consisting of leather gear meant to keep him warm. A large farmer&#39;s hat covered most of the servants face however, a cold stream of air could be seen leaving his mouth at any given time. The servant looked up, his hollow eyes peering at Galvin, the flames in his eyes danced as if he were looking at his master’s features.

“You have given me flesh and bone…” His voice was rough and scratchy, akin to a chain smokers. “Tell me child why do you need my services, for what purpose have I been called back to this wretched ground!”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In the immediate moment as he saw the frame begin to react, before the icy torrents of wind even shot out of the summoning Circle. Galvin could have sworn he felt an all too familiar chill run down his spine, an eerie suspicion that a familiar set of eyes normally watching from behind him were now manifesting before him. It&#39;d been so long since he felt this presence so strongly, the last time it was when he was still a child, cold, on the streets, stomach rumbling to the point he was certain it began to cannibalize itself, with that same cold presence looming over as he laid on the floor in pain. Putting up his hands as he was blasted by cold wind, he didn&#39;t even have time to ponder before the stale air dropped him to his knee coughing.

Taking harsh labored breaths to try and compose himself again, the fog that puffed out in front of his face was telling, looking up at servant as the blue flames gave his servant form. Now Galvin wasn&#39;t a coward by any measure, but the being that stood before him now, instilled what could only be a primal fear within his chest, scratching at the back of his mind. An instinct alerted him to the danger of this man as if some inevitability had just doubled itself, one who&#39;s cold presence he only ever felt as people were felled around him.

This caused the man to jolt to his feet and stand with some confidence, not one to let himself appear weak and frail before a possible threat, ironic in that his own servant elicited this response, was lost on him in the moment, &quot;W-Well... I&#39;ve been hired to investigate the Island City of Nirvana... The populace who once welcomed tourists have apparently turned into violent crazy people, which I guess makes itself apparent, seeing as they&#39;re probably boarding us right now and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to invite us over for dinner.&quot; he answered gesturing to the sirens on the walls as the loud alarm continued to blare loudly. <em>Who the hell did I summon?!&#39;</em> he thought. &quot;Introductions might be rushed.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ankou quickly picked up on the fear he struck into his Master&#39;s heart. Ankou however, thought nothing of Galvin&#39;s reaction. As an agent of death Ankou was familiar with fear, often times people broke down at the sight of him. The bringer of death took a moment to embrace his surroundings. He had been summoned in some musty boxing gym, perhaps his Master was a fighter. 

Ankou nodded his head, his eyes shifting back towards Galvin. The boys words had been enough to give Ankou a grasp on the situation. &quot;Island... Boarding... We are on a boat then. We are under siege so I suppose you summoned me in a rush to keep you safe? If the enemy is unaware of our presence in this room we should keep that a secret. If our existence is unknown to the island dwellers we will have an inate advantage.&quot; 

Ankou took little time for small talk. He was already discussing business, he was quick to take up the situation. It was easy to tell that Ankou would be a strong willed adversary, however, this meant that disagreement from Galvin could cause conflict. 

The servant stepped towards Galvin, a human sized scythe materializing in his right hand. Ankou stomped the but of his weapon on the floor causing a black coach and two horses to appear from thin air. This was obviously the skill of a rider class servant. &quot;Take shotgun and introduce yourself young man. And if it&#39;s alright with you we&#39;ll be off somewhere safe.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Almost growing a bit indignant at the idea he was desperate for protection Galvin&#39;s face hardened some, &quot;Now now I wouldn&#39;t say in a rush to keep me safe, heck if you were here a few moments ago I was taking my sweet time working this whole ritual thing out, trust me when I say a couple of freak crazy people aren&#39;t something to be afraid of, if anything given where I&#39;m at I&#39;d have the advantage.&quot; he pointed out firmly before taking a breath and looking across the room, &quot;Let me grab a few things first.&quot;

Hopping over the top rope, his shoes making a nice thud on the hard floor, he stepped over to bench that had a few stray materials laid out on it, but instead his hands drifted to two shaped metal gauntlets, sliding into them for a perfect fit, &quot;Servant or not, I like to secure my own safety as much as possible, and I take great pleasure in that.&quot; the magus commented as he stepped back into the ring. Tightening his muscles as he activated his magic circuits, Galvin moved his hands in a flowing pattern as he took wide circular steps, clenching his fist, he threw an uppercut, while using his other hand to stop his arm short, before pulling at the empty air like he had a rope in his hand.

In the next second a large on the other side of the room, practically leaped off the ground and threw itself through the air, soaring towards the Master who caught it in his hand, jerking a bit as he flexed his arm to halt it from hitting the floor, placing it in the coach as he stepped on, &quot;Well after the way you showed up I was expect a little more fan fare with this thing, like cracked floor, screams and black shadows... Anyway My name&#39;s Galvin, Galvin Sterling, I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t like the prospect of running away from a fight, but better to give them as little information as possible I suppose. Besides we&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to make first impressions later.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ankou let off a small grunt as he observed the small display of his Master’s skills. He was with no doubt a martial artist. Ankou himself was a close ranged fighter, in close combative matchups the two could hold an upper hand. The thing they&#39;d definitely have to watch out for was a Caster class servant. The Master-Servant pair had little tools to deal with such a threat. Ankou shook his head, he was too deep in thought, thinking of the worst scenarios already… However to Ankou the feeling of urgency was natural, this is his one chance to die after all. After everything the Agent of Death had been through he deserved to die didn&#39;t he?

Rider turned his head to Galvin watching as he climbed in the passenger seat. “My presence is to strike fear, my coach is to travel and contain the souls of the damned. These purposes do not conflict, Galvin.” Clearly Ankou was not the type for jokes. Galvin would have to work on that one. “It&#39;s nice to make your acquaintance Master, I am Ankou, your rider class servant. I am the first born child of Adam and Eve, an Agent of Death, and my wish is to die. That should be enough information to break the ice hm?”

“Now then enough talk lets be off. We’ll return when the fight has settled. We must preserve our presence, I cannot hide mine so it is best we distance ourselves for now.” It was true Ankou’s presence was almost impossible to hide. Just being within a <s>American</s> football field&#39;s length of him was enough to start making your skin feel cold.

With a raise of his arms and a whip of the reins Ankou’s carriage moved into motion. It took on a near transparent hue and moved through the ships floor and walls, Ankous carriage was completely ethereal, unaffected by the physical world. He would try to bring his Master to Nirvana, if they could scout the island before the attackers returned home they could gain leverage.
