                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Before panic struck the Canopus, condemning poor sailors and crewmen alike to fates bearing dull eyes, all was quiet. Alarms did not blare. Crewmen did not shout. Danger did not seem imminent. It was just, quiet... or perhaps, in the starry eyes of few, hopeful. After all, Nirvana was close. The land every passenger, of legal entrance or not, yearned to step their feet on after weeks of faring the vast ocean-- just within sight! The occasion was momentous, and to some, this meant packing up all their belongings, and getting all ready to finally venture upon their final destination. In fact-- most likely followed such routines. But still, just when all seemed set and imminent for the passengers of Canopus, there were others with more... mischevious whims on their mind.</em>

<em>It was to the unfortunate circumstances of fate that investigator Homer Harold Hathaway, otherwise known as H.H.H., was to be pulled from his preparations so suddenly. Not that he couldn&#39;t have resisted. Homer had a choice. The choice to return to his preparations, surely important, as adventurous and experienced as he was, and continue his day as normal. But alas, there were forces beyond him that plucked the strings under his nose. Forces that nudged him, not to go about his routine, but to venture the lower decks of the Canopus for no other reason than feeling as if something, anonymous and mysterious, called for him. And, as he descended farther and farther down the Canopus, he&#39;d be proven right.</em></span>

<em>Indeed, there was something that called to Homer, luring the man mindlessly into the dark. As he got closer to it, lower and lower down the Canopus, he&#39;d begin to think he could sense a presence. He might&#39;ve craned his neck or held a hand over his ears to hear better, but soon, he believed he could recognize... music? Yes yes-- music! That was it-- plucked music-- surely from a stringed instrument of some sort, coming all the way from the deepest chambers of the ship. A performance, the incredible, adventurous Homer would realize, just for him.</em>

<em>It was a mysterious song that played for the investigator, yet, lovely all the same. Every note sung pleasant and dream-like in the air, ushering along a romantic story glazed sweetly by careful fingers. The piece, written centuries ago by a composer just as anonymous as the tale it told, was so soft... so alluring... it was if the very air around Homer had become lighter; subsequently, so had his will to return to the upper decks. Curiosity of what musician must be making such lovely music replaced such in Homer&#39;s mind, sprouting from a seed he was far too far gone to realize had been long planted in him. Soon, entering the loading bay, where the music seemed it&#39;s most soothing, Homer would find the source of this blissful romance that called to him...</em></span>

He had messy brown hair, and a rather small frame, crisscrossed as he was on the floor. A simple outfit comprised of a dirty white button-up shirt and black slacks hang off his lithe body, and in his hands is an instrument of sorts, one that took the general shape of a guitar... but there was something unique about it. Whatever it was, the instrument in his hand, without a doubt, was the source of the music. It&#39;s thrums filled the loading bay warmly as the lad&#39;s fingers danced upon it, and upon seeing Homer, bright vermillion eyes turning up towards the man, the musician did not miss a single beat.</em>
<strong>&quot;Why, hello there, sign&#243;re.&quot;</strong>

<em>His voice was honey-sweet, the kind of sweet that made one&#39;s legs weak in the knees as they swooned, and he had a gentle smile about his lips. It felt incredibly hard to ignore his words, like it drifted alongside the music filling the room. Not many experienced such saccharine allure. Through it all, whatever Homer may have been thinking, there was one thought that rose above all else.
The music was so lovely,
the young musician&#39;s voice, just as,
and all Homer Harold Hathaway wanted to do...
... was listen more...</em></span>

His movements were more reactive than intentional. Ryn likely would not have ever seen such a strong effect take hold, especially this quickly. This implies that either his skills had vastly increased over the short period he had been upon the ship or Homer was absurdly weak minded.

Slowly he approached closer to Ryn trying to take in as much of the melodic tones as he could. The boy had captured him complete and was fully under his command. The only truly independent action he still held was the subtle bobbing of his head to the music.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A distance away Ronda searched for her missing boss. One moment he was beside her going on about how he once took down an entire army of copper armored soldiers and overthrow a bloody thirsty tyrant that took over an entire city, then the next he had disappeared from her side. Cautiously she moved through the passages and the lower floors of Canopus in search of him. This man was truly growing to be a headache. If it wasn’t for the fact that she had a binding contract to him she wouldn’t care as much as she did. Unfortunately what little collateral she held was tied up in this agreement so for the time being she will wander the dark corridors for a man that seemed far more interested in how his hair looked than what their plan would be when they reached the island. Eventually at the farthest corner of her ear did she hear the faintest sound of strumming. She could feel the slight tug against her mind to which she instinctively drew a symbol upon the air that ignited before her to give her a reinforcement against mental interference before slowly following in that direction. Whatever was down here was pulling upon string that likely shouldn’t. <span class="mention" title="&#198;nkidou#4116">@&#198;nkidou</span></span>

Such a weak mind he had... granted, the lad hadn&#39;t known very much about Homer&#39;s mental endurance prior anyways. The first he&#39;d heard of the self-proclaimed hero was on the deck of the ship one day, when the lad had just been passing by, trying not to be seen... and there H.H.H. was, exclaiming boldly to a redhead that seemed his student, and waving around a certain something Ryn wanted. First awe-struck impressions and a little questioning from other passengers who knew who the author was had the musician thinking it&#39;d be a challenge getting Homer to bend his way-- but here he was. Eyes already blank and stupid as a fish. Ryn stifled a sigh. So disappointing. 

Not that he was complaining though-- no no! This just made his job all the more easy. Suppose, if the hero of the seas he&#39;d heard about turned out to be quite the underwhelming man, then he could appreciate Homer for making little hassle.</em>
<strong>&quot;Homer Harold Hathaway... I must say, it&#39;s a pleasure. I&#39;m a fan y&#39;know? I&#39;ve read all about your adventures across the floating islands.&quot;</strong>
<em>He hadn&#39;t really; that was a lie. Though, Homer didn&#39;t need to know that. Ryn continued to speak, his sweet voice tinting just a tad with bitterness.</em></span>

<em>Ryn&#39;s smile grew in order to assure Homer he meant no ill-will in his words.</em>
<strong>&quot;Of course-- I&#39;m not the type to hold fast to somethin&#39; false. I can be have a change of mind! I can believe in you, Mr. Hathaway... if you just prove yourself worth believing, first.&quot;</strong> 

<em>The lad let his single audience member think as much as his manipulated mind could for moment, continuing to fill Homer&#39;s ears with music. A few moments pass before Ryn spoke again, this time, a more persuasive sharpness to his tongue.</em>
<strong>&quot;So, I want you to run out and bring me your servant card, plus whatever other materials you need to summon a heroic spirit, and show me how it works!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">On cue Homer nodded his head and smiled. One might assume that the trance had been broken, but Ryn knew better that was not the case. In fact, he only tickled a factor of the so-called hero’s ego. None of the words of berating seemed to reach, but at the chance to show how much of a grand adventurer he was made Homer light up like night signal in the sky. With an exaggerated now he bellowed. “Homer Harold Hathaway at your service sir. I am finest magus adventure across the many isles and I shall demonstrate my prominence to you on this auspicious day. You wait here a moment and I shall you wonders you will never forget.” 

Not waiting for Ryn to respond Homer began down a certain direction in the loading areas of the ship, ushering the boy to follow. It only take a few minutes maneuvering through different pieces of cargo and supplies before they reached a massive rectangular box, not to a metallic coffin. Entering in a code upon an exposed number pad the box would swing open to reveal a tall mechanical doll standing inside. The device did not carry face and had no remarkable features aside from wiring and joints. To most observers it appeared rather unremarkable, but Homer continued to beam brightly. Reaching with his coat he pulled out a small chromium card and held it out for Ryn to see. “This automaton is a servant frame, it is a device used by mages to accomplish complex missions and aid in fantastical adventures. All one needs to do is place the card into the center piece of its chest and utter a special chant, which I have right here.” Homer pulled out a small slip of paper with messy writing upon its surface. “If one does this in combination they shall bring forth a mighty hero of legend or history as their servant, who is obligated to follow your every order and command. It is quite the piece of equipment and it is in my possession.” Although he spoke fluently, Ryn could tell there was still a glaze in his eyes as he loosely held the card and paper.</span>

And finally, a third time, taking in every single little detail of the thing he could, all the while beaming like a child lost in a candy store. Such intimidating design-- not to mention futuristic! It felt just like something out of an old sci-fi movie, and as Homer keyed in a code that revealed the true treasure inside, Ryn felt his breath escape him. The lad stepped closer to the doll, gaze studying. It was neither man, nor woman. Happy nor sad. Heroic nor evil. Monster nor human... it was blank... a canvas that had the potential to be anything. Or rather, anyone. 

Oh how Ryn wished to run his hand across the wiring that made up the apparatus, feel every little wonder that&#39;d soon paint itself the stunning hue of lost greatness. But he restrained himself. Held his hand quick and stern to his instrument-- never missing a beat. He couldn&#39;t get carried away just yet... though, he certainly couldn&#39;t hide the excitement brimming in his eyes either.

<strong>&quot;Wonderful... absolutely wonderful sigńore! Thank you, thank you! You&#39;ve proved yourself a hero... at least, to me.&quot;</strong>
<em>A comforting warmth filled the lad. He wasn&#39;t lying this time... today, this man was Ryn&#39;s hero. Homer, whether he wished it or not, had done something truly special for Ryn. Something that, as the lad reached out to Homer, eventually taking hold of the slip of paper and card, made him also grasp the author&#39;s hands, grip firm in gratitude. He smiled. Homer didn&#39;t actually seem like a bad person, a little boastful perhaps and awfully weak of mind, but kind at heart. Not to mention the enthusiasm and partial tongue of a true storyteller... in truth, there was a lot for Ryn to like about Homer. In truth, the lad had very few friends at home. Yet, in his mind, he&#39;d always imagined making friends with people like Homer. The lofty kind, with adventure bristling in their eyes. Perhaps, if the circumstances were different, they could&#39;ve had a nice chat!</em>

<em>A sigh parted Ryn&#39;s lips. Sadly, such was just a hopeless fantasy. After all, there was no way Homer would want to be his friend after this. With his grip loosening on Homer&#39;s hands, Ryn gently hooked his fingers on the card and paper, and pried away the card and paper from the man. He held them close to his chest. Homer might&#39;ve stirred a little as Ryn&#39;s music had ceased, but the lad&#39;s voice was all he&#39;d need for what came next. Speaking in that sickly sweet tone, Ryn nodded towards the way Homer had guided him.</em>
<strong>&quot;Rest now, Mr. Hathaway. You&#39;ve gone on so many adventures throughout this vast blue world, I believe you deserve a break. Go on, take a seat jus&#39; outside this room. Lie your head, let slumber take you away... and dun&#39; fret &#39;bout these. I&#39;ll keep &#39;em safe for you until you wake.&quot;</strong></span>

Though, due to the enchantment the objects slipped from his grasp all the same. Homer&#39;s remained blank unfeeling as Ryn seemed bask in joy at claiming what was clearly not his and taking advantage of a man who had done him no wrong. Yet the ecstatic smile stayed spread across his face, even as he turned about to walk just short of outside the room, or at least out of eyesight of the boy. Now Ryn, stood solemnly alone in front of presently soulless shell of machinery.</span>

The strumming had suddenly stopped so it was slightly more difficult to discern the direction in which she should continue to travel. Still she had to continue onward, lest she have to hear a lecture from Homer later on how a hero never abandons their mission, especially when one might be in trouble. Making yet another arcane, a small bead of light appeared upon the end of Ronda&#39;s finger to help guide her through the darkness.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Silence. Utter silence filled the room, Ryn watching Homer walk away without so much as a word.&#160; He stayed like that a moment, waiting, counting out the dwindling steps the investigator took as he walked off into the dark... until no longer could Ryn hear anything but his own breath. He looked down, at the card and paper in his hand, and drew a shaky inhale. <strong>Finally.</strong> 

A smile spread across his face and the lad thrust his spoils in the air, stifling a cheer through his clenched teeth. He&#39;d done it-- not only had he gotten the card, but he&#39;d managed to snag the entire frame too! All with the ease of playing a simple song no less; child&#39;s play. Excitement trembled Ryn&#39;s hand as he lowered the card under his nose, right below his eyes to shakily study. Almost immediately, his chest swelled in awe. Such incredible design... it was unreal such a small thing was the very device that could bring legends to life! Or-- well, that wasn&#39;t quite right... 

He turned to the blank doll. Yes, it was only part of the deal, wasn&#39;t it. His eyes traced the little slot in the doll&#39;s chest, and the metal coolness of the card began sending shivers down his arm. It beckoned him to insert it where it belonged with the doll, like a key to its lock. Opening up what door, hell if Ryn knew, but he wasn&#39;t going to stray from obliging the urge either. There was little time to waste with Nirvana so near, and after spending weeks on this ship, fortunately with food courtesy of Allen, it was high time he take his first real step forward. Feet growing lighter and lighter with every stride, Ryn skipped along until he was right infront of the servant frame. With Homer&#39;s card raised proudly, he slotted it into the doll&#39;s chest cavity. A quiet click alluded to the card being a perfect fit, just as expected.</em></span>

<em>The coffin reacted almost immediately. The wiring that made up the doll began humming, and a very subtle glow soon seeped from deeper within the box. It seemed to pulsate from inside, as if some metallic heartbeat just jumpstarted from behind the doll&#39;s chest. Ryn could not help but watch the light, enamored by its soft glow, before he hurriedly pulled up the slip of paper Homer gave him. 

His nose wrinkled. Homer&#39;s chant was certainly... ambitious. If not somewhat self-righteous. It reeked of something someone holier-than-thou might try appealing to a celebrity with, and left with a slightly sour taste in his mouth after reading it, Ryn stuffed the paper away in his pocket. He didn&#39;t need a script to chant. How hard could it be, anyways? A little improv couldn&#39;t hurt... and besides, he already knew how a basic chant should sound. That was something taught to him long ago... 

Stepping back a pace or two, Ryn raised his guitar, and gently cleared his throat. Letting his hands slide along his instrument again, he quietly began playing. Soon, mana locked away in the box siphoned out, and flowed into Ryn. He savored the exquisite, potent energy that fleetingly swirled althroughout him, before sending it right back at the servant frame, the doll pulsing a tad brighter in response. A summoning circle, likely painted here in preparation before Ryn had arrived, began to emanate light from below the metal apparatus. Before long, the whole room was covered with a mysterious blue hue, the likes of which only deepened as Ryn parted his lips to speak over the music.
The ritual had begun.</em></span>

Shut the four cardinal gates,
Stir the three-forked Kingdom road.

As I part way for heroes of renown,
Through wishes beckoning the sands of time, 

One of the heart
One of the mind
One of the soul

<em>Butterflies prodded at the lad&#39;s stomach from the inside, and every bit of his body felt jittery. Who would he summon? A knight? A soldier? A philosopher? Perhaps a king, or a beast? The sheer possibility shined anxiously in Ryn&#39;s eyes, as if the mere thought that anyone may come thrilled him. In the end though, it all didn&#39;t matter. As long as they helped the lad find him... he didn&#39;t care who arrived before him.</em>
<strong>&quot;--And as I hold them close, before a mystery left unsolved
Take form from leyenda, blessed to rise once more
To act as sword,
As shield,
As hope.
For from times cut short, a path was carved.
A path I refuse to wander another step alone.&quot;</strong></span>

<em>He paused. For a moment, he seemed at a loss at what to say next... though, it came back to him as the music, so familiar not only to his fingers, but to his ears, hit a bold crescendo over the whirrings of the machine. Ryn beamed. This was it... the light was beating brighter! It was only a matter of time until it too reached its crescendo.</em>
<strong>&quot;I made a vow,
back then ago.
to attain all virtues of Heaven,
to have dominion over all vices of Hell,
to be all the good of the world. 

Hero...
I vow all and more to you once again.
Just so that you may hear mine song, and usher mine tale. 

From Men, from Monsters, from Gods
To those who heed my call...
From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by three great words of power...
If you are the hero I seek...
Come forth from the ring of restraint, and let us pave the path ahead,
O&#39; keeper of the balance!&quot;</strong></span>

This had the potential to be one of his most lucrative endeavors yet, all was needed was to watch carefully as this young girl he took with him did all the heavy lifting while he watched from afar taking notes. Good thing she was a nobody, otherwise people might ask questions on what exactly happened when she never returned to the ship. 

Suddenly a loud pop was heard behind him from the conclusion of the summoning, Homer was startled by this and began to shake his head vigorously starting to come back to reality of the situation as well as grasping what was going on. He turned the corner only to witness Ryn standing over the puddled mess of his servant frame. A deep rage built up in the writer as his face became red and his veins began to pop from his brow as he stormed directly towards him. “What the hell did you do with my shit you little brat!” Homer grasped Ryn by the collar and shoved him into a nearby cargo crate. The boy would then feel the point of a sharp knife against the flesh of his neck. “I’m going to cut your fucking tongue out and feed it to the fish, that way you won’t hum another devilish tone again. You know how much that cost me, how many books did had to sell to afford that hunk of metal. Perhaps I’ll get a return on investment by selling your organs on black market.

The shape slowly formed into the appearance of a tall woman dressed in black leathern clothes, a wide brim hat, and a trench coat. Homer was squirming in place, as liquid ran down his face as well as his pants leg, though the woman did not seem moved by his tears. She merely stared blankly back at him, holding him aloft.

At last in an even tone, just above a whisper, she spoke out. “You have many sins that you carry in your soul, yet you do not feel regret for the action taken but the consequences that may eventually catch up to you. You fear that those you’ve wronged will retaliate against you, and you’ll be left with nothing. Normally I would take the initiative in teaching you a lesson, though you were actively threatening the well being of a child. That simply can not be ignored, so I shall enact righteous justice upon you forthwith.” At this Homer was wailing, but could not muster a sound due to his throat being restricted by her grip. With her free hand the women raised her palm to the center of his chest and in a forceful pulse her arm shot through his rib cage out the other side of his as she gripped tightly upon his heart. Letting loose of her grip she allowed Homer to slide off of her arm and fall lifeless to the ground. After examining the still beating organ within her grasp for a moment, she lightly brought it to her own chest where it appeared to be melded into her own body as if entering tar. Once fully absorbed, she’d turn over to Ryn and stare down at him with bright glowing yellow eyes and they sane blank expression. “Are you alright, my Master?”</span>

Dazzle amongst the highest point their arduous climb may offer, and squeeze it for every bit its worth... so when such was the farthest from the case here, Ryn, naturally, was confused. Instead of being greeted by a glorious, shining hero brandishing armor and weapons rivaling the very heavens, he was met with <strong>goop</strong>. An actual, slimy conglomerate of black tar, the sight of which immediately brought concern to Ryn&#39;s eyes. His first thought was that he had failed. Screwed up the chant maybe, or faltered on a note. Utter disappointment would&#39;ve followed next-- if not for the furious voice that echoed behind him. Before he could so much as turn around, strong hands lifted him by his collar, and a choke rasped out of him as his body slammed against one of the cargo crates.</em> 

<em>Dizzied by the impact, Ryn&#39;s eyes strained to focus on the waft of blonde pinning him up. When eventually his vision did clear, he gasped, hands leaving his instrument and grasping Homer&#39;s arm, holding back the blade against his neck. He strained to do so however, and in Homer&#39;s rage, a line of blood drew across Ryn&#39;s neck. Panicking, the lad blurted.</em>

<em>Ryn&#39;s body hit the floor just as he was about to finish, groaning. He expected the fists of the furious writer to come barreling into his side, and winced for the strike... but it never came. Ryn&#39;s cautious eyes dared to peek open, and the sight he saw stole his breath. A lady in black, tall and brooding, stood triumphantly with Homer squirming in her hand. Her posture was straight and poise, and unwavering gaze absolute. At first, Ryn watched on with awe. For it was obvious: he was being saved. She was a hero, incredible strength, cool outfit, and just speech and all. Those were his first thoughts, rubbing the slit on his neck where Homer had nearly killed him. Alas, such admiring awe was quick to turn into horror... as the woman&#39;s hand penetrated clean through Homer&#39;s chest, and his beating heart pumped from where the author himself could see, if only he had the strength to turn his neck. A cry rung throughout the bay</em> 

<strong>&quot;NO!&quot;</strong>
<em>Ryn lunged forth as Homer&#39;s body slid off the woman&#39;s hand, catching the man, now limp, in his arms. The horror in his eyes furthered looking down the hole within Homer&#39;s chest, and the lad&#39;s lips trembled as he tried shaking the investigator up.</em>
<strong>&quot;S-Sigńore? Homer?&quot;</strong>
<em>Again and again he shook Homer&#39;s body. There was no response. All became quiet. Then, drums began pounding in Ryn&#39;s ears, screaming an ugly cacophony that made his heart convulse and head ache. His panicked eyes quickly flicked to the woman. He saw Homer&#39;s heart, still spurting blood over the floors, slowly begin enveloping into her chest. Healing magecraft. It could save Homer. In no less than a moment, Ryn tackled against the tall woman, banging her chest with his fists while begging her desperately.</em></span>

<em>Ryn&#39;s voice broke. It was useless. The heart was long gone within her leathery clothes, and Homer, dead the moment Ryn had caught his corpse.</em> 

<em>Unable to muster a word, the lad&#39;s legs gave out on him, and he crumpled to the floor in disbelief. It was almost as if he hadn&#39;t even heard the woman&#39;s question, his face blank in shock as he ran a hand through his hair, trying to quell make sense of what just happened. He noticed his hand was slick... and upon lowering it under his eyes... he saw blood. Homer&#39;s blood. All over his clothes, his hair, his face, his guitar-- his hands..
Ryn could not muster a single word. Not a peep. He could only stare at the dark leg of the woman he sat empty before. The leg of the woman he knew, somewhere in his head, he&#39;d summoned. Wondering to himself...
&quot;What have I done...&quot;</em></span>

I believe his exact phrasing eluded to harvesting your organs. Considering all that was taken from him was his heart, I believe he received a lighter sentence than what was planned for you.” The woman knelt down so that she may be eye to eye with the boy. Her hair was ebony black, same as the ichor, yet not an inch of her looked greasy or out of place. If it wasn’t for the horrors that just occurred before him, Ryn might only see a young woman in her mid to late 20s  who had never seen a violent day in her life. She carried a soft faced beauty that did not accurately reflect her demeanor, which almost made it more off-putting. 

Slowly she leaned in and spoke in a calming and even tone, seemingly to not heighten his anxiety beyond what it already was. “What you have done is summon me master. I am designated under the Assassin class, and I stand ready to follow your orders master. Shall I dispose of the body? It shall be no trouble for me if you find the sight of motionless corpse disturbing.” 

She was such a stark contrast from Ryn’s present reaction. Whereby he was distraught and beside himself, Assassin continued to remain mute in emotion, simply seeing the situation in its simplest form and only seeing the next logical steps before her. Yet she still kneeled before him, a being capable of such violence yielded before this boy. This servant could be either a blessing or curse depending on how Ryn responded next. As she waited for him to make his decision, her head tilted as she seemed to study him. “Dorian means a great deal to you doesn’t he?”</span>

Too wrapped up in the horrible red that painted every fiber of his being, reeking of the metallic stench of murder. It fumed every part of his senses and invaded his head, and none of the words Assassin spoke got to Ryn. None, at least, until the very last sentence she uttered before him. That name. <strong>His</strong> name. The lad&#39;s head shot up, nearly ramming the woman right in the jaw, and he stared wide-eyed her.</em>
<strong>&quot;W-What...? You know him? You know Dorian?&quot;</strong>

<em>Well, that&#39;d certainly gotten to him. He was paying full attention, for a moment, forgetting the stench that plagued his every waking thought. His hands had stumbled back on the blood-stained floors, looking for some sort of grip on reality. It was all coming at him too fast. There was no way this woman-- a servant no less, could know who Dorian was. Such a thing should be impossible... yet, he&#39;d heard what she said. He could ask her again, he bet, and she&#39;d repeat it clear as day. That enough pulled Ryn back from his temporary daze, and on sparked, though dismally, a hint of hope in his eyes. Could it be that, through the haze of blood, a miracle had arisen before him...?</em></span>

Fear of the unknown is a common trait in boys of your age, though I suppose your situation goes beyond the normal realm of adolescence. I can tell that my display has taken you aback, I apologize for that. As your servant it is my purpose to protect you at all costs. You are fortunate I arrived when I did otherwise you might be covered in your own blood instead of someone else’s.” Gently Assassin stood back back to her feet and offered a hand to the young boy.

Quickly she drew the broomstick from her back with the metal prongs faced outwards to them. “Who are you? What have you done with Mr. Hathaway. Give me one good reason I shouldn’t signal the ship crew right now.” 

Ryn would see in front of him, yet another young beautiful girl with fire red hair and dressed in fine baggy clothes and overalls. She looked no older than himself, yet still carried a maturity beyond her years. Although she only seemed to be threatening them with the other side of a broom, Ronda appeared to carry an air of seriousness and appeared prepared to act upon any wrong move they made. “Speak swiftly and carefully lest I mark it as the last words you shall have as a free man.” <span class="mention" title="&#198;nkidou#4116">@&#198;nkidou</span></span>

Of course she didn&#39;t. She just knew Dorian meant something to Ryn, somehow... and what good was that, exactly? He already knew how dear Dorian was to him-- however the woman knew, he was confident he knew himself better than she did at a sparse glance. Saying such only reminded the lad how much he missed the man... so as Ryn gazed at the woman, down the length of her outstretched arm, mysteriously rid of the blood that&#39;d coated it seconds ago, his face tensed in confusion. He didn&#39;t understand-- why? What did she want, telling him things he knew better than anyone else... was she toying with him...? 

A flash of color flicked in the corner of Ryn&#39;s eye. The bright hue of fire. Blank of expression, the lad&#39;s head turned to look at the flames, met with only a girl. He took one moment to look her down, staring listlessly at the broom she pointed at him and Assassin, before the lad jolted in a panic on the floor.</em> 

<strong>&quot;Wait, wait!!&quot;</strong>
<em>He screamed, but not towards the girl threatening him. His wails were meant for his servant. The lad&#39;s body jut infront of the leather-clad woman, stopping her from acting out as she had with Homer. Then, speaking in a voice that was anything but careful, Ryn burst out.</em></span>

<strong>&quot;He&#39;s dead okay!? I killed &#39;em, I-I killed Mr. Hathaway, I--...&quot;</strong>
<em>Hearing a sudden choke, the girl would see the bloodied lad&#39;s face pale, and his hands wrap around to his neck. Fingers massaged tensed flesh, tentatively prodding muscles strained for a reason Ryn didn&#39;t understand. It was if a knot had been tied at his throat, sealing off those awful words he would&#39;ve spoken. Only, with no way out, his words instead festered in his stomach, tossing and turning his insides and making him want to retch. The feeling made his body feel heavy, and the lad shakily shook his head, trying to lighten the weight. Eventually, easier words to say squeaked past his lips.</em> 

<strong>&quot;I promise I did&#39;n mean to... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</strong>
<em>The lad hiccuped, hanging his head above Homer&#39;s body. He hadn&#39;t wanted any of this. He hadn&#39;t wanted to run away from home, nor take food away from the strangers of the Canopus... nor had he wanted to kill a man. But it all happened. Homer was dead. His blood pooled at Ryn&#39;s knees. And still, at even the passing mention of Dorian, the stowaway could forget all that, just for a moment... and have hope stir in him? 

There was something wrong with that. Something terribly, terribly wrong. However, a stinging heat in Ryn&#39;s eyes hazed the world before him into a blur, and he couldn&#39;t see what was wrong anymore. The hope in him was gone, and before he knew it, tears were dribbling down his cheeks. Such a pitiful view it was as he stubbornly pressed his face into his sleeves, trying to wipe it all away.</em> 

<em>Still rubbing at his face with crimson-stained sleeves, Ryn stumbled to his feet on his own. He took an uncertain step behind his servant, and spoke to her in a voice no louder than a whisper. It was all he could muster while he desperately tried composing himself.</em>
<strong>&quot;Assassin... I-I a-accept our contract. But o-only under one condition: we do not kill. N-not like this. Do you understand?&quot;</strong></span>

This boy needed her help, though this red head was a new addition to the equation that only served to make it interesting, especially after Ryn’s silent assertion. She would nod her head and respond. “As you wish master. Though I shall continue to exercise necessary force to keep you safe. Though if you deem this one out of your purview, so be it.” 

Assassin turned her attention directly to the red head and seemed to stare right through her. “Your master threatened my own, claimed that he would dissect him and sell innards across the world. What occurred next, regardless of the methodology was brought upon by himself. In that moment it was either him or them, and my master chose to live. Though based on his current demeanor, my master does not seek a similar demise for yourself. You should consider yourself fortunate for winning over his favor so quickly. Introduce yourself, so that the two of you may become more properly acquainted.”</span>

Her eyes narrowed. “You idiot, shouting like that on the main deck like that was of course going to get people’s attention. Did you really think someone wouldn’t take advantage of your negligence.” 

Ronda looked back up at the two of them, her expression still stern but not as furious. “You’re a servant.” Her eyes glared over to Ryn. “A servant intended for Homer.” If Ryn felt uncomfortable by Assassin staring right through him, this was just as bad if not worse. “Although I don’t really like the fact you were stealing from him, I understand you are trying to do your best to survive in your own right. Let me guess, there’s something waiting for you back home that only a successful mission for you can restore. Can’t say I fully relate, but I can sympathize I suppose.” The end of the broom began to lower away from them, as she knelt down and started pilfering through Homer’s pockets, pulling out different coins a few ink pens, and a small red leather notebook the size of a journal. Placing the items into her own bag, the girl smiled up at the two for the first time. “Ronda Parker, mechanic and rigger extraordinaire. Now who the hell are you two?”</span>

To say the least, her grin was met with a stare of utter stupefaction.</em>
<strong>&quot;Y-You...&quot;</strong>
<em>The lad held his tongue, pretending his eyes had simply stung even more all of a sudden. In any other case, stealing from the dead was as heinous as bad deeds got... but Ryn had done worse to Homer. He was in no position to say anything.</em>

<em>He simply turned his head away, giving up on rubbing the tears away, as the blood on his sleeves only made his eyes sting more. He didn&#39;t want to look, it made the guilt feel all the more sick in his guts, and Ronda&#39;s gaze wasn&#39;t comforting. Though, after hearing Assassin accept his wishes... the lad did feel a little better. Just a bit. The distance between all three of them was still far, a notion Ryn would&#39;ve rather kept intact for the moment, seeing how the both of them seemed to act. The boy didn&#39;t find it entirely bad, if that counted for anything. Perhaps the leather clad woman knew, in whatever strange way she knew about Dorian, that Ronda&#39;s assumptions about him couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. There was nothing waiting for Ryn back home... in fact, he was the very thing that waited back home. He just decided he couldn&#39;t wait any more.</em></span>

<em>Alas, that was not what she asked forn was it? Ronda wanted their names, and though the lad was secretly concerned about how easily she could brush off her master&#39;s death, Ryn was obliged to answer. He curled his arms tight around his instrument, sniffed his nose, and spoke.</em>
<strong>&quot;R-Ry--&quot;</strong>
<em><strong>BEEP BEEP. ATTENTION ALL CREW...</strong></em>

<em>The lower decks suddenly turned an evil shade of red, and voices louder than even the loudest scream from a man blared urgent warnings all throughout the halls. It was too loud to hear clearly, especially with even more ruckus clashing in the background. Ryn&#39;s vision flashed from pure black to hellish red every half second, and he felt dizzy again, causing him to stagger forward. He ground his foot into the floor, but yet another tremor roused throughout his body, crumpling his knees until one hand had to support him from below. As soon as his hand did reach the floor though, it too quaked like his legs, and he struggled staying up on his feet.

Closing her Assassin attempted to focus in on the environment. &quot;Their are other servants nearby, they appear to be in midst of battle. It is presently unsafe for you master. It would be unwise for me to fight so many opponents all at once, especially since we do not yet know who all is our enemy.&quot; Her tone was straight forward yet still even giving an impression of calm. Slowly she&#39;d approach the boy and kneel before him. &quot;I can take us far from the danger if you so choose, Is there anything you need or wish to take before we depart, do you have any allies upon this ship that needs rescue?&quot; The fact she was able to stay focused even in a high tense circumstance such as this was a credit to her status as a heroic spirit. Each question and intended action carried purpose and reason behind it. Assassin easily could tell that Ryn was scared and uncertain of themselves, therefore his servant will have to serve as his mind and give him a guiding hand on what should he be focusing on.</span>

She didn&#39;t much appreciate being brushed and treated as if she wasn&#39;t there. &quot;The three of us were mid conversation, and emergency or not you have a lot to still answer for. Despite me not really caring much for Homer, he still was my key to this adventure. Since you lot killed him, that means in my mind you&#39;ve taken his place as my catalysts for getting what I want. I don&#39;t care what you do or where you go, but I am coming with you end of story.&quot; Ronda spoke with a fire in her stomach and drive that would send most men crazy. It was unclear if she would be a hinderance or a help, but regardless she intended on tagging along.</span>

But the crew just started getting close to Nirvana-- surely, fighting couldn&#39;t have broken out amongst the investigators so near to their destination... unless... there were other servants aboard the Canopus. One&#39;s that didn&#39;t call themselves investigators. Fraught with sudden urgency, Ryn held Assassin&#39;s arm for support, and got to his feet. He was just about to tell Assassin if she was sure servants were really fighting on the ship-- until Ronda started talking. The more she spoke, the more she confused Ryn as to her morality... but her panic wasn&#39;t misunderstood. He nodded hastily.</em>

<strong>&quot;Take her-- her and H-Homer. All I need is on me already and...&quot;</strong>
<em>Wait... if servants were fighting aboard the Canopus... that was dangerous, wasn&#39;t it? Getting caught into the crossfire between powerful beings like Assassin was a deadly fate-- all the crewmembers and investigators-- just how many had already fallen? The smell of death became more putrid in the air at the thought, and Ryn shut his eyes tight. No, he must think elsewhere... not to those with unfortunate outcomes but to those still alive. Ryn knew almost none of them, but a twisting feeling in his stomach told him he couldn&#39;t just leave those left to drown. Who, though, could he save with Assassin&#39;s help, and how many? If it was only few... there was only one person he could think of. Ryn gulped. Yes, that was the person he wanted most to help. He hoped everyone would be alright... but before he aided them, he could not leave kindness unpaid for.</em>
