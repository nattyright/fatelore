Anything from synthetic animal fur coats to Pallas Cat undies can be found here, reminding people of better times where tacky merchandise was the only thing worth worrying about. Due to the high number of supplies, it has gathered the attention of Nirvana’s Servants who currently use it as their base of operations.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Alex stalked the well-trodden pathways of the former shopping district. Back in the day this location was teeming with tourists, crawling all over the place like a swarm of insects. Buying up and comsuming its resources. Now it was home to a much smaller but still numerous amount of islanders. Even in the slow hours of the day a number of residents still lingered about, scavaging the remains or harking their own wares to passerbys, much to Alex&#39;s chargain. The mental noise of the population rang hummed like a soft static in their head. On more than one occasion Alex had considered thinning the population but ultimately decided against it. Doing so would bring too much attention to them, and despite the noise it was still at a tolerable volume. As long as there was no sudden increase in the population, Alex would continue to live as they did.

Occasionally, a pedestrian would catch sight of the strange figure. Wearing a long dark coat over a complex looking mechanical chestpiece and a helmet with a single glowing vertical light down the center. Most knew of Alex as a strange introvert who viciously guarded their territory and steered clear of their path. Those too ignorant or too foolish to stick around too long in Alex&#39;s prescence were quickly scattered by a sudden onset of anxiety and panic. To make this difficult journey a bit more tolerable, Alex had stopped at a confectionary to pick up some treats. The cashier was intolerable, nervously laughing and trying to strike a conversation to hide her fear. Alex saw through it all of course, stewing madly in silence until they got what they wanted and left. Eventually, Alex reached their destination, their favorite store on Nirvana.</span>

A single middle age bearded man looked up from the register and let out a single grunt. The man&#39;s mind was quiet unlike the average islander, was he jaded by experience or perhaps too old to really care? It mattered not to Alex. They approached the front and placed a single mechanical component on the desk, followed by a handful of metal coins and old slips of paper. The man took one look at the items before him, grunted once, and walked into the back of the store. It was the most pleasant interaction Alex had all day. Now they just had to wait for the man to get their part and they could leave this unbearably noisy place and return back to their sanctuary.</span>

Of course as soon as she had returned to her estate, Ruth sent communication to one Ashley Drakin. The little puppeteer had a knack for some of the unsavory business Ruth will be up to soon. 

So she had invited the girl to an outing to the <span class="mention">#merch-store</span> where they could discuss some business. While treating Ashley to another plushie. 

“Ashley, my little <em>poppet</em>.” The woman greeted her associate. “How have you been recently dear?” Ruth extended her hand as she extended the question, a typical greeting from the cult leader. Expecting a kiss upon the hand.</span>

Trying to fix her clothing to look at least a little presentable she turned to the green haired woman with a tiny soft smile.

Next to the lady stood two strange looking men. Both of their eyes shimmering with emptiness as they shuffled their feet behind her. Giving off a strange air, these two did not look around the room and just looked straight ahead, saying as close to the young lady as possible.

It had been awhile since the young lady had left her lab, almost a week in fact but once she got the invitation she couldn&#39;t say no. She was running low on supplies anyway and needed to grab some more &#39;parts&#39; as she would put it.

&quot;Ruth.... it&#39;s been awhile... sorry to keep you waiting I was up all night....&quot; With a semi loud yawn she shuffled over to the taller lady happy to hopefully be getting some new parts soon from her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There were various reasons for Aslan to search through the merch store right now. But the main reason was it was getting cold as hell and his little friends managed to make some room in the closet by ruining half the stuff he had in there. Well, doesn&#39;t matter, he would have needed to go island shopping sooner or later. The moment he entered the merchandise store, Aslan made a beeline immediately towards the clothing section.  While doing so, Aslan too a quick glance towards the current attendants of the store. Two pretty good-looking ladies aaaaand... A weirdo. 

Well, maybe Aslan should take that thought back, because he did hear a lot of things about a certain individual on the island from some of his customers. Mostly just rumours and gossip, but it was rumours and gossip from both influental people and average town folk. So there was probably <em>something</em> going on... Actually, was that even him? Maybe it was someone else... There are a lot of weirdos on this island, so why would this one be the more famous one... Eh, it didn&#39;t matter anyways. He&#39;d just quickly get what he needed and be on his way again. Squeezing his way past the women with a quiet &#39;sorry&#39; he quickly picked up as many shirts he could find that looked like they could fit and was on his way to the register before anything happened.

The cultist held her hand out for a few more moments awaiting the greeting she expected. But this girl, she needed rest. <strong>Badly</strong>. Flanking her, as is usual, are the boys. Ruth never bothered to grab their names but her pet loved them just so much. 

“Even the boys came along with you. <em>Lovely</em>. But next time, please get more rest.” The hand remained extended for a moment longer before it retracted. “Dearest, I have some news to speak with you about. The Good Doctor gave me quite the exciting <em>tip</em>.” 

Ruth looked at the other occupants of this shop. An elderly man, A younger gentleman, and… a well… Human, Ruth supposed. Perhaps that’s the infamous Bronde resident? 

And of course her hungry eyes began to stare upon the figure. Looking past her associate. Curious to see what rested beneath the suit of armor.</span>

No, three people were intruding in this one safe zone Alex had in this place. Alex quietly growled and clenched their hand, but stayed put by the register with the goods and the strange cash they brought. Just a few minutes and they could leave.

Alex then felt a presence draw closer. Static noises filled their head with a small mix of uncertainty and anxiety. Alex slowly craned their head around to look at the intruder. The metal emotionless face stared back at Aslan but said nothing. Regardless, Aslan could feel that he wasn&#39;t welcome in this being&#39;s presence. Then Alex tilted their head in curiosity.

Normally, populated places such as these were filled with a mish-mash of various thoughts and emotions of all different types and complexities. However, they were all being drowned out by a single growing sound. A loud gnawing hunger that only wished to consume. Alex stared past Aslan and directly at Ruth.

<strong>&quot;...noisy...&quot;</strong> A heavily synthesized voiced echoed from the helmet. Between that and the clothing they wore it was extremely difficult to determine whether it was a man or a woman.</span>

Grabbing small bits of supplies the two men emotionlessly moved around the store, one walking right by the armored figure without even flitching.

Looking up for a moment she released how close he had gotten to her scary neighbor. She grabbed the slightly visible strings and quickly pulled the puppet man back. Though half asleep she knew better then to get on his bad side, its the last thing she really needed to deal with on top of everything. She looked between the both Ruth and Alex and took a step back now clinging to the orange haired man&#39;s arm and sneaking over to where the stuffed animals were.

&quot;That.... that would have been really bad.... don&#39;t go there... not near there....&quot;

The orange haired male only looked down at her and nodded his head softly as he was dragged away, the small blonde boy following the two with his arms full of supplies as Ashley watched a black haired man walk by her as she flashed him a soft attempt at a friendly smile.

While Ashley made a warning, the woman did not pay it any mind. Taking a step towards the robotic looking individual. A demure look upon her face, asides from the intensity of her eyes. 

“You look unfamiliar to me. Are you perhaps <em>the</em> Bronde heir? Or the squatter that laid claim to their lands.” The woman spoke with poise, approaching in a non threatening manner. She extended a hand. “The Name is Ruth Naomi. If you aren’t too much of a recluse, it would be so lovely to see you at a service at <span class="mention">#the-new-holy-mother</span>.” 

While her face and manner of speaking were wholly civilized. Alex could just feel the hunger intensify. As her eyes stared daggers into the suit of armor before her.</span>

&quot;Bronde estate? So he is the person everyone was talking about...&quot; Aslan muffled under his breath, tilted his head a little bit and decided to inspect the walking armour more closely. 

At least he did that for a short while before he realized most of the gossip he did hear was mainly calling Bronde a big red flag that everyone should stay away from and decided to take some steps back and distance himself from Bronde. <em>Just in case.</em> Of course he did all of this as subtle as a brick, looking almost as if he was just provoking Bondre at this point.</span>

As Ruth spoke to Alex, they merely groaned and rubbed the side of their head as if in annoyance. Her words were overshadowed by the noise of her hunger like everything else. For a long moment, Alex did not move or say anything. Eventually, they looked back to the register. The man had not brought out their item yet. Alex then turned back and began to rummage through their bag. They then pulled out a chocolate muffin and placed it in Ruth&#39;s hand.

This infuriated Ruth slightly, along with the comment the figure made. The forehead vein made its appearance as her hand forcefully gripped the muffin. Destroying the pastry within her grasp. “My apologies. Perhaps you should keep that <em>tongue</em> in check.” 

The hand’s grip loosened and the remnants of the pastry fell to the floor. The cult leader wiping her hand upon the closest material that is not her own clothes. Which just so happened to be apart of Alex’s garb. 

“Well, stranger. Let your secrets be kept. Darling, little <em>poppet</em> do you have what you need?” Her attention and those hungry eyes turned away from the empath. Walking towards her associate. 

She gently nudged Aslan out of her way. “Excuse me.” Ready to leave this place.</span>

A bunch of yarn and threads, three bags of plastic forks, a bunch of cups, and a few other things as the two boys held their own random items. She smiled to Ruth and nodded looking down at all her findings she could use for her babies but then slowly looked up at Alex, her smile twisting ever so slightly into something more deranged. 

&quot;Hello there neighbor good to see you for what like the second time ever, you should get out more...&quot; Unfased by his terrifying air he held around him she only stood closer to her little minions. All three of them hiding behind Ruth after just in case he wanted to try anything.

&quot;But what did the bird man say Ruth...? Is it anything scary? Or are more people dying?&quot;

“Oh dear, she should be allowed to indulge as often as she wishes.” Ruth smiled. Before once more giving attention to her companion. 

“Our bird sung a wonderful song. The seagulls <em>have grown restless</em>.” She shared the song of the bird to her puppeteer. “But the rest we should discuss in private. After all, some <em>exciting things</em> will be coming your way.” 

Ruth left a hand full of money upon the counter, not exactly counting the amount left either. But she assumed it was enough. Before waltzing her way to the door, assumed to be shadowed by the boys and Ashley.</span>

Still, at the very least it didn&#39;t seem like they were up to anything here. He&#39;d just stay in the back, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. Just be quiet, hold still and try to figure out what the heck seagulls being restless means. Or do something else to pass time, anything in order to ignore the fact that Bondre is still going to be at the store with him.

<strong>”So loud. So noisy. Like a swarm of insects ceaselessly buzzing around my head.”</strong>

It started small. A dull throb in Ashley’s hands. A twinge in the pit of Ruth’s gut.

<strong>”Worms crawling inside my mind. Poking and prodding into every recess.”</strong>

The pain in Ashley’s hand increased. She could feel her tendons snapping, her finger bones cracking and breaking. Every nerve in her hands screaming in pain. Physically her hands looked fine but the pain was white-hot.

The twinge in Ruth’s stomach grew. First into a craving, then a hunger, and then starvation. Like she hadn’t eaten anything in days. A bottomless pit in her gut demanding to be filled.

<strong>”People’s minds…are so noisy…”</strong> The purple lights on Alex’s helmet glowed ominously. <strong>”They need to be… more silent…”</strong></span>

The moment was that interrupted by the sound of something being dropped on the front desk followed by a small, unenthusiastic grunt. The shopkeep has returned with Alex’s item.

Immediately, feeling of pain and hunger vanished from Ashley and Ruth. Alex then calmly and silently retrieved their item while the shopkeep scooped up the mysterious currency.

Alex turned to leave and looked at Aslan. They could feel the twinges of fear and anxiety coming off him. Alex raised a finger and pointed at Aslan.

<strong>”Be quiet.”</strong>

Immediately Aslan felt a wave of blissful stupor wash over him. A feeling of wanting to do nothing more than to just sit down and vibe with the universe.

As Alex began to leave, they stopped in front Ruth.

<strong>”My name is Alex Bondre.”</strong> Alex spoke plainly. <strong>”I spent a very long time cultivating and preserving my own sanctuary of peace and quiet. I will not tolerate any intrusion to that peace and quiet.”</strong>

Alex then turned to Ashley.

<strong>”Kill them quickly or indulge less often. Otherwise… I’ll break your hands again.”</strong>

Alex then began to leave the store.]</span>

<strong>CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME, BE THE WOLF WHO SWALLOWS THE SUN. CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME. EAT THOSE BEFORE YOU AND LEAVE NONE LEFT FOR THE SCAVENGERS OR THE EARTH TO RECLAIM.</strong> 

While this might have meant to be a power move on the part of Alex, it awoke the most primal portion of her origin. But as soon as it came, the feeling left. Returning to slumber within. 

Her eyes were still wild as the empath spoke their name, and their wish to be well left alone. “Duly noted, Mx.Bronde.” The eyes gave the other human one final look before exiting the premises of the building. 

“As. I was saying. Let us retire to your lab for a more in depth conversation. You do remember the <em>last time</em> the seagulls brought things to this island, do you not?”</span>

Gently stepping towards the blonde haired boy she started to pet his hair gently with her one free hand with a twisted grin on her face. A loud laughter playing in her head as she remembered their screams.

&quot;Of course how could I forget all those fun days, I&#39;m so happy they brought little Ally to me, I wonder who will join our family next huh...?&quot; The blonde boy called Ally only looked at Ruth blanky. He would only blink once in awhile but his stare was lifeless and empty. The now soulless creature only looking on helplessly.

&quot;If I killed then quickly they wouldn&#39;t be this beautiful now would they neighbor....&quot;

Who knows what would happen if he succumbed to it. He wouldn&#39;t just sit down and let those weirdos do whatever they wanted. 

Fortunately it didn&#39;t seem like they were allies or something like that, so at the very least they wouldn&#39;t gang up on him if something happened after all. Probably. The two girls were about to leave the premises and Bondre seemed to follow suit... Hold on, all of them were just leaving like that? This would be the best case scenario usually but... Man, couldn&#39;t they have talked about a less interesting topic?

 Aslan quickly made his way towards the door and poked his head out of the store. &quot;H-Hold on you two! W-What do you mean, seagulls?&quot; Aslan finally asked. This topic just happened to worm its way into his mind, no matter how much he was panicking or try to figure out the situation he was in in the first place. He just needed to know what this meant. &quot;I doubt you mean actual birds, after all... Are we getting visitors again?&quot; He asked, this time with a little bit more contempt in his voice. Turns out he was able to feel something else other than just fear.</span>

The woman took a step forwards, and her hand made contact with the man. Almost immediately a was of exhaustion washed over him.  

It felt as if his stores of mana had been taken away, leaving a very minimal amount. “Forget our conversation and get back to where you belong, <em>boy</em>.” It was strange to see as soon as she made contact her visage almost brightened up. Became more concrete. 

“Ah yes, I too am very excited for another to join your family, little <em>poppet</em>.”  With a smile she and her shadow made their March to a more private portion of the island.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>&quot;Ruth Naomi...&quot;</strong> It was the first time Alex had heard that name, but even a recluse like Alex had heard of her. The adoration and fanaticism of her followers hummed loudly in the background of Nirvana&#39;s consciousness. Having met the woman herself, Alex could tell that she was dangerous. Far more than a simple cult leader. That hunger she had was unnatural. Plus she was loud. Two qualities Alex hated.

However, Alex&#39;s thoughts were on the conversation Ruth and Ashley had. From the way they talked, something big was about to happen. What was going on with the seagulls? Alex stopped in the middle of the street and in a rare occasion, reached out to the pulsing heart of Nirvana&#39;s subconscious. Alex instinctively flinched as the floodgates opened and the tide of thoughts and emotions crashed into them. Alex groaned as they sorted though the many, many thoughts until they found what they were looking for. A strange unifying element of every citizen of Nirvana. That intense animosity of outsiders. It was growing stronger, more prevalent, which meant only one thing.

<strong>&quot;Outsiders...&quot;</strong> Alex intensely growled. <strong>&quot;Unacceptable.&quot;</strong> Perhaps they would get some usage out of that S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame after all.

Her mind was racing as to what kind of outsiders would show up, if any of them were pretty enough to join her collection. There had to be one at least... but if it was anything like the last time maybe getting that old S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame out would be a good idea. The last thing she wanted was her babies to get hurt. With a wicked grin she followed along quietly, ready to crush anyone who got in her way.
