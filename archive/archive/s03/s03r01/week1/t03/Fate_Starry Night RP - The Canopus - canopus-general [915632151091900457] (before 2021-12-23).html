Each in a small coterie of similar professions, Scientists, Psychologists, Hunters, etc. Each a different nationality and from different places, and as such, he himself stood among a small group of medical personnelle. How long had he been on this ship? A month? Two? It couldn’t have been more than two at best, they had picked him up almost like a ripe fruit, from what seemed to be his clinical office to the small cabins, the transition was almost effortless. But now, he could feel antsy that he wanted to get off this damning ship. With a sigh, he turned back to a pair of chatty doctors, nodding his appreciation at the idea that they were able to discuss some issues that plagued the community but quickly dismissed himself, quickly heading toward the side decks of the ship to give himself time to breathe.</em>

“They said the project wouldn’t take too long, but I didn’t expect it to take any longer than this. . . “

<em>He said under his breath, and it wasn’t until he had gotten close to the empty and vacant rails that he had finally let himself relax, or well, loosen a bit. Dante’s mind wasn’t one to often give itself time to breathe, especially not now. When they had proposed such a thing, he knew exactly why he had come along, and that very thing seemed to be the reason he even continued so far. The doctor’s mud brown eyes shift to his lame arm, to anyone it looked perfectly normal. However, strange enough, it wasn’t physically harmed but rather, it was almost spiritually damaged, lost in its own world where it had ceased functionality. A curse, and a burden to himself.</em></span>

The current case could easily apply to the young man walking through the halls of the ship. He wasn&#39;t wearing his usual clothes, he was wearing a chef&#39;s white jacket and hat, as he walked to the kitchen to fulfill his job. Weirdly enough that wasn&#39;t his actual job he had been asked to help oud due they lacking enough staff and he really didn&#39;t had anything better to do with his time till they arrive at his destination but what began as a one time deal had turned into basically a part time job for him and the worse was that he hasn&#39;t even come to realize it till just a few days ago.

Then again in his defense it could be said that the work keep his mind busy enough that he didn&#39;t had time to worry and it was quite fun to a degree. But even then it didn&#39;t make it any less ridiculous. 

&quot;Are you alright sir?&quot; he said as he looked at the man a few steps in front of him.</span>

Yet it wasn&#39;t that he doubted the doctor words nor that he find it weird he was just staring at the ocean. If anything one could say he was the weird one for suddenly speaking to a total stranger. 

But at the same time the sudden tone and how it slowly changed as words continue to came out sounded a bit weird. Then again it could just be nothing but Allen own misinterpretation of the situation. 

&quot;I am quite well, and I appreciate your concern&quot; He said with a smile, honestly at this point being a chef was basically quite engraved in him. &quot;Cuts are quite an issue for those working on the kitchen that much is true, but as I have been told one only cuts oneself in two kinds of situations, when one is either fooling around or not paying enough attention.&quot; 

The smile never leaved his face and a certain tone of enthusiasm could be felt as he spoke of an old lesson, his crimson eyes looking at the doctor completely unaware of what could be going in the man&#39;s mind.</span>

“Ah, that may be right! So I’m guessing you’re a chef also before here? As you can guess, I am a doctor if the lab coat did not give away the profession.”

A doctor was one of the positions a crew always wanted filled up regardless of how much it would cost. It was just like the man in front of him had said many accidents could happen at any times and they needed someone to keep things from getting worse. 

It may vary depending on the ship he was but the main reason was that if all members of the crew were to fall ill or get hurt there would be no one to take them to their destination. In this time where water covered the world being stuck unable to move was quite a great fear for those who traveled this water. 

&quot;You could say that, I am a bit of a freelancer. I do all sort of jobs, right now I work in this ship kitchen&quot;  he said keeping his smile, just like the doctor he was enjoying this unusual exchange, as it did provide a change from his usual routine. 

&quot;Its a pleasure to meet ya Doctor, and be sure that if any of my coworkers end up having an accident I will leave them in your care&quot;</span>

His face changed for a second as he felt like something wasn&#39;t right with his word, his smile fading for a few seconds as he try to understand any possible other meaning the doctor modesty could give.

But that just lasted a mere moment, after all his mother had taught him &#39;No one in this world is truly special&#39; perhaps that was what pushed the doctor to proclaim such words. Then again this was also nothing but his own interpretation and even so his own naivete as he saw the doctor as good person. 

&quot;Yes I am also heading to nirvana, I was employed to fulfill some requirements for a certain client&quot; he said deciding to not confront the doctor over his previous choice of words.  &quot;Hard to say honestly, any work has its own difficulties and dangers, anything can happen so is really early to say anything regarding that.&quot;</span>

<em>Dante had quietly said the last part to himself, though it likely looked as if he were talking to himself, his voice hushed to a whisper. In a brief moment, he fought over two options, introducing himself or simply trying to retreat back to his own cabin, hoping he couldn’t stress himself over the ideas that this mission could bring him. And with a small strange sigh, he simply shook his head and bowed lowly.</em>

“B-but was nice to meet you! Thank you for such a good conversation!”

<em>He spoke almost too fast for others, but, to him it felt too slow! And with that said, he kept his head down and began to walk away, trying his hardest to be as quick as possible as he turned the corner and left the man by himself. He didn’t even introduce himself! And soon, he made a beeline towards his cabin, doing his best to avoid any others until he had finally reached his room. And even then, he felt the need to lock it before he gave a sigh. He tried to not overthink the idea of what they could be approaching, but even the thought of having to try to stop thinking about it made him want to pull his hair out! And so, to try to calm his nerves, the doctor grabbed a book off the small shelf that housed them and busied himself. Flipping through the pages so that he could at least physically try to not think about it at all. . . Forcing something to have himself read, anything to keep his worry from over taking him.</em>

Was he cut out for such a thing? He didn’t know, and yet he knew there wasn’t a way out of this. He had been obligated to do this, and yet he knew nothing that he had been obligated to! A panicked hand went to his head, dropping the book he held onto the floor with a page sprawled open, it’s contents on the idea of summoning a servant.</em>

<em>The Doctor took in a small breath, he remembered pieces of what they had asked him to do. He was going to complete a mission. He was going to need to use what he could in order to complete his contract. That had to including having a servant by his side. He was to survive and aide in whatever manner that he could. And almost immediately, he could feel his breathing almost begin to regulate itself, changing from its erratic and shaky moments of panic, to a more calm and willing inhale. Okay, he had to breathe more, think about what could be a solution. Doing his job was one. . . He was here to support those who also boarded this ship. And to do that, he needed not only his own expertise, but he needed to follow what the instructions were given to him. Summon a servant. Those instructions, those instructions would be the way he could continue this. He needn’t to worry much on the rest. . . He could go about it one step at a time, and with that in mind, he fixed himself to get ready for what the summoning entailed.</em>

<em>It took about 20 minutes or so to draft the correct powdery circle and such to mimic the same requirements on the book. With the ruby beads in his hand, Dante pressed his fingernail to his hand, with enough force to cause a small cut on it, causing the blood to drip from it onto the summoning circle which caused a luminous light to blind Dante a bit, but before his body could move to end it, his mind was ahead of it, and force him to begin the incantation. He tried to speak, his voice quiet and meek.</em></span>

Come forth in duty, from desire, under will.”

<em>And with that, the light gleaned like starlight, quick to force Dante to take a step back and his mind losing the strength he had so quickly gained. Was he wrong for doing such a things? What if he had failed? But, even his thoughts were being burned away, for even they were evaporated by the harsh rays the circle emitted.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the light from the summoning circle continued to flare and brighten into a red and gold flame, Dante could see the ground underneath the circle turn into marble, with the transformation spidering out in all directions, transforming more of the floor and a small corner of the room marble. The wind generated from the summoning spiraled throughout the room, picking up and throwing books and Dante&#39;s items in every direction. The book that Dante was reading about summoning would fly past his head, slamming into the wall behind him, flipping open to an image representation of the servant and master meeting.


Within moments of the ensuing madness, the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame began to form as a red and gold cocoon of light appeared at the center of the circle. An orange, red and golden sword swung out from the cocoon, splitting the cocoon in half, revealing the Servant within as he was facing away from Dante, sword outstretched from the swing. Standing on top of the molten marble as it was quickly cooling and solidifying underneath his boots stood an imposing figure with slicked-back red hair dressed in a bloody red and an ornate golden armor, his gauntlets that covered his arms up to his shoulders colored in silver accented with a blood-red tint. As he turned to face Dante, Caesar&#39;s piercing golden-orange eyes trained on his master, making stern, uncomfortable eye contact with the doctor. For a moment, he stood there looking upon Dante as if studying a new book, deciphering a language, looking upon a new and unexpected phenomenon.&#160;


&quot;Salvē. Tell me, are you the one who has summoned me?&quot;&#160;


Caesar spoke in a strong, authoritative, yet somewhat thoughtful tone as he dispelled his blade in a flick of his arm, the sword disappearing in flame and gold light.

He rose his hand to shield his eyes, winds beginning to race past him, papers flurrying about and his book found itself slammed against the wall. The floor became a slick marble, which when Dante tried to move back, he couldn’t catch his footing in time and forced him to hit the floor with a thud. He wanted to scurry back as if a mouse tempted to crawl back into its hole.</em>

<em>The bright summer colors that had began to illuminate the room were almost mosaic, artistic even, each one a glorifying shade and hue of red, gold, and orange, that even Dante, while panicked couldn’t help but marvel at it. And soon, that panic had began to become a mixture of curiosity as well as soon, a blade soon pressed from it, skewering the light as if an it could have been tangible. What could have been holding such a thing? Who could have? The answer wasn’t something he knew immediately. . . But, after having seen the blade, the armor showed itself, a gleaming color that mimicked the hair that the man had.  If the man had thought the eye contact with the doctor was uncomfortable, no word could describe the feeling Dante could have seen, his glasses lopsided from the fall and his hair unkempt from the winds, he looked as if he himself had gone through a storm. The swordsman’s words were deep, commanding enough though it was a question. And even that question made Dante ask himself if he wanted to answer it. Could he have admitted he’d summoned him? Would it be good to? His body trembled for the moment, the only fear he felt since he was but a young lad. This. . . Was what magecraft did.</em>

“Yes, I-I summoned you. You’ve really heard my call?”</span>

He was in his prime, from when he doubled the lands of Rome. From when his people viewed him as a God.

Caesar&#39;s last thoughts from his deathbed crossed through his head.&#160;

&#39;Have I played the part well?&#39;

His last words to his closest friends as he gave the remaining life he had in his veins into the spirit of Rome. Now the words felt like they were said moments prior, yet they felt like they had been said a lifetime ago, simultaneously Caesar felt like he lived in both the past and present, presumably that was the fault of the summoning and the magic that carried his consciousness and will across reality for him to be here in front of this doctor. Perhaps it was time for him to play a different part, maybe he could raise another successor. As Octavius studied his master he took mental note of every part of him. One arm seemed stiff, his body language skittish, the voice was lacking bravado, but there was a determination that Octavius could almost taste. Something in his eyes gave Caesar all of the answers that he needed.&#160;

The tall servant closed the distance between him and Dante, clasping his armored hand onto the doctor&#39;s shoulder with his working arm, and gave Dante a small confident smile.&#160;

&quot;I heard your call, loud and clear, Master.&quot;&#160;

Almost as if he had been reading Dante&#39;s thoughts, Octavius began again.

&quot;You have summoned to your side The First Citizen of Rome, Heir to Julius Caesar himself, Saber Class, Gaius Octavius Caesar.&quot;</span>

Dante tried looking up at the man,  and noticed the smile he kept, and steadied his breathing, counting each inhale and exhale. One two three. . . One two three. . . His husky confirmation that he had heard the skittish doctor’s call had then really stopped his shaking all together. So, he had summoned himself to his side. Even when it could have been anything else.</em>

<em>The word ‘master’ was almost distasteful for him, though he knew that was what this contract would have been anyways. It was one of which one served the other, a mutual benefit, and yet the name sounded misguiding. He shook his head, no, he had to be the leader in this, right? Wasn’t he the one who needed to be protected against whatever he faced? He was going to open his mouth to ask who exactly had the man been, when he answered for him already. . . A man of Roman descent, and close to Julius Caesar. A saber at that too. Dante racked his brain to remember what Rome was, he had remembered it in textbooks, long stories of which the earth was a place of beautiful hills and valleys, forest and desert. There had been an empire, but even empire was an understatement. . . That empire gained popularity through political gain, military might, and even stories circulated about it in the books to the day, but he couldn’t find himself to imagine such a thing true. How had an empire gotten big yet fallen? It didn’t make sense.</em>

*But, here was a man who had been from it, from the way he dressed and his attitude, the doctor couldn’t help but believe it either. And so, instead of questioning his idea of whether he could prove himself to be truly of Roman descent, he instead did what he should have done.</span>

On one hand, he&#39;d been pleased he wasn&#39;t summoned to some ego-ridden bastard, yet he couldn&#39;t help but wish that this doctor was a bit more. Although he could see the potential present within Dante and he intended to bring it out. The telltale sign for Octavius was the fact that Dante could still speak despite his presence and actions. In reality, this introduction was like a game of latrones for Octavius. Every word or little reaction was a move, a poke, a prod, simply to see how the doctor acted.&#160; So far he liked the effort to make himself appear as an equal or superior. Still passive, however, he would try his best to bring out the master he was summoned for. 


He then released Dante&#39;s shoulder and walked around the room, running his hand along the walls of the cabin, slightly admiring the handiwork but mainly he was being dramatic.&#160;


&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong… master…&quot; He lingered on the word for a moment as he paused as if to taste the word in his mouth. He didn&#39;t like it.


&quot;Master isn&#39;t a title befitting for you, nor will I call you such,&quot;&#160;


After he made the statement he turned his head sharply back to Dante and made eye contact once again.


&quot;Tell me, <em>Dante. Jeanne. Colt.</em> Why should I, inheritor of Rome, provide you the respect and devotion that is provided to a <em>master?</em>&quot;


He asked in an inquisitorial yet foreboding tone as he let his words sink in like a veiled threat. He wanted to see if the young doctor would have some sort of fear or panic or delight from his words. For added effect he slowly paced his way back to Dante, one arm crossed with his elbow resting on top, his free hand stroking his chin.


&quot;Why should I provide the might of Rome to your cause?&quot;</span>

As the man trailed the cabin walls, inspecting the work of it, Dante couldn’t help but wonder what he did so for, the simplistic room had nothing to gain yet lose, a basic color of white with a small painting bringing in what could only be a handful of mediocre color, if he trying to judge how nice the room was, well, he’d likely be stuck with the word “bland”. But, once again the Saber broke the silence that Dante would have allowed to make present, that he could have quickly taken refuge in.</em>

<em>Maybe it was the way he said it, ‘master’, that made Dante’s body run cold, as if the blood had soon slushed through him, any sort of heat and hope he had, resigning from him. The newly-found master’s stomach churned in agreement, only reinforcing the future statement that Dante knew would be said next. He tried steeling himself for it, waiting for it to be said. He wasn’t fit. It was a mistake. If anything, it wasn’t uncommon for masters who did not seem fit to be killed by the servants they summoned, his brain teased him with the thought of it. Would he be cut down as well? Killed for his incompetence? Their eyes met once more, only this time, what imitated bravery Dante’s eyes told before were battled with the nostalgic and coping indifference that felt overpowering.</em>

<em>His name being called out felt more of an interrogation than a true question, and maybe it was to be taken as such. How the Roman spoke of himself, Dante could have ignorantly believed that Rome was still there, that he’d be the one who needed the power of an empire washed away by the sands of time, and the washed again by the depths of the sea.</em></span>

Why did he need such? Did he truly have what was to be said to be such a master? But, with every question there were two answers that continued to be nearby, one whispered yet the gravity of it was enough to force his attention, and the other loud yet somehow undiscoverable. He needed to get his arm back. And he needed to be able to complete the task he was given. But, to say the first would give way to show how selfish of a person he was. To fix something that was already so prominent in his life, and to admit that he himself had needed magecraft to deal with such a thing. The other? It was instinctual, contractual even. He had a job to do, heal the wounded, and to do what was ordered. No one would think he would be lowly if he were to admit the second, and so, no one would think him handicapped. Only obedient. A second or two later, he spoke it, the answer he felt was the most voiced, and with that same lie of bravery, in what sounded like a command than an actual answer, and in what could at least try to make himself think he still had what was needed to be seen as what the Roman had easily dismissed.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After hearing Dante&#39;s words, Octavius blinked a few times and then gave a low deep laugh that slowly escalated to an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Then after a few moments, he abruptly stops. Octavius should have expected as much. It wouldn&#39;t be that easy to bring out the wolf from the doctor. At least he was trying, but trying wasn&#39;t good enough. Octavius already had a clear view that Dante was speaking out of his ass. A boy of such nervousness and lacking of spine? A doctor with a frozen arm that hasn&#39;t moved once in this conversation when the rest of the individual can&#39;t stop shaking like a cold, wet cat? A shivering master with as simple a goal as doing what he&#39;s told? If this Dante was a cold, stoic soldier of some sort he could believe that they would have such a bland reason for existence, but this doctor? 

No, Octavius knew that there was more to it. If that was a doctor&#39;s purpose then what of a soldier? He needed to find out what this task was. For now, Octavius had resigned himself to this attitude towards his <em>master.</em> Until this <em>Dante</em> gave Octavius a better answer: he would be callous and estranged towards him, but he would comply. He would comply to avoid complete rejection of a potential partnership, he didn&#39;t want to make the young doctor shut down entirely. From the moment he was summoned and how Dante moved and acted, it was clear this doctor was here for a purpose and once he found out what this mission was, Octavius would be able to find out why Dante was here, then when the young doctor was truthful with him, he&#39;d provide him with his worth as a servant and as a Roman.


Octavius slowly uncrossed his arms before summoning his blade back to his hand.


&quot;Well then <em>Dante. Jeanne. Colt.</em> What mission is so important that you would need Caesar? Why would a doctor specifically need a servant in the first place? Are there not better candidates than a healer?&quot;

It was close enough that the doctor could see his reflection in the sword and close enough that if Octavius moved it any closer, the speed would rest against his cheek.


&quot;Why should I be obligated to serve under a tool? That is what you are Dante. A tool. If you are serious in your purpose being simply to obediently do as instructed then that is all I shall see you as much, <em>doctor.</em>&quot;</span>

And that would force him to explain the reason of why he’d been afflicted, and of the sins that were committed by his family generations ago, as to why he felt he’d have to atone for them.</em>

<em>Once again, his name was said to address him, the words digging into him and wounding what little hope he had to keep to himself in this mission. But, his quick questions were unable to be answered by him, they were meant to be said one by one, but even Gaius knew that his master—No, the man who summoned him— wouldn’t be able to give much of a convicting answer other than what he had been repeated to say. What he truly felt would be changed and defaulted to and easy to give for those situations.

Behind that sheepish nature, there was some potential there. Even simply saying the truth constituted a form of courage. Especially such a statement that would hurt a lesser man&#39;s pride. A lesser man would probably have ended Dante on the spot for such a comment.


&#160;He&#39;d get that answer from him eventually, but for now, he&#39;d simply play the part. Perhaps in due time, the young doctor might be straight with him. But that was for him to approach on his own, the Roman emperor didn&#39;t care to force him on it. For now, he&#39;d be Dante&#39;s servant and his supposed <em>bodyguard</em>. The word repulsed him for a moment. The greatest emperor Rome had ever seen, reduced to a mere protector for a healer. He gave a light sigh. Sacrifices needed to be made. He was still a servant after all.


In any case, Dante was right, by technicality, he did accept Dante&#39;s call and summoning. He had chosen to be the servant of a tool. Octavius however knew that Dante was more than a simple tool. There was a Caesar in that anxious head of his and there was certainly more he could learn about the doctor, for now, he&#39;d let Dante stir in his anxiety. There was no use in rushing Fate.


&quot;Fine <em>Dante</em>, I shall accept your words. For now. I&#39;ll play the part of your protector and servant. While I live, nothing will touch you.&quot;


Of course, he was going to do it regardless, it was simply a formality and insurance to the young master that he indeed succeeded in summoning him once again.&#160;


&quot;Now that we got proper introductions out of the way <em>Dante</em>, explain to me what is going on and why a doctor needs a servant for protection. I presume this isn&#39;t a holy grail war?&quot;


He asked simply. Despite the one-sided mind game, he was playing with Dante, as</span>

But, now he had to deal with whatever the Saber would give him past this. It was one thing to not kill him, it was another to fully obey what the doctor had ordered him to do.</em>

<em>Though the saber had affirmed that Dante would be safe, away from whatever could harm him, the brunet took that moment to move away, putting a few small scarce yards away from and the man. He had threatened him with a blade, and though he had so nicely put it back, Dante hadn’t trusted him enough to know that this saber would truly keep his word.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius took a glance over to Dante as he shuffled across the cabin away from him. Perhaps he was a bit excessive with the sword. No matter, what&#39;s done was done and he&#39;d made his point, or at least he hoped he did.&#160;

Octavius pointed at Dante and spoke again. Slight anger was present in his voice as he spoke again.

&quot;Nonsense Dante, a doctor is one of the most important parts of the battlefield, alongside any soldier or commander. You keep the fight going.&quot;

He snuck in the quick encouragement to Dante, while he was being callous towards him, he wouldn&#39;t be unfair. In any regard, an unconfident doctor is an untrustworthy doctor. Especially if that doctor was supposed to be his master.

Even to allies, one must remain strong and unmoving. Speaking of which, that would likely be the next topic after he was done learning of the current objectives of this mission, which much like everything else said by Dante… had been lackluster. It seemed as though he&#39;d have to play along with the doctor&#39;s passiveness until the time arose for him to find some real information.&#160;

Something that struck Caesar as well was that they had a healer summon a servant. Either that meant Dante was a supreme asset overriding Dante&#39;s defeatist attitude or…

&quot;Tell me Dante. Am I the only servant? Surely a doctor wouldn&#39;t be the only one privileged enough to summon a servant.&quot;

Either way, it would be peculiar. If he was the only summoned servant for this mission, then either this was an oversight or the doctor was integral to the mission. Alternatively, if there were more servants summoned for this mission. What could warrant the need for such force? As well, were the previous teams given servants? The saber was deep in thought as he turned and leaned against the wall, the alternate side of the room from Dante, scratching his chin and looking back at Dante once again, although his gaze was more sympathetic this time around, less interrogative.&#160;

Either way, his first objective was</span>

However, no sort of blade would be conjured up, and he even got a sort of agressive compliment from it. However, little could a compliment do to help ease the self induced storm Dante had within himself.</em>

“I didn’t say that doctors were not useful, I said that I am not useful.”

<em>His voice wasn’t one fo protest, neither of a fight that seemed already won, instead its steady tone simply was a mere acceptance, of what could not happen. Doctors like he weren’t soldiers, and he wasn’t going to be on the battlefield. But, he of course wouldn’t tell that to the Saber, he didn’t want to create animosity within the Emperor, a useless master with no intention to fight, against the man who ruled a country founded years ago. It was a besmirchment on his title. On his authority.</em>

“I don’t know if you’re the only servant, we were told to summon them within the meetings and such. . . Each person was given a job to at least. But, I don’t know why. . . The other teams should have gotten this done before us, but they even failed. I don’t know why we’re sent here now.”

<em>Gaius wasn’t the only one who had these questions, initially once Dante had gotten the chance to hear about it, he too was curious onto what could have happened to the other teams. How had two teams failed so easily? Had they put up a fight? Where had they failed at? Did they too summon servants? Would he end up the same. . ? That lady question plagued him consistently, teasing his mind with fake and yet so vivid images of what horrors could be there. Bodies of faces he hadn’t seen.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If there was something that was making Octavius angry, it was the lack of confidence that Dante held in himself. This would take time to remedy, he knew this. However, with an attitude such as this, Dante might as well have already been defeated before the waters became turbulent. His agitation was present somewhat in Caesar&#39;s face, particularly Dante could see what looked like flames broil within the Roman&#39;s eyes. The doctor&#39;s words were like nails on a chalkboard to Caesar as it was an oxymoron to him. It had been a while since he&#39;s given a good speech, indeed, he needed to show Dante what his <em>words</em> meant to the emperor. How he&#39;s disrespected the gaze of Octavius. Perhaps he&#39;d been wrong about this one. Perhaps the potential he saw was wrong. Perhaps this Doctor was nothing more than a fluke.

&quot;Then you aren&#39;t a doctor if you don&#39;t value your worth, <em>Dante.</em> If you believe that you only have worth in your healing ability, then you must believe that you have worth in yourself. The lack of confidence that you hold in yourself is why I cannot hold confidence in you or your decisions as a master. What kind of doctor, what kind of mage even has no confidence in themself? If you cannot manage that, then... What even is Dante. Who are you? Are you even a doctor? You state that you are a doctor yet you have the confidence of a floundering fish. If I protect you with my life, could you even save it?&quot;

Octavius&#39;s voice was deep and stern, there wasn&#39;t a hint of direct anger in his words, but there was an undertone of scorn from the Emperor. Dante infuriated Octavius, he made the First Citizen of Rome angry. Such a thing wasn&#39;t possible, even against Marc Antony, Cleopatra, the rebellion in Carthage, none of that angered him to this end. At first, the fury was surprising, he couldn&#39;t get the reason to appear in his head. Why was he furious at this doctor when nothing else angered Octavius to such a degree, the only feeling close was the news of the death of his father.</span>

The anger turned into resignation after a moment of letting the pressure from his magical energy suffocate the room, he took a moment to breathe and had a deep breath before he turned and drove his fist through a wall next to the door of the cabin.

&quot;No matter <em>Dante.</em> I&#39;ll bring out the potential that I see in that frail spineless body of yours. Whether you want it or not. Am I clear? <em>Master?</em> If you accept defeat before the battle has even started, then you&#39;ve already lost the hardest part of the battle.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>If he had made the first citizen of Rome angry before, Dante could feel now he was livid, and almost immediately Dante&#39;s instincts told him to retreat back into the ever so high walls that he could easily create again. However, just like harsh his pessimism seemed to the emperor, the idea of he being helpful without much to give was nearly a mere taunt, a joke at what he consistently lacked at. His speech had already begun before he could even try to instinctually utter out an apology, was it foreign that he was couldnt do much with what he had? That the master could not prove his worth? He wasnt saying that he was not a good doctor, but that he was not a good master! Not a man to fight on the battlefield, nor a man to easily go to war Each question seemed to be as strenuous as weights, each one being tied to his thoughts and forcing him to try to pick up what he could. The doctor tried to find answers that his mind would allow to be spoken, even if they were lies.</em>

&quot;I am Dante Jeanne Colt. . . A cardiologist. I have decent skill as a doctor, but I cannot say that I am better than the handful that ride about this ship.&quot;

<em>He carefully chose to not answer the last question, not wanting to speak things that could be thought untrue. But he did wander it as well, would he save his own life? Would he have chosen to move forward if his servant had protected him? He thought he would have, but something lethargic and desolate inside him thought the opposite as well. The doctor&#39;s eyes kept looking down, trying to not show the doubtful feeling that cradled him. The crash of Gaius&#39; fist going through the wall not enough to make him even raise to look at him, but rather continue observing: the ground, his labcoat, and his shoes. The saber&#39;s bold affirmations made him take in a breath, knowing that regardless he was still having to go through his mission with it, and that he&#39;d still have to be a master. With a soft sigh, he replied.</em>

&quot;Yes, you are understood, Saber.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius sighed as his anger subsided. He felt as though he drove his point home a bit too hard. This would take time, time that Octavius had of course, but it would take time. He supposed that it was better to have a master with potential, however hesitant they&#39;d be to accept it, rather than a master with nothing to build on. The emperor was starting to realize why he was so invested, why he was angry at Dante. In any case, this conversation was over, he&#39;d made his point and had said everything that he&#39;d wanted to say to his master for now. He&#39;d let him stew in his thoughts for a while. There was no good in rushing development, that type of thing took time and effort. He could force Dante to be more than he thinks he is. Ultimately, the changes would have to be made by Dante, and Dante alone. He could only light the way. He again looked at the doctor, looking at the ground like a disciplined child. Most likely internalizing all of Caesar&#39;s words. 

&quot;I am going to walk around the ship, familiarize myself with the rest of the crew.&quot; The Saber stated simply. There was nothing else to say or do. He hoped that he got through a little bit to the boy.

He thought he would stay quiet, but when he spoke again as he turned to leave the cabin, a smile crept across his lips unexpectedly. He was glad that Dante wasn&#39;t looking at him, the smile would probably be a tone shock. The doctor&#39;s actual introduction. It wasn&#39;t much, but it was a start. At least he was being a bit more honest.

&quot;Well Dante, I hope we may work together well.&quot;

Octavius looked away from Dante and at the door to the Cabin as he unclenched his fist slowly, something that he hadn&#39;t realized he&#39;d been doing. He understood why Dante both made him angry yet excited, disappointed yet hopeful, dismissive yet also nostalgic. As Octavius opened the door of the cabin to leave, he knew what it was that made him invest in Dante Jeanne Colt. 

He reminded Octavius of himself.</span>
