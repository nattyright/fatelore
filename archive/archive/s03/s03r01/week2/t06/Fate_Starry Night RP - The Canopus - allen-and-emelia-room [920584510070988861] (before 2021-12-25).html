Allen was quite tired and all that was in his mind was to lay down and rest. After all from what he knew this days of just working and peace would end soon enough. Sometime it really hit his mind, specially at times like this when he was tired like this. How in a few days all was gonna change and the possibility of death was something real enough for him to ignore. Yet at the same time there little he could about, worrying would solve nothing he knew that well enough. That was partially why he worked to keep his mind busy but even then he the concern still came out. 

He enter the room and let himself fall on the bed, still dressed as a cook as he felt himself too lazy to change. He let out a yawn as he put himself comfortable enjoying the softness of the sheets. 

&quot;Yep... I earned this&quot; he said with a smile as he continue to lay down.</span>

However, she still expected more than what she saw! Not that any of that mattered. Most of the time spent on this mission would be on Nirvana anyways. All she needed to do was hold out until they reach their destination. Sounds easy enough!...Right?

&quot;At least I have my own room. I can enjoy some nice peace and quiet while I write up my reports.&quot; Emeilia&#39;s footsteps  rang out through the empty hallways of the ship. One look of the map and she knew where to go to reach her room. No need to constantly double-check. She was confident that she would find it and soon enough she does. 

The sounds of the doorknob being turned broke the quiet atmosphere as the door opened. Did someone need Allen already? Wasn&#39;t he off duty? No, the people who entered was someone new. Someone who froze in the doorway holding onto her suitcase once she saw the person laying down on the bed. &quot;....&quot; Did she have the wrong room? Impossible! Her memory was impeccable. She couldn&#39;t be wrong!</span>

This wasnt his first time of a ship after all, small stuff like jokes or night visits between crewmembers was something Allen has only heard yet had to actually experience in person. 

Was there and issue and needed to be informed? Was there a problem in the kitchen? Many possible ideas began to ran through him mind as he tried to get a better look at the person standing on the door. He raised an eyebrow as he saw the young woman frozen on the doorway. She looked surprised and confused, Allen began to position himself better, now sitting on the edge of the bed as he try to take on what was happening right now. 

&quot;Hello? Can I help you?&quot; he said as he continue to observe the woman, not sure of what else to say or do in this situation but wanting to get it over as soon as possible to go back to being able to rest.</span>

That just wasn&#39;t true! This was her room. Shared quarters between both sexes was something that was forbidden where she was from. To say this was taboo in her eyes would be an understatement! 

&quot;Help me? Yes, you can help me in fact! Explain to me why you&#39;re in my room and why I shouldn&#39;t get security to have you removed immediately!&quot; The woman before him pointed her finger at him as if he was in the wrong. Which was weird since she was the one who barged in and acted like she owned the place. A slight tinge of red dressed across her cheeks, ruining any attempts of hers to appear serious before him. 

Emeilia took a deep breath and placed her suitcase on a nearby desk. Then she pulled out a ID card from Geneva that she had on her. &quot;I&#39;m Emeilia Lewis. I&#39;m a part of the investigators on this ship and I was told I would be given a room, not a shared one! Much less one with a guy!&quot; Her voice reached a higher octane once she got the last part.</span>

He repeated the woman word inside of his head, her loud tone waking him out of his tiredness as he let out a yawn. 

&quot;Alright miss&quot; he began as he streched his arms a bit over his head. &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about your room, but i have been assigned to this one for the last month or so?? Hard to keep time when inside a ship like this.&quot;

For Allen the whole situation was quite simple, then again his own situation as a cook did let him understand the situation inside the ship a better than your average guy. 

&quot;Probably is an issue of lack of space&quot; he said as he let out another yawn. &quot;There isnt enough space for single rooms I guess. Oh my name is Allen Ignis, pleasure to meet ya.&quot; He said as he lift his left hand and give her a lazy greeting.</span>

&quot;A lack of space? Surely, you must be kidding me...&quot; Emeilia hung her head low. Her hand was brought up to rub the bridge of her nose to relieve some stress and push back the encroaching headache. She can already feel the pounding pain such a headache will bring her. 

The reality of the situation slowly dawned upon her that she had no actual say in this. If what he is saying is true, then she&#39;s stuck sharing a room with one of the staff members, let alone a <strong>GUY</strong>! 

&quot;This can&#39;t be happening...&quot; Emeilia completely ignored the kind greetings from Allen. Her mind was elsewhere. &quot;There has to be someone I can trade rooms with...&quot; She combed through her memory of all the other rooms and occupants she read on the list. All the other women on the ship already were paired up. She just had to be the unlucky odd one out in this case!</span>

While he could see that sharing a room with an stranger was probably not a thing she was fond of it was just gonna be for a few days, weeks tops.

&quot;I am not kidding ya&quot; he said as he looked at her with a more serious expression. &quot;We are quite short on resources to say the least, everyday is a bit of a struggle just to produce enough food for everyone.&quot; 

He was speaking the truth, there had been more than a few times the head chef had asked him and some other just to try and catch some fish so they can get something to use for lunch. 

&quot;But really dont see what is the issue, let just try out best to get along till we get to Nirvana. I promise ya I wont try anything if that is what concerns ya.&quot;</span>

But Geneva shouldn&#39;t make a mistake like that. Did they do this on purpose to test her capabilities? They had to be...

&quot;The issue is that shared quarters like this is forbidden on Geneva! It said so in the rules! It-Ah.&quot; She froze before she continued as the realization that she isn&#39;t on Geneva anymore eventually got to her. After living in a place with so many rules and guidelines that must be followed to the letter, this ship is the equivalent of the Wild West in her eyes. So lawless and without any rulebook to follow. This was hell to someone like her.

She never broke any rules before. She had a perfect record. One anyone would be proud of having! To think she would have to soil said record for the sake of the mission. This was truly the hardest test of her resolve...</span>

5 years, for 5 years he had been traveling across the many nomad cities that existed around the world. While he was far from considering himself and expert he had seen a bit of everything and or course he had heard of Geneva. He personally didn&#39;t like the city, being forced into whatever they decided for you was the very reason he had left his home, but then again it wasnt his place to criticize how they handed things there. But then again maybe they could help him understand a bit why his mom wanted him to protect their land so much. 

&quot;Well I am sorry to inform ya there is nothing we can do about it if this was the room that was assigned to you. On the bright side, you get a new life experience&quot; he saif with a smile as he tried to ease her mood at the current situation. &quot;But why exactly are they forbidden back there??&quot;

Allen wanted to think of himself as a reasonable man, so he wanted to make the best of the situation. Maybe a common ground could be found between the two of the so she wouldn&#39;t be so distraught by this? After all it was bound to get annoying if she continue to yell.</span>

The initial shock of the situation was wearing off as just the stress was settling right in now. The casual conversation did help her out though. Even if she&#39;d never admit it, nor realize it actually.

&quot;It was to discourage interpersonal relationships between both sexes to allow others to focus more on their duty to Geneva instead.&quot; She spoke rather plainly, as if she were reading off from a list of facts she had stored in her head. &quot;They had a bunch of other rules similar to that.&quot;

It was one thing to hear about Geneva but to see someone who actually lived in the city, and see how it molded them as a person, was something else. A life governed by rules, strict guidelines, and extremely high expectations are what made Emeilia who she was. That much was clear to anyone who knew of their origins. Was Emeilia even given a choice on how she wanted to live her life? The answer is likely not. Geneva made her believe that it was for the best though. <strong>&#39;For the betterment of Geneva.&#39;</strong> That phase was heard plenty of times in her life to justify whatever they needed. 

Her eyes opened up as an idea popped in her head. She didn&#39;t need to get used to not having rules. She could just make some of her own! There was no need to jump straight into the deep end right away! &quot;Hmpf! Allen Ignis, was it? In lieu of the lack of proper rules here, we will just have to come up with our own rules in order to better this situation we&#39;re in!&quot; The smug smile on her face showed the level of pride she felt for coming up with such an idea.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Is that so?&quot; Allen ponder her words as his expression turn serious for a bit as he tried to understand what kind of person he was talking to. The way Emelia said it make him think that such life should had been a very lonely one but stopped himself before the words came out. It wasn&#39;t his place and she probably wouldn&#39;t listen to him. What&#39;s more she looked a bit more calm than when she entered the room and he didn&#39;t wanted to ruin the  mood. 

Still even if he wouldn&#39;t speak of her way of life that didn&#39;t meant he approve of it. To him it was confusing, to live and devote himself for something was okay and something he would encourage but it needed for ti to be his own choice. A decision he came on his own, why should one place should be protected at the cost of others?? Why should Geneva or any city for that matter be so important than it would completely overshadow the will or needs of its inhabitants?

Those questions was something he had trying to answer in his travels but he find it really hard and he wasnt any close to getting his answer. 

&quot;Wait what?&quot; Allen said a bit surprised as the heard Emilia talk about setting rules. &quot;I guess I dont mind as long as they are reasonable I suppose. What do you have in mind Emelia??&quot;</span>

So no parties, or whatever you boys do.&quot; Already, she got down writing the list of rules with a fervor unlike no other! It was difficult to do hand motions with a pen in hand but she did her best.

&quot;Now second rule...&quot; Then she started on a long list of rules that somewhat mirrored that of her home city. Hours where each of them had the room alone to change. A schedule to follow as to not bother the other. It even had times for lights-out! Everything was written down to a tee.

After she was finished, Emeilia handed the list to Allen so he could double check the list himself. Her handwriting was clean and free of any mistakes. How long did she work on her penmanship, or rather how long did Geneva make her work on it? &quot;What do you think? Did I miss anything?&quot; Unlikely! The sparkle in her eyes added to the fact of how proud she was that she thought of such an ingenious idea. Well, ingenious to her, of course. Probably not so much to others.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Different emotions began to swirl inside of Allen as Emelia began to write all the numerous rules she wanted to install to make their cohabitation bearable.

Part of him couldn&#39;t help but respect how proactive she was and how fast she able to get to the situation. Honestly based on her first words he woukd have expected to keep yelling at him for a while longer. Yet another part of him found her really weird, for all her knowledge and the such she seemed really ignorant of how some people outside of her city. Like sure he was a boy, but he wasnt that much of a party guy but it wasnt that big of a deal for him either. 

&quot;Alright lets see&quot; he said as he reached for the piece of paper with his left hand. Were Emelia to look at them he would see burns of different degrees and sizes over the back of his hand wrist, suggesting they could extend through his forearms.

&quot;Well...&quot; Allen was unsure on how to react to the so many rules. Like part of them make total sense, one would say some of them were common sense and it wasnt even needed to write them down. 

But just like that there were other which seemed to be quite a hassle. Allen wasnt used to  such limitations in his actions he liked some leeway to deal with different situations. 

&quot;Well i think that beyond this ones&quot; he said pointing at some of the rules that he could easily follow.&quot;We really dont need much else, like I agree with the quiet and time for each to change but my work is very irregular so i dont think i could follow this even if i wanted.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It wasn&#39;t hard for Emeilia to notice the various burn marks on Allen&#39;s hand. At first she thought it was due to being a chef as accidents do happen. What kept her from accepting that was the varying degrees of the burns. They couldn&#39;t have came from simple accidents. 

However, Allen&#39;s response took her out of that thought process and back to focus on the topic at hand. &quot;...&quot; Emeilia glared at him while she grumbled with her cheeks puffed up. She wanted to think of a good comeback to send at him. Unfortunately for her, his words were valid. That doesn&#39;t mean she had to accept them though! 

For someone who was so used to having things planned to the second, irregularity was something she absolutely dreaded. 

Without so much of a word, Emeilia swiped the list away from him and held it close to her chest. &quot;Fine! We will just have to adjust the schedule as time goes on then! How does that sound?&quot; Even if it took them the entirety of the trip to get into a schedule that worked for both parties, she was going to do it.</span>

It wasn&#39;t cause he doubt the situation wasn&#39;t serious, to a degree he could understand that she needed something like in order to relax, or at least to let him rest in peace. But remaining serious was hard specially with the expression she was making. As much as she would want o appear angry, to Allen she actually looked quite cute but the man had enough sense to know that saying that out loud would lead to more problems. 

&quot;I guess that could work?&quot; Allen said as he heard Emilia rebuttal. &quot;But feel like is too much of a hassle considering we only gonna be sharing rooms for a short time. You should try to relax and enjoy whatever time we have till we reach the city.&quot;

With that Allen proceed to lay down on his bed looking as the ceiling as he tried to relax again.</span>

He even had the gall to just lay down as well! &quot;This <strong>is</strong> to help me relax and enjoy whatever time I have to spend with you on this damn ship!&quot; Emeilia tapped her finger on the list of rules repeatedly. The poor clipboard enduring each tap after the last. 

The headache was returned. Finally. for the first time once she came in here, Emeilia sat down on her bed and took a deep breath. The bed felt nice at least. &quot;I can&#39;t believe my luck...&quot; 

Emeilia debated on including this in her report. She had to be thorough so she couldn&#39;t leave out any details as per the mission&#39;s requirements. But did HQ really need to know about this?

She never thought that she would be so out of her element so quickly. Perhaps that was the point of this mission? To stick her in a position where her comfort zone would be the furthest thing from her and see if she could still perform well. It was definitely a stretch to think that. There had to be better ways to test her abilities after all. None of this made sense to her. Maybe that&#39;s why she was still considered a rookie despite her intelligence.</span>

Just be reasonable&quot;

While he understood he wasnt getting off of getting a schedule regardless of his will he was sure he should at least put his foot down when it came to the unreasonable demands. Part of him was now curious about what kind of life she must had for her to need rules and structure so much specially when were going to a place that may lack both things completely. 

On a side note he felt it was a bit of a shame she was so stressed all the time. She had quite the cute face so seeing her expression turn sour so much was actually quite a shame in his opinion.

&quot;Shame you can&#39;t relax, people would be able to see your cute face better that way.&quot;

He open his eyes at the realization of what he just said. He had meant it for it to be an inner though but it had accidentaly come out. He let ouf a sigh as he turned his face to look at her preparing himself for a wave of yells and insults.</span>

One could hear it drop inside the room with how silent it became. If one listened close enough, you could even hear the waves against the ship itself. That was how silent it was. 

The moment Allen turned around, he saw Emeilia staring at him with the same wide open eyes as he had. Like a deer in the headlights, she remained frozen after hearing such a thing. This marked the first time Emeilia ever received such a compliment. The first time someone openly called her cute to her face. Her mind didn&#39;t know how to process it. It was like all the gears in her ever-moving mind suddenly had a wrench placed within them. 

A light shade of pink started to spread across her cheeks as she slowly understood what was just said to her. A guy just called her cute....

In front of her face no less!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Emeilia stood up. Her hands were balled up into fists. Did she plan on striking for him saying what he just said? While her clenched fists told one story, her embarrassed expression told another. Her puffed up cheeks, which are now painted with a nice shade of red, betrayed any attempt to look truly angry at him, despite that being exactly how she is currently feeling at the moment. 

She searched her mind for the best comeback against such a thing. The perfect response that would truly put Allen in his place. Then he will learn of the difference between their intellect. One that would immediately have him on his knees and groveling before her! &quot;<strong>YOU IDIOT!</strong>&quot; Except what came out was none of that. 

A pillow flew at the face of Allen before she stomped her way out of the room. &quot;<strong>Ace!</strong>&quot; She called out for someone called Ace. Who was Ace? Why would she be calling out for him after such an incident? She left the room before such answers were revealed however.

Emeilia continued to storm off down the hallways in search of Ace. However, she would most likely not end up meeting him before cooling off. She wouldn&#39;t hear the end of it if she bothered Ace with something so trivial. She needed to relax and calm down. It was only until after she cooled did she realize how awkward things became after her little <s>cute</s> outburst. Maybe she can find a barrel to sleep in for the duration of this trip so she could avoid having to face Allen after such an embarrassing display of emotions. While she probably wouldn&#39;t find a barrel to hide away in, she did know about one thing though.

That this was going to be a <strong>long</strong> trip to Nirvana.</span>
