For Allen time has become something hard to measure, his busy work and life inside the ship had become a bit or a rut. One he had come to enjoy to a degree. While there obviously many problems, like Ryn having issues learning the job at first or Emelia need to have schedule  Allen had come to enjoy the company of those inside the ship.

&#39;We will arrive at Nirvana in 24 hours&#39; That declaration had signed the end of his time as a cook. As much as he enjoyed being one, he had a previous mission he needed to fulfill and was now changing gears as he began to prepare for it. He went to his room and picked up his red coat and black gloves as he left his chef jacket on the bed. He had avoided wearing the coat for most of the time he had been there but that was only because he was a cook then, but now he was back to being an investigator. 

He asked some member of the crew to move his servant frame to the deck as he really had no idea what was going to come out so he rather have some space to work with. He has heard that they could try and get a catalyst to ensure the type of servant they wanted to but unfortunately he lacked the resources for that not that he really cared. For him as long as his servant was trustworthy he was fine with anything. 

Flames began to dance around his as he began to chant, his eyes closed as the flames moved at the pace of his words. 

&quot;I promise you, my flames shall erase all that is evil and protect all that is good. Come, guardian of fate! You are my hope! My last hope!!&quot; 

The flames leaved him as he opened his eyes as they entered a pillar of light and fire engulfed the metal figure as he reached for the one who would fight alongside him.</span>

Muscle and sinew formed out of thin air and covered the metal skeleton but despite that process till being ongoing skin formed over the top of it quickly followed up by the individuals clothing. Once the flames cleared the process was still ongoing and Allen would be able to see the tail end of the process as muscled formed around the frames fingers before being covered up by skin and clothing. Yet that isn&#39;t where it ended. Something much larger manifested itself as motes of light coalesced into solid shapes that rapidly grew out in size to form the second part of his servant. The weapons claws and defining features of a ship of all things.

When the final details were put upon his servant including the ever so hated Nazi symbol upon her right sleeve gravity finally caught up to the fact that the thing that was floating was not supposed to float. Landing on the deck of the Canopus with a heavy thud his servants eyes finally opened. &quot;When there is no more room in hell Graf shall roam... the other hell... what the hell?&quot; When she was mid sentence of her glorious introduction the memory and knowledge of the events of the world had hit her all at once like a fully loaded eighteen wheeler. Instinctively reaching for the sleeve that had the Nazi symbol on it she ripped the thing off unceremoniously and tossed it overboard. The last thing she wanted was somebody thinking she was a villain.</span>

Yet strangely he didn&#39;t feel any fear towards the being in front of him. In fact all he could think was a simple yet weird emotion for the situation. 

&quot;You look so cool!!!&quot; he said unable to contain himself as he looked at the robotic parts of his servant. The claws and the cannons was something he didn&#39;t expect but it was impossible for him to react in any other way. He was so focused on that he didn&#39;t notice her ripping the Nazi symbol from her sleeve.

She had a pair of large triple barrel turreted guns upon the sides of her ship part but there were several smaller guns too and each one on its own turret. As he moved on to her back he would come across the two torpedo launchers which held 4 rather explosive penguins each. Between them was the main superstructure and a radar tower that extended even a little bit above her own head. Down lower though there was a metallic looking tail with fins like those one would find on the great white sharks tail. 

Once he returned to her front the summoned individual spoke once more. &quot;Archer class servant, Deutschland armored cruiser Admiral Graf Spee reporting for duty.&quot; Her introduction included what type of servant she was since she had noticed that he was quite confused as to what in the hell she really was.</span>

Were Allen were a better magi, he would had began to theorize how he used this ship as a sort of catalyst to summon Graf or if his flames invoked a feeling of war which let her answer his call but those thoughs were the further away from his mind. 

&quot;Investigator Allen Ignis&quot; he said as he calmed down his enthusiasm and smiled at his servant. 

&quot;You seem quite capable I will be leaving my life in your hands.....&quot;

He suddenly stopped as he wonder how to call her. He remained silent as he looked down and though which option was the better. Would Archer be good?? Or maybe just graf??

&quot;How should i call ya?&quot; He finally give up and asked her directly</span>

While he spoke however she closed her eyes and visualized an empty black space and then listened to her own radar responses. Things that were behind walls she could not see but she got the general shape of the ship in her minds eye and several different dots that were moving about every time her radar swept over them.

Opening her eyes once more she looked to Allen and said. &quot;Either one works. My identity is easy to deduce and even if i am found out it wont give the enemy an edge over me.&quot; Graf raised her right hand and balled the claws into a fist. &quot;For with these hands i will grasp victory and fight until the end.&quot;</span>

&quot;Alright I will call ya Graf&quot; he said as he enjoyed how easy the name came out of his mouth. 

As she proclaimed that she would grasp victory Allen mind began to wonder about it. Victory wasnt his main goal but it wasn&#39;t against it either. Well they do needed to survive and prevail against everything that killed the first two expeditions. He was well aware than having servant only increased his chances a bit and by no way it was a reassurance. 

&quot;Like the attitude.&quot; He said as he places his black glove on Graff fisted claw and smiled. &quot;So I will promise ya this, as long as you dont betray nor lie to me I will fight with ya till the very end Graf&quot;</span>

She had deemed this man worthy of her and certainly he was making all the right noises. She was hoping he would also prove to be just as steadfast in actions too.

&quot;Please dont be alarmed.&quot; Graf then said and without as much as a moments hesitation she jumped overboard. Rather than sinking like one would expect with something as large as her ship half stuck to her waist and back she floated above the water. Like a true ship she remained upright and soon behan to skate alongside the Canopus while slowly making distance from the large ship. around 50 meters away from it she pulled out what looked like a small plane. Like a little toy its engine fired up and the propeller made a noise that akin to a drone. Then with a physical throw she gave the little thing enough starting velocity to maintain flight. Through the planes eyes she observed their immediate surroundings and from all the way up there she could see for dozens upon dozens of miles. At least it looked like graf was enjoying herself on the open seas once more and was already getting back into her routine of keeping an eye on the horizon for any enemies.</span>

Her movements were swift and precise, no one could say she was making any unnecesary movements.

&quot;Beautiful...&quot; it was all he managed to say as she moved away. 

It took him a few minutes to stop staring at the ocean. Finally he snapped out of it as he began to wonder how good was Graf ability. His decision of making his summoning now had been proven correct someone like her would be priceless when it came to the ship docking. After all dangers could come at any moments and at any time. The same applied for when they began to move inside the island.

&quot;Dont go to far!!&quot; Allen yelled at her as he realized he hadnt told her where they were going or what was their mission.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Some time had passed since Octavius&#39;s summoning and introduction with Dante. In that time he had been wandering around the ship looking around and seeing what the vessel had to offer. He had stumbled into a few of the crew who parted before him as if he were royalty, well he supposed he was. And well, he was still wearing his armor and his large frame and literal radiance did affect his appearance at least a little bit. His inner thoughts humored him, although it wasn&#39;t that he wasn&#39;t used to the red carpet treatment, this was a different feeling, this wasn&#39;t Roman reverence, this was simple respect for his status as a servant or perhaps mild tense fear from his imposing visage. Either way the Roman Emperor didn&#39;t like it, especially since it was reactions that he certainly didn&#39;t act on to create.

Soon enough, however, Octavius found himself back onto the deck of the Canopus after hearing that they were a day out from landing. He had a prickly feeling in the back of his neck. Excitement, anticipation, there was something there to it. Now that he was in his prime body when he conquered those extra lands for Rome all that time ago again, maybe his instincts as a Roman were making him feel the itch of combat again. Although he had more to concern himself with. His thoughts were interrupted as he noticed an individual standing next to the edge of the boat, he seemed different than some of the other crew members, something more interesting. Perhaps even simply something to satisfy Caesar&#39;s boredom. It mattered not as Octavius made his way over to Allen. Given Saber&#39;s thoughts, he wasn&#39;t being very subtle in his approach. To be honest, it could even be misunderstood as aggression.

&quot;Salve, you there, I require a moment of your time.&quot; He said sternly and authoritatively. He hadn&#39;t learned much from some of the rest of the crew so maybe he could glean something from this fellow.

A warning shot across his bow as one would call it. The noise was caused by a rather diminutive little girl skating on the waters surface and keeping up with the Canous with ease.

Despite mowing along and parallel to the much larger ship she was facing directly at Gaius with what looked like a determined anger filled face. &quot;One step closer to him and the next one will have your name on it.&quot; Even though she spoke with a normal voice her voice carried like it was amplified by a megaphone.</span>

Allen tensed at the man in front of him, the air around Saber was different that from Graf, then again it could simply be the mix of shock and surprise of seeing a servant that wasn&#39;t his.

The sudden meeting keep him from uttering a single word. Still he examine Saber with his eyes tryinf to make sure he remember him so this shock were not to happen again. 

&quot;Oh sorry I....&quot;

As his mind began to work again, so did his mouth and as he was about to answer the man he heard a loud sound from his left shortly followed by a shell. 

His eyes widen as his mind went into overdrive, his brain using every bit of energy to help him understand what was happening and how bad it was. 

&quot;Graf!!!&quot; He yelled at her as he began to wave his arms in the air. His aim was to tell her to not shoot. But it could easily be seen as him asking for help.</span>

Instinctively Saber summoned his sword into his hand and pointed it in the direction of Archer. A warning shot? While he was grateful that Archer simply didn&#39;t try to kill him outright, if this Archer was to be an enemy, then it was a tactical error. Octavius took a look at Allen who yelled out the servant&#39;s name, Graf. No secrecy in true names then it seemed. This was the servant&#39;s master and that meant that this Graf was assumed to be an ally. However, if they were going to bear arms against Caesar, then he shall respond in kind. 

&quot;Archer, if I may assume your class, I do not mean your master harm, now back down. You don&#39;t want this to become a battle.&quot; He called out sternly as his fiery aura slightly began to pour from his body. As well he shifted positions around and behind Allen, trying to at least block the other servant&#39;s aim, even if it meant technically using Allen&#39;s body as a deterrent.

Dante gave a small sigh, maybe this mission was going to be more of a hassle than he expected. . . Could there have been a way to even end his duties there? He racked his brain for possible cowardly solutions, trying to find what could be the best way to approach it. However, that in itself wouldn&#39;t be long before a loud shot made itself known, forcing Dante to nearly buckle over. <strong>WAS THIS THE WAR?*</strong>

*Dante did not know what it could have been, be it the uncomfortable feeling that the room had provided or the fear of that a battle could have already ensued, but his body forced him forward, slamming the door open as he raced outside. He had a servant, and instinctually, he knew he&#39;d have to fight, even if he truly didn&#39;t want to. It took a moment with his scrawny body and weak lungs to finally run towards the deck of the ship, each of the passengers he ran into staring at him with confusion as much as he had looked at them before he went out to see what the noise could have come from, and once he saw the first familiar face of his saber he tried running near beside him, only to slow when the cook he had spoken to -- or well, tried to avoid now -- had also been seen as well. Saber&#39;s sword drawn made the doctor nearly panic, was he already engaging in battle when they had not even gotten off the boat!? The declaration was unsettling too, this cook was a master? What had the  canon been about? Had that been what caused it? Dante inched towards the saber, trying to stand his position nearby. If he could at least understand what was happening then he could help diffuse it. However, as for now, the doctor rose his hand towards the cook, trying to at least symbolize a pause in what ever had happened before. A slight brave move he could barely find the strength to do. . .</em></span>

Pointing at her he had warned her to not be his enemy? As a saber he stood no chance against her... not when she had the advantage of being on top of the waters surface while he would sink like a lead brick.

This time her second triple barreled turret bore down upon the man. Rotating a bit up while the three barrels drew level with him on a vertical axis. Each step the man took towards Allen grated on the girls nerves. Even though they had met only a few moments ago, Allen had displayed at least the desire to do what her captain had failed to. As saber passed behind her master partially she took the shot. With one of her numerous smaller guns she fired at his sword in an attempt to knock it out of his hand. She wasn&#39;t worried about hitting Allen as at this short range she knew that her accuracy was immaculate and she would not miss the intended spot.

All the way from here she saw him as the enemy attempting to assault her master and she would protect him. Every action that Allen had made looked to her as a plea for help and every action that the roman emperor of old had done appeared hostile. &quot;I wont tell you twice. Back away from my master.&quot; she said with clear anger in her amplified voice.</span>

A moment of silence had led Allen to basically become a human shield for this man who had just come to talk to him. As he felt the projectiles pass near him, more than fear he felt nothing but great admiration for Graf accuracy. Were the situation not slowly escalating into a bigger conflict he would be praising her. Well he would praise her later but at the current time there were bigger issues. 

&quot;You should probably listen to her.&quot; he said as he managed to compose himself. &quot;I think you are only getting her more mad.&quot; 

He was quite certain that telling Graf to stop was really pointless as Saber actions seemed bad no matter how one tried to justify them. So he tried to have Saber see reason, as just like Graf even when they had just met moments ago he had nothing but complete faith in her. His naivete was something that would normally get in his way, but in a case like this it let him trust something as inhumane as a servant with the most facility. 

&quot;It would be an issue if this goes and you ended hurt.&quot;</span>

Octavius watched the round soaring towards him, and when it got close enough, the Saber just had enough time to dematerialize his sword from his hand and simply let the round harmlessly soar past him. He didn&#39;t want to risk a potential injury by trying to contest whatever that Archer was shooting at him with, he didn&#39;t even know if he could deflect or have the reaction speed to accurately bat it away. It was true that he was at a disadvantage due to the water, but he was in front of his Dante now and she had challenged his patience, if she wouldn&#39;t listen to reason, then perhaps it was time to enact a show. Oh how Caesar wished Agrippa was there, now that was a man of incredible naval ability. Octavius went through his options, now while he couldn&#39;t specifically engage her on the water without drastic means that wouldn&#39;t be useful to anyone. Perhaps if he used his Noble Phantasm then that could send a message that wasn&#39;t one to be trifled with, however that would disrupt much more than this little pissing contest, it would cause issues for the entire ship and he was keen on not making a bad introduction to future allies. So he was going to be a bit less dramatic. Octavius lifted his hand and resummoned his sword to his hand, having it appear next to Allen&#39;s face before sauntering away from the Archer&#39;s Master and over to his own master&#39;s side, specifically in front of Dante, blocking him from the sight of Graf.

&quot;As much as I&#39;d like to see if you would keep your threat a baseless threat or turn it into a promise, I&#39;d rather not have to remove your master&#39;s head from his spine. As you can tell I have the explicit option of ending his life, but I will not, because I simply do not wish to kill an ally.&quot; He stated casually as if this situation was as tense a standoff as buying something from a shop.

He showed that he could kill Allen, he showed that he could at the very least react to her attacks and he stated that he could exploit the greatest weakness of a servant. Closing the distance to their master. Sure he couldn&#39;t reach her, but her master was right there, in range. And although he wouldn&#39;t think about killing any potential allies or other crew members, he could bluff well enough. The difference between the Saber and the Archer was that the Archer made threats, Octavius made promises.

&quot;So, Graf, friend, wouldn&#39;t it be easy to simply stand down and come back aboard so that we can have a civil conversation? Trust me.&quot; He said sincerely and dematerialized his sword once again.</span>

Who could have been giving out such lofty demands when they couldn’t even face them head on?! The second fire was effortless, a bullet whizzing past Octavius’ person before it disappeared from sight. Had Dante heard his saber correctly, this had to be the work of an archer. . . But they were miles from land, and from the deck, it was only those three, so that had to leave the sea as the only option. Dante tried to move back a bit, trying to catch a quick glimpse, only to see a small woman skating about the waves, an artillery at her disposal as they aimed towards Gaius. Ah, so that was who the assailant was, and she seemed to think her master was in peril?</em>

<em>The way Allen had seemed to ask for Gaius’ surrender could have easily been echoed by Dante. And it was, though it wasn’t for the Saber’s safety, but instead for the girl’s and Allen’s! The doctor had seen first hand the anger the Emperor held, and while the girl’s anger was visible, Dante felt a larger fear towards Gaius’ more than anything. This shouldn’t have escalated anymore than it had been given the chance to. But, nonetheless the way Saber had drawn his blade, it seemed it could have easily set everything off. From the way the girl protected her master, the cook, to how Saber casually goaded the human armada, Dante was forced to try to intervene how he best thought it could.</em>

“We are not here to cause any problems with your master! I happen to be his Saber’s master right here, and an ally towards this man you claim is your own Master! B-believe me when I say that we wish not to do anything ill towards him!”

<em>He couldn’t exactly stop his Saber from enacting on the supposed threat he gave, be it a bluff or not, but he could at least try to speak as carefully as he could, wary that any words could have made the girl see him as an enemy too.</em></span>

Glaring at the man she knew that her master was at a disadvantage here but he was right next to the edge. He could very easily just jump off if needed. She had been firing off warning shots mainly because her master was there and she couldnt afford the shrapnel of her shells possibly hitting Allen. Even the last one that was so close to the man had a dud fuse to make sure it didnt explode. Octavius Caesar though was a right piece of work as he still continued to threaten her master but before she could shoot him again he backed off.

All fourteen of her guns followed him towards his own master dante and shielded him from her. Now that Allen was not in immediate danger again she turned to face forwards again but kept one of the smaller guns facing in their rough direction, just in case. Once Dante had spoken and said that he was Octavius&#39;s master and wished to do no harm.

Giving it a bit of thought Graf slowly approached the ship and soon disappeared from sight. When one looked over board to see if she was down there still they would find naught but water and the ripple left behind by the ships wake. A short while later though the same girl could be seen emerging from one of the doors that lead up onto the deck. Now that she was up here she walked to stand by her masters side. &quot;Trust is gained through actions not words.&quot; She stated plainly towards Dante but snapped her crimson claws... Yes she pulled a thanos and snapped a metal claw. A mere moment later her entire main armament glowed bright red before exploding into a shower of motes of light that evaporated a second or two later.</span>

Being handle in such a manner was exoected although it still annoy Allen to a certain degree. He had believed that he could take it easy till nirvana but Octavius has proven that he had let his guard a bit too low. 

&quot;You have the worse way to start a conversation....&quot; he said as he moved closer to Graf and took another look at the servant and his master. Although he did let out a sigh of relief when saw Graf make her weapons vanish at least it wouldnt escalate any further. 

&quot;Oh the doctor&quot; Allen tension began to fall as he recognized the familiar face. &quot;Oh you are this guy master?&quot; He said curious about the whole situation before starinf back at Octavius. 

&quot;So.... what you guys want?&quot; He asked not really annoyed but with a bit of cautious so things wouldn&#39;t escalate once again.</span>

The resolution to his conflict was still ripe on his mind he almost forgot that we originally were going to meet with this chef to ask for details out of boredom. And while his boredom was mildly satisfied from that short scuffle, he now had to finish what he started so to speak. Perhaps it would be good to show a better side of himself to further ease tensions. Octavius then knocked his fist against his chest in a normal Roman greeting. Although introductions would as well be a strategic game.

&quot;Why simply after I was summoned by Dante I wanted to see more of the ship. When I saw you on the deck I wished to meet you as you seemed interesting, different than the rest of the crew, and low and behold, my intuition was correct.&quot; He stated in a sympathetic and almost joyful tone as he motioned to Graf in the last sentence. &quot;I must apologize for sending the wrong message moments ago, threatening his head was the only logical way I could be sure that you wouldn&#39;t simply gun me down.&quot; He said with a closed-eyed smile and a chuckle.

The last thing he said wasn&#39;t wholly the truth, he knew that he could have simply backed off from Allen. He simply wished to send a message. Now that he had, negotiations and diplomacy take precedent. He had a suitable way to try and build trust. 

&quot;I suppose I should introduce myself. I am Gaius Julius Caesar of Rome, Saber Class, and servant of Dante, a pleasure to meet you.&quot; He lied as naturally as he breathed. While he wasn&#39;t entirely wrong in his statement, he was Caesar and he had taken his father&#39;s name when he passed it down to Octavius as an inheritance. If this island is truly as dangerous as he could gather, who knows how much information and misdirection could be used effectively here. And to a servant, their true name was everyt</span>

She . . . she was quite the aggressor, or at least, to Dante she was, she could have easily shot towards them both, and had she, the battle could have been decided rather quickly. The nervous master shuddered at the thought. Were all servants so battle ready? What mission could have been going on that they had to summon such historical walking weapons?</em>

<em>With Octavius&#39; body blocking him from the woman&#39;s sight, he couldnt see that she had easily left her battlegrounds, moving herself to the deck to be with her master. Instead, Dante trained his eyes back on the cook, he didn&#39;t even try to stop her from what he could see. Even he had tried to stop his saber&#39;s rash attempt at a bluff, but this cook, to him, had done little to stop the onslaught that the woman could bring. Once the woman had rendezvoused with her master, he took in the image of the pair. . . They didn&#39;t seem to match each other at all, or well, they didn&#39;t look symmetrical, then again neither did the Doctor and Gaius. Nonetheless, he could still feel the fear he had when he heard the similar sound of cannon fire from the woman, even with her weaponry gone and beside the master she dearly protected, he could  only tell that they could have been formidable opponents if that were the case. Even the words she scolded him with were just as dangerous as her firepower. As the cook interrogated him, Dante couldn&#39;t help but feel grateful that Saber had spoken up first, giving him an excuse to try to explain why he had been absent from his servant. No one could have easily said they were being attacked by their servant right after summoning! He&#39;d have to think of what could be acceptable, a good lie being that he&#39;d had to help with a meeting, or discussed things with the other pack of doctors that boarded with him, anything.</em></span>

Dante could only think that was the logical reasoning. Once the roman had finished finished his introduction, Dante gave a small shuddered sigh of uncomforting distress. Saber was right, he had met the man, and so, with a side step behind the Caesar, he whispered his name and status.</em>

Still after hearing the other pair announce their names he could begin to put some thing together. At the very least it wasnt an enemy attack and just Dante&#39;s servant being... &#39;Playful&#39; for a lack of a better word. Still this situation had get him some interesting information. Graf loyalty wasn&#39;t something he held in doubt but seeing her defend him even though he really didn&#39;t need it was something that actually make him feel relieved and even a bit happy. 

&quot;Thank you&quot; he said to Graf with a smile.  Before his eyes looked at the other pair, just like Dante he observed both and he also came to the conclusion they really didn&#39;t fit each other. The Saber seem proud and confident while the doctor seemed quite scared and trying to hide behind him.  While it wasn&#39;t his issue Allen didn&#39;t feel that was the correct stance for a master as while a servant would protect them that didn&#39;t mean they could do it always. 

&quot;Well as you can see we are another pair in this Investigation team. This is my partner Graf&quot; he said as he pointed as the girl &quot;I also apologize for the misunderstanding.&quot;</span>

She did however suspect him still because that was in her nature as a raider. Suspect everything and everyone to be the enemy. The only ship and well in this case person she trusted was Allen.

Expected, although unnecessary. What happened, happened, no point in losing sleep over spilled milk. An Archer with a wide array of armaments and weaponry. The guarded look she gave Octavius made him think that this Graf wouldn&#39;t trust him so easily. He expected that, and he welcomed it to a certain extent. That meant that at the very least she was smarter than she looked, and he could trust that. He ran back the altercation in his head. The way she effortlessly soared along the water and fired with such accurate shots. Shooting ordinance free of human error. That as well as her strangely specific title brought him to the conclusion that she was a famous ship from somewhere in history and while he wasn&#39;t versed in naval combat to any extent, perhaps he could persuade her to be a sort of Agrippa substitute while he was summoned here. Masters of land and sea combat, like it always had been. 

&quot;Well it&#39;s good to meet you both, I hope that we remain stalwart allies on the battlefield. A battle is decided not by those with the most numbers, but those with the best tactics. So that brings me to a question. How do you both plan to deal with this investigation and what do you know so far?&quot; Octavius asked inquisitively, bringing everything back around to his original reason for seeking out Allen. He wanted to know all he could about everything, it was the only way to succeed.

Caesar then looked over to his master, Dante, and brought his hand back and lightly, yet forcefully pushed him beside the Emperor. This was a conversation between the four of them and he wanted Dante to be beside him rather than cowering behind him. He then spoke again, this time towards his master. &quot;Dante, do you have anything to ask them? Anything at all?&quot; Now while he didn&#39;t expect anything different than what he just asked, he wanted to know how Dante would react to being</span>

He couldn’t think what she could have been, but he knew Gaius could at least. Or so he thought he could. He’d have to ask later.</em>

<em>As Octavius explained himself, Dante couldn’t help but give a sigh of relief he didn’t bring up how abrupt and uncontrolled his summoning was. He couldn’t deal with being seen as a weak link, especially when the Archer and the cook seemed to be completely in semblance. To look as the lowest addition would eat at him, would clearly eat at what he could think would be Gaius’ thoughts of him as a master. No, he shook his head. It was just a strange situation. He agreed to be here. . . He thought. He did it for reasons. He just had to continue with it. His ears tuned back into the conversation, trying to pick up where he left off, where saber had asked them what they had known about the expedition. But with little to no effort, he found himself at the center of the attention, Gaius’ sly words forcing him to have to ask questions he hadn’t thought of. He froze. His brain short circuiting as he had lost his position from behind his human interaction shield. Did he have a question? Did he even want to ask one? He didn’t know! He found himself looking at his feet, his good arm going to comfort his lame one with instinctive patting and scratching, even when it would remain oblivious to it.</em>

“Something to a-ask? I guess if you know of the others have done the same thing. Summoning. . . Have you gotten word of it? And have you meet any of the others.”

<em>He said the last one with caution, as if speaking it would bring an ill omen against them. There had been others of course, the ship boarded with a good hundred or so. But, he knew they themselves would easily have to separate.</em></span>

Both fair although he hold himself back from showing how annoying Caesar attitude was. After all due him being taken by surprise it could easily be seen as just him being sore at that. 

&quot;I dont know much about the island. All i know is that this is basically a suicide mission so my main goal is to survive whatever we may encounter in that place. Besides that nothing much but explore I have a couple of assigments I need to fulfill but it would depend on how the situation goes.&quot;

He was being vage on purpose as he lacked any actual plan but didnt feel like sharing that outright. Besides that was the conditons those who hired him had put him. While he didnt really care that much for the secrecy that family wanted to keep, unless he suceed that is, an agreement was an agreement so he would respect it. 

&quot;I havent meet any other masters I just summoned her quite recently you see. But on that note, are you alright Dante?? You seem nervous&quot;

While Allen words came just a normal concern it could easily be seen as he ha ing picking up at the young man internal struggle and mental stress.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For the faintest moment, there would seem to be a smile creeping from the side of Octavius&#39;s face after Dante finished speaking. He was filled with a bit of optimism from the fact that his light push made Dante speak a bit, and asked relevant information no less. His mood wained slightly when he realized that Archer and himself might be the only servants summoned so far, as they grew nearer to the island, he would have wished to introduce himself to them as soon as possible. No matter, at least he now knew that there was potential at least for other servants to be brought forth into this time. He relished the idea of meeting other historical figures, touching base with the minds of countless eras. Although one thing stuck out to him. Allen mentioned that this was a &#39;suicide mission&#39;. Did that mean that the investigation was doomed to fail? Surely not, at least, not while he had any say about it. He had things to do, Dantes to turn into Caesars, he couldn&#39;t accept the prospect of death. As well he could feel the same sense of informality when it came to a plan from Allen. To simply explore and do your best wasn&#39;t a worthy tactic for a Roman such as he. Caesar now had a new idea. With the land growing ever closer, Octavius wanted to test Dante on his skill of the mind. Until landfall, he wanted to come up with an actual plan, most likely temporary until more information was gained, but a plan nonetheless.

He refocused back into the conversation at hand as for the few moments that he&#39;d been in thought he had been looking to the horizon towards the island. When he came to he looked back to the ally master-servant pair and gave a light bow and a small smile before exchanging a goodbye. &quot;Well then, I suppose that&#39;s all I wished to know. Thank you both for entertaining my words for a while. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I wish to have some time to speak to Dante back in his quarters. War plans don&#39;t make themselves.&quot;</span>
