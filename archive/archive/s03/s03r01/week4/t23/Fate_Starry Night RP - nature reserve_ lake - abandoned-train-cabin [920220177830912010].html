            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">Located near the dock inside a train station there is an abandoned train cabin, is unknown how long has it been since anyone ever enter in it. A thick layer of dust covers the interior, the cabin is connected to a single car. While the controllers look old they appear to still be functional. The cabin contains a map of said stations but dirt and time had made any details hard to see, only a rough layout of the nomad city can be seen alongside some of the routes this old train used to went by. It appears that the previous drivers used to spend a long time in this cabin as there is a small fridge near the controllers and a closet all the way to the back of the car.</div>

This rusty, worn-down, ancient train-cabin that smelled slightly bitter-- it was an astonishing relic if the lad had ever seen one. Seemingly in good enough order too, he thought he&#39;d seen a fridge earlier. On a better day, he might&#39;ve tried investigating it. Seeing how this ancient behemoth worked before it was left to rust, maybe giving a shot at thumbing some dust off the shoddy controls... fantasies all put to rest as the most miraculous feature of this train showed itself: the incredible ability to dispense human beings from the ceiling.</em>

<strong>&quot;AH!&quot;</strong> <em>The lad yelped to the ceiling and jerked his body around, given a fright from a sudden &#39;thud&#39; behind him. A body greeted him limply on the floor, unmoving, dark-haired, and bruised to the bone. Upon further processing and a squint, Ryn realized who it was.</em>
<strong>&quot;Al&#39;? Allen--!&quot;</strong>

<em>The lad gasped. After kneeling and turning Allen onto his back, Ryn could see the chef was wounded. Quite badly too-- nothing fatal it seemed, but the man looked beaten to the bone. Might&#39;ve even had a few broken bones too. He&#39;d no idea Allen had been so beaten up during the scuffle on the ship... was everyone else like this too? Worse? Pursing his lips in concern, Ryn decided to focus on his friend here first, laying him on the least dirty side of the cabin gently. Then, after feeling lightly for the wounds littered about the man, he let his hands hover over the worst of them, a soft green glow bringing eerie light to the cabin.</em></span>

<em>The sound of fractured bones cracking back in order, and flesh weaving tendon and sinew whole filled the room. Ryn never got too used to how grotesque the noises were, so he winced, and feinted to look the other way whilst Allen&#39;s body slowly bent and crooked back in its proper place. In the meanwhile, only about a minute after Allen had dropped in, Ryn heard someone else land in the cabin with them. He didn&#39;t really look up, busied with tending to Allen, but it could only be one person... at least thats what he thought. In any case, he blew out a relieved sigh, and spoke over his shoulder.</em>
<strong>&quot;Thank you for takin&#39; him here, it looks like he&#39;ll be alright... just let me fix him up a bit and we can leave.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The last few moments of that fight was a total mess for Graf. one moment she was winning and allen was dealing with ruth quite well and then Ruth regained control and Graf herself ended up on the back foot. Even after blowing apart the sandstone hands trying to drag her 6 feet under she couldnt get anywhere as the spear still wedged in her superstructure was being held. Her radar was showing a total mess too. at some point he even picked up something as big as the yamato right behind her and then on the next sweep it was gone again... Man what she wouldnt give for a sonar right now.

With one more explosion of an unknown origin she found herself freed, only to get dragged down into an inky pit by some tentacles. A few shells were fired off into the sky to land god only knows where as she tried to resist. Inside the blackness she couldnt see or hear a thing but felt like she was being watched, yet the radar once again had whole load of nothing.

This is when she saw a light at the end of the tunnel jus before being spat out inside a run down train. Falling out of the ceiling with a heavy crash she quickly got back up again and took a note of her surroundings. a quick sweep showed nobody ut her and two other people, one of which was allen... the other guy... he was an unknown factor. Aiming one of the guns at him she was about to fire, when he said to just give her a moment while he treats allen before they could leave? &quot;Huh? I didnt bring him here.&quot; She responded and her voice quite likely was one that he did not expect hearing. &quot;I have no clue how we got here in the first place. One moment were at the beach... the next im here.&quot;</span>

It was somewhat difficult to discern Assassin&#39;s visage due to the darkness as well as her back was to the entire group. Her tone was even unmoved by the immediate reaction of violence brought on by the other servant. Nothing about her stance or her action shown indication of hostility, in fact her demeanor seemed somewhat Laissez-faire. Even still, she was present enough to be aware of the conversation. Though one factor that Graf would likely take note of was that although he could see the figure in front of them, they had no mana signature whatsoever or at least one so low that it could not be detected.

Assassin&#39;s arm moved back crossing with the other across her chest. Her voice then filled the room once more as she continued to speak in a calm and almost haunting timber. &quot;I found your master plummeting to the watery depths, If I did not intercede he likely would have drowned and thusly your supply of mana instantly cut off. Though I admittedly I did not due this of my own laurels, my master is the one who spoke in favor of your own. Therefore, I brought you here away from the prying eyes of your enemy. Perhaps in exchange you can enlighten me on what has occurred so far since your arrival to this island. Who is it that attacked you, why was the attack had in the first place, and most importantly what abilities did you witness while in combat.&quot; The looming figure glanced out at Ryn who was hanging over Allen, healing his wound. &quot;I do not believe we shall be staying for long so it might be best for us to not mince words and speak as openly as we can. I shall start and you can follow. I am Assassin. Once you’ve answered my questions, you may ask your own.”</span>

He looked obviously in pain as he breathing slowly began ragged as he just lay there leaning over the wall. Ryn  diagnostic was quite accurate, he had pushed his body beyond his limits leaving himself with sore muscles and some cracks on his bones. 

The blood he had cough and had previously been around his face after the two thunder strikes he had suffered had been mostly cleaned by the water but some remained on his shirt and  at the edge of his head. Most of the damage he had suffered was internal, as drops of water continue to fell from the edges of his coat he began to cough hardly as he cough some water he had inhaled while he had began to drown. 

But that was all, Allen remained unconscious and it appears he would be for the time being or maybe even worse if Ryn weren&#39;t around to patch him up.</span>

Neck straining back, the lad was almost instantly met with the steely gaze of a metal pole pointing straight inbetween his eyes, dark and hollow down the middle. His first instinct was to gawk, and cock his head. After all, he&#39;d seen nothing like what was trained at him now in person-- just what was it...? His eyes trailed further up until they reached the bearer of the metal pole, and upon seeing the pale-haired girl, adorned with claws and a scary outfit, the slightest twitch came to his face. Was it a weapon?

He was just about to say something, at least, until the voice of the person he&#39;d been expecting to hear arrived. Like relief from anxiety he&#39;d not even really registered had just washed over him, Ryn&#39;s shoulders shuddered, and he scooted back from the pole the girl held, closer to where Assassin stood. Allen dragged along slightly too, and once near his servant, Ryn pinched his lips shut and let her do the talking. By the time she was done, the lad was nodding. A hint of hesitation held him back a moment, but Ryn decided he had to say something, as a &quot;master&quot; now of course.</em>
<strong>&quot;You dun&#39; have to tell us more than what you wanna-- but yes. I&#39;d like to hear about what happened to the ship if you can recall it. We got into a bit of scuffle ourselves see, so there wasn&#39;t much chance to worry about anyone but Allen here...&quot;</strong></span>

<em>It was beginning to set on him that the girl that&#39;d appeared here was probably Allen&#39;s servant. It was a little odd really, Assassin and her seemed quite different from one another; yet, they were undoubtedly made of the same &quot;stuff&quot; of legends. He didn&#39;t know whether to be awed or relieved at the presence of two in the same room...

Allen suddenly coughed, and the lad immediately jolted back from the chef, afraid he&#39;d stirred from his unconsciousness. Though, sure enough, Allen was still asleep. Ryn saw water had only sputtered out of the man, and he pulled his bloody sleeve up to wipe it off Allen&#39;s face, before slowly hanging back over his body. The shock had left a bit of a morose expression on the lad, and he added to his last words quietly.</em>
<strong>&quot;Oh, and if you&#39;re wondering who we are... we&#39;re acquaintances with Allen.&quot;</strong>

She had nothing but eyesight to go on if she ever had to fight her. Her instrumentation was completely useless here. Fortunately she was an ally for now so she stood up fully and let Ryn handle her masters recovery. She herself was bleeding and the spear in her superstructure was still wedge in deep... thats gonna take a while at the &#39;docks&#39; to fix.

Once asked about the enemies they encountered she recounted the entire thing like a battle report. Times when first contact was made. Time of first attack and even every times for every salvo she had sent at the enemies. She had kept track of all of that info and memorized it. she also made a mention of another pair that blew right through their battle on the beach and dove under the water, which made it damn near impossible to do anything about them. &quot;And well Then you showed up Assassin and dragged us out of there.&quot; She then remembered that she hadnt introduced herself yet so she did that too. &quot;My designation is Deutschland class armored cruiser Admiral Graf Spee. I am also known as the pocket battleship and my class designation is archer.&quot; She wasnt really worried about others finding out what she was at all as them knowing what she is and doing anything about it were two very different things.</span>

I’m curious if paths shall ever cross, and if so what sort of soul do they have buried under that rough and destructive exterior.” For a brief moment Assassin turned to the look at the group as a whole, most specifically Archer, her golden yellow irises both soft yet piercing at the same time. There was no hatred, anger, joy, sadness, just a blank emotionless glare that almost gave the impression she wasn’t looking at her at all, but more so through her. 

It was only a moment or so of silence but it carried the sensation of almost lasting forever. Yet the moment did in fact end with a gentle nod and tipping of the brim of her hat. “I appreciate your patronage of being so upfront, you have every reason to be cautious, so your faith in our well meaning nature is appreciated. I’m equal exchange I shall impart my own identity, though I apologize for the fact that it is rather complex in its disposition. You see I carry many names from many different lands and different cultures. I am a being often feared, but so readily utilized for the welfare of others. I’ve been referred to as La Llorona, Babba Yaga, El Cuco, but among all of there was one universal term that had carried on for so many generations. Asimple moniker that chilled many a heart. For the perhaps of further interaction you may refer to me as such, for I am <em><strong>The Boogeyman.</strong></em>

Almost on cue the air became cool and the silence around them became deafening as the revelation had just implanted on what sort of beings they were truly dealing with in this endeavor of theirs. Though almost to cut through the tension itself Boogie spoke out still as if nothing had occurred. “Moving forward it would be wise to develop a plan of action. What is our goals on this island?”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Graf Spee... it sounded kind of like Giraffe. And when he ran it all through his head: Admiral Giraffe Spee, he&#39;d be a liar if he said he hadn&#39;t cracked a little bit of a smirk. He really shouldn&#39;t have found it amusing after the day that they&#39;d all had, but, he did. It took him out of his daze, that was for sure.

Unfortunately, that amusement died down as soon as Assassin continued with her own long introduction. Every word of hers dripped with almost suspenseful longevity, up until the reveal. The Boogeyman. Ryn reeled where he sat, and glanced at Assassin, dumbfounded. <em>That</em> was who he summoned? The Boogeyman?

But-- but she wasn&#39;t a man! Nor was she particularly Boogey, if not a little off-putting. Though, to think that was what surprised him most at first made him flush, and he turned away. The Boogeyman as his servant... that explained some things, didn&#39;t it. The lad scratched his cheek, letting his hands dissipate to their normal hue, and stood, avoiding Assassin&#39;s yellow gaze.

&quot;He&#39;ll be fine in about a day.&quot; he commented quietly. His feet shuffled to the side, and he was unsure of what else to do, before catching a crimson glimpse of the blood on Archer. He perked up, and pointed at her, letting the revelation of his servant simmer longer.

&quot;You alright there? I&#39;d be happy to fix you too. &#39;Least I can do while we talk important stuff!&quot;</span>

Why she could see her but the radar wasnt getting a damn thing, just a blob of possibilities like she was in some sort of a state of uncertainty. If she could tell where she is, she had no idea where she was going but if she knew where she was going there was no telling where exactly she was at. What a headache inducing problem to gave for sure but it was something she could deal with to some marginal extent.

&quot;I do not know what our goals really are. We were attacked shortly after i was summoned so we didn&#39;t have time to talk. I will have to get back to you on that one when captain wakes up again.&quot; she then looked down upon her bleeding leg and yq ked out the spear or rather what remained of it out of her leg.&quot; Id appreciate it if ypu could stop this oil leak.&quot; Graf stated as she dropped the bloodied spear chunk. It was quite surprising that she didnt even make a sound when she did that.</span>

We have much to do and little time to waste.&quot; Her head then turned once again back to Graff. &quot;It is pleasure to make your acquaintance, I do hope our paths cross again, perhaps in more ideal circumstances.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Graf may have made no noise whilst pulling the spear out... but her skin most certainly did. The squelching made Ryn&#39;s face sour a moment, before he nodded, and kneeled down  a bit to get a closer look. The greenish hue glowed back into existence in his palms, and he held them out towards Graf&#39;s bleeding wound. In the meanwhile, he waited for the two to finish talking.

<strong>&quot;Mm. Well, as I understand it, <em>all</em> us investigators came lookin&#39; for people that went missing &#39;ere a while ago.&quot;</strong> he added, knowing neither servant must&#39;ve known very much about the investigators&#39; mission. The lad&#39;s eyes leapt to the side when he continued.
<strong>&quot;I&#39;m no different, duh. So, you both may consider our goals pretty similar. Could prolly&#39; help each other some while... hm... there! All better! Oil leak... patched?&quot;</strong>

Was that the offical term the servant would use? He certainly didn&#39;t know, and it did amuse him a little to say, but Ryn merely shrugged it off. With Graf&#39;s wound healed, he&#39;d lumber up to his feet, and back away, stepping closer towards the Boogeyman.
<strong>&quot;In anycase. Yes, I also bet we&#39;ll all see eachother again soon. This isn&#39;t a big island, so it&#39;s prolly&#39; only a matter of time.&quot;</strong>

Ryn gave a quick once-over towards Allen, then Graf, before turning completely away. Yes, it&#39;d only be a matter of time, he was sure. Though if not... well, a part of him would be content enough without the chef knowing he&#39;d summoned a servant. His outline got vaguer the closer he walked towards the Boogeyman, and his voice farther, the dark slowly engulfing them.
<strong>&quot;Best get going now though-- you read my mind... uhm, Boogeyman. Let&#39;s &#39;spirit&#39; away then, haha! Take care of Allen! Oh, and tell &#39;em we&#39;re even now.&quot;</strong>

Suppose he couldn&#39;t help himself but say it aloud. They were even. 
And so too were they gone, the Boogeyman and Ryn disappearing from the premises in a zip, leaving Graf and her master alone.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the conversation went on Allen had no idea of what was happening, the inside of his mind was still focusing in his latest fight with that woman who had began to attack both him and the ship without a single warning but there was more an issue that he had just notice in the final moments of his fight with Ruth. There were more enemies,  he and Graf had kept the woman and her servant busy so someone else had to be the one who had broke the ship in half. Well at least one more person had to be responsible, that was something he would need to look after he woke up. 

He slowly open his eyes, the scene in front of him make little sense as the last thing he remembered was sinking into the ocean. Certanly an experience he rather never experience again, almost as much being hit by a thunder a third time but knowing his luck the former was more easy to avoid. His body hurt, but weirdly enough it didn&#39;t hurt as much as it should, he had been thrown around like a bag of potatoes and basically electrocuted twice and blasted. But right now he was mostly tired and just with sore muscles.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; he said aloud as he began to look around, trying to make any sense of the situation. 

Eventually his eyes found Graf she looked a bit bruised but nothing serious. Then again that only increased the amount of questions he had and seeing that neither of them were in the mood to move a long conversation was about to take place.

&quot;Alright I give up what happened??&quot;</span>
