                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Heavy steps echoed endlessly through the empty hall. Hurried steps. An impatient run through the darkness, his path and surroundings lit only by the red alarms of the Canopus. Blood and organs decorated the ground, the walls and pretty much everything else. The air was stagnant, putrid, incredibly foul. That smell which Ace knew all too well—<em>the smell of death,</em> stuck to his nose, aggressively reminding him of his own incompetence at every ragged breath he took. 

<em>Granel was right.</em> 

On Ace&#39;s back rested a fine piece of machinery, big enough that you would second-guess lifting it up yourself—a S.E.R.V..A.N.T frame. While you&#39;d normally use a hand truck to move such a massive thing around, he just grabbed it by the handles and ran off. Not because he could, mind you, but because he <em>needed</em> to.

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

The ship rocked again, threatening to knock the veteran off his socks and into an early death squashed by the frame he carried. He muscled his way into regaining his balance, kicking the ground harder as he reached the end of a hallway and into another. He had been running for a full minute now, how did he not bump into anyone yet, <em>not even corpses?</em>

&quot;Rookie!&quot; He screamed, hoping to carry his voice through the talkie-walkie on his belt. &quot;One minute until I reach the deck, hurry with the preparations!&quot;</span>

A recent explosion knocked her off her feet then onto her side. Her suitcase was flung to the side with the contents, being components needed for the creation of a ritual circle, spilling over the deck. There she remained huddled up out of self-preservation. Her more primal instincts kicked in during this intense situation. An incomplete summoning circle stood in the centre of the deck. 

Explosions, shells being fired, alarms being rung, metal twisting and bending against its will, and screams polluted the air. This horrid cacophony shook Emeilia&#39;s resolve to its core. The thought of death plagued her mind. She was a part of the Scholar Company. She wasn&#39;t meant to see combat. She wasn&#39;t <em>trained</em> to be in combat. This was the hand she was dealt though. The test she was meant to pass. One she promised her superiors that she could do. How foolish she was..

<em>&quot;Rookie!&quot;</em>

Her eyes shot open. That voice was Ace&#39;s. That&#39;s right. She was on the Canopus. They&#39;re being attacked. She needed to focus!

The clouds over her head remained but were slowly broken through. She had a mission to do. Ace entrusted her with the preparation of the summoning circle for their Servant. If they don&#39;t manage to summon one now, they may not get a second chance to do so.

A deep breath was taken to steady herself while she got up on her knees. It was shaky and a terrible attempt at regaining her composure but she had to make do with it.

<em>&quot;Remember, Emeilia. Page 19 of The Art of Summoning; subsection 3: A key component in any summoning ritual is the creation of the all important summoning circle. It is the foundation of the ritual spell and failure will befall any magus who’s circle ends up being subpar..&quot;</em> Emeilia recited the lines to herself quietly. She did this in hopes it would steady her shaking hand. Reading calmed her nerves. She doesn&#39;t have the book with her, but she remembered the lines. It was the next best thing for her. 

The summoning circle slowly began to take form once more. She had a minute to finish it and get it ready for Ace. His voice was all the confirmation she needed to know that he was alright. If he was alright then she can do this!</span>

<em>Mayhem.</em>

Huge appendages made of green stood at every side of the ship, menacingly wobbling about, eerily <em>unpredictable</em>. Fleshy strings pierced the deck, the walls, plunged deep into every nook and cranny of the ship, moving at seemingly random, <em>destroying anything that stood in their path</em>. Crewmates and investigators alike ran in every direction, panicked. The ones that didn&#39;t run attacked their comrades, a kind of madness overtaking their actions.

He didn&#39;t have the luxury to pay them any mind, though. On the edge of the deck, miraculously undisturbed by what was happening around, stood Emeilia Lewis. Ace ran off as he spotted her, swiftly dodging tendrils, crewmates and mad crewmates along his way. Those that he couldn&#39;t dodge, he simply rammed into, taking advantage of his size and his momentum to propel them aside. There was no time for sophistication, he had to get to her <em>fast</em>.

&quot;Rookie!&quot; His voice pierced through the madness as he approached her, still in the middle of his run. &quot;If you&#39;re not done, I swear to god, I will kill you first then kill everyone on this fucking boat, and finally kill everyone else on this <em>fucking island!</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;It isn&#39;t perfect, but it is the best that I can do under these conditions, sir!&quot; Emeilia yelled back once Ace made his appearance known through his voice. She was visibly shaken. Her hands could not stay still. It was a wonder that she could even manage to complete the circle in time. Perhaps HQ knew of this potential within her, even if she didn&#39;t fully grasp it herself.

She couldn&#39;t even stand without her legs giving out on her. As expected from a rookie like herself. Of course, given her background and placement as a brainiac, she did perform better than expected, even if the bar was placed low already for her.</span>

&quot;Good job, rookie,&quot; He said, panting. &quot;You just helped prevent a fucking massacre.&quot;

Abruptly, he deposited the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame at the middle of the circle with a heavy <em>thunk</em>. Catching his breath for a second, he took a moment to observe his surroundings. None of the mad crewmates were in their vicinity. Good. He couldn&#39;t allow himself to be distracted while in the middle of the summoning. If he or the rookie were to be attacked, his trance-like state wouldn&#39;t allow him to retaliate.

He turned his focus back to the summoning. More than the circle, another detail caught his eye. The rookie&#39;s shakiness didn&#39;t go unnoticed, and quite frankly, she had every right to be in that state. A rookie fresh out of the academy, that had had her first taste of the outside world but a few days ago, from a company that had nothing to do with combat, had just been thrown in one of the most chaotic situation he had ever experienced. If he was fifteen... no, ten years younger, he too would be shaking in his boots.

&quot;You call that unperfect?&quot; He calmly spoke as he knelt, touching the summoning circle with the tip of his fingers. &quot;That&#39;s the best fucking circle I&#39;ve seen in my life.&quot;

He may have slightly embellished his thoughts, but what he had said was mostly true. From the circle drawn with impeccable precision to the arrangement of items, everything was laid with a tidiness that you could only find amongst the scholar corps. To be able to pull off such a thing in this high-stress situation with no prior experience, Emeilia Lewis wasn&#39;t all talk after all.

&quot;...I wasn&#39;t talking about me back then,&quot; He went on, reaching for the inner-pocket of his vest. &quot;I mean it, you really did help prevent a massacre from happening. <em>Good job, rookie.</em>&quot;</span>

Those words instilled a sense of pride inside of her. Emeilia was nowhere near Ace&#39;s level, nor will she unless she herself dedicated years to get the experience needed to measure up to him like he did. But, those words made it feel like she had a chance at something so insurmountable in her eyes. 

Slowly but surely she got back up onto her legs again. She was a Genevi. She needed to stand strong; not only for Ace but for Geneva itself. Once she was up, there was a fire within her eyes thanks to him. It looked like Ace knew a bit more rather than how to throw a good punch! Those Brainiacs at HQ sure knew their stuff.

Emeilia pushed up her glasses before using a nearby wall to help keep herself standing by leaning against it. She did her job. Now it was up to Ace to carry the torch to the end.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Out of his pocket came a muddied charm pack with unintelligible words written all over it, what he guessed to be prayers. The outer layer of cloth had severely yellowed for who knew how many centuries. Small patches of black and crimson decorated the charm, brittle and heterogene. He pulled it close to his face, holding it over his nose… no smell. When he gently pressed it between his fingers, he felt a resistance, like there was something inside. The texture of fur… animal fur? Hair? Human hair? Something else entirely?

No matter. Ace placed the charm on the circle, valiantly facing the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame. Right as the charm left his fingers, he could feel an energy building up in the atmosphere. Deep breaths. He could feel his stomach turning, the artificial magical circuits responding to the shift of energy.

Ace rolled his shoulders, then grazed the immaculate summoning circle with his fingertips again. The Spirit Core flashed bright red for a split second before going back to normal. A faint smoke emanated from his fingertips, almost unnoticeable to the naked eye. His senses heightened, the screams and the cacophony of battle growing more and more distant as his focus deepened. They were little more than hums to his ears, almost unnoticeable.

This was it. He silently prayed not to be torn apart by a fleshy tendril or pulled away by a tentacle, then begun.

“In the name of our Lord, I spill Od, blood and gore,” He murmured with conviction, his voice unnaturally deep.

The Spirit Core flickered intensely in response to his words.

“In your name, I plunge into the realm, ask then beg…” He went on louder, more passionate.

The ground shook, a thin pillar of light shooting out of the frame and into the sky.

“I sense, I acknowledge, I reach…!” He almost screamed, no longer himself.

The light intensified, almost burning his eyes.

“Until finally, I demand, I obtain… <strong>and I command!</strong>”

Time froze.

Then resumed, booming.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A call was made. 

A request for the Throne of Heroes to send one of their Mighty into action once more.

To serve the summoner, their Master, until they are no longer needed.

Many heard the call, but only one could answer. Only one who’s desire was stronger than the rest; and this one’s desire outmatched all the others by leagues.. 

A rumble went throughout the Canopus. A deafening pulse was felt. The mana in the air pooled together and was fixed upon one singular point, the rest was paid for by Ace&#39;s own reserves. This singular point was the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame. This empty husk of metal and magic was where it all was focused to. A brilliant light came from deep within the frame itself. The spirit core was claimed by a Servant. The anchor was formed.

Harsh winds erupted from the summoning circle, blowing away anything that wasn&#39;t anchored down already. They were strong enough to blow away anyone unprepared to endure them. Although, the strength was not the only thing to fear about the whirlwind. The temperature dropped as the winds turned to freezing. Ice formed in the air which flew around within the vortex that encompassed the summoning circle. It completely covered the frame from sight.

The only thing visible was the glow of the frame itself. The outline grew in size as it took the twisted form of the Servant that answered Ace’s call. Two azure flashes of light seared through the whirlwind. The eyes met Ace’s through the frigid winds. Whoever was in there almost had about two feet of height on Ace’s already tall figure.

The skin was sickly, malnourished, and pale. The rancid odor of dead flesh was carried by the cold air surrounding them. An elk skull sat upon their head, hiding their face underneath. A mixture of ancient clothes, charms, and furs adorned their body from a time long since forgotten. They bore resemblance to the catalyst used though. Was this really the Servant they were meant to summon?

The pungent odor of death served only to attract a certain someone from their deep slumber. This atmosphere of decay unknowingly corrupted the catalyst used for the summoning. Instead of ▅▅▅▅ answering the call, the <em>monster</em> they hunted so many times did.

The cold air was inhaled by the creature before them. It filled their lungs. They hunched over slightly before reeling back to let loose a deafening howl that echoed throughout the ship, coast, and beyond. 

<strong>“▅▃▃▃▬▬▬▅▃▃▃———!”</strong>

A bestial howl was made. What started out as an animal call, reminiscent of the animal whose skull decorated their head, swiftly turned into a deep roar midway through that rumbled within the back of their throat. A horrid mixture of both beast and man. An unnatural force of nature stood in front of the two.

What <em>hero</em> did they just summon from the Throne?

Luckily, there was no need to guess what the class container was for the Servant they just summoned. Only one class was capable of such maddening screams.

<strong>Berserker.</strong></span>

Everything was <em>perfect</em>... as perfect as things could be in their current situation. The circle, the frame, the chant, the concentration of magical energy in their surroundings. The use of a catalyst was the cherry on top. The conditions were as good as they could&#39;ve possibly been, there was nothing more they could&#39;ve done to make it better. He did not show nor did he speak it, but Ace&#39;s excitement rose in anticipation of the Servant he was about to summon. A knight class, no doubt. Perhaps even a trusty companion that would shoulder part of his burden, hopefully one that would help calm things down at the Canopus.

As the ritual unfurled, the excitement slowly turned into confusion. Ace&#39;s whole body went cold, the violent whirlwinds almost tearing the sunglasses off his face. Keeping calm, he took a deep breath and exhaled. White fog came out of his mouth as he did so, and suddenly, he was made painfully aware of his surroundings. The temperature had furiously dropped. Confusion turned into concern.

Then the figure of a tall figure came into view, almost blending in with the surrounding trees. For the second time since the beginning of this week, he had to raise his head to meet that of the starving beast. 

Concern turned into dread.

He reflexively stepped in front of Emeilia, an outstretched arm serving as the sole layer of protection between her and the thing he had summoned. His other hand trailed on the handle of his magnum, waiting in anticipation... no, in <em>apprehension</em>. He had to worry about his crazed colleagues wanting to harm him, and now he had to worry about his own Servant too.

Then came the howl, and everything stopped. His ears ringed, his eyesight became cloudy. His instincts kicked in, gripping him from the shoulders, screaming at him not to take his eyes off the creature. If he did not pay a hundred percent of his attention to it, he was certain that something disastrous would happen. Alarm, anguish, excitement, terror—a cocktail of emotions brew inside Ace. 

<em>This wasn&#39;t what he had hoped for. At all.</em>

The veteran’s suit briefly glowed cyan, then turned back to normal. His shoulders dropped immediately after, relaxing ever so slightly. A deep breath, then a second breath. He was now calm.

&quot;Stay behind me, don&#39;t make any sudden movements,&quot; The veteran&#39;s words echoed in the deafening silence following the scream, composed. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got a good chunk of the ServantPedia™️ entries memorized. Tell me, who... <em>what</em> did I summon? Talk slowly, don&#39;t raise your voice more than you need to.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The intense burst of winds knocked Emeilia against the wall she chose to lean against for support. Oh how she longed to witness a Servant summoning in person. To lay her eyes upon a hero of old besides from the videos she had seen previously before. This wasn&#39;t what she expected to see though. 

This feeling of dread was so much worse than what she was feeling earlier. She wasn&#39;t safe now that they summoned their own Servant. If anything, death was much closer with that <em>thing</em> here.

Emeilia was frozen in place, not because of the freezing winds but, out of fear. Everything in her body was telling her to run away and hide. Her legs trembled and refused to take a single step. It was as if her body knew that running would useless against it. 

However, she wasn&#39;t alone. 

An arm was placed in between her and the Servant before them. The sight of it broke her focus on the thing and onto Ace. That’s right. She wasn’t alone. He’ll protect her. 

She stood a step to the side to better place him in front of her. Each step felt like she would tumble and fall at the slightest misstep. 

“How would I know? There’s thousands of entries! Give me something to work off of!” Emeilia spoke in a hushed tone. Her voice was shaky as she attempted to stay calm. The unsteady breathing and true dread in her eyes were clear signs of how that was going though.</span>

After that, they stared at the pair that were in front of them. Berserker had a statue-like stillness to them. Like a predator ready to pounce at the drop of the lightest feather. The tension in the air alone could crumble a lesser person.

The azure flame-like energy that radiated from their eyes died out until only a small dot remained. These beady, unblinking, ‘eyes’ stared into Ace then further beyond, as if trying to gauge who they were as a person. The temperatures slowly warmed back up once the eyes resided. Though, the chilling aura around them remained. Frost formed where they stood.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Complete and utter stillness. His skillset worked wonders in tight, nerve-wracking situations such as this one. The ability to relax and to take cool-headed decisions, this was one of veteran Ace Colin&#39;s biggest strengths on the battlefield. Much like the thing he had summoned, his stare was hard, abnormally calm, <em>unphased</em> even. And yet, even in his sudden apathy, he could still feel a hint of discomfort deep in his guts. If <em>he</em> felt discomfort in that situation, then how did Emeilia Lewis feel? 

&quot;Listen to me,&quot; The veteran spoke, relaxed. &quot;He&#39;s not gonna bite you. Even if he wanted to, he would need to get through me first. Worst case scenario, he bites <em>me</em> and I get one more scar to show off.&quot;

He punctuated his crude, not-so-reassuring speech with a ha-ha. Of course, he understood Emeilia&#39;s dismay completely. You&#39;d have to be a psychopath not to panic in front of... <em>this</em>, whatever this was. If he hadn&#39;t had access to a cheat such as <em>Adfectus Missus</em>, he too would be pissing his pants right now.

So. Something to work off of. There were lots of hints she could&#39;ve picked on to identify that thing, but it seemed like she wasn&#39;t in the right headspace to figure them out by herself.

&quot;I&#39;ll calmly describe it to you then,&quot; He said, calm, almost <em>nonchalant</em>. &quot;Tall as shit, at least seven... maybe eight feet tall. Mostly looks like a human, albeit a very starved human. It&#39;s got nasty wounds all over its body, like it has just came out of a life-threatening fight. It&#39;s got some sort of animal skull on his head, and keeping up with his stare is the scariest shit I&#39;ve done since the OC&#39;s training camp. <em>Needless to say that it&#39;s a Berserker.</em>&quot;

&quot;Also, it smells like shit,&quot; He went on, taking a deep whiff. &quot;...no, scratch that. It smells as if shit, blood and organs were all mashed up into one fragrance. Also, it brought with it some kind of cold. I can see frost appearing on the deck all around it.&quot;</span>

She wanted nothing more than to throw up from the pressure alone. Her legs felt like they were going to give out any second. Adrenaline was coursed through her veins. 

There was a light though. It was in front of her. Ace. 

His words reassured her. ‘<em>Just listen to his words. Focus on them and you will be alright.</em>’ She thought to herself as she closed her eyes. She needed to focus. 

8 feet tall. The list of entries in her memory got narrowed down immensely inside of her head. There was still plenty to choose from. Too many to pick an answer. 

Starved Humanoid. Animal motif. Death stare. Horrific smell. Related to the Cold. <strong>Berserker.</strong> The list got shorter and shorter as the descriptions made it clear on who they just summoned. Only one servant matched this description in her memory. 

A gulp was heard behind Ace. Emeilia steadied herself before speaking. Her voice was still shaky and scared. She had Ace though. He was her pillar to cling to. “<em>Wendigo</em>. A spirit from the old world. Known for their cannibalistic nature and ravenous hunger.”</span>

The silence returned as the words spoken came from neither of them. They came from Berserker. The chilling part of it was that Berserker spoke to them using <em>their</em> Voices rather than its own voice. Emeilia&#39;s &#39;Wendigo&#39; and the rest being Ace’s words were mimicked back to them with flawless execution. It was as if Berserker stole their voices for its own.

Wendigo tilted their head slightly at Ace as their staredown continued. Ace knew what those words meant as a Magus. They were a servant’s introduction towards their possible master. Perhaps that’s why Berserker hasn&#39;t made a move towards them yet. If that was the case though, that would mean Ace was just handed a loaded question…</span>

Before he could voice his concerns, he had been interrupted. <em>By his own voice</em>.

&quot;What the...&quot; Ace started, dazed. Much like Wendigo, he tilted his head in confusion.

<em>Berserker spoke</em>, although its words were unmistakably his and Emeilia&#39;s. So it wasn&#39;t completely mute, great. That would&#39;ve been a lot more reassuring if not for the fact that it spoke with <em>their voices</em>. But if that thing spoke, there was a good chance it could be <em>reasoned with</em>, not to mention that it hadn&#39;t attacked them. Yet. Not everything was hopeless, he thought, this was a step in the right direction. Maybe that <em>thing</em> had enough intellect to recognize him as its Master. The tension in Ace&#39;s stomach quickly lessened, feeling as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.

&quot;So you can speak,&quot; He stated, the grip on the magnum loosening. &quot;Berserker class. A pain in the ass to work with, but what can I fucking do.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Leaving Emeilia&#39;s side, Ace took a couple of measured steps towards Wendigo, a hand pushing his shades up. His thoughts clearer, he slowly began to realize the silliness of his initial reaction. Even if the <em>thing</em> he had summoned looked dangerous, it was still but a Servant. <em>His</em> Servant. What sort of Master would call himself as such if he was afraid of his own personally summoned familiar? He was the superior, the man above, the <em>Master</em>. 

The putrid stench of rotten meat assaulted his nose as he got closer to the beast. Thankfully, it was nothing he couldn&#39;t handle. That foul, repugnant scent of <em>death</em> was a thing you got to know everything about as a soldier. Up-close and personal, Ace stared back at the beast. If this was to go anywhere, clear boundaries had to be set right from the start.

&quot;The man who summoned you,&quot; He repeated, firmly. &quot;I&#39;m him, Ace Colin. Your <em>Master</em>.&quot;</span>

As he got closer to him, well within striking range, Berserker had to look down at their new master. The jaws of Berserker was barely visible as snarled bestial teeth peeked out from the void under the skull. Were they on guard due to Ace? It was hard to tell with Berserker so motionless.

Ace was no fool though. Someone like him was able to tell that Berserker simply needed a reason, no matter how small, to lash out. Will he treat Berserker like the mere beast they are? That&#39;s still left to be seen.

&quot;<strong>The man who summoned me. Ace Colin. Master.</strong>&quot;

Finally, Berserker moved. The first movement it did since its summoning. They knelt down ever so slightly so be face to face with their new master. Those small blue dots seared deep into Ace&#39;s soul. 

The temperature around them was low. Like there was a chilling breeze ever-present with them. If this is how cold it was when this <em>ability</em> of theirs was passive, just how cold could it get if it was active?</span>

This thing will plague her nightmares for decades to come. She wondered if she would even get a good night&#39;s sleep ever again. It felt unlikely. Not with that thing in her memories. 

Despite all of that, Ace stepped forward. He faced this monster without any fear. This only served to make the gap between them all the more obvious to her as she stared at his back. 

&quot;S-sir.&quot; Emeilia&#39;s shaky voice spoke up. &quot;There was something else about their entry. Our store of mana batteries will be useless. This is due to Berserker&#39;s nature. It seems...&quot; She stopped herself to regain the courage needed to continue. She needed to steady herself, lest she mess up her words. &quot;It seems Berserker carves human flesh. I don&#39;t know what happens if they don&#39;t get it, but I would rather not find out myself, if I am being honest, sir.&quot;</span>

A cannibalistic spirit from the old world, the rookie had said, and that trait was so prominent that even Mana batteries couldn&#39;t sustain it. The rookie&#39;s initial description wasn&#39;t just for flavor, <em>it genuinely ate human flesh</em>. Keeping up with the blue dots had suddenly gotten way harder, he could feel his apathy slowly giving way to an ever-growing feeling of dread. The cold, the rotten stench, the stillness, the oppression, the disturbing news. Bad things kept piling onto the man&#39;s shoulders, threatening to topple his psyche at the slightest hint of doubt.

&quot;...shit, that doesn&#39;t matter to me right now,&quot; He said as he finally broke eye-contact with the beast, turning his focus to the surroundings of the group. &quot;It&#39;s neither the right time nor the right place to discuss Berserker&#39;s eating habits.&quot;

The acoustics of battle echoed around them. Sailors dropping to the waters below, fleshy tendrils ripping people apart, sudden madness overtaking the crew—there were lots of things that needed to be tended to urgently, the most urgent thing being...

His other hand fished in the opposite pocket, taking out a handful of heavy bullets. <em>Clunk. Clunk.</em> One by one, the rounds slid into the magnum&#39;s chambers, with one of the bullets briefly glowing lime-green.

&quot;As of today, you will be serving the proud nation of <em>Geneva</em>, along with me and Scholar Corps rookie Emeilia Lewis,&quot; Now full, the cylinder noisily retracted back into the frame. &quot;Whether you&#39;re a man, a woman, a beast or something else entirely—<em>it doesn&#39;t matter.</em> You will do your part and you will be of use to Geneva, for that is the sole purpose of your summoning, and the sole purpose of our existence.&quot;

&quot;Your very first task,&quot; He went on, swiftly pocketing his magnum back inside its holster, his eyebrows knit in conviction. &quot;<em>Prevent this god-forsaken ship from sinking lower than it currently has.</em>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A sense of belonging briefly washed over Berserker. A purpose? A reason to continue existing beyond their cursed desires? This was new..

&quot;▂▂▃▃▃▃▂▂...&quot; A low guttural rumble came from Berserker. It was as if they were in agreeance in Ace&#39;s words. They will serve Ace and this <em>Geneva</em> they spoke of. Or at least, they&#39;d try their best to do so. 

Just how are they going to go about completing their first task though? They were a Berserker after all; a Spirit of the Old World. A being of destruction. 

Wordlessly, Berserker made their way to the railing of the ship to gaze below at the waters. The Spirit knew nothing of how to fix a ship of this size. Fortunately for Berserker, they weren&#39;t alone in this endeavor of theirs. They had ▅▅▅▅ within themselves. Perhaps, they could provide some insight on how to tackle this problem. 

&quot;▅▅▅▅▅▅&quot;

Those words spoke to Berserker inside of their head. A visible twitching was seen once they received them. An uncomfortable sight to see, given their inhuman, yet human, appearance. But, now they have a plan. Whether it worked or not was still up for debate. They had to give it a try though. It was the only option they could think of at the moment.

A rumbling was then felt. The hand that wasn&#39;t being used to hang onto the ship reeled back. Frost slowly began to build up on their arm as the temperatures dropped rapidly around them. Berserker&#39;s eyes then flared up like brilliant flames as they let out another animalistic howl. &quot;▂▂▃▃▄▄▅▅!&quot; Their hand then struck the ship. Berserker&#39;s skill <strong>Aspect of Winter</strong> was activated. Ice quickly formed on the hull of the ship and started to spread out to cover up any damages the ship might have. This would do nothing in terms of repairing the ship itself. This was merely just to temporarily stop it from sinking further until they could reach their destination.</span>

The bone-chilling scream was almost enough to make him second-guess his previous statement, that of asking <em>it</em> for help. A loud metallic noise echoed from the punch it delivered to the hull, a curse escaping Ace&#39;s mouth at the same time. Asking a Berserker as volatile as Wendigo for help, even as a spur of the moment decision, was foolish. What good could this thing have possibly done to their situation...

And then the temperature dropped.

&quot;<em>...fuck me</em>,&quot; The realization of what Wendigo had done hit him like a truck, his mouth agape. &quot;This <em>thing</em> can actually think.&quot;

The frost quickly climbed up the ship&#39;s hull, filling the holes and holding the broken boards together. A clever solution to their problem, <em>way too clever for a Berserker</em>. He had no idea Servants from such a class could even apply critical thinking to their actions. He had thought them as mindless beasts, strong yet emotionally inept, obvious to plans or clever tricks.

<em>Scary. So, so scary.</em> Intelligence was a valuable asset in battle for sure, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel uneasy at the thought of a bestial, cannibalistic hunter spirit that could also form cohesive sentences and devise spontaneous plans. If this thing ever were to rebel against him...

No. The veteran banished those intrusive thoughts from his mind, lifting his head from the hull to the deck. Even if their footing had recovered, it did little to ease the mass hysteria amongst the crew. He peered behind him, watching the sailors flinch at the sudden patches of frost appearing on the deck, some of them sticking close to the railings, ready to jump over them to save their hides.

<em>Pathetic</em>.

No, before that, even without outside interference, they had trouble preserving their food storage. Those were the men and the women who were supposed to investigate on Nirvana, the island that none had come back from before.

<em>Unacceptable.</em>

&quot;Berserker has done its part,&quot; The veteran said as he turned to Emeilia, nodding towards the center of the deck. &quot;Now we need to do ours.&quot;

<em>Granel was right</em>, a group of people on Nirvana—perhaps even the whole island wanted them dead, managing to bring a whole another meaning to &#39;xenophobic&#39;. A vein bulged on Ace&#39;s forehead as he slowly came to the harsh realization that, if they didn&#39;t regroup and reorganize, they would most likely suffer the same fate as the first two expeditions.

&quot;Gather the sailors and the investigators on the deck and try to calm them down to the best of your abilities. Proceed to ask them about what they&#39;ve seen, what they&#39;ve heard, collect as much data as you possibly can on the things impeding our trip. While you do that, I&#39;ll be looking for the rest of the crew in the deeper parts of the boat.&quot;

&quot;...we won&#39;t go down without a fight,&quot; He said as he approached the rookie, patting her on the shoulder. &quot;We won&#39;t.&quot;

Stepping away from the rails, the veteran swiftly walked his way over to the ship&#39;s entrance, quietly disappearing into the shadows of a deep staircase.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A deep chill ran throughout her body once she felt Berserker&#39;s skill activate. It wasn&#39;t a refined or precise skill. It was more akin to an outburst of energy. Wild and uncontrolled. Just like the servant who wielded it. It was outright horrifying to say the least. 

&quot;And I have to travel with that <em>thing</em>..&quot; A sigh left her as she tried to prepare herself for the stress that is to come with this mission. &quot;I bet the others summoned normal servants too...&quot; 

Emeilia continued her lament towards the servant that they just summoned until she saw Ace approach. Quickly, she straightened up and silenced herself before Ace could hear her. The fight was long from over. There was no rest to be had even if they managed to summon their servant on time. Chaos still ran rampant on the Canopus. Someone needed to quell it before it got out of hand more than it already had. 

Right after Berserker got to work on their given task, Emeilia was given one from Ace as well. It was simple. &#39;Gather up the others and calm them down. Gather intel from them shortly after.&#39; A simple enough task. One she knew that she could accomplish. &quot;Right, Sir! Please, be safe in there.&quot; Emeilia gave Ace a salute. The fires within her were small, nearly non-existent, but now there was a blazing flame inside of her thanks to Ace. If Ace told her that they wouldn&#39;t do down without fighting then she would make Geneva proud by making sure they don&#39;t! 

The two then split off for a second time. Each of them with their own objectives to complete. They were so close to the docks! They just needed to hold out for a bit longer!</span>

The docks was within the Canopus&#39; sights. 

The investigators and the crew needed to fight for a little while longer to reach their goal! To simply fall and crumble now before they even reached dry land would be a disservice to the past two expeditions! 

Berserker saw it to personally that the ship would hold until the ship reached Nirvana. They leapt from one spot to the next, using <strong>Aspect of Winter</strong> to summon forth the cold wrath of Winter itself, so they could freeze shut any damage that ship may have sustained up to this point. 

The hull soon took on a jagged icy appearance on the parts where the hull was compromised. The ship was no longer sinker further into the ocean. The frigid ice emitted water vapor into the air once the cold temperatures was met with warmer ones. It was truly a sight to behold! 

Berserker stood on top of the highest point of the ship and stared at Nirvana. Their eyes were burning bright with an azure flame. Ice formed around their limbs, anchoring them onto the ship itself where they stood. This won&#39;t be the only attack they&#39;d launch at them. If Berserker wanted to keep their new Master safe, and their new purpose in life alive, they would need to face any and all challenges that came at them. That much was clear.

The sounds of ice cracking was heard as Berserker brought in their arms close to their chest. Hunched over and primed, Berserker threw their arms to their side before letting out a final howl. 

<strong>&quot;▅▬▬▃▃▃▬▬▅ーーー ———!&quot;</strong>

This was a declaration of war to Nirvana. To show that the Third Expedition will not be so easily broken!
