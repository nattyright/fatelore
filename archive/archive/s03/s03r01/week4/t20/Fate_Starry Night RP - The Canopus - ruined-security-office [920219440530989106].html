                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Granel and his Servant ran through the ruined ship as metal creaked and pipes groaned as the ship continued to run into Nirvana. If it were a real island, the ship would run aground. As it was, who knew?

Granel would&#39;ve liked to retrieve the ship&#39;s black box, but there was no time. He had to guarantee his own survival. His contract was void if he was dead. His employers would understand that.

&quot;<strong>So, Servant.</strong>&quot; Granel huffed as the two ran through the ship. &quot;<strong>Sorry about summoning you straight into combat. Wasn&#39;t my intention. What&#39;s your name and class?</strong>&quot;

The man&#39;s eyes glanced down towards the sword at Donald&#39;s hilt. &quot;<strong>Saber? Does your sword shoot beams or anything like that? I&#39;ve worked with a few Servants in the past, and that seems to be somewhat clich&#233;.</strong>&quot;

Granel slowed to a light jog as they reached the security office. &quot;<strong>Here. Keep watch.</strong>&quot; Granel said as he attempted to pry the security door open. It was locked electronically, but this section of the ship seemed to have lost power. 

Either that, or every door automatically locked. What ship locked itself down while they were sinking?

&quot;<strong>HRRRRRRNGHHHH!</strong>&quot; Granel grunted as the door pried open, inch by inch.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“I think it was yer <em>sole</em> intention,” Donald shot back. He had to stay behind Granel for lack of knowledge about his surroundings. It bothered him to no end, but such was the situation. To be honest, it was the smallest gripe he had at the moment. Bottom of the barrel, so to speak. 

“And don’t get it twisted, lad,” he stopped running well ahead as his Master slowed his roll. He instead walked the rest of the distance, “just cause I joked about the class thing, don’t mean I’ve got a magic sword. It slices and dices as well as the rest ov’em.”

When Granel told him to keep watch, he rolled his eyes but turned around nonetheless. A safe call, yet incredibly unnecessary for someone like himself. Did the brute lack a brain? What idiot <em>wouldn’t</em> keep an eye sharp while the two of them were in a moment of downtime? Besides, it was the perfect opportunity to see just how bad he’d been wrangled by the sea demon. 

Wait a second… 

“Did’ya not hear me say my own bloody name?!”

Now he wasn’t annoyed, he was straight pissed! “It’s <strong>Donald</strong>. Donald McBane. You can look it up when we’re dry and warm. And that wool’s pulled from yer ears.”

Instead of continuing his bellyachin’, he poked at his sore arm. That bard’s magic had all but gone, leaving the old aches right where they’d been left. It felt incredibly disfigured, yet not completely unsalvageable. With any luck, both that and the small chunk out of his side be’d back come sunrise. 

At the very least, his forced partner had the smarts to keep him alone with the monster. If that had been a double battle, his frame would’ve made some nice friends with the fishes a dozen times over. 

One positive.

“What’s in this room o’yers, anywho? Rations? A map? My lost flintlock, perhaps?”

Alright, that last one was on himself and he knew it. Still stung, far more than the scratches that had dried up by now. Once they got off this wreck, maybe there’d be time to search the shore. See if his precious had floated ashore.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The man grimaced slightly at Donald&#39;s sharp remark. The man wasn&#39;t far off. Granel should&#39;ve summoned him earlier on, so that the two could build morale. He had worked with tons of teams before. Why was this any different?

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re right. That was a bad choice of words. I apologize.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted as the door tore from its hinges, clattering as it was shoved aside, loudly banging throughout the entire ship.

Whoops.

&quot;<strong>I was busy fighting zombie familiars. You&#39;ll have to forgive me for not catching your name. Let&#39;s hurry.</strong>&quot;

Granel stepped into the room, bending over slightly to enter through the doorframe, only to gape as he and Donald entered.

It was as if Scylla had burrowed through part of the office as she ascended towards the upper sections of the ship, as there were entire walls missing, and Granel could see water when he leaned over the edge. An empty beer can fell into the maw.

&quot;<strong>Shit. You fought <em>that</em> and lived?</strong>&quot; Granel asked, seemingly impressed. His Servant certainly wasn&#39;t third-rate. Despite the praises he could sing of Donald, however, it was more important to do what they came to do.

He turned towards the massive array of screens and monitors, which were still somehow intact. Several screens were active, however, and Granel could see a swarm of unrecognized individuals on several cameras.

&quot;<strong>Nirvanans. We&#39;ve been overrun. There was no way we were going to hold this position. They sent us here to die.</strong>&quot; Granel growled as he banged his fist into the desk.

&quot;<strong>Tear up that wall. Leave nothing behind.</strong>&quot; Granel said, pointing towards the array of computers. &quot;<strong>Ration packages, used by Genevan soldiers, booze, water. This isn&#39;t my first rodeo.</strong>&quot;

Granel cautiously edged past the massive hole, and went into the lounge, and began stuffing brightly colored boxes, tapes, and drink into the bags.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Granel had the potential to show humility. And humor. Maybe this wasn’t a lost cause after all. Unfortunately, time would have to tell which way this relationship would go. That was a precious resource around these parts, as Granel ripped the door off its hinges and immediately entered. The brute had to duck down to even get in, further emphasizing his bulk. Unlike himself, where the bulk was more farce than fact. 

This man was pure muscle. 

“You were there,” Donald muttered in response to Granel’s question. The room was a mess, with some of the walls straight up gone. The wall of televisions were still up and running (must be the work of an actual Caster), showing a peculiar show. Multiple screens show individuals who reminded the Scot of his home time period. Disheveled and soaking wet, they roamed the halls of the ship. 

Based on his Master’s words, they were not the type to buddy up with around a fire with a cask of ale. At least, not for them. His name for them was just as weird, ‘Nirvanans’. That was vaguely familiar, sounded like a religious term. Which one was it again? One further east, perhaps?

“Make sure the booze is snug,” Donald half-assedly smiled. “For every drop you lose, you&#39;ll be sure to pay in due.”

With that, he waltzed over to the monitors. There wasn’t point in checking out the perilous depths of the sea unless it was somehow <em>not</em> blue. A flick of the wrist brought his sword out and the pointy side closer to him. 

Granel would start to hear glass scattering across the area as the first few monitors were smashed to bits…</span>

Wonderful, the Nirvanans could add littering to the list of crimes committed by the Investigation Team.

&quot;<strong>Trash it all. Computer towers, security footage, everything. I&#39;d rather not be recognized.</strong>&quot; Granel said, realizing how pointless that was. He was probably the most massive man on the entire Nirvana Preserve. He had a target on his back thanks to Koji. All they were really doing was hopefully buying the other investigators time on the island. 

In the end, it was simple policy. The ship had served its purpose, it was time to trash it and leave nothing of value.

&quot;<strong>Naturally.</strong>&quot; Granel smiled. &quot;<strong>If we&#39;re gonna die out here, might as well die hammered, yeah?</strong>&quot;

Several rolls of mana batteries were stuffed into the final bag, and zipped up. Waterproof. Granel allowed himself a bit of pride. He truly did think of most things. Besides, who knew where they&#39;d be able to find more batteries on Nirvana? Better safe than sorry.

As Donald continued his purge of the security office, he would see a marked case:

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was some saving to this relationship after all! A good drink did wonders for the spirits and made the prospect of death a little more easy to swallow. There was a joke in those words, Donald was sure of it. How to turn it into one was beyond him. Probably beyond Granel, too.

So, he continued his smashing assault. Strike a screen, watch the bits and pieces fly around, move on. Strike, watch, next. Strike, watch, next. Str–

No! Not that! In his gung ho destruction, he almost destroyed something markedly not a screen. Nor a relevant piece of technology. This was something that predated everything else, if only by… how in the hell would he know? 

It was a rectangular case, as if a brick had been cut in half. All that was left is this pitiful thing, labeled ‘Titanic’. A year had been written out as well, a few hundred years after his own demise. There was a name, too, though it rang no bells. Putting his destructive conquest on hold, Donald grabbed the item and viewed it from multiple angles. Nothing off about it. 

“Hey,” Donald called out, “you know a ‘James Cam-er-own’?” He held the VHS up high, shaking it slightly. A faint rattle could be heard on the inside, the tape hitting the box over and over. Not hard enough to cause nervousness, but perhaps better safe than sorry?</span>

&quot;<strong>Batteries, check. Rations, check. Flashlight, check. Mages don&#39;t have to deal with this nonsense.</strong>&quot; Granel grumbled, though he didn&#39;t mean it. An industrial-strength spotlight blew any magus&#39;s werelight out of the water.

But wasn&#39;t he missing something?

&quot;<strong>No no no.</strong>&quot; Granel murmured as Donald picked up the strange tape. &quot;<strong>No no no...! Where is it? Please tell me it didn&#39;t fall over!</strong>&quot; Granel looked over the edge, seeing chunks of ice floating about. He turned towards Donald, who was holding a black box. The man slumped his shoulders in relief.

&quot;<strong>Thank goodness. Er, hand that over, Donald! It costs more than your S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame did. Please.</strong>&quot; Granel said, hustling over to Donald, before plucking it out of the Scot&#39;s hand. The man seemed nervous, yet also extremely relieved. He tucked it into his massive backpack.

&quot;<strong>Let&#39;s go. We&#39;ll have to descend to the lower levels, and leave through the loading bay. Come on—</strong>&quot;

The ship rattled, and the floor slanted slightly, and the ruined computer desk started to slide...

He didn’t get the chance to continue this argument. Before he could get another word out, the floor started to shift. Tilt, even. As if the ship herself were singing its terrible song. A deathly, harrowing tune of death and ruin for everyone still aboard. 

Not that they’d be aboard in the next coming seconds. 

Even someone like himself couldn’t keep his feet on solid footing if it became a near ninety-degree angle. So when it did just that, his first thought was on the blade still in his hand. A death grip would have to suffice, as both man and metal started the slippery slope into the cold abyss. There were even large chunks of ice to cushion their fall, how well planned! They could smash their legs to bits and drown on the frigid liquid, slapping in chaotic symphony.

He attempted to grab hold of anything at all, which only left the desk that held all the technology he had just destroyed. Which was also joining them in the sudden dip. Bollocks. 

In the short hindsight, as the pair finally fell off the ground-turned-slide, he would’ve been holding on for dear life with his bum arm. That would’ve been, what, ten extra seconds staying dry? Not much at all.

The sea <em>was</em> blue. At least that was an expectation he could hold onto, in these trying times. The maw of saltwater was ready to eat, and no flailing of limbs or screams of terror would do any good.

Donald took one deep breath and was swallowed up whole.</span>
