During the days he was awake, he couldn’t dare speak of what happened on the Canopus, even when the memories tormented his every though. Some times, he’d go into such a stupor, he’d lose his sense of direction, quick to bump into trees, or fall into small ditches, or have close encounters with the mist foreseen problems within the Deserts in Nirvana. However, if that were not enough for him, his nights were even more of a nightmare for both him and his saber. During the night he’d wake from terrors with a scream, loud enough to force him to nearly convulse and fight his way into reality. His voice had become raw as the nights came and went, each same event happening over and over to torment his dreams which used to elude him before. The vision so clear it’s like he’d have relived it, how the sailors were drenched in blood, how even with contorted body parts and shattered limbs, they inched towards him, knives in hand as if nothing but his own blood was needed to be spilled. Sometimes it got to the point where he’d nearly blink himself and cry, asking himself who is he? What was his name? How did he get here? But, not much could comfort him during those moments besides a shaky whisper that’s come to him. He was a Doctor. He was Dante Jeanne Colt. He’d come here to help with problems that plagued both himself and others. He’d came here on the boat named the Canopus. He was the master of Octavius Gaius Caesar, the first Emperor of Rome, he had experienced an event on the boat that scared him. He had survived. However, even the lack of sleep seemed to wear on him, with quick sight of dark bags under his eyes coming in as they journeyed  towards their location.</em>

<em>But, finally, as they were ordered, they had arrived to the desired location. The lab hadn’t been much, desert flora had populated such a hospital and it’s dilapidated state only gave Dante a glimpse of hope that he’d be able to hole himself away there.</em></span>

He knew the saber would be against the idea anyways, to stay within a place not many would go to, to hide from all the troubles that the island would give them, to be unseen by any other inhabitants, but truly the idea came from a place of worry. It hadn’t been much actually find the place, the way the large hospital had been almost abandoned, and how little the lower floors and basement floors seemed to be, Dante found himself a room that seemed to be a consultation office. The room littered with old dusty boxes and books and dust proved no one truly entered and how it’d taken him a moment to even find it due to the foliage covering up most of the door had sold him on the idea. This, this would be where they could hide. A place where they could stay. The doctor did little to say it was good though, but rather with his useful arm, pulled one of the boxes to the other side of the room, clearing space off of the cot that could have been used as a bed for himself or Octavius. And soon, had the Emperor simply not helped, then would the doctor speak, his voice shaky and uneven due to little use already.</em>

“This will be where we stay. . . It seems perfect that it’s here to. No one will find us here, come help clean, it’d be best to at least have space for us to sleep. I’ll set up what I can. . .”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius had been at first angry with Dante as the plan of going deep into Nirvana had been established. Octavius had wanted to meet up with the other if any surviving investigators. It would have been good to know who was an ally and what they had to work with in terms of support if they could get it. Since however, the pair went off in a separate direction, it was safe to assume for Octavius to now be skeptical with every person they would come across now. They were in enemy territory with an unknown number of enemy combatants and they had no plan other than hide. As well from how coordinated the assault was there was no telling what servants the enemy had at their disposal not to mention their masters. If all of them were as dangerous as the pair they fought on the Canopus, that Spider and that Caster, then Octavius and Dante would have to be smart about they went around the island. The mystery of Nirvana and its inhabitants as well as that one Caster servant that helped him and Dante out raked his mind. Why were they so aggressive towards them? Why had that hard helped them? Was that another investigator&#39;s servant? Questions that would hopefully be answered at some point.

As the nights and the traveling went, Octavius&#39;s anger would turn into concern and sympathy for his master as he would encourage Dante, pats on the back, and ever-present confident smile on his face to hopefully ease Dante&#39;s tension, and of course some light chiding every once and a while to show that he wasn&#39;t simply pitying the poor lad. He hoped that he could put Dante&#39;s mind at ease even a little bit. Watching his restless nightmare-filled sleep broke the Emperor&#39;s heart. During those times Octavius would try to help Dante&#39;s mental state slightly by recounting some of his stories like bedtime tales as he stood watch at night. The few Nirvanians that they encountered were easily dispatched, knocked out if able, one killed as a necessity. Besides the occasional odd encounter or the night</span>

The first real taste of combat, the terrifying nature of conflict, the horrors of what waited in the world. While he understood this, he couldn&#39;t quite fully connect with his master. In Octavius&#39;s time, it was a part of the culture and it was expected for him to not feel the depressing aspect of life and death and conflict and war. The type of person that Dante was, was the foundation for everything that Octavius did in his life. Why he wanted peace for Rome and why he strove to create Pax Romana, Roman Peace. He wanted to end war as a necessity for the Dantes of the world.

He was Gaius Octavius Caesar, formerly Octavian later would be Augustus Caesar, first citizen of Rome, the architect of the most prosperous period of Roman history, now, he was the Servant of Dante Jeanne Colt, a cardiologist. He would protect and guard him against as much as he possibly could and he would guide and help him during this campaign. Just like his adopted father Julius Caesar guided his formative years before his death, Octavius would strive to do the same.</span>

When the pair made it to the abandoned hospital in the Octavius was unimpressed, to say the least. He would have wanted a base with a bit more sight value, a true base for the pair. Beyond the dislike of the look of the hospital, Octavius&#39;s reaction was quite the opposite of what Dante expected. A hospital was a... Decent base of operations. Plenty of supplies if they existed, there was likely to be some food and water for Dante, plenty of space to hide if need be. And it was very plausible that more investigators could show up for similar reasons. He knew as well for Dante&#39;s sake that constant combat wouldn&#39;t be ideal for either of them. Octavius knew that he would bear the brunt of combat on the island and while he was a powerful servant in his own right, thinking that power would solve every problem was a fool&#39;s plan. Either way, even <em>if</em> he could dominate every servant on the island single-handedly, he was probably one of the most vulnerable servants on the island. The Emperor knew that Dante wasn&#39;t in any way combat-ready. It would most likely be up to Octavius to most likely fight both servant and master if necessary. Honestly, that would be easier than worrying about how Dante was doing in a fight against an enemy master. If they were all like the Spider then it was clear that any combat would be difficult, so he didn&#39;t blame Dante for wanting to find a nice hidden place for them to set up shop.</span>

When Dante spoke to Octavius he flinched, enough time had passed that the Saber forgot what his master sounded like. <em>Oh he just wants some help moving things.</em> &quot;Of course Imperator, although you can just tell me where you want everything placed, I can move everything just fine by myself. You get some rest Dante, you require it more than I do.&quot; Octavius then began to pick up all of the furniture and items scattered throughout the room and reorganize it to be a lot neater. This shall be the Senate room for their little New Rome. It wasn&#39;t much but it was a start!</span>

His body was weak from fatigue, and the way he occasionally slowed to take a moment to gain his footing from risks of falling and slipping was so often that had he likely had fallen from pure incompetence at his tasks alone. But still, he refused to sleep much at all. Being awake meant he wouldn’t worry. . . Being awake meant he could run if he had to. And the world around him was more vast than the cramped dreams of the lower decks of the Canopus, with the doors tied with string that couldn’t be opened without its wielder’s fingers. The red blaring lights only giving glimpses of the mangled and bloodied faces that crept along the darkness.</em>

“I . . . will be fine. I simply am just going to take a moment, please forgive me for such a thing.”

<em>His voice was uneven, as if even speaking was becoming too tiresome for him, and yet, he persisted he didn’t need rest. Finally, in his most failed attempt, the box fell down with a clatter that echoed within the room, the sounds of metal and old bottles of medication making a shrill noise that almost forced Dante to collapse onto his knees in sheer hysteria. His eyes open as if the dreams that used to only haunt him in his sleep came to life and he were back into such a situation. In such a state he couldn’t do much, but rather cower, the phantom feeling of reliving such a thing so powerful and the hold so grasp he almost stopped breathing entirely. His one eyes dulled with a numbness that could turn any beating heart to tears. His body shook as if he were left alone in the rain, his arm went to his face just like during his battle with that woman. . . Covering his eyes as he simply waited for the woman, just waiting for death to finally take him.</em></span>

The scene of the contorting sailors hounding him again like hyenas, cackling and poking at him with their weapons. And at the end of it all, that woman’s face appeared, the bloody smile she had as she watched it all. The same complacent smile as if what she did was not sacrilege itself.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As he was setting the furniture of the room in decent places around the room, Octavius paused at the clatter of the box. At first, he assumed that Dante tried to pick up a box he wasn&#39;t strong enough to lift, but as he turned to check on Dante he noticed that the young doctor had fallen to the ground. As soon as the emperor saw this, he dropped the boxes he was carrying on the floor and moved to Dante&#39;s side, first putting a hand on his shoulder to steady him. 

&quot;Imperator? Dante are you alright?&quot; Even as the words left his mouth Octavius knew the answer to his question. With that revelation, Octavius picks up Dante and carries him over to a couch, and lays him down onto it. He heard Dante&#39;s murmurs about the woman and her puppets and scowled. He hadn&#39;t fully realized how much that traumatized the lad. &quot;Now my suggestion has turned into a command. Dante, you will stay right here and rest, I will knock you unconscious if I have to to make you rest. I understand what you are going through my friend, and I can&#39;t tell you how to deal with the experience, but do not let your first brush with the horrors of this island destroy you. I know you can get through this ordeal Dante, it&#39;s why I accepted you as my Imperator, above any other master on this island.&quot; He then stands up above Dante, looking around the room before his eyes find what he was looking for. Caesar practically teleported from how fast he moved around the room before appearing before Dante again with some crackers and a bottle of water. &quot;And you need to eat and drink. I will not have you wallow, defeated before we have yet to lose. You better not lose a battle of the mind before the first words have been said, Dante! I am the only one here, just me Saber. Your safe.&quot; Octavius said as he shoved the food he found into Dante&#39;s hands and then put one hand on Dante&#39;s shoulder.</span>

<em>When he opened them, he found that the Saber had been there with food in his hands, the packet of what seemed to be old crackers that seemed to be stale and a bottle that had dust that covered the label. . .

He looked down at Dante for a moment, deep in thought. Octavius knew that this was only the beginning of their ordeal on this island, between the Islanders and the Investigators, he knew that there would be a lot of blood spilled, horrific scenes that would be displayed across the landscape of the island and above all else, many people would die. Octavius wanted to savor the look of peace on Dante&#39;s face before he could never see it again. How many more times would he see him at peace? Octavius didn&#39;t know, but he wanted to see every single instance before he couldn&#39;t see it again. Caesar patted Dante on his head before turning away and looking at the office. He knew what he could do to surprise Dante.

. . . 

A few hours passed between Dante passing out and Octavius&#39;s gift. Octavius would in the time for Dante to wake up, reorganize the room into something neater, something fit for a Caesar. While his options were limited with furnishings and decorations, Octavius tried his best to make the office a bit homier. He scoured the hospital, taking desks, chairs, a beanbag couch, and generally the best looking stuff possible, and put it in the office, almost making it seem like the hospital had never been abandoned in the first place. When he was finished he sat, exhausted, next to Dante on the floor with a few items. A board, some nails, and a knife he found. With the knife, Octavius was carving something into the wood.

He could still feel the looming grogginesses of days without proper rest, however even a little sleep was better than none. The doctor let a small sigh, happy that the saber had kept what he said true. He was safe. He wouldn’t be harmed. Not yet.</em>

<em>Dante scanned the room to see what needed to be done, he last could remember, they had finally made it to the room and he was trying to pick up the boxes to organize in order to make it into his workshop. . . But, alas, the room was already done? The large round table in the middle of the room with chairs about it, how the bean bags from what could have only been patients rooms were scattered about in a sense of relaxation and a more Roman-Esque fashion. Dante shook his head, had Saber done this? It could have only been him. But, even that thought about it was enough to put a small weak smile on his face. It was done, and yet he didn’t even have to ask.</em>

<em>What had him finally look down was the constant sound of chipping that happened beside him, the sound of a makeshift design. The doctor turned his head, noticing the bright fiery hair of Saber as he focused intensely on his work. The sign, “New Rome”, as bold and arrogant as it could have been to boast their newfound workshop. Something about it was almost inspiring, to see that wherever the man went, Rome followed. Even when the sands of time washed away the very foundation of what he had built. Dante looked at the board as well, happy to see it, for that banished the terror of the world if only for that moment. New Rome. A place where nothing and no one would find but themselves.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Octavius put the finishing touches onto the sign, he heard Dante waking from his slumber and a smile grew on his face. Octavius then sets down the sign on the desk next to him and puts the knife back into a pouch attached to a leather belt. Octavius then turns his head to look back at Dante. His face instantly softened a little bit as he could see that his master got actual rest for once. Octavius then passed the leather pouch belt to Dante. All of the pouches were on the right side of the belt. 

&quot;Ah Imperator, you&#39;re finally awake. Don&#39;t worry about apologies Dante, we are in this together now. A master and servant partnership is just that, a partnership. We have to rely on each other. I couldn&#39;t expect you to take care of me while you were in that state so I simply took care of all of the heavy lifting for you. And you&#39;ve only been asleep for a few hours.&quot; Octavius stated as he then proceeds to stand up over Dante, not at all explaining the pouch at all to Dante. Although if Dante checked the pouches, they&#39;d be filled with rations, a knife, a few extra books, mana batteries, some sanitary wipes, and even a full first aid kit. He then picked up the New Rome sign and looked back at Dante once again. &quot;I wanted our base of operations to feel like a home rather than a shabby hideaway. And this sign cements it. Dante, I want you to put it on the wall outside. This is your New Rome after all.&quot; 

Currently, Octavius had put the island on hold, he wanted to make sure that Dante was alright and he wanted to connect just a little bit before they would have to go into the next fray. The mission wasn&#39;t as important to Octavius as Dante&#39;s well-being.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It had been a restless night. After a brief respite at the <span class="mention">#desert-labs</span>, the Rider pair resumed their westward trek across the desert, until civilization finally massed before them. Concrete sidewalks proliferated ahead, sand dunes giving way to homes then buildings made of wood and steel. They were in a desert town, one of Nirvana&#39;s few urbanized clusters that housed a slew of amenities for both tourists and residents alike.

After a few twists and turns, the pair arrived at the hospital just before the sun broke over the horizon. Koji swiped them into the building with his employee&#39;s card, then shut himself into an operating room after telling Scylla to &#39;behave herself and don&#39;t go causing trouble for the overnight stay patients in her current state&#39;.

Koji did have a point. The sight of someone gushing blood like a fountain might not instill the greatest confidence in those who came to the hospital to seek recovery...

A few hours had passed since then. The sun was now overhead as noon fast approached, but the doctor still hadn&#39;t emerged from the operating room. 

The waiting game had gotten old ages ago. How long had she been waiting? How long was she supposed to wait?

...He couldn&#39;t have died, could he?

But that would be <em>silly</em>, because she could feel strength returning to her body bit by bit. The amount of mana she had been receiving went from a tiny trickle to a more generous flow in the past few hours - not quite as much as she had been getting on the Canopus, but it was only a matter of time before it had fully recuperated.

So where was the doctor?

...He couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep and left her out to dry, could he?

...

Inside the operating room, half kneeling and half sitting on the floor, arms folded on the mattress of the operating table, shoulders rising and falling with each steady breath he took, the doctor was truly fast asleep...

What a <em>scum</em>.</span>

Still, Dante nodded at what was in it, grateful that he had it. But, what threw him off was the knife. Was. . . He to fight someone with it? Dante took it from its designated location and held it in his hand carefully, almost too carefully, as if with a light touch of his finger and he’d suffer a gash to the abdominals. He looked at saber, confused.</em>

“Y-Yes it is a partnership. I agree. . But, what am I to do with a knife? I’m no good in battle. I understand the idea of you giving this as a gift, I just wish you understood that I—“

<em>He couldn’t pass the threshold much longer, to admit that his arm would be useless in battle would show he too was useless. Something about how foreign the words died on his lips made him want to forget the idea entirely. His arm would too care for the lame counterpart, scratching it though he could feel nothing. He didn’t want to say much on the topic anymore, so he continued back to the conversation beforehand. He continued his smile, though the authenticity of it died shortly. But, he’d feign it. Even if for the emperor to enjoy his creation.</em>

“It does feel quite nice though. . . But I don’t know if I’m deserving of this New Rome, that was your empire, no? I feel like you should put up the sign. <em>Your</em> New Rome, that way it gives us a place to call your home too.”

<em>He pushed the topic back to him, birthed a bit of mirth at the thought though he knew little it could bring him. He was the Roman Emperor, to give him such a sign would mean he gave up his title. Instead, the Doctor nodded at the sign and Octavius, as if he himself had decided that he was more deserving of it.</em></span>

It had been restful, though hardly convenient. After all, they had not came all this way to nap.

But upon his awakening, he would notice two things.

One - The open door. Obviously, at some point, Rider had opened it up and checked in on him. Whether that was a touching gesture or disobeying an order, it did not matter. Because...

Two - Scylla was gone. She hadn&#39;t died, no, there was no sign of an expended S.E.R.V.A.N.T rig, and his artificial circuit, haywire as it was, still held onto the connection. But there was no point speculating. After all, if one wanted to find the monstrous woman, all they would have to die was follow the trails of blood.

The trails of blood that led through the neatly organised hospital corridors, leaving rivers of sanguine on the plain white floors, which led all the way to <u>the morgue</u>.

It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that wasn&#39;t good.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For the moment, Caesar would ignore Dante&#39;s pause to teach the doctor a lesson as he reaches over and takes the knife from Dante, swinging it around at the air with quick slashes and stabs against a shadow opponent. He then pauses, looked to Dante, then motioned to the sign before handing the knife back to his master. 

&quot;The reason I added a knife Dante is the versatility of having one. Will I expect you to use it to kill someone, yes. Will I expect that might occur exactly once because you have other tools at your disposal, also yes. It&#39;s not about the fact that it is a weapon, it&#39;s the use behind it. You can use that knife for any number of things, not just to end a life. I simply give it to you as a necessary option in your tool kit.&quot; Octavius explained as he held the &#39;New Rome&#39; Sign in his other hand. &quot;And just because you are weaker than most, doesn&#39;t mean that you having that knife is useless. My father, Julius Caesar, was killed by comparatively weaker men with just a few knives. You simply need to believe in yourself more Imperator, as I do.&quot; He ended with a small smile as he started walking towards the door of the office. Although it was short-lived as he would have to pause again to chastise the doctor. <em>For such a passive individual, Dante sure was a stubborn mule when it came to positive reinforcement.</em> Octavius spun around on his heel to face Dante with a blank, yet disappointed look. If Octavius could change one thing about Dante, it would be his self-deprecating humbleness.</span>

&quot;Dante. I named you the head of this campaign did I not? Named you Imperator over all of Rome for the time being, did I not? I named you the next emperor of Rome. Did. I. Not? Now get over here so you can plant the sign to the wall and proclaim the new lands that we shall take for Rome. If you cannot fathom that you are the head, then we shall nail this to the wall together. No buts, no protests, nothing.&quot; Octavius stated seriously as he added a bit of venom to his stare. Perhaps it was too aggressive for the young man, but Octavius wanted Dante to know that Octavius put his faith in him and his decisions as his master.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji awoke with a throbbing headache. 

He wasn&#39;t sure how long he&#39;d slept. The fluorescent light blasting from the ceiling destroyed any sense of time he could&#39;ve had in this confined, windowless space. His arms felt numb from where he&#39;d used them as a pillow, and when he tried to rise, he found that one of his feet was still asleep. It tingled for nearly a minute after he got up, and hurt whenever he stepped on it.

It took him a while to locate the clock. But by the time he did, his mind was no longer on the time, but in a state of panic.

The door to the operating room was wide open.

Now, the hospital wasn&#39;t completely deserted. Patients and employees still came and went, but ever since Nirvana&#39;s shutdown, no one really bothered clocking in regularly anymore. Many doctors, like himself, had resorted to appointments and home visits, saving the hospital for only the most dire of circumstances.

To say that someone - be it a colleague, a janitor, or a patient - had poked their head into this operating room while he was asleep and left without bothering to wake him was simply unimaginable.

Which left him with only one person by the process of elimination.

&#39;Scylla?&#39;

He hobbled out of the operating room and into an empty hallway. His Servant, whom he explicitly remembered telling to wait outside, was nowhere in sight. Save for a trail of blood that led further down the hall.

Koji rubbed his temples, feeling his headache intensify.

<em>&#39;Scylla,&#39;</em> he switched to his mind voice. <em>&#39;Where&#39;d you go? I did not give you permission to wander around.&#39;</em>

He followed the blood trail, which seemed to drizzle just about everywhere one&#39;s foot could reach. Scylla had clearly been exploring, but what could a measly hospital possibly offer a beast who had no interest in anything other than the taste of flesh?

...Oh no.

In other words, the morgue.

&#39;Shouldn&#39;t have let a goddamn <em>pet</em> out of the box.&#39; Koji muttered, furious with himself that he hadn&#39;t left Scylla at the lab. At least she&#39;d have been away from proper civilization. What if someone had spotted her tearing meat off the bones of the deceased? What if she had decided that fresh human meat was more tasty and started a massacre here at the hospital? Was that why the hospital was so quiet even though it was still in the middle of the day?

<em><strong>&#39;Get back here this instant!&#39;</strong></em> He shouted into Scylla&#39;s mind.</span>

The easy control and precision that made even his shadow step back in fear of being punctured by the weapon. He. . . He was expecting him to be as controlled as him? It was as if asking the moon to outshine the sun. It just couldn’t do it. <strong>He</strong> just couldn’t do it. The lecture of his expectation’s only seemed to paint a picture Dante couldn’t look at, he couldn’t see himself harming anyone. To kill. The picture was unrecognizable, disfigured as he thought himself, mangled yet it demanded a presence, even when, the art that it showed looked nothing like the muse.</em>

<em>The more he went on, the less it seemed to connect, almost as if a circuit without any charge. It didn’t matter in a system of beliefs, the impossible would remain the impossible. The way his mind had already built excuses to prevent it showed so; just as no matter where the Roman emperor went, Rome would never be the exact same, the same was to say for the doctor. No matter what would happen, he’d never to find himself able to kill another. Yet again, his body refused to let such a thing be said, instead he let his own venomous words stew inside him, taking up whatever hope he could find to at least appease the idea of what the Emperor had. Now wouldn’t be the time for fighting over impossibilities, for they showed themselves with or without introduction. In a brief moment of seeing Gaius face him once more, he forced his attention towards him. How he fervently professed that he saw something so different than what the other had seen, as if his viewpoint were so alien and not at all correct that even then that had made him question his own idea of it. Part of his mind simply gave into the grave reality of things, that he’d been planted here to die, to have little to no idea how he’d accomplish such a task of even investigating the island.</em></span>

The word imperator had become something he’d taken on, be it with his agreement or not, and yet that minuscule part wanted to follow it. To follow the idea of this fantasy played before him, as someone who could stand and lead to a solution.</em>

<em>Due to such an ultimatum he was given, it gave him little choice to allow the servant to hang the sign up himself, and so he was forced to concede with the second option. He’d hang it up with the saber, to at least get what he felt could be justly done: The emperor to declare what he felt would be a New Rome. Dante nodded, simply moving past the saber towards the door before he opened it, letting the door become ajar as he tried to find what he could say next. Carefully trying to not upset the saber anymore than he had already done. Though even the idea of having to do such a thing and not simply try to live up to the expectation he had asked of him, hurt more than ever.</em>

“You are correct on what you had said, but then you are to hang the sign up with me. This is your new Rome, and I will simply follow through with it. It is the least I can do as a Master, and as a person. . .”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nothing. Despite his mental questioning, Koji received nothing in terms of response, not even a grunt or a growl. Nothing but silence, leaving him alone with his thoughts.

Had their bond somehow severed while he was asleep? No, that was wrong. Mana was still being siphoned through his artificial circuit, misfunctioning though it may be. The connection between them was still intact. Then, was she asleep? No, that seemed equally as unlikely. There was no way such a paranoid beast would allow themselves to sleep, especially under such conditions. 

All the rhetorical questioning was ultimately pointless. It was obvious she was just ignoring him. She had disobeyed him, left to go start trouble by cannibalising the dead, and was trying to avoid the consequences of their actions. How typical.

And so, reaching the end of the trail of blood, Naoharu Koji would open up the door to the morgue, to find--

--nothing of particular interest. Well, except for Scylla herself, and the red carpet she rolled out from her body. No great rampage, no piles of corpses, scraps of flesh and bones picked clean. No signs of feasting, not even so much as a bite mark.

Instead, Rider stood over one of the many slabs, down at the expressionless corpse of a woman. A cursory glance at the tag hanging off their foot would reveal her cause of death - a drug overdose, one that had led to critical organ failures. Probably one of the many gangers who roamed the island, or perhaps one of Miss Naomi&#39;s cultists? It mattered not.

Scylla looked down at the body, one hand under the jaw, tilting the head upwards while the other sat atop the yet unshaven head. All the while, she looked down at the body, as though she were completely transfixed by it, so much so that she was unbothered by both her wounds and by Koji&#39;s mental demands. 

Despite how macabre it appeared from an outsider&#39;s perspective, Scylla was uncharacteristically calm, serene. Just what was going on inside her head?</span>

He glanced down at Dante as he drank the doctor&#39;s words. Octavius, while still not fully convinced of Dante&#39;s words, would take them for the moment. Although it was clear that Dante was still dodging responsibility to Caesar. It didn&#39;t matter much though to Octavius, at least he was moving around and had regained at least some of that initial Dante attitude that was present before the fight against Caster. Octavius as well glanced at the tool pouch again. He knew that Dante didn&#39;t have it in him to take a life, but what he did know was that a cornered animal was more dangerous than a confident hunter. He knew if for whatever reason that he wasn&#39;t there to protect Dante that his master needed a means of defending his life, even if it was haphazardly with a weapon that he wasn&#39;t comfortable with. Before walking out the door, Octavius gave a light chuckle and pat Dante on the head as he walked past him with the sign, some nails, and a hammer underneath his arm. 

&quot;That&#39;s a good attempt at being assertive Imperator, keep it up, and might be able to believe that you have some fury in your body. We&#39;ll put it high above the door so many can see the claim of our territory. I&#39;ll put you on my shoulders so you can nail it into the wall outside.&quot; Caesar said nonchalantly as he walked down the hallway, although when he entered the main lobby of the hospital, he noticed the trail of blood from the front door, giving an audible sigh as he kept walking. Octavius hoped that this was simply from an investigator that was taking refuge in the hospital or just a very unfortunate emergency. &quot;Alrighty, let&#39;s find a good place for this sign Imperator!&quot; Octavius said to Dante, completely disregarding the blood for the moment.</span>

It pained Koji to think that Scylla still hadn&#39;t figured out how telepathy worked, which could only mean one thing. She was flat out ignoring him. And when someone was ignoring him so thoroughly, it could only mean one of two things: either they felt guilty about something and was trying to hide, or they were so engrossed in whatever they&#39;d been doing that it&#39;d taken their thoughts far away from reality.

And since when had guilt ever affected Scylla? Could she even feel guilt? 

The trail of blood hadn&#39;t thinned much from where he&#39;d departed. For better or worse, it meant that he was now providing more than enough mana for Scylla to generate enough blood to shed. Though it also painted a huge target on her head for anyone who had been roaming this floor at this hour. Koji could only hope that he was the only one around.

He quickened his pace. The light creaking of a door opening went completely unnoticed as he sidestepped a few potted plants that were obstructing the hallway-

<em>bonk</em>

And he felt his shoulder clip something pointy and hard, before a block of wood was sent clattering onto the floor.

&#39;...&#39; The doctor stopped, looked around, and found himself staring at an armored redhead who looked as if he&#39;d just stepped out of one of William&#39;s stage play. His red-orange garb contrasted painfully with the green foliage of the potted plants. To say that he looked like an eyesore would be a gross understatement.

A Servant?

His gaze shifted to the few nails and hammer the redhead carried under his arm.

A Servant...on construction duty.

Unsatisfied with his answer, Koji cast his gaze further down and saw a tired-looking doctor wade his way through the plants in a winkled white coat and messy hair. When he walked out, he was practically dragging his feet.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji blinked, unfazed by the disorienting state of affairs. Pulling all-nighters weren&#39;t all that uncommon at the hospital. Who knew how many doctors had secretly taken residence on the premise due to convenience and free cafeteria food?

Not that the hospital was in full operation now, nor was the cafeteria still open.

Well, not like he had any right to judge. Koji picked up the wooden plate, turning it over in his hand as he was about to hand it back to the two individuals...

&#39;...New Rome?&#39;

He regarded the Servant, then his Master, this time with an eyebrow raised. Dante would feel his blood run cold. Just what was his luck, running into a Nirvanan first thing in the afternoon?!

Koji studied Dante for a few seconds, a contemplative look on his face. &#39;The hospital is not a playground for your Servant,&#39; he warned the fresh-faced doctor. &#39;There is nothing wrong with&#39;—he glanced at the door plate next to the room—&#39;Lab B-008.&#39; 

Since when did such a room exist?

The doctor chose to not question it. He had much more urgent matters to attend to...

And so he left his fellow doctor and his Servant to their own devices as he continued down the hallway, wooden plate in hand, and turned at the intersection towards the morgue.

...

He was immediately hit by a blast of frigid air, followed by the sight of blood covering the otherwise porcelain white floor. There was so much of it that only a few dry spots were left on the floor, so much that treading on it felt like walking on a thick layer of pudding.

In other words, it was disgusting.

But perhaps even more disturbing was the fact that none of it seemed to have come from the corpses resting on the slabs. The rest of the morgue was spotless, while the perpetrator stood to the side, frozen like a statue as she hunched over one of the corpses, studying it as if she were poring over some ancient tome instead of a delicious meal.

Incomprehensible.

Was she admiring the corpse?

...Or was she about to begin her feast?

With some effort, Koji slid his cane under Scylla&#39;s hand and pushed it from under the dead woman&#39;s chin. He looked towards the foot of the slab next to locate her toe tag. Drug overdose. Seriously? Nirvana&#39;s soil was rich enough to support civilizations several times its size, but all people wanted to grow were weeds?!

&#39;...Care to explain what you&#39;ve been doing here?&#39; He questioned his mute Servant.</span>

The instant that Koji&#39;s cane pried Scylla&#39;s hand free from the body, it was as though a rat had taken the cheese from the mouse trap. In a singular moment, the tension in the muscles released and her arm clawed through the branch-like body of the walking stick, leaving half of it as a jagged stake, and the other half as splinters and sawdust that fell down to the floor below. 

Had it been an active act of malice, or merely a subconscious response to being interrupted? Was this the jaws of a hound biting down on his heels, or the jaws of a bear trap closing as he stepped on it? 

Rider, her state of silent reverie now broken, turned to face her master. Beyond the expected anger that her expression bore, there was also evident disappointment. Her narrowed gaze carried the expected disdain, but it was tempered by the prolonged sigh that escaped her throat, sounding closer to the gurgling purr of a sick cat than any noise a human throat would make.

<strong>&quot;Would <u>you</u> care to explain yourself?&quot;</strong>

Her hand grabbed Koji by the arm, twisting it to reveal the area where his artificial circuit resided. Her thumb poked and prodded at it, brushing along, trying to find any sign of incision, any sign that it had been worked upon. When she failed to find such a sign, the gurgling sigh made its reprise.

<strong>&quot;If you wanted to sleep, Naoharu Koji, I would have preferred you do it in your own bed, instead of dragging me into this arid waste and having me eat glorified roadkill.&quot;</strong> Scylla spoke coldly, releasing her grip on the doctor as she scolded him. <strong>&quot;The monster does not act upon the heroes&#39; calendar. If you intend to nap, then I shall not sit about and allow you to waste my time. Do I make myself clear?&quot;</strong>

As though to emphasise that point, she slammed her fist into the side of the metal slab, leaving a dent next to the head of the corpse, and causing a harsh <em>CLANG</em> to echo through the halls. A full stop to properly punctuate her point.</span>

Though he wasn’t comfortable with the idea that he’d be hanging it up by himself truly, while Octavius simply was beside him. But, there’d be no way to back out without much of a fight from the emperor himself, so, while he mentally prepared for the task to begin. . . it wasn’t surprising when he flinched back in to reality due the sound of wood clattering to the floor. His eyes went to his servant, but then, they drifted to the figure who stood beside the wooden sign. And that was when Dante’s heart dropped.</em>

<em>He was careful about the room, how the lower floors had been unused and hidden with the plants that once decorated the hospital covering about the basements of it all. While he expected the hospital to still function, it wasn’t expected, no, wasn’t planned that someone would visit it. And yet, here a man was. His coat also indicated he was a doctor as well, did he work here? He couldn’t have noticed that he wasn’t there. But his eyes moved towards Octavius, how quickly his attention seemed to focus on him for the time being. This . . . This was a man from the island.</em></span>

The audacity to walk into him, take his sign, know he was a servant, take his sign, talk to and about him like a tool and STEAL HIS SIGN. The only reason he had frozen so long was that he was just so confused on how that man had the gall to make his master apologize for <strong>his</strong> lack of vision! After the man had left, Caesar let out a breath from his mouth in which Dante could see a wisp of fire escape the corner of his mouth. Octavius then immediately turned and began walking in the direction of where the doctor went, following the blood trail. Hardly slowing down when he heard that clang from the same direction that the doctor had gone. Although the context clues surrounding the blood trail, the doctor who looked as though he&#39;d had a run-in with a wood chipper, the fact that he knew immediately that Octavius was a servant and lost as well as that violent sounding smash could only mean one thing. That man was a Nirvanian, and Octavius could get info out of him. As well as there was a good chance either there was a large and strong individual or some other servant in that room, what is it, the morgue? No normal being could bleed that much and be alive. Priorities have shifted. Get information, get the sign, ruffle some feathers. 

A slight smirk came over Octavius&#39;s handsome face, he wanted to indulge himself at some point, perhaps actually get some genuine conversation going or fight something that wasn&#39;t a giant snake or some undead dolls. They were in the dark out here, after all, if Octavius could get some semblance of Intel out of this doctor then the day would be worth it. Also, he wanted his sign back. That took all day to carve correctly. Octavius stopped at the hallway towards the morgue and then turned to Dante, who he had forgotten to mention any semblance of his not plan.</span>

He said plainly and with his continuous smirk as with no other words, he went straight down to the morgue and stood at the doorway, looking at Koji and Rider. Immediately beginning to put the pieces in place. That was a servant salivating over a corpse and that rude example of a doctor was most likely its master. From a glance, he couldn&#39;t tell what Scylla&#39;s class was. What was it with these Islanders and having vague characteristics? His immediate guess was either Berserker or Rider from that earlier sound of metal being handled like paper. He couldn&#39;t see any weapons from a glance or any other noticeable characteristics so it was reasonable to guess for Octavius that it was one of those two. Unless he was thrown a curveball and she was some buff Caster. 

&quot;Excuse me. You wouldn&#39;t mind answering a few questions for me would you?&quot; Caesar asked out loud to the pair as he crossed his arms. He wouldn&#39;t expose anything about who he was yet, he remembered how crazy that purple-haired spider was and her servant and he didn&#39;t want to be crass with his reaction like he was with that situation. &quot;I&#39;ve recently been summoned into this place and I was wondering what you both could tell me about the goings-on around here, my master isn&#39;t privy on such information.&quot; He asked casually with a half-lie. Technically everything he just asked was the truth, so he hoped that the genuine question wouldn&#39;t be seen as anything more than a casual ice breaker.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The snapping of his cane put him on high alert. Servant or not, he was in the vicinity of a beast! Koji jerked his arm back, but Scylla was way faster. Before he knew it, she already had his arm in an iron grip.

&#39;Scylla. Let go.&#39; His voice was clipped as he twisted his arm and tried to wrench it free. &#39;I just fixed up my artificial circuits. You&#39;re going to damage it again at this rate!&#39;

But Scylla refused to budge. It hurt where she grabbed him, and he was reminded of a Servant and a human&#39;s difference in strength. This was by no means the first time Scylla had lashed out against him. The night of her summoning. The fight on Canopus. The detour at the labs. No matter where he went and what he did, something <em>always</em> pissed her off. 

He hadn&#39;t thought much of it at first. Chalked it all up to her origin as a sea monster and attributed her impulsiveness as bestial instincts. And much like training a beast, he&#39;d hoped to reinforce her desirable behaviors through a mixture of rewards and punishments, even if it came at the cost of making a few compromises...

<em>What a load of bullshit.</em>

&#39;I&#39;d never have expected a self-proclaimed monster to have such a refined palate,&#39; he smirked, his tone growing icy as he ridiculed his Servant. &#39;When a beast is starved, it knows not to be picky about its next meal. But clearly that doesn&#39;t apply to you. Is it because you haven&#39;t starved enough?&#39;

He dropped his broken cane and used his free hand to grab Scylla by the collar, dragging her down to face him.

&#39;Your role as a Servant precedes your nature as a monster,&#39; he reminded her grimly. &#39;I did not come all this way to fix my circuits just so you can get yourself killed salivating over a dead body. If you have so much time to kill, why don&#39;t you use it to heal your injuries? Or are you finding it that much more intriguing to paint the hospital in your blood?&#39;</span>

Such a loaded, presumptuous term. She had already reminded them that this &quot;relationship&quot; was not that of owner and slave, but it appeared he had forgotten. Or, had he simply chose to ignore that? Ngh, no, he was too spiteful to forget a single word that escaped her lips, definitely those that could be twisted against her. Couldn&#39;t be the former. Definitely the latter.

If her teeth were to grit any further, then they surely would have shattered into a thousand pieces. Instead, her jaw loosened, and a sigh escaped her lips. 

<strong>&quot;Leave it to a medicine man to presume he knows everything.&quot;</strong> Scylla scowled, swatting the doctor&#39;s arm away and tearing itself free from her grip. <strong>&quot;Logos over pathos, is that not your creed? If only your composure could live up to that promise.&quot;</strong>

Shaking her head, Rider turned away.

<strong>&quot;A monster&#39;s present is to be evil, its future is to be slain. Everything else if forgotten. Leave me to grieve... No, I should not ask anything of you. Doubtless you will not give it.&quot; </strong></span>

&#39;Reason?&#39; He gave Scylla a short, mirthless laugh. &#39;Me, reasoning with the likes of you? You think too highly of me, Rider. There&#39;s a dozen ways you can kill me without so much as lifting a finger. Do you really think I&#39;d be so foolish as to <em>reason</em> with you, when I am constantly at your mercy?&#39;

&#39;Don&#39;t use me as your excuse,&#39; he snapped. &#39;I may be your Master, but you are the one who <em>chooses</em> to listen to me as much as you <em>choose</em> to disobey me. If you wished to destroy me, there is nothing I can do to stop you. Just like how I&#39;m powerless to stop you from drowning yourself in your misery. <em>Are you even listening to yourself right now?</em>&#39; 

When Scylla didn&#39;t respond, he felt a tinge of anger building in his chest. Oh, she was giving him <em>attitude</em>. Doing as she pleased, whenever she pleased. He walked up to her and wedged himself between her and the corpse resting on the metal slab.

&#39;Dying once more in the hands of a fairy tale hero, is that your wish?&#39; He asked her quietly. &#39;Is that why you refused to be deactivated, or why you chose to hole up in a morgue of all places - not because you wanted to feast, but because you wished to experience what they had, dying a mortal&#39;s death? Get a hold of yourself, Scylla!&#39; 

He gripped her arms and shook her. 

&#39;You are a <em>Servant</em>. A vessel powered by magecraft. When you die, there will be nothing left behind to bury. No one will remember you. No one will have ever known you! Why did you answer my summon when all you wanted to do was to die?!&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Once again, the smart aleck proved so eager to stretch out his neck, to assume in spite of the folly of assumption. But, she could not bring herself to be angry. Make no mistake, the kindling of rage still remained in her heart, but she could not bring herself to ignite that inferno. She had spared him from another thrashing.

...No. It was not that she spared him. It was that he did not deserve it. 

<strong>&quot;Even now, you think this is about death. You are wrong.&quot;</strong> Scylla stated bluntly, looking down at Koji even as he shook her. <strong>&quot;Death is not everything. Defying death is not a new beginning. It is merely prolonging an old life.&quot;</strong>

Without fuss, she proceeded to pick the man up, pulling him out of the way and setting him down to the side. Compared to her usual manhandling, this was not a beast mauling its prey, dragging it back to its den. No, this was an ordinary person, moving an obstacle out of the way. And with the human roadblock gone, the servant turned her attention back to the carcass laying upon the slab. Once again, her hand would reach out, caressing the corpse&#39;s long locks of white hair, devoid of even the slightest blemish.

<em>Feet sinking into the sand, tide rushing to and fro past my heels. Kept warm by the sun, kept cool by the island winds. I look out to the horizon, where the deep blue of the sea and the vast blue of the sky meet. Never a worry to prick my fingertips, never a concern to mar my joy. An eternal summer of love. A truly blessed existence.</em>

<strong>&quot;I cannot rightly say why your broken Grail forced me to answer your summons in such a pointless container. But, I cannot allow myself to disappear. It would be an insult--&quot;</strong>

Slowly, her spare hand would reach up, grabbing a strand of her own hair and bringing it up to her eyes. The ends were stained crimson, like blood spilled on snow. Had it always looked like that?

There is no beauty in living like this. There is no choice to live otherwise. No going back to that ideal time.</em>

After a moment of hesitation, her fingers loosened, and the strand fell back into place once more. Her head tilted upwards, staring a hole into the ceiling tiles. When she next spoke, her voice sounded choked, strained as though an invisible hand had a vice grip on her throat. She closed her eyes.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji stared with churning confusion as Scylla went back into her reverie. There was something disturbing about the way she obsessed over the dead woman. Were it from any other person, perhaps he wouldn&#39;t have batted an eye. But he&#39;d observed Scylla for days. While her mood shifted faster than storm clouds in the wind, this was the first time she looked so unguarded and so serene. In front of a corpse, no less. 

Had Scylla always had a fascination in women, or was it something deeply entwined with her roots? Was he intruding upon a private moment?

...Was it ever going to become a problem?

&#39;You have quite the complex relationship with death, don&#39;t you?&#39; Koji said with mock interest. &#39;Say what you will about it, but the fact that you wish to cling to your second life shows that even a monster cannot overcome its fears. If you don&#39;t want to disappear from this world, then you&#39;d know better than to waste your time admiring a corpse when you&#39;ve barely healed-&#39;

He turned his head towards the cadence of heavy footsteps resonating outside the room. 

&#39;-and left enough footprints out there to alert the whole damned building.&#39;

He watched the armored redhead saunter into the room, following by that shrimpy doctor who looked like he was about to fall over any minute. God. Could this day get any worse? Not only was Scylla going through a slump, but his colleague decided that now was a good time to come and socialize? He hadn&#39;t come in for <em>weeks</em>. What was there to talk about? Mopping floors?

What a <em>chore</em>.

&#39;If this is about the floors, I&#39;ll call the cleaners later.&#39; Koji decided to cut to the chase. But to his surprise, it was not his colleague, but the Servant  who spoke up first.

Koji frowned. &#39;I&#39;m not your Master. Why are you asking me?&#39; He looked at the doctor who was half hidden behind the redhead&#39;s frame. &#39;Is he new around here?&#39;</span>

But what truly threw him off his feet was how quickly Saber had gotten from his collected state to following him. His movement making Dante’s eyes break its commitment to the ground in fear that it was the doctor who was moving towards them once again. It didn’t occur to him as quickly that the doctor had taken the sign until he noticed it had gone missing without a trace. Dante’s hand went out immediately in a failed attempt to motion him to stay beside him, but as he stretched out his good arm, he was already down the hallway, making Dante scramble to his feet to try to catch up with him. The doctor had just scolded him that this was no play area for servants, no place to just let him have leisurely activities. . . And while he truly didn’t understand why he had such the thought that he should have followed directions, it stuck with him as important to go and go through with him. Regardless of which side they could have come from.</em>

“S—Saber! We shouldn’t follow them!—“

<em>But just as he tried to give as much of an excuse, his footing almost was lost as he slipped a little, the stick blood enough to have him wobble and teeter to a wall as the side railing caught him for a bit.

It couldn’t have been another situation like what had happened on the boat could it? And that had immediately shut him up from not pursuing the emperor towards his interrogation. He too had to ask. . . The fear that another investigator dead or alive could have been nearby, was enough to propel him to stay within the Saber’s orbit until they made their wo the morgue, where a woman and the doctor had been found.</em></span>

<em>The doctor’s response was curt, how quick he was to almost passively badmouth the saber’s curiosity sent a bit of panic ablaze inside him. He’d mop it up later? Who had been bleeding? Why was he so unfazed by such a sight? Plenty of questions were prodding at him, provoking to ask something. . .But, when it came to his questions, he couldn’t help but find a slight fear that perhaps, he didn’t want to know. When his gaze finally came to himself though, Dante had to think of something quick. Was he to lie and say he worked here? It would have been perfect. . . Saber and he were to get information, maybe it’d have been beneficial to at least ask about the blood that were splotched and painting the marbled in his crimson hue, all of it seemed to be made known and so, in a bold and yet cowardly attempt, he nodded.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji groaned internally as he listened to the young doctor. Of course it was about the blood. Anyone would freak out at the scene Scylla had created outside, much less a doctor who was practically trained to be allergic to blood being anywhere outside a body, a bag, or a tube. It didn&#39;t help that Scylla was still bleeding from some of her more grievous wounds.

The headache was getting worse.

&#39;The blood is a non-issue. Every single body you see here has been dead long before I got here.&#39; He cast Scylla a glance. &#39;My Servant is going through some growing pains. As I stated, I&#39;ll have someone clean it up later.&#39;

He walked over to where he&#39;d dropped his broken cane, picked it up, and carefully wiped it clean on the sheet covering a nearby corpse. 

&#39;Of course you haven&#39;t seen me. I don&#39;t work full-time.&#39; He replied as he worked. &#39;Not many do these days, since we don&#39;t get a lot of patients...hasn&#39;t anyone informed you on that?&#39; 

He looked at Dante strangely, as if he&#39;d just asked something more incomprehensible than seeing a Servant bleeding out in the middle of a morgue. 

&#39;Since you won&#39;t be seeing much of me, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for us to be on a name calling basis. Why don&#39;t you go back to your office and finish settling in?&#39; He reminded the duo, and Octavius was reminded of his objective: the sign! He scoured the older doctor for his painstakingly handcrafted wooden plate, but both Koji&#39;s hands were preoccupied with the cleaning of his cane. Where could it have gone...</span>

To be honest, Octavius thought that he would be panicked at the moment due to being in proximity to another master and servant, from the island no less. As always, Octavius knew that there was more in Dante than he realized.

Octavius assessed the situation intently. Dante and himself we at the exit, these two Islanders were stuck in the room without an exit, a natural exit anyways. As well his suspicions had been confirmed with them being a master and servant pair. These two were clearly in some sort of altercation beforehand to gain such injuries. The Saber wondered if they had been present on the attack against the Canopus. He knew that it was likely and it was certain that if they had been there they had killed people or at least helped in the demise of the ship, but Octavius couldn&#39;t act on that right now, the most important thing right now was the fact that he and Dante now have two Nirvanans in front of them, two that could have valuable information to spill if they asked the right questions. Then when they were done, perhaps the Caesar could indulge in a bit of exercise. Also, he wanted his sign back, and speaking of when the Doctor mentioned that they needed to settle it, it made Octavius cringe slightly. Didn&#39;t this raggedy man not realize that the reason they followed them in the first place was the sign that he took! Octavius uncrossed his arms and took a step into the room before speaking.</span>

&quot;Well, we would love to, but two things first. Firstly, my good doctor, we would like our sign back, it&#39;s a decoration for our office. You picked it up after you bumped into me earlier. And as well, we were curious about what happened to you both. My master and I have heard that another group of interlopers has arrived on the island, alas we were too preoccupied here to do anything about it. Can you tell us more about the conflict?&quot; He asked the main question first, talking with his hands and giving a shrug to emphasize the shame of not being available at the Canopus. It&#39;s been a while since Octavius had to lie to people, he hoped he hasn&#39;t gotten rusty.</span>

“N-no, I hadn’t gotten much information really, as you said it can be quite dull around here. Truly you’re probably the only person who seemed to be alert. . .”

<em>He didn’t want to give up much about himself, how was he to know the hospitals weren’t often frequently used. He didn’t even know the island held such places in the desert!

Luckily, saber had gotten to his part of the questioning, making his responses not needed to be said. He said exactly what he was thinking, which truly shocked him since he didn’t really think he’d get that far, and that lying was something he expected Gaius to dislike.

<em>Okay, maybe he wasn’t exactly lying on that part.

&#39;And you indulged your Servant in his...conquest,&#39; he turned to Dante, &#39;in a hospital of all places. Was the sign necessary, or am I witnessing Roman tomfoolery in its most extravagant form?&#39; 

He looked at the duo incredulously as they inquired him on the goings-on at the beach. Had they been living under a cave?

&#39;Why don&#39;t you get yourselves a copy of today&#39;s newspaper?&#39; He said slowly, his eyes never leaving the young doctor. Despite being half a room apart, Dante felt as if he&#39;d been scrutinized by a microscope. Koji&#39;s eyes were unblinking, taking in every detail, every movement, watching him like a hawk. 

&#39;It&#39;s a huge scoop, you know.&#39; The doctor continued. &#39;A scoop any writer Servant worth their salt would salivate over. But are you really that oblivious, my dear colleague?&#39; 

His gaze traveled down the length of Dante&#39;s arm, before settling somewhere near his wrist. A shiver went down Dante&#39;s spine. He&#39;d forgotten about the little souvenir he&#39;d received from a certain lady on the ship...

A smile broke over Koji&#39;s tired features.

&#39;You seem to know your way around.&#39; He commented offhandedly.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Just as soon as she began to settle back into her daydreaming (and her ignoring Koji), she was dragged out of it. Not by Koji himself, no, at this point she could care less about his opinion on this matter. Instead, it was the arrival of the emperor and his meek-mannered underling that caused her eyes to open.

Her body grew tense. That servant, with hair like fire and a face as though it were chiselled from iron, was no doubt a hero in one sense or another. About that, there could be no doubt. Conversely, his scrawny-looking excuse for a master carried no such air of heroism about him. The notion of the cowardly king Eurystheus and his &quot;underling&quot; Herakles sprang to mind, a notion that only further caused the tension to grow.

If she was in a proper state, it would likely be an even fight between them. But, she was far from being in anything resembling a &quot;proper state&quot;. If Saber wanted to fight, she would likely loose. In that sense, it was fortunate that he was choosing to blather on instead.

But, listen to the smug condescension of Octavius back to back with the pitiful mewling of Dante was like knives and forks scraping inside her skull. Or, to do away with such an ultimately unnecessary metaphor, it was <strong>extremely irritating</strong>. In this regard, her and Koji&#39;s opinions aligned.

<strong>&quot;I don&#39;t care about your sign or your unsubtle prodding.&quot;</strong> Rider interjected with a blunt snarl, jabbing a finger towards the exit in which pair of strangers stood. <strong>&quot;If you are too lazy to carve a new sign, it is not our problem. If you are too lazy to learn of the conflict yourself, it is not our problem. I could not care less about your own ignorance, and I could not care less about freeing you from it. Get out.&quot;</strong></span>

The older doctor insulted his Roman heritage, insulted the sign and they sort of insulted Dante. And that female servant, she had a distinct feralness to her and the patience of an animal, as well as insulting his banter. This enemy servant and master pair were perfect for each other it seemed. Both filled with bitterness and vitriol. Octavius let a small smirk reappear on his lips as he thought of if he were to stab one of them, pure vinegar would surely come out instead of blood. Either way, despite their rudeness, Octavius was gaining a decent amount of information. There was a newspaper that cataloged the goings-on in Nirvana, if they were to get such an item, that could lead Dante and himself on the right track to learning more about this wretched place. For now, he had to keep up the show, however, what Koji said threw off Octavius&#39;s rhythm for a moment. The new doctor act plus that damn string on Dante would make a conflicting story. He had to add to the bluster. Octavius took another step forward towards the pair, standing sort of in front of Dante, somewhat blocking the young doctor from view as he held up his hands and shrugged in mock ignorance.</span>

&quot;Oh thank you, good doctor, getting such a paper would be magnificent. By chance do you know where we can acquire such a precious resource?&quot; He says, trying to shift the subject away from the damning evidence that there was certainly more to Dante and Octavius than what they presented. He at the bare minimum wanted to get the location of this newspaper before everything went to hell. His eyes as well continued to glance back towards the servant. She reminded the Caesar of Cleopatra in an ironic sense. Beauty hiding an acidic personality. As well, Octavius had sort of understood that he probably wasn&#39;t getting his sign back, which was a shame to be sure. Who knew it would be easier to talk to Romans than these Islanders. A social being surrounded by socially inept recluses, what agony this was. Octavius also dropped the shrug, bringing his hands down to his side, keeping his right and open in case he needed to summon his sword to his hand at a moment&#39;s notice. As well he shifted his left foot behind him slightly in case he either needed to brace or launch himself. He wouldn&#39;t be blindsided again.</span>

The answer couldn’t be found, but yet part of him crumpled at the thought that he was the problem of it. He was right, a hospital was no place for games, no place for childish ideals of New Rome. . . But, even then he couldn’t help but whisper his protest with it.</em>

“A hospital may be a place where people are to be serious, but it is instill hope. . . The sign wasn’t something of a game, but to declare that it could be a stable place.”

<em>His eyes couldn’t keep their gaze with any of them, and yet his body stood tall as if he had declared a new law he supported. However, he hadn’t much time to relish in the idea that he had been able to speak his mind on such a thing, because what he didn’t expect was that the island had declared their arrival news for others. They were on the newspaper? Had everyone known that the others had arrived? Were they shown? Though he wasn’t figured out to be an islander, he could feel the way the looks the doctor gave narrowed in on him. His coat felt stuffy, a warmth that sat and bothered him and refused to leave until either he left or declared it. But he’d have to fight with it. He couldn’t just announce he’d been an investigator of the island.</em>

“I—I happen to not often read the newspapers. . . Medical records are more of a thing that peaks my interest. . . I apologize for being oblivious. . .”</span>

He couldn’t even look down anymore, the way the man had so easily pressed for answers and so quickly flipped his questions on their sides, wallowing for a way to right themselves had thrown him off even more. That suffocating heat made him feel as if he were being immolated, the flames of oblivious lies licking and nipping at his body within the morgue, until his body stilled entirely as he topic and gaze shifted toward his arm. . . Specifically that same useless arm that held the string given by the woman on the boat. . . His good finger twitched, the same one that mirrored the other that lamely held the evidence. He had forgotten to rip it off, to tear out the trauma she had given him.</em>

<em>While the rider had finally made her stance known, the doctor had already been losing his breath. Her words nothing but a foreign language that fell on ignorant ears. . . His entire attention had gravitated towards her master. How had the cold colleague noticed? What did he mean by it. . . He could feel that his mind was ready to sprint away, and yet his body protested and stood still. The movement of Saber blocked the gaze, enough to where Dante allowed the other arm to pocket his lame one, hiding it into the confines as Gaius went on with his questions. He should have asked more, not stood there. . . But, what could he have said? The doctor reflected anything he said and turned his own observations into questions! The meek master couldn’t do anything but hope that the Caesar was to be diplomatic as he could. However, then soon enough, Dante in his brash topic of choice, said something quietly to where he tried to whisper it to himself, though had the room been quiet enough, then it’d be clear that the trio could hear it as well.</em>

...But from what?

He turned his gaze back to Dante. The young man was shifting his feet and glancing around, as if to be sure no dead people were walking around the room. The rise and fall of his chest quickened, suggesting shallow breathes. The pulse throbbing in his neck, the faint glisten of sweat at the base of his throat despite the chilly air inside the morgue.

Octavius may have hidden Dante&#39;s arm, but that was only the tip of the iceberg in the vast amount of information one could glimpse from the human body. When Koji put his mind to it, very little escaped his gaze.

Dante was nervous. His Servant, solicitous. And neither of them seemed to have the faintest idea of what was going on.

Koji&#39;s smile faltered.

&#39;Would you like to take a guess or go for a hint, Servant?&#39; His tone remained civil. But the atmosphere had changed slightly. &#39;Rather, why don&#39;t you both take a crack at it? I&#39;ll answer your question if you can get it right in three tries...&#39;

He tapped his cane against the floor. It looked as good as new. Had it magically fixed itself?

&#39;...Or you may follow Rider&#39;s advice,&#39; he raised his voice slightly, &#39;and <em>get out</em> before I change my mind.&#39;

Dante had a feeling he wasn&#39;t just talking about the morgue.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To call the situation at the laboratory office tense would be an understatement. Naoharu Koji was rarely the sociable type, even with those from Nirvana. His Servant wasn&#39;t exempt from this rule either, something that he was always quick to remind her of.

Clearly, Dante and the Roman Emperor hadn&#39;t gotten the memo. Their attempt to masquerade as inhabitants of the island was filled with holes. The only reason Koji hadn&#39;t ratted them out in the first place was because he rarely cared about other people in the first place.

Plus, there was no incentive to do so. Unless they insisted on remaining bullish, that is.

So, Octavius and his Master were stuck between a rock and a hard place. They could press Koji further and most likely give themselves away as outsiders, or they could leave the laboratory emptyhanded, with no knowledge nor New Rome to speak of. Both options left them with no joy.

They would not have the luxury of making that choice.

As the two pairs conversed, Koji inevitably sensed something wrong in the room around him. Or was it perhaps Scylla who had noticed it first with her monstrous senses? Who could say.

All they knew was that something was coming.

<em>thunk</em>

The noise of the lab&#39;s reinforced steel being bent like a pretzel. The clanking noise of metal falling and torn apart. The inching footsteps that drew closer.

Something wicked this way comes.

&quot;Uoooh...&quot; A ghoulish moan echoed from the walls, not dissimilar from that of a poltergeist as its intensity varied with each passing second. It got closer and further away at the same time. Something moved in the halls, enough to send a shiver down the spine of both Octavius and Scylla. They could sense the bloodlust, rage and mana emanating from the creature lurking in the shadows.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong>

The scream broke the world apart.</span>

<em><strong>CRASH!!!</strong></em>

Dust, rubble and metal filled the morgue, as Koji and Scylla felt fortunate that they were closer to the room&#39;s exit than to the corpses themselves. Dante stared in disbelief, while Octavius was most likely prepped for combat. He knew that whatever had emerged from the ceiling was up to no good.

The dust settled, allowing two bright lights to make their presence known. One red and one purple. They were like glittering stars, with length beyond measure as they revealed themselves as a pair of swords. Ghastly, pallid hands gripped at them with want and greed. Their arms shakily wailed about as the figure emerged from the cloud of dust and rubble that they had created. 

The figure was impossibly tall, being akin to a giant as they almost reached the ceiling in terms of height. Perhaps they would have reached it if they weren&#39;t hunching back, like a leper on the street. Their growled and snarled like a wild beast, waving their swords around in anger despite their dignified attire. A royal outfit, embroidered in jewels and gold, paired with luxurious purple drapes and a golden crown.

What betrayed them even further were the two wings on their back, being an assortment of branches and trees that seemed to have formed two protrusions on their back. Dark malice emanated from them, the type of grudge that could last for centuries. What was even scarier was the lack of a face on the person. It was fully covered by a veil, hiding their emotions. All they could hear were the screams.</span>

Their growl echoed across the lab as they immediately pounced towards the group. They spun their swords around, clockwise, resembling a spiral of doom more than a human body.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She could smell it before anything else.

The sudden increase in magical energy, the <em>rage</em> it carried upon it, an anger so potent that it was even greater than her own. It was pervasive, invading her nostrils, bearing a stench akin to rotting flesh. But, there was no such decay within the morgue. Every body had been perfectly preserved, as though the passage of time did not even occur within these sacred chambers. 

It was that odour that made her aware that something was amiss, but it was the sounds of creaking metal and hollow groans that made her alert. It appeared that this pair of New Romans would be the least of their concerns. Her attention was turned away from the pair of intruders, towards the walls, and more importantly, the presence beyond them. Growing tenser, tenser, tenser still.

Until the gigantic figure of Vortigern came crashing in, and all of that tension was released, like a spring. In an instant, Koji would be snatched up by a dozen tentacles, before being hoist upwards as Scylla leapt onto the ceiling, another dozen tentacles piercing through it to give her grip. A sudden move, but one that took them out of immediate danger, out of the path of the mad fiend that had just invaded the room.

Tch, how typical. She was nowhere near battle-ready, and yet, now she would have two foes to contend with? No, this would not do at all. This was not a hunt she was ready nor willing to partake in.

<strong>&quot;Which wall is the closest to the outside?&quot;</strong> Scylla inquired, peering through the dust and eyeing the four walls that made up the morgue. <strong>&quot;We&#39;ll burrow away. No point lingering here any longer.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">All of Octavius&#39;s next thoughts were interrupted by the charge of this new malicious force that radiated from the infrastructure next to the group. All ignorance, all pretty and dancing words all diplomacy was wiped from the Saber&#39;s mind as the wall next to them was destroyed and he felt the chaotic energy signature from the new opponent. Like a coin, Octavius flipped from Diplomatic Emperor to Roman Warrior in a moment. All of the smug blusterings gave way to stern confidence. Thanks to his already readied stance for a fight, Octavius was able to summon Auram Pax to his hand, bringing the sword to bear against the newcomer as he swung and brought his blade to match Vortigern&#39;s own two blades, locking the pair in an explosive stalemate for the moment. The impact sent a shockwave from the meeting point, destroying the ground where they both stood and sending cracks in every other direction. If he&#39;d been any slower, Octavius would have been cleaned in two. Right after the point of contact, Octavius would be seen sliding backward, a few feet away from the beastly servant. 

This was not how he envisioned the day going. His hands ached from the block, his body vibrated from the hit, his entire body screaming as he recovered from that attack, gaining a new posture, putting both hands on his sword&#39;s handle. So much for not getting blindsided anymore.

&quot;What in the hell did you do that for! Anyone ever teach you how to knock!&quot; Octavius calls out to his new adversary. Now that he had a moment to look at him, Octavius could tell from a glance that reasoning with the thing was a poor decision, he&#39;d be harder to reason with than both Romans and these Islanders combined!</span>

<em>Thud.</em>

Dust fell from the ceiling. <em>Thud.</em> Koji tore his eyes away from the Roman pair and looked up. The ground shook. His face remained impassive, but his knuckles whitened in his grip around his cane.

Then came another <em>thud</em>, and the lights wobbled. A nauseating flux of mana permeated the air.

&#39;What in the world,&#39; Koji whispered, then the ceiling caved in.

Rubble and plaster rained from above, filling the morgue with dust. Koji felt Scylla&#39;s tentacles wrap around him, pulling him out of harm&#39;s way as the new arrival landed in the morgue and made his presence known. Growling like a rabid dog, the faceless Servant calling himself Vortigern immediately lunged towards Octavius and locked him in a clash of blades.

Friend, or foe?

There was something to said for the eagerness in which Vortigern pounced on the Roman general. Was another Islander nearby? Had they been staking out the Roman pair and waiting for the perfect moment to strike? Were he and Scylla part of their equation? But Scylla was badly injured. How much could a weakened Servant possibly contribute in a fight?

A dark thought crossed his mind.

&#39;This is the lowest level of the building,&#39; he informed Scylla, his voice muffled by the sleeve covering his mouth. &#39;We&#39;re underground. We have to go up to get out.&#39;

He closed his eyes and started scanning the surrounding area for birds under his control. A flock of sparrows caught his attention. Flexing his connection to the creatures, Koji sent the flock in and around the hospital building, spreading them to cover as much ground as possible. Then he began to scout.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius never felt so brittle in his life. His hands used to grip the glorious world of Rome with love and force, yet now his fingers were twitching and shaking. It was only one attack, but his body had already perceived the killing intent behind Vortigern&#39;s blow.

A sinister flame coiled around Auram Pax for a second, but it dissipated as quickly as it came. Still curious on its origins, Octavius stared back to his opponent, noticing that the sword in the red light was actually a sword covered in flames. It swelled with a burning desire, one that reminded Octavius very much of his own path of conquest.

Was this person a fellow Roman emperor? The crazed Caligula, maybe? No. They seemed deranged, but their sword less so. They could sense something noble about that weapon.

&quot;Uooooh....&quot; Vortigern cried out, shaking his head left and right as Dante and Octavius could hear cracks and snaps. He glared at Octavius, sneering through his veil as he uttered a few words.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t find...Door...&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t find...<strong>HER! UOOOOOOOOH!</strong>&quot; His growls shook the entire morgue, followed by him slithering at the Roman Emperor with unprecendented swiftness. He moved like a ghoul more than a human, contorting his limbs and body to attack from unprecedented angles.

To Koji, it very much reminded him of his own research, to the point he wondered about this Servant&#39;s origins. Who exactly was Vortigern? He remembered hearing about that name once, but didn&#39;t care enough to look them up.</span>

How interesting. The way it moved.

Likewise, his birds scoured far and wide, but seemed to find nothing. All they saw was a pile of destruction here and there, as if Vortigern had been searching for something on the way there.

<em>&quot;Her?&quot;</em>

Octavius would remain ignorant to the doctor&#39;s astute observations, for two good reasons.

One: He couldn&#39;t read minds.

Two: It was hard to focus when a 7 foot tall giant was threatening to cleave you in half.

Vortigern slashed fast and he slashed hard. The flaming sword once again collided with Auram Pax, and while Octavius&#39; strength was on par, he could feel his fingers burn from the scorching heat. Even his sword, his Noble Phantasm, was starting to bend from the fire alone!

The next thud followed a a creak, and that was when the paranoia began to deep inside. Something was above them. Or someone. They had to leave. It didn’t feel right, the sense of panic that had been flooding around him was at this point choking him. And as if it were a cruel joke, the ceiling had belched a creature, the contents of the roof of the morgue clouding its frame from sight.</em>

<em>It was strange to compare it, he knew, but the way he could immediately see the beautiful twilight colors of his blades had allured him like a moth to a flame. Had he not been so terrified, he may have wandered towards it, the way that even the grey clouds of debris and dust had consumed its form, and yet his lithe and ghastly form had been outlined was just marvelous. Soon enough, the dust had settled about, and it’s true form had been revealed rather than it’s shadowy counterpart. The mangled figure before him had been seen immediately, and Dante’s eyes bore upon it. The wings that had been more of an exoskeleton than actual wings, a cruel joke on its mere existence, and how it had been adorned in crowns and jewels, as if he’d robbed a grave of its contents, all of it had fascinated him, and yet that fascination mutated and transformed into a distinct erratic need to escape. They needed to go.</em>

<em>Dante was quick, quicker than he expected to be, how his muscles tensed immediately to move back from the saber and the agile zombie.</em></span>

Slugging it out, blow for blow, would not be an ideal strategy for the Roman Emperor. While he help the same level of strength against this bruiser of an opponent, that&#39;s where the pros stopped. This Vortigern was relentless with its assault, what was worse was that the servant&#39;s swords were more than likely Noble Phantasms and while he could deduce that the one on fire was actively damaging his blade and himself by exposure, he needed to learn was the other blade was likely to do. As well the enemy servant was faster than Octavius expected for a being of his size. The Saber didn&#39;t have much going for him besides his brain in this cramped room. First things first, however, Caesar needed to make sure he didn&#39;t lose his sword first before he could find a way to fight this monster. If he could just get him outside then he could use his <strong>Noble Phantasm</strong> to level the playing field without worry for collateral damage. 

He heard the plea from Dante clear as day through the ringing in his ears. Which was easier said than done with the seven-foot behemoth bearing down on him at every moment. The only way for them to escape was to impair this berserker, otherwise, Octavius alone couldn&#39;t escape the beast, much less while carrying Dante. This was a us or him scenario, unless he could make Vortigern retreat, this was the hand that they were dealt.</span>

For now, though, he had to hold back the onslaught from this servant. Blocking wasn&#39;t doing Octavius any favors, so he would try to avoid his attacks instead as much as possible! Octavius pushed forward with his sword to buck the enemy away from him for a moment of reprieve. He had to risk getting some damage in on this bruiser one way or another. At Vortigern&#39;s next attack, Octavius would pivot his sword to strike Vortigern&#39;s blades on their side before slamming his blade down to the side, putting Octavius&#39;s sword over the creature&#39;s weapons pinning them momentarily to the ground. Immediately afterward Octavius leaned in forward towards Vortigern, taking his right hand away from his blade to slam the back of his gauntlet-covered fist into Vortigern&#39;s face. This however would make put him on semi unstable footing simply for putting more power into his strike as every blow exchanged between the pair destroyed the ground around them more and more.</span>

His birds searched every nook and cranny of the hospital, but they couldn&#39;t find even the slightest trace of a person. Light came through the numerous human-shaped holes in the walls and floors; it seemed that Vortigern really didn&#39;t want to bother with any doors or stairs as he made his way through the building...

Or any other building on the street for that matter, judging by the similarly shaped holes puncturing their walls. A walking disaster. 

A Berserker. They were most likely dealing with a Berserker.

Koji released his birds, returning his vision to normal.

&#39;They aren&#39;t here,&#39; he informed Scylla. &#39;Either Vortigern is a stray, or his Master deliberately set him loose in the middle of the city and hoped for the best.&#39;

But what kind of lunatic would do that? S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames weren&#39;t easy to come by; were they <em>that</em> confident in their Servant&#39;s strength and trusted that he&#39;d never lose?

How strong was a Berserker class Servant, anyway?

For a moment, Koji dropped his gaze to the enraged Servant. He wasn&#39;t familiar with Vortigern&#39;s legend, but he knew a thing or two about his Class. Mad Enhancement. A skill that traded a Servant&#39;s sanity for powers that stretched beyond their normal capacity. It would explain his infantile speech patterns, and how he was able to parry Octavius, who appeared to be a Saber, without breaking a sweat. 

But was that all there was to him?

Icy dread crept down Koji&#39;s spine. The more he watched Vortigern&#39;s movements, the more that feeling intensified. The uncanny ways Vortigern manipulated his limbs and twisted his torso, crawling, kicking, and slithering like some cursed thing. His movements were more haunting than righteous, his appearance more ghoulish than noble, even with the royal garments adorning his body.

Scylla scowled, glancing back down as Vortigern and Octavius continued their duel, shining swords clashing against one another, a delicate dance of life and death playing before her eyes.

But she tore her eyes away, back towards the ceiling. To smash through the ceiling would take much more exertion than a simple wall. And, she did not have the luxury of simply swimming upwards. A significant expenditure of magical energy, but, still lesser than what she would waste in a futile fight.

<strong>&quot;Fine.&quot;</strong>

So, she began to dig. Tendrils lashing out, piercing into the ceiling, tearing chunks of metal and stone out of it. It was like a drill, gouging a hole up towards the ground floor, a small opening at first, barely more than a crack, but growing larger and larger with every strike. Before long, it had grown into a chasm within the structure of the room, large enough for Koji to comfortably fit through, and for Scylla to snugly fit through. It had taken a lot of magical energy, they could escape-

<em>Scylla, stop.</em>

She could feel her eyes widen as Koji spoke, as though he stomach was becoming a sinking ship. Soon after, the command that she had feared most followed - Destroy the enemy, exterminate that &quot;Vortigern&quot;.

<strong>&quot;...That is not fine. That is a stupid request.&quot;</strong> Scylla spoke bluntly, glaring daggers down at her master. <strong>&quot;But, fine. I shall grant it.&quot;</strong>

The tendrils stretched outwards, hoisting the master upwards and placing him up on the ground floor. At the same time, they loosed their grip on the ceiling, allowing Rider to drop down and land on the floor once more. The situation was grim. She was in a rough state, and no doubt, she would die if she were to err. She had to fight intelligently, or else she&#39;d be carved up within that whirlwind of swords.</span>

Her flurry of pre-existing tendrils surged forth like spears, all of them aiming to pierce Vortigern in the vestigial &quot;wings&quot; from the back of his body. They were large, wide, but also worthless, indefensible. It was like the fleshy underbelly of a whale, the blubbery fat of a seal. 

In other words, the perfect point to attack.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Paying no mind to the world around him, Vortigern focused on his current assault. Octavius gradually felt overpowered with each passing second, knowing that if they stood at a standstill, it was obvious that the Berserker would eventually overpower him. Realizing this, they made a swift maneuver with their sword, pivoting it upward before slamming it down, trapping both of Vortigern&#39;s swords on the ground while simultaneously trapping Auram Pax as well.

That was fine, since he raised one his fists and proceeded to punch Vortigern right in the face.

The beast scowled as Octavius continued his flurry of punches. While he could tell that he was dealing damage based on the blood on his gauntlets, it felt like he was punching a brick wall. By the time he delivered the seventh punch, his training dummy had enough.

<strong>&quot;GUOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> Vortigern growled, pulling his head back as Octavius&#39; next punch missed. The Berserker then proceeded to headbutt Octavius&#39; fist with unprecedented fury, the Saber gritting their teeth as they felt the knuckles in their fist crack.

While Octavius was distracted by the pain, Vortigern took advantage of the situation and stared back to his flaming sword. While Auram Pax was keeping it down, it would be na&#239;ve to say that he was fully trapped.

<em>crackcrackcrackcrack</em>

In a swift motion, he started spin his wrists that were currently holding his swords. He did so with such speed that both Dante and Octavius could audibly hear the sound of his carpal bones cracking.

He spun so much that eventually his swords started spinning as well, as if he had transferred his momentum over to them. The flaming sword was now more akin to a flaming sawblade as it started to gradually grind Octavius&#39; sword with its repeated turning. Eventually, it could no longer hold it down, as Vortigern exerted his full strength and raised both of his rotating swords at once, causing Auram Pax to be flicked upward from the momentum.

<em>CRASH!</em></span>

Octavius could only stare in disbelief as he watched his prized sword hang from the ceiling, embedded on a wall. Even worse, he was now completely exposed to Vortigern&#39;s next attack. The tyrant raised his swords and attempted to finish him off in one blow, until-

&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; Vortigern cried out in pain, feeling several tendrils stab him in the back. Octavius noticed blood spurt on the ground as the spears emerged from Vortigern&#39;s chest, ample time for him to get out of the way. 

It wasn&#39;t as if Vortigern was still focused on him, after all.

&quot;Smell....Like fish.&quot; He snarled, gripping one of the tendrils before squashing it with his bare hands. Scylla felt a tingle in her nerves as he started doing the same for the rest, moving his arms in impossible positions as his swords started chopping down her spears in an orderly fashion.

Vortigern&#39;s wings spread out, blood dripping from them as he turned around and glared at Scylla.

He then hopped, spinning his body in mid air as his head now faced the ground while his feet faced the roof.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> He screamed, reaching the ceiling as his feet bounced off it like a pinball, aiming to use the added momentum to crash right into Scylla. The fact that he had used the ceiling as a spring pad of sorts caused much unneeded pressure to the laboratory&#39;s surface. The opening that Scylla has created was now being blocked by dust and rubble, trapping them even further inside. It was large enough for Koji to communicate with his birds and perhaps even sneak some inside, but not large enough for a human or Servant to leave. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Roman Artoria</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If glares could kill, Koji would have been perforated a thousand times over. Perhaps it would&#39;ve been easier that way. At least the chance of suffering would be minuscule compared to the thrashing of a raging Berserker.

But the look on Koji&#39;s face told Scylla that he had insisted on staying. Had she insisted otherwise, he would stay behind and deal with Vortigern himself. And that was a problem, because he was Scylla&#39;s meal ticket, and her fate was inevitably tied to his.

There was no arguing with his decisions when he got stubborn like this.

Koji pulled himself up, which was no small feat considering how much the building was shaking from the fight underground. Scylla had pushed him onto the upper floor through the hole she had carved, but as the fight below him continued, the hole only grew larger as more of the floor collapsed into the room below. It was only a matter of time before the entire morgue caved in.

Koji walked a wide path around the hole as he observed the fight from above. Vortigern&#39;s movements were erratic and his strength was overwhelming, but there was no tactics to speak of. One moment it was Octavius and his sword, the next it was Scylla and her tentacles. Berserker pounced on every person he saw and responded to every little stimulus he received.

It was like watching a dog chase its own tail. Over and over again, never learning his lesson. 

It was a weakness he could exploit.

Wedging his cane into a small fissure in the floor, Koji started feeding blood into his cane and let it grow. Vines crawled from the ground floor into the basement, spreading themselves along the walls, anchoring themselves there, spinning a new sort of web. 

In mere moments, a massive binding of vines sealed the doors and cut off Dante&#39;s escape.

But as you can see, my Servant is wounded. Promise me that you will shield her from danger and ensure her survival, and I will let your Master leave.&#39; 

As he spoke, more vines slithered along the floor and chased after Dante, threatening to wrap themselves around his ankle and bind him in place. He was planning to take Dante hostage and force the Roman emperor to become Scylla&#39;s meatshield!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When the Emperor&#39;s sword launched into the ceiling, Octavius gave an audible &quot;Shit&quot; as he brought his arms up to block the next attack from the swords, knowing full well that it was mostly in vain. He was prepared to be returned to nothingness, but when it never came, his thoughts and regrets were wiped away as he saw more of Vortigern&#39;s blood spill across the ground and the spears protruding from his chest. Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, Octavius jumped backward, out of reach of the mad beast. Octavius&#39;s right hand ached from his punches and Vortigern&#39;s headbutt, shaking his hand as he could feel the damage done to his hand. Unless he wanted to injure his hand more, he would need to be more careful with both his strikes and how he blocked hits. Certainly, Octavius could fight through the pain, but he didn&#39;t need to destroy his hand to defeat the enemy, especially since that enemy was both taking their assaults like it was nothing and unfazed by fighting two servants. With the bastard&#39;s attention on Scylla however, Octavius could likely grab Dante and leave, two birds with one stone, the native inhabitants could deal with this dispute themselves and- 

His thoughts of escape were dashed when he looked to Dante and saw that he was now made a hostage by the other doctor. Fantastic, he was being blackmailed into this now. It would take too long to cut Dante out while that mad man was raging about. He would have to play along for the moment irritatingly enough. Although his new &#39;ally&#39; was significantly more injured than he from the offset, that meant that if he played his cards correctly, at the end of this scuffle then there was a good chance that they could turn the tide of negotiations. While Saber did believe that they could take the mad man, the fact that he now had to protect that Rider as well meant that there was more chance for injury for himself. There was nothing else he could do then, fight until victory.

We&#39;ll work together, but if you touch one hair on my Imperator&#39;s head I&#39;ll destroy you!&quot; He called out his threat as he jumped to the ceiling, turning and planting his boots into the roof next to Auram Pax as he pulled out the sword from the ceiling and launched himself to Scylla&#39;s aid, albeit slightly reluctantly as he lands with a crash next to the Rider, swinging Auram Pax towards Vortigern&#39;s head in retaliation of his attack against Scylla, although his swings had less power behind them as his right hand was holding his sword a little more loose than usual to compensate with his hand injury. The attack was both a gauge on how reactive the mad man was and how durable he was or at the very least an attempt to make space between Vortigern and him and Rider. 

While the emperor didn&#39;t like the arrangement to be forced to work together with the Rider, it was better than fighting Vortigern by himself though.</span>

Such a decisive series of strikes were rewarded with a spray of sanguine from the body of this feral servant, but Scylla was none too pleased by it. Even if she was in the mood for a hunt, she wasn&#39;t so desperate that she&#39;d lower herself to feasting on the fetid flesh of this grotesque husk.

Worse than that was the knowledge of what came next. That little Emperor had proved himself thoroughly ineffective, while her own assault had dealt a significant blow. That meant that the attention would shift, away from Saber, and towards--

--The sharp pain of having her tentacles sliced to pieces interrupted that thought, causing her to flinch. In a matter of moments, all of those living weapons were reduced to naught. But, it was no great source of pain. She&#39;d already been dealing with much more intensive bleeding for hours prior.

Vortigern lurched forward, bouncing off the ceiling to simultaneously remove her means of retreat, and bolster his own rush. But, that was the key, wasn&#39;t it? He&#39;d dedicated himself wholly to his forward momentum. He could not turn away easily, not anymore.

With a howl of exertion, Scylla raised up her leg, proceeding to bring it down as Vortigern&#39;s momentum carried them underneath her heel. It was hardly her strongest axe kick, likely not even enough to end the fight with one blow. Pitifully weak in comparison to herself the day prior, but even then, it was still a powerful blow.

It was time to see how strong this mad fool truly was.</span>

He went and put a hand towards it, ignorant of what it could do, but when he saw he could only push through it and still not be free, he retracted it. This. . . This was the working of the someone else, it couldn’t have been vortigern. And to think that the woman—Octopus(?) could use such a thing wasnt exactly something he thought would be possible. So it had to be the doctor. The islander. And this rhetorics were confirmed by the shrewd ‘negotiation’ he had gone about. Fight with him? He had trapped him here!

He didn’t have a damn thought of how his servant would die, if it meant he and Octavius would be safe, he’d take it.  And to lock him inside such a cage wouldnt help him at all. Dante turned around and saw how brutal the scene had gone before him was, how the beast had so easily diced at the woman’s appendages and how Saber had to compromise for his safety. He would end this damn doctor, he just had to wait. He was becoming annoyed with how little the others had began to think of him, how little they thought of others. If it were to him, he’d had left them to be brutally slaughtered in their tracks, their existences erased from such a place. A death in the home of the dead, something poetic and just. And truly, something within him seethed that he wouldn’t allow it. For now, he’d have to death with the idea of Vortigern needing both.

“Ill need you to release that!”

Vortigern was just a millisecond away from colliding with Scylla, until Octavius returned to the fight with his sword in tow. He had been forced into a difficult situation, having no choice but to defeat the Berserker if he planned on saving his Master.

He had attempted to strike at Vortigern&#39;s head with his blade, which would normally result in a clean cut, but the beast was far smarter than it looked. It immediately raised its other sword, the purple one, and parried his blow with ease. However, Octavius did succeed in stopping the Berserker from harming Scylla, along with blocking one of his opponent&#39;s swords.

Dante took full advantage of that, tossing some of his spells as a multitude of chains emerged from his manuscripts, wrapping themselves around not only Vortigern&#39;s swords, but their hilts as well. Destroying the blades with chains alone was impossible, but the wise doctor realized that he simply needed to affect Vortigern&#39;s grip on them in order to change the tide of the fight.

&quot;...Uooooh?&quot; Vortigern stared at the chains, wondering on their purpose as he realized that he couldn&#39;t move his arms as well as moments ago. He was locked in place with Octavius, and not only that...

He was completely powerless to stop Scylla&#39;s next attack.

<em>SQUASH!</em>

Everyone in the room could hear the sound of Vortigern&#39;s bones break. His blood squirting out of his left shoulder and making a pulpy mess on the floor. Scylla&#39;s axe kick had buried itself into his shoulder blade, causing blood and flesh to pool out of the macabre figure. It started to boil as it fell on his flaming sword, causing steam to fill the room.

For a moment, everything remained still. The only sound that could be heard was Vortigern&#39;s own blood, bubbling on his blade.

Bubbling like his rage.

Scylla&#39;s bestial instincts would warn her that something wicked was afoot. They were screaming at her to run away, for she was no longer the only beast in the room.

Despite having a wounded shoulder. Despite pouring more blood than Scylla herself. <strong>Vortigern&#39;s left arm was still functioning.</strong>

She couldn&#39;t get away, for her leg had gotten stuck in his own body. He took advantage of this fact and gripped his other sword, freeing it from the chains with pure strength.

<em><strong>STAB!</strong></em>

Blood gushed from her behind as she felt excruciating pain. The scorching blade had been speared right through her chest, emerging from the other side as Koji could see his Servant be skewered like a pile of meat.

Vortigern growled, giving Rider no time to react as he launched the blade at the ceiling with Scylla in tow.

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Her back crashed on the roof, yet she did not fall down. How could she, when the blade inside of her had now stabbed the ceiling, keeping her pinned? All she could do was feel the pain of the sword&#39;s flames. These were more than just fires. No, they felt like flames designed to punish her. Light destined to destroy monsters such as her.

Octavius stared in awe, wondering how he could match such raw strength. All he knew was that Vortigern&#39;s other blade, the one he was currently clashing with, was still trapped by Dante&#39;s chains. If he could use this to his advantage...

<strong>Vortigern let go of the blade.</strong>

Then, he slammed down on its hilt with overwhelming force, causing it to spin around Auram Pax like a rotating fan!

<em>clangclangclangclangclangclang</em>

It twirled around his blade, clashing repeatedly, but that wasn&#39;t the full extent of its power. Come to think of it, Octavius had yet to notice anything particularly unique about the purple blade.

Until now.</span>

Dante would be shook as he noticed his chains be wrapped around the blade with ease. Their Christian texts were overwritten, corrupted in some unreadable language as they turned from gold to a vile purple. Instead of restricting Vortigern, they now focused on wrapping themselves around Octavius, limiting his movements and focusing on Auram Pax&#39;s hilt.

<em>The same order that Dante had given them.</em>

Vortigern then stared at the ceiling, jumping back to Scylla as he landed right on top of her, his feet treading on her mutilated body.

<strong>&quot;MINE!&quot;</strong> He shouted, gripping at his sword&#39;s hilt as he extracted it from the ceiling, causing Scylla to follow as well. He then bounced off the walls, flying towards Octavius while the man was still occupied with the spinning sword and Dante&#39;s own chains.

<strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong> Vortigern screamed, raising his blade as he attempted to plunge both Scylla and his flaming sword into Octavius&#39; cranium. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Roman Artoria</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Octavius winced at every single strike the purple sword made against Auram Pax as his hand and forearm felt every single one of those strikes reverberate throughout Roman&#39;s left side. It was disorienting, but Saber soon steeled himself as he heard another of the Berkerker&#39;s roars, looking up to see the mad creature soaring straight towards him, the blade pointed towards his skull. There wasn&#39;t much that Octavius could do. He was trapped at the moment due to his master&#39;s overturned chains and that damn bastard&#39;s spinning sword making sure that he felt as though he was defending against rapid heavy strikes over and over again. As the creature came down, the Roman paused as he looked up at Vortigern. Was it fear? Was it resignation? Was it pity? No, the look in Octavius&#39;s eyes was pure determination as his will remained unwavering despite his approaching demise. Octavius would face the creature head-on! Even when backed into a corner with death approaching, Octavius felt his brave and confident face as his body seemed to glow, fire licking out from his armor, his red hair flowing light a wildfire, and with the brightest difference being Auram Pax being coated in a thin layer of flame. Everyone else in the room could see that Octavius was rapidly gaining power, it seemed that being pushed was the catalyst of this newfound strength!</span>

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare underestimate me!&quot; Octavius bellowed as he once again grasped Auram Pax with new vigor, and although he could now feel the bones in his left hand cracking from the stress of taking the repeated recoil from the purple blade, Octavius pushed through the pain. And as though there was no obstruction, the Roman Emperor destroyed the chains binding his arm and Auram Pax, swinging the blade, meeting the purple blade head-on and lending it careening across the room from the impact as Octavius swung the sword like a haymaker towards Vortigern. The only downside to this counterattack was that Octavius wouldn&#39;t be able to properly block the red blade, so two both ensure that his boosted attack would land, and to lessen the damage, Octavius reached out, grabbing the sword itself and pushing its trajectory, however minuscule, burning through his gauntlet and his hand in the process. With that minor movement change, Octavius changed the trajectory of the hit from his head to his right shoulder, impaling it, but allowing the enhanced Auram Pax to sink into Vortigern&#39;s upper left side.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thanks to the meddling of Octavius and Dante, Vortigern was forced to cancel his attack towards her. The swing of Aurum Pax was parried by the one of the profane blades, only to then be fully ensnared by the many chains. It was not a permanent solution, especially not against such a savage foe, but it did not need to be. Her heel smashing into his shoulder made sure of that.

His fetid corpse of a body was wrecked by the kick, flesh and bone alike mangled by her foot. Not enough to kill, but enough to cripple them long enough that their death was assured. Against a normal foe, this surely would have been their untimely end. But, as her master had told her, this was no normal foe.

And now, it was his turn to attack.

As he freed the burning red blade, Scylla was afforded little time to react. Removed from the ocean she called home, she was a literal fish out of water, her movement slowed. She had neither the time nor the means to dodge. Which meant--

<em><strong>HURTShurtshurtshurtshurtshurtshurts! HURTSHUHRTSHURTS!!!</strong></em> Her nerves screamed in pain, as did Scylla as she was pinned to the ceiling. The guttural shriek echoed throughout the crumbling morgue, bouncing off the metal walls of the sealed chamber. She could feel the burning spread through her insides, as though she was being cremated from the inside out. It was unbearable, intolerable.

Body and mind alike were frantic, seeking some manner of advantage she could use to turn the tides. But she would not find it. Not before Vortigern returned, retrieving his blade, and dragging her along with it. 

Running out of magical energy, grievously wounded, and currently impaled. In this state, she was useless, and that <em>infuriated</em> her. Was this all she was to be in this battle? A maiden, rescued from the mad king by the noble hero? A prisoner to her fate?

No, surely not! She just needed a switch of tactic. If Vortigern was to be the monster, then <em>she</em> would just become the hero.

So... what would Herakles do?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB!</strong> Vortigern would feel the weight of his blade shift, away from the point and towards the hilt. An arm gripped his wrist, as Scylla pulled herself forward, further down the blade as it shredded her insides. Did it hurt? Absolutely. It was torture, no different than Prometheus having his liver devoured by eagles, or Perilaus being burnt alive in the brazen bull. But, so what? She had already suffered a defeat ten thousand times worse than this pain could even be, a death more ignoble than any that this wretch could provide. Compared to the suffering of that spiked club, this sword of supposed punishment was nothing!

Further, further, further down. Past the crossguard, past the handle, past his hand, until she had threaded herself onto his forearm. From there, her hands moved, one gripping Vortigern by the throat, as the other reared back.

<em><strong>CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH.</strong></em> A series of blows rained down upon the head of the mad king, her fist smashing against his visage over and over and over. She could even feel her fingers ache from the pressure of her punches, such was the force that she put into them. But, that did not matter. All that she needed to do was kill him before she killed her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji stared at Dante questioningly, as if he had just uttered something insane. &#39;And I should care for you - <em>why</em>, exactly?&#39; He asked, making no effort to help, as the younger doctor had requested. &#39;I don&#39;t even know you.&#39;

He turned towards Octavius. &#39;That will depend on your performance, Roman, and you aren&#39;t doing a very good job at it!&#39; 

He refused to cut Octavius any slack even as he rejoined the foray. It mattered not whether the Roman had done so out reluctance. With death looming behind Vortigern&#39;s every strike, where the slightest slip-up could have fatal results, Saber had no choice but to give it his all. 

But even that was not enough. Perhaps such was the difference between a thinking, intelligent being and a mindless beast. Scylla and Octavius were aware of their own mortality, but Vortigern was not, and thus, its actions could not be predicted by common sense. The more it was injured, the more it went into a frenzy, and the less it appeared human. 

It all started with a cleaved shoulder. 

Koji watched in disbelief as Vortigern&#39;s arm, which was barely hanging onto its shoulder, moved as if it had a life of its own. With a grand display of brute strength, Berserker used the chains produced by the younger doctor against his own Servant while simultaneously impaling Scylla with its flaming blade. 

Koji shot Dante a piercing look.

&#39;Is this your idea of helping?&#39; He accused the young doctor. &#39;Fuel the enemy with your magecraft? What change are you looking to accomplish in the face of such thoughtless, ignorant conviction? If you die down there today, it will not be by <em>my</em> hand.&#39; 

It would, however, take the issue off his hands. He wasn&#39;t about to sympathize with an outsider, after all.

The fight was turning into a messy, all-out brawl, with blades twirling, limbs swinging, and there was blood and gore flying everywhere. It got to the point that Koji could barely make out which limb belonged to whom, and the lack of clear visuals irked him. How was he to know that Octavius hadn&#39;t gone back on his word and stabbed Scylla in the back? 

Frowning, Koji signaled the sparrows currently surveying the hospital.

<em>&#39;Chirp, chirp!&#39;</em>

A small flock of birds gathered around him, before plunging down into the morgue through the collapsed floor. They took up post around Dante and the Servants, despite the danger of getting hit by a stray blade or one of the young doctor&#39;s chains.

Oblivious to death. Untouched by death. These brave little soldiers were to be Koji&#39;s eyes, allowing him to observe the fight from his vantage point.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vortigern&#39;s landing was imminent. His flaming blade was poised to take Octavius&#39; head, but the Roman Emperor had other plans. With newfound determination, he broke out of Dante&#39;s corrupted chains and unleashed the full strength of Auram Pax. He sent the purple blade flying, freeing himself of his shackles as he now faced the mad king head on.

Blocking the blade was possible, but it would have left him at a standstill, unable to attack. That was not the path to victory. No, the path of an emperor, just like the one he had walked in life, required him to take <strong>risks.</strong> He put it all in a single counterattack.

He intercepted Vortigern&#39;s sword with his half broken hand, enduring the pain of having his own palm be scorched by the malignant flames. With a strong grip, he twisted its trajectory, causing it to stab Octavius&#39; shoulder instead.

Blood poured out of his mouth as he felt the excruciating pain of flames burning within him, but he couldn&#39;t help but smile in the face of such adversity. After all, stabbing Octavius meant that good old Vort was a sitting duck! He was quick to stab at the king with Auram Pax, next to the wound that Scylla had caused.

&quot;Uoooooooh!&quot; Vortigern screamed in pain, blood spurting out of his body as it bathed both Octavius and Scylla. The latter took advantage of the monster&#39;s panic, burying herself deeper within Vortigern&#39;s sword until she could reach the man himself and grasp at his neck.

<strong>CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH</strong>

A repetitive melody filled Koji and Dante&#39;s ears as they witnessed Scylla going to down on the mad king&#39;s visage. If the creature had a face, it was most likely long gone by now. Demolished in a flurry of punches that were enough to silence the beast.</span>

&quot;UOOO-OOOOOH-OOOOOH!&quot; He screamed with each punch, but it did not stop Scylla. Even a monster had its limits and Vortigern was soon to reach his. With the injuries to his left shoulder and the profound wound that Octavius had inflicted on him, it would be a miracle if he survived the encounter.

Indeed, his mind was in a dazed state, barely capable of perceiving the events around him. His hand went limp as he dropped the flaming sword, letting it rest inside of Octavius&#39; body while Scylla continued her assault. His body felt weightless as he could feel ascending to a higher plane.

Until he saw it. He saw what he was so desperately looking for. It was hidden in the corner of his eye.

A lone bird flying around the area, scouting the fight ahead and reporting back to its head. It flew upward, reaching its Master. Naoharu Koji.

Scylla&#39;s spine froze as she sensed a malignant glare in Vortigern&#39;s eyes. His muscles tensed as the pain went numb.

<em><strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em>

He screamed, breaking Octavius and Scylla&#39;s eardrums. His face was smashed, his body was pouring blood and his left arm was close to giving away.

That wouldn&#39;t stop him.

Another scream followed suit as Vortigern jumped, dragging Scylla, Octavius and the flaming sword with him as they all collided with the ceiling. The two Servants, despite their differences, shared the same pain as the thick marble roof crashed onto their heads and shoulders.

Not even Vortigern was exempt from this. But it was nothing. Nothing compared to the pain he would feel if he failed his mission. He shrugged it off as he cracked his neck, grabbing Scylla with one arm and Octavius with the other as he smashed their faces together, creating an awkward kiss before sending them plummeting towards the ground.</span>

It wasn&#39;t enough to kill them, no, but it was enough to keep them out of his business for a bit. The flaming sword left Octavius&#39; body, having been shook by the impact with the ceiling. Vortigern grabbed it, before walking a few steps backward and grabbing back his purple one.

He then stared at his true target: Koji.

&quot;Birds...Just like hers.&quot; Vortigern grumbled, his body shaking in a mixture of rage and delight. &quot;He told me...The birds would lead me...&quot;

Koji watched Vortigern take a few more steps. Each step leaving behind a cracked footprint.

&quot;Lead me to <em>her</em>....Lead me to...<strong>ROWENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong>&quot;

Vortigern flew, his wings opening up as he headed for Koji himself. He cared not for the rubble around him, nor for the fact that his injuries were still open. Blood kept dropping from his pallid body as he was now just a few feet away from reaching the doctor.

<em>rrrrrrip</em>

His speed decreased. His jump was stopped as he was now stumbling in mid-air and about to fall. He turned behind him to see what had happened.

One of his robes had gotten stuck on a pile of rubble, tangling him as a result.

<em><strong>&quot;UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot;</strong></em> He groaned in frustration, raising his arm as he proceeded to toss his purple sword towards Koji instead. He then fell, finally collapsing on the floor in a puddle of his own blood. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Roman Artoria</span></span>

<em>The brutality the creature showed the both of the servants was a spectacle he couldn’t take his eyes from, a bloody one, but one that couldn’t be averted.

Eventually, the battle had gone to a decisive end, or one that could be shown by how much the beast had staggered, how much he faltered through his stances. It was known he wouldn’t win, that with both the servants, Vortigern wouldn’t have been able to defeat both. Maybe the woman, but she was lucky enough to have Octavius fight her battles with her than be alone.</em>

<em>Koji’s words annoyed the doctor more and more, his words a gas that only helped fuel the burning anger that had been struck in Dante. He hadn’t done much, and yet he accused him of helping the enemy? Dante could feel something come from him, his tongue ready to sling whatever insult he could find, when he noticed the final move from Vortigern, his final attempt at fighting. His blade aimed at Koji so quickly, and while both his servant and Gaius had gone about their own battle, Dante simply watched.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This was the worst pain that Octavius has ever felt in his life. That burning blade made sure that he couldn&#39;t feel his right arm anymore, getting slammed against a ceiling and that Rider did wonders for his body. And landing on that cracked ground further brought joy to Octavius&#39;s entire being. Octavius&#39;s right arm was covered in his blood, he has blood running from his head as well and he had more blood coming from a few places within his armor that had been cracked or outright destroyed during the skirmish. At first, he just laid there as the fire vanished as quickly as it appeared as most fires do. He didn&#39;t want to get up and fight that servant more, that hardy son of a bitch ruined his plan of being fit to fight after this was over so that he could hold leverage over those Islanders, but now he had lost the use of his arm and his left arm was also damaged from the earlier barrage of attacks from the purple blade. And now he generally felt like how Carthage looked after Scipio was done with it. Of course, if he used his Noble Phantasm, this would be a non-issue, but that would put the enemy in that same radius. Those thoughts aside, which would come later, Saber heard that last roar from Vortigern and used his one good arm to propel himself from the ground into a standing position, leaning down and grabbing Auram Pax once again, expecting another assault from the beast... Only to see it collapse, throwing its blade at the other doctor.  On one hand, Octavius could full well let that blade fly and let that Islander take that to the chin, or his servant could protect him. He didn&#39;t need to intervene, although his master was also standing right there, with a cool look of apathy that unsettled Octavius a little. That was a new emotion that he hadn&#39;t seen on Dante before.</span>

Either way, it was clear that he could let that sword fly, he had some chivalry in his body after all. Since he didn&#39;t make any moves to harm Dante, he was worth the effort to protect, at least for information later and he didn&#39;t want to deal with a hell-bent octopus lady if he died. With that last thought in mind, Octavius flipped Auram Pax up, grabbing the tip of the blade like a throwing knife and launching it and intercepting the sword mid-air, changing the trajectory of the blade just enough that it would fly centimeters past Koji&#39;s skull and Auram Pax landing harmlessly next to the two Doctors. As well if Koji knew anything about Roman history, he could probably notice that the sword looked very similar to a certain other Caesar&#39;s sword of a similar name. The collision of the two blades sent one last ring throughout the wreckage of the building as the fight seemed to be over with.

&quot;Could have gone worse all things considered.&quot; He quipped as he sat back down on the ground.</span>

It was as the smithy god Hephaestus, his hammer clattering against the anvil as it forged his tools of war, such was the force being used. Though it paled in comparison to the Nine Lives of Herakles, it was nevertheless a fearful display.

In this state, his shoulder maimed and his skull thoroughly beaten into a pulp, Vortigern was <em>still alive</em>. In fact, upon seeing the observing bird, Scylla could sense a spark within his faceless face. Like a rabid dog that had just spotted a kitten. The nature of the hunt had just changed.

Before she had a chance to react, she was suddenly caught within the rotting husk&#39;s grapple, dragged through the roof and then smashed into Octavius. Considering how he was armoured, and she was not... It was much more unpleasant for her than it was for him.

She fell down to the floor, dazed by having her brain bounced about her skull, just barely conscious enough to recognise Vortigern&#39;s mad dash towards her master. She gave chase as best she could, but in the end, it would be the Roman that saved Koji from an early death, deflecting the thrown blade with his own.

Funny, how fate weaved itself, how enemies could become friends in the blink of an eye. But Scylla did not focus on that. She was focused solely on ending this, here and now.

<strong>&quot;GRAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot;</strong>

As the king lay in a heap, Scylla lurched forth, grabbing him from the back, and using the remainder of the energy she could muster to snap backwards. In a single fluid motion, Vortigern was dragged up in the air, before descending down on his mauled head, suplex slammed onto the concrete.

With any luck, he would stay down.</span>

<em>CLANG!</em>

Alas, it was not meant to be. Octavius intercepted the blow with his own sword, causing the purple blade to miss Koji by a hair&#39;s breadth as it impaled a wall instead.

Vortigern groaned in misery, bathed in his own blood as he prepared to stand agai-

<em><strong>SMASH!</strong></em>

He felt his bones break as Scylla violently assaulted him from behind, culminating in a suplex that should have floored any foe, especially one as injured as Vortigern.

Indeed, he lied immobile for a few seconds. Enough time for Scylla and Octavius to relax for a bit.

But Koji knew better. A corpse should not be left alone. Not until you were absolutely sure it was dead.

Before he could scream and warn Scylla, Vortigern already cracked the ground around him, rising up from sheer rage alone. His arm dangled like a piece of fruit as it looked ripe enough to fall.

Scylla and Octavius immediately prepared for combat. Just how much abuse could this beast take? They finally thought that they had made progress, only to see their efforts be for naught.

Vortigern raised his flaming sword. He gave them all a vicious glare. And then-

And then he simply ran past Scylla. Ran past Auram Pax. Jumped over Koji himself as he gave the man one last glare, landing a dozen or so feet away from him.

&quot;That smell...Not hers.&quot; Vortigern grumbled, extracting his purple sword from the wall as he seemed visibly pissed.

&quot;Not...<strong>HERE! UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!</strong>&quot; He screamed as he jumped once again, crashing through the ceiling as more dust and rubble filled the premises.

Eventually, the howling stopped. The morgue went quiet. As it should be.

Vortigern was long gone. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="nimbus#4116">@nimbus</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@RaptorAttacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Draco#5000">@Draco, Roman Artoria</span></span>

He tensed, staggered back, but Vortigern was upon him in an instant, screaming hysterically about his birds and someone named Rowena as it hurled its glowing blade towards him.

<em>Rowena?</em>

The name did not ring a bell. Rather, his mind was filled with useless noise as hosts of negative thoughts clamored for attention. What a cruel joke, to die at the hand of a pale imitation of his experiments, before he could fulfill his promise-

<em>CLANG!</em>

Saber had kept his end of the bargain and more, choosing to give up his weapon to save the enemy Master. Vortigern&#39;s blade careened off course as it was knocked away by Octavius&#39; own sword. It missed Koji&#39;s head by mere inches, close enough for him to feel a slight breeze as it soared past him and embedded itself into a wall.

Koji fell to the ground, stunned. He heard the clattering of steel as Auram Pax landed harmlessly on the floor a few feet away, but his attention was all but snatched by the beast caught in its own robes, clawing and gnawing at its clothes as it struggled, weaponless, to break free. 

But that moment of distraction had turned it from the hunter to the hunted. The excitement of the chase turned to dread as Scylla ambushed Vortigern from behind, putting a decisive end to the monster as she crushed its skull in one mighty suplex.

And that was the end. Vortigern was no more.

...Or was it?

The sight of Vortigern&#39;s death had struck a nerve. It was way too familiar. He&#39;d seen it hundreds, thousands of times, on his kitchen table, out in the fields, on the operating table at the labs. He&#39;d seen countless birds, mutilated beyond recognition, pull themselves back together like puzzle pieces falling into place before flying off, looking as good as new.

Vortigern&#39;s corpse moved.

In mere moments, the maddened king had risen from the ground, eyes burning with rage. But then it did the unthinkable.

It <em>spoke</em>.

No screaming. No gibberish. For a moment, it grumbled with a surprising amount of lucidity and restraint-

But then the moment passed. Vortigern regressed to its primitive state, screaming once more in its garbled voice as it made a quick escape through the ceiling. 

The violent storm was gone. It had vanished as quickly as it came, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake.

Oh, and two wounded Servants, on top of two shaken Masters.

What was the meaning of all this?

...

<em>&#39;Chirp!&#39;</em>

A series of chirping broke the silence. A few sparrows landed on top of Scylla and Octavius, sticking to them no matter which way they turned or how far they swatted they away. The birds seemed to have been given a directive to follow the Servants, and they seemed adamant on carrying it out.

Koji took a long, deep breath. He cupped his face in his hands, carded his fingers through his hair, then ran them down the back of his neck. There was a long silence as he tried to come to terms with what he had just witnessed, but his mind was blank save for a single, troubling thought.

&#39;...who the fuck is Rowena?&#39; 

<em>And what, pray tell, did he have anything to do with this name?</em></span>

Had he simply stayed put, it would have been an easy way to go about dealing with the islander, Dante gave a sigh, watching as the sword clanged with Auram Pax, missing the poor doctor by a hair. Sigh, I guess that just meant that it wasnt time. Not much he could do about it.</em>

<em>Vortigern had a job and yet part of Dante was slightly disappointed that it had failed so easily. . . It was odd though, to have gone down in such a brief struggle, it wasn’t enough to even be relished in. Or well, to watch. But, Dante had spoken too soon, for as when he finished his thought, the beast got up once again, his rage the first thing that shook the very foundation of the morgue around them, the walls mirroring with his rumbling footsteps. When he picked his blade up once again, a small smile tugged at the parts of Dante’s soul. He’d continue, and he’d continue when he hoped Octavius would be too tired, he’d fight Koji once again. . . And yet, that never came.</em>

<em>The beast’s few coherent words were a disappointing glare, who was this her? Again he asked himself that, again he’d replay that he’d tried to find this her, and again he’d be stuck at the idea that Koji trapped him there against his will. All of it a vicious cycle that only made his blood boil more. That damn doctor. He was the root of it, no? Berserker’s flooded his thoughts, like a tsunami, he lost his current idea of interrogating, and soon, came back to the beast’s attention, only to see he would jump and leave, as quickly as a storm passing by. Soon, Vortigern’s presence was gone.</em>

<em>Dante’s voice was grim, almost unamused, mirroring Koji’s once annoyed voice before. He didn’t even bother to look at him, but rather he looked simply at the pool of blood that stained the once beautiful white tile, now ruined with debris and crimson fluid. No, he was right, Koji had to have been the root of all of it.</em></span>

Until Vortigern just left. He turned, rushed last Koji, and left. Sure when the berserker rushed towards the birdman Octavius flinched as he thought that his plan of saving that damn islander would net a positive undertone for the next phase of cooperation, but if he died, Octavius would lose sleep over spilled milk and be almost disappointed when he didn&#39;t take Koji&#39;s head from his shoulders. When the creature finally left, the Roman then looked up to his master, surrounded by vines. He then glanced at Scylla and Koji and finally, he looked at his injuries and also felt them. His right arm was completely limp, he knew that he cracked a few ribs from the constant slamming. His left arm had a few fractures as well. He could hear Dante&#39;s threats loud and clear and while he was impressed that his Imperator had seemingly grown a spine a lot of confidence, it was a little late for posturing. Octavius was in no shape to fight that Rider. From what he witnessed during the fight, she fought like a beast from myth or some starved lion in the coliseum. The fact as well that she fought on despite her injuries and prior injuries made Octavius understand that if they ever went to blows attrition would not be in his side. While it was she that she was more damaged than he was, the Saber having lost the use of one of his arms and his other one being damaged meant that his attack potency would be minimized. He was glad he still had use of his legs, at least he had his speed if need be. Now was the time for tact and careful words and considerations. It was time to return to diplomacy. Octavius crouched slightly as he then immediately afterward jumped up from his place over to Dante. With his available arm, the Caesar ripped apart and tore away the vines until he got to his sword before picking that up and began cutting away the weeds. After he was done he stood next to Dante, twirling Auram Pax and letting it rest on his shoulder before looking from Dante and back to Koji.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nirvana held many secrets. Secrets held by its citizens. Secrets native to its land. In fact, if there were ever a place to be considered otherworldly, Nirvana would be it. Away from the prying eyes of the world, the city had developed independently of outside influences, floating all by its lonesome in a forgotten corner of the world as it branched off into territories unknown.

Bred on the same soil, Nirvana&#39;s residents shared that same mentality, much preferring to keep to themselves instead of meddling in others&#39; business.

But that only made Vortigern&#39;s existence all the more baffling to Koji.

The resemblance between it and his experiments were too uncanny to be a mere coincidence. If almost felt as if someone had been purposefully keeping tabs on him while taking too liberal of an inspiration as they created a blatant knockoff. Then they decided it&#39;d be fun to parade this knockoff in front of him - and for what? To flaunt at him? To mock him? Whatever their agenda, this third-rate copycat had certainly wanted their ego stroked. What a surprise, eh?

Fright turned to anger, then to conviction. Koji was not amused. There was no forgiveness to anyone who dared insult his research. He would get to the bottom of this, starting with the identity of this Vortigern, then perhaps, an island-wide search for its whereabouts. He would need to visit each district in order to mobilize more birds.

&#39;Come on, Rider. We&#39;re going back to my office.&#39; Koji motioned for Scylla as he rose to his feet. &#39;I have a few names to look up...&#39;

He paused as his train of thought was interrupted by the Roman pair, who brazenly asked - no, <em>demanded</em> an explanation as they directed their ire towards him. And why shouldn&#39;t they? Koji had plunged them into danger for his sake without offering any assistance in return. Octavius had fought tooth and nail for an enemy Master, but in the end, he couldn&#39;t even get his sign back. Did Koji even remember his sign?

Koji narrowed his eyes. &#39;That beast could&#39;ve been sent by one of your so-called allies, and you, a decoy to lure me out. Is this what you meant by peaceful coexistence?&#39; He studied the Roman emperor coldly. &#39;You seem like the diplomatic type.

He was sick of him not answering the question. Due to the saber cutting the vines of blood that wrapped around his ankle, the doctor was free to move. And as such, he finally turned around, his eyes losing their warmth and replaced with a bleak and yet distasteful glaze. His once soothing cocoa eyes now reflecting a dark muddy abyss.</em>

“Your peace? Your peace ended the moment you decided to trap us in such a space with that. . . That <em>beast</em>. So do not ask about peace. I am not here to disturb your peace, much less meddle in whatever thing you have, I am here to do a job asked of me and to fulfill my own mission. And if my mission were wanting to have lured you out, I’m sure my servant would have killed you the moment he seen you, he needs not my help to do such a thing. Lest you have forgotten that your own servant looks as if they are on their last legs.”

<em>Dante’s newfound words held truth to them, a heavy and overbearing honest that could easily have been his own weapons at that. But even then, the rage that had been given birth inside him slowly died off, and he could feel that overall he was slowly growing tired. He let out a sigh, and looked away from the doctor and his servant. He didn’t want to continue wasting time on it, the sign could be gone for all he cared now, he just wanted to be away from them. But the doctor’s words did seem to raise some power over Dante too. He hadn’t met everyone who he worked with, and those he did he knew little of. And that thought made him unnerved. However, he wouldn’t let his worried plague him externally. Not now that was. He had to be alone, he yearned for it. Thirsted for it.</em>

“How are we to know it isn’t someone who chooses to go against you? From I see, you’re quite startled yourself, had it not been something you cared about, I’m sure you’d have fled. And yet you’ve stayed.”</span>

Pulled himself up like the living corpse he was, before getting dragged off by the strings that puppeteer him. All the while, screaming and screeching, before making a hasty retreat.

The timing was convenient, for Scylla was all but spent. If she were to spend even a single unit more of magical energy, then her ability to sustain her servant body would begin to falter. No, it was better this way, to have a chance to rest, to consume what mana Koji could regenerate in this moment of peace. Even better, that her opponent was either too wounded, too chivalrous, or too stupid to finish her off.

All the while, as the two doctors traded thinly veiled barbs, Rider laid in a heap, pondering. Rowena. A woman&#39;s name. The name of his master? No, surely not. If that were the case, he would surely have been weaker, the separation from his Master depriving him of that vaunted might. Then, a figure from his past? A lover, perhaps?

No, she did not know enough about that beast to speak conclusively. Better to save the questioning for later, once they had fully recovered. But, there was no doubt that Dante and Saber would let them leave so easily. Unless...

<em><strong>&quot;UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!&quot;</strong></em>

The tense game of cat and mouse was interrupted by a howl of sheer agony, one not belonging to the Berserker from moments prior. No, it was coming from Scylla! Koji would feel his artificial circuit sizzling underneath his flesh as Rider staggered to her feet. Her torso was on fire, wholly consumed by azure flames! Was this an effect of Vortigern&#39;s swords that they were yet to understand? Was the fight still going? The gathered could only watch as the fire grew brighter and brighter, so bright that it hurt to look at, and then--</span>

The wound caused by the sword, hell, even those from the earlier fight with Donald, both were entirely gone. The only sign of what had just happened was Scylla herself, keeled over and panting desperately, trying to take in as much breath as she could. What had just happened?

<strong>&quot;Enough of this prattle.&quot;</strong> Rider snarled, seemingly recovering from that earlier display as the straightened up. <strong>&quot;We are leaving. If you are so desperate for answers to your questions, go out and find them yourself... or, are the children of Aeneas just as weak as their forefathers?&quot;</strong>

Her eyes glanced over to Octavius for a moment, before snapping firmly to Koji. She grabbed the doctor by the scruff of his neck and proceeded to carry him away, out the exit to the room. But, as she reached the doorway, she stopped.

<strong>&quot;This sham of an alliance is over. If you bother us again, I will not hesitate to destroy you without question.&quot;</strong>

At that, she made her exit, with her master in tow.</span>

The servant for sure wasn&#39;t on the side of Nirvana which was clear, but it did attack Octavius first. Unless this was a loose servant from the investigators then there was something else going on. As well, he and Dante left the Canopus without speaking to another investigator and when Koji brought them up, Saber realized that there were others like them here. So unless an Investigator followed them to unleash their servant to kill Koji and his servant and they were in the crossfire or this was a third party. As he was going to bring up this retort, another scream rocked Octavius into a defensive posture, raising Auram Pax in a guard as he slips in front of Dante. Had that berserker come back? No, the Rider had appeared next to her master. The taunt did not affect Octavius this interaction had given him as many answers as questions. The Islanders weren&#39;t bloodthirsty. They weren&#39;t drones. They could be reasoned with. Carefully, but it could be possible. That was all Octavius needed to know. And so as the Islanders left, Octavius remained in thought as he turns to Dante and gives him a calm, closed-eyed smile, dematerializing his sword. 

&quot;You did great back there Dante, I&#39;m proud of you.&quot; He said as he brought his good arm up and pat Dante on the head.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A mission. Now where had he heard that before?

Last year? The year before that? Deep in the forest, where the woods were lovely, dark, and deep. Screaming. Crying. <em>Begging.</em> The scent of ozone, mixed with the pungent smell of burning flesh. 

Koji drew in a long breath. He could envision it. He could taste the moment on his tongue, feel it on his fingers. Knife poised over flesh, descending once, twice, followed by a slash. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Bodies stacked on top of one another like firewood, the same bodies that used to scream the same tired words.

Missions. Assignments. Private commissions. 

That ship had been full of visionaries. And so was the ship before that. And so were the stragglers before that. And now the third ship had docked. Carrying the same type of crowd, spouting the same type of excuse...except that they were much better armed.

It was all part of some gradual, orchestrated operation. Like invasive plants trying to take root in Nirvana&#39;s beautiful garden. If left unattended, these weeds would vine out through the rest of the garden and cause irreversible damage-

<em><strong>&#39;UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!&#39;</strong></em>

Koji&#39;s face lit up with pain, his artificial circuit burning and sizzling as vast amounts of mana flowed out of it. He whirled around, disoriented, as Scylla&#39;s torso suddenly burst into azure flames. The last sight he saw of Scylla was that of her face, fixed in terrible agony, then the flames burned so bright that it almost blinded him, before consuming Rider in entirety.

But...then the flames tapered off.

Koji opened his eyes. Scylla was still there, yet her wounds had vanished.  The flames hadn&#39;t just cauterized her wounds, but made them vanish so cleanly, so thoroughly, almost as if she hadn&#39;t been injured at all.

Was it healing? Regeneration? Time reversal? Some other type of magecraft he wasn&#39;t aware of? But more importantly, perhaps, was the question-

<em>&#39;Why didn&#39;t you do it earlier?&#39;</em>

<em>You could&#39;ve demolished Vortigern had you been properly restored!</em>

But, alas, his question would have to wait till later. Koji felt his feet leave the floor. Rider hoisted him up like a kitten, then departed from the room in huge strides. 

<em>Clack, clack, clack.</em> The staccato of her high heels echoed off the floor, growing fainter as Rider made off with her Master, leaving a whole mess of rubble and the outsiders behind...

&#39;Not that way, Rider. Take the stairs. My office is on-&#39; 

By leaving, they didn&#39;t exactly mean the <em>building</em>, did they?

It was time to get used to some troubling neighbors.</span>
