It was difficult for the Rider pair to fully untangle themselves from the chaos. It didn&#39;t help that Koji was adamant on staying at the peripherals of the battles, scouring the waters for any signs of the pink hatted Servant. He even employed his birds and surveyed the rest of the city&#39;s shoreline, but in the end, the Servant who called himself William Shakespeare did not emerge from the waves. 

As the sun well and fully slipped over the horizon, Koji&#39;s stamina waned, and everything started to ache. He felt trashier than when he&#39;d dragged his miserable ass out of bed in the morning, and the meal of toast and coffee felt like a distant memory. He was in desperate need of some proper nourishment, and what better place to go than-

A desert?

Instead of having Rider take him back to his cozy abode in the snowy mountains, Koji led her down a completely different road, until the smell of sea salt faded and the air became chilly and dry. 

The beach had seamlessly transitioned into a desert, much to Scylla&#39;s dismay. To make matters worse, Koji had decided to walk now of all times, and compared to her strides, his snail pace was prolonging her suffering in the arid landscape for just that much longer...</span>

If one were to be polite, they might say she looked like a walking, talking corpse. If not, they would say she looked like a carcass that had been butchered, draped in her own bloody flesh, and then butchered once more. It had been a brutal affair, agonising in more regards than one. All of that for a hunt without a catch...

All because of that <em><strong>damn</strong></em> Caster. William Shakespeare, who had so rudely interrupted in their exchange, solely to &quot;keep things interesting&quot;. Who did he think he was? A god, allowed to interfere with others for his own amusement? Despicable, despicable...

Ngh, hours of search, and they still hadn&#39;t found him. Worse still, she wasn&#39;t getting as much magical energy as she was before. Her master was exhausted, and she needed time to heal.

So, then...

<strong>&quot;Why are we here?&quot;</strong> Rider growled, following close behind Koji as her ambled along, like a vulture circling overtop a limping gazelle. <strong>&quot;Neither of us are in any state for such flights of fancy. You need to pass out, and I need to recuperate. So, why are you further piling fatigue upon the both of us?&quot;</strong>

The doctor would get the sense that, if he didn&#39;t provide a good answer, then he&#39;d certainly regret it.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji was silent. There was no need for Scylla to spell it out, when exhaustion was looming over the both of them like a giant shadow. Scylla looked as if she had been bled like meat at a slaughterhouse. She was toughing it out, but she still needed healing, pronto.

However, just the fact that she <em>wasn&#39;t</em> getting much healing spoke volumes of the condition her Master was in. Though Koji looked no worse for wear on the outside, the trickling amount of mana he was providing Scylla right now paled in comparison to the near endless amount she could access back on the ship. It was barely enough to maintain her current condition, let alone heal her injuries. 

Whatever he wanted to do could very well wait until he&#39;d had some proper rest. Scylla knew this. <em>He</em> knew this. But he couldn&#39;t stop. Didn&#39;t want to. A million thoughts muddled his mind, making him restless, keeping him on edge. 

He sighed wearily. &#39;We are taking a walk,&#39; he said, attempting to lighten the mood. &#39;Do you not like walks? It helps to clear the mind, if not strengthen one&#39;s physique. There&#39;s a lot more to recovery than simply passing out,&#39; he paused, wondering how to best break the truth to her. He could already feel Scylla&#39;s stare stabbing into the back of his neck, as if questioning why he wouldn&#39;t simply stay put like before.

&#39;I can&#39;t fix you right now.&#39; He admitted finally. &#39;I can go into hibernation, and still won&#39;t be able to fix you. My artificial circuits have been damaged.&#39; 

He stopped, turned to face Scylla, then rolled up his right shirt sleeve, exposing a length of arm that looked like any ordinary arm - except that it was covered in scars and burn marks and swollen with a lattice-like pattern running down its length. It looked painful to touch.

It&#39;s what empowers you and allows me to deactivate you with a simple command.&#39; He gave her a wry smile before continuing on. &#39;But now it&#39;s on the verge of breaking. I cannot give you more mana than it is absolutely necessary without risking it breaking down completely...&#39; 

He trailed off and studied Scylla&#39;s face - what remained of it, at least. He hadn&#39;t told her the full story. He hadn&#39;t told her that the breaking of his artificial circuits would only dissolve their bond, and that she would be liberated and go back to subsisting on mana batteries...perhaps, even under a new Master. He also hadn&#39;t told her that they were currently headed towards a facility that conveniently housed said mana batteries, and that her survival would be guaranteed either way. And finally, there was no way he would tell her that he&#39;d been withholding all of this information, because he suddenly wasn&#39;t so keen on breaking their bond anymore.

The advent of the outsiders had changed his opinions on many things. Among them was Scylla, who had gone from an eyesore to an asset in the span of a single clash. But he&#39;d done so many wrongs to Scylla. He had no doubt that were she to learn any of these secrets, she would personally break his artificial circuits and desert him on the spot.

And he couldn&#39;t afford to let her do that. He couldn&#39;t afford to do another summon when his artificial circuits were nearing a state of disrepair. He desperately needed a usable Servant right <em>now</em>.

What selfish beings humans are.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Alas, Koji&#39;s attempt to &quot;lighten the mood&quot; was neither wanted or welcome. No, all it did was cause Scylla&#39;s frown to deepen. This was akin to a net thrown over her gaping maw, a momentary stall before it was shredded, buying a few seconds at most. 

<strong>&quot;I prefer swimming. I could be swimming right now, if we had went back to the mountains. You could walk on the way back, if you so wished. So, I ask again: Why are we here?&quot;</strong>

Perhaps her questioning had pulled the truth from his throat, or perhaps he found the words he was looking for. Either way, he finally admitted why they had strayed from the path home - That circuit in his arm had... Not broken. Frayed? No, burnt out? Ngh, enough with the attempt to be verbose. <em>Damaged</em>, that was the fact of the matter. It was a blunted sword, an arrow without a point, failing in its sole purpose.

That purpose being to supply her with magical energy. With that revelation, she could feel the dots connect in her mind. So, that was why her body felt stagnant, as though it were not able to properly heal itself. If it were to fully break, then her sole source of assured sustenance would be cut off, and without that crucial anchor, she would fade away.

That thought caused her eyes to widen. She could not allow that to happen, no matter what came to pass. She would not experience death for a second time. She would not allow herself to fall into that endless abyss again.

And, of course, that made her dependent on the good doctor&#39;s continued living.

Koji would find himself swept off his feet, once again being carried by Scylla as she moved forward, quickening her stride. Not quite a sprint, but still far faster than their previous meandering pace.

<strong>&quot;You should not walk. If you collapse, you might further damage your arm. I cannot allow that.&quot;</strong> Rider warned sternly, one eye glancing down at her master while the other looked ahead. <strong>&quot;Simply tell me where we must go to fix that circuit, and I shall take you there.&quot;</strong></span>

He wasn&#39;t so terribly sorry for deceiving Scylla. No, he wasn&#39;t sorry at all that he had deceived a beast who was capable of shredding him in a matter of seconds to lay her hands off him when he was being next to useless. Right now, words were all he had at his disposal at reclaiming his spot on the chain of command. It came as a relief, more than anything, to see Scylla accept them so readily-

The next moment, he was off the ground, hefted by none other than Scylla as she carried him like a sack of potatoes before resuming her stride. All manners of gore started rubbing onto his clothes from Scylla&#39;s wounds. His eyes began to twitch at the icky wet sounds they produced as they stained his outfit red, brown and black.

&#39;Let me down, Scylla!&#39; He protested, half out of disgust, half out of distress. &#39;Don&#39;t make matters worse. You are in no condition to carry anyone but yourself. I still need you to stay alive for-&#39;

He glanced at his wrist to check the time, found nothing there, and remembered his watch was broken.

&#39;-a while.&#39; He finished lamely. God, why was everything a disheveled mess?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Indeed, to be carried by Scylla was neither pleasant nor clean. Blood cascaded down from her lacerations, showering down onto Koji and bathing him in sanguine. Nor was it a particularly steady &quot;ride&quot;, punctuated more by the nausea-inducing sway of her brisk march across the uneven dunes.

In that sense, it was reminiscent of the sinking ship that they had visited hours earlier. Though, considering the context, that comparison was more grave than it was humorous. 

<strong>&quot;Do not treat me as though I am a floundering weakling.&quot;</strong> The hound brushed off the doctor&#39;s concerns without a second thought, continuing on her path as she ignored any and all objections. <strong>&quot;I am no damsel in distress. I am fine, and will be better once the connection between us is restored to the fullest.&quot;</strong>

A blatant lie. She was by no means fine, not in the slightest. The damage she&#39;d sustained would have killed a lesser servant, and even then, there was no guarantee she wouldn&#39;t keel over and die any second now. But the pain did not matter, nor any looming threat of death. She would not die. She could not die. 

Grunts of exertion forced their way free from her throat as a single tendril, tipped with a bulbous eye, sprouted free from her shoulder and stretched up, peering about like the periscope of a submarine. 

<strong>&quot;What actually makes matters worse, Naoharu Koji, is your incessant timewasting. My health is irrelevant. I will survive long enough to do what must be done. So, stop making me repeat myself and tell me where we are going.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For a moment, Koji was at a loss for words. Who did Scylla think he was, blind, moronic, or both? She was fine? <em>Fine</em>, when she was dousing him in her own blood? He turned to swear at his Servant, but instead of cursing, the tired doctor burst out laughing. He laughed loudly, choked on her blood, then spat and laughed some more.

It wasn&#39;t even funny. 

&#39;I am treating you like a <em>patient</em>,&#39; he simmered with exasperation as the taste of salt and copper coated the inside of his mouth. &#39;While you are treating me like an Elizabeth Bathory copycat. Either do something about the bleeding, or stop with the barefaced lies. <strong>You are doing it again!</strong>&#39;

He groaned when Scylla used what little mana she could scrounge up to create a scouting tendril, tipping her closer towards exhaustion. 

<strong>&#39;You&#39;re. Not. Listening to me!&#39;</strong> He seethed. &#39;You&#39;re behaving like my least favorite type of patient. There&#39;s a limit to how far stubbornness can carry you even if you are a Servant! You can&#39;t fool your body into thinking it&#39;s fine when it isn&#39;t!&#39;

He whipped out his cane, suppressed the urge to bonk his half-dead Servant with it, and pointed some ten or fifteen degrees westward from the road they were currently on.

&#39;You want to trade your precious life to save a few minutes on the road? Then keep heading in that direction until you see the Nirvana labs. Do you know how to read signs? Doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s going to be the greyest, most boring-looking building you&#39;ll ever come across. You can&#39;t miss it.&#39; 

&#39;And don&#39;t even <em>think</em> about bleeding out on me.&#39; He flexed his artificial circuits a little bit more than he was willing to, feeling the sting as it heat up abnormally fast. Oh well. At least he knew it was still somewhat functional.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The humourless cackling of Koji did little to change Scylla&#39;s mind. If anything, it only served to convince her to tighten her grip, in case he tried to wriggle free of her grasp.

<strong>&quot;I. Am. Fine.&quot;</strong> Scylla reasserted, her voice a low grumble, half growl and half sigh. She wanted to shout, to properly sell her point, but on this occasion, her larynx denied her. Her reserves of mana so low that she could not even yell... How grim. But, while she recognised that inwardly, she did not let that show outwardly. <strong>&quot;Do not treat me as though I am a frail little child. Monsters do not die of exhaustion. That is that.&quot;</strong>

However, the doctor did receive a slight concession. Rider extended her arms out slightly, putting him further away from his body, and thus, away from her draining blood. Well, most of it, anyway. The occasional trickle would still land upon his mess of a shirt, but it was better than the previous downpour.

<strong>&quot;Portside... Very well.&quot;</strong>

Thus, the walking would continue for a time, master and servant carrying on along the desert sands. But eventually, that time of walking came to an end. As they began to crest one of the many dunes, the periscopic eye would squirm for a second, before shrinking back down into the host body.

Sure enough, once they reached the top, they would be greeted by the sight of a selection of buildings, simple looking cubes build out of the ground, all of them white or grey or silver or, if they were feeling particularly exciting, beige. Scylla was unimpressive.

<strong>&quot;The human aesthetic has certainly degraded.&quot;</strong> She grunted. She shifted her arms, allowing Koji to pull himself to a standstill. It seemed that she saw no further need to carry him about when they were so close. <strong>&quot;Now tell me why, exactly, do we need to go to this place?&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji was not convinced, but alas, he&#39;d met his match in stubbornness. Scylla was quick to demonstrate that she would rather die defending her name than admit her weakness, and Koji had no choice but to let her have her way, lest she waste even more mana on proving her health. 

And thus began his unpleasant &#39;ride&#39; to the labs. If one were to ignore the blatantly bloody trail left in their wake, the walk was fairly easy for someone of Scylla&#39;s stature, and they made good time. Before long, a collection of buildings that looked to be cut from the same pattern appeared on the road ahead, each looking squarer than the next and exuding an air of importance - or boredom, depending on how one looked at it. For both the Master and Servant, it was most certainly the latter.

Koji ignored the mild nausea in his stomach as he was finally let off his rocky ride. &#39;The good news is that we won&#39;t be looking at them all that much,&#39; he said. &#39;Because we are going inside. For supplies.&#39; 

He went up to one of the larger buildings in the cluster, jamming the front door open with a generous growth of roots and branches from his cane. The door burst open with a <em>pop</em>, revealing a corridor with white walls, flooring, and fluorescent lights. 

The interior of the lab was just as dull as its exterior...

A spray of antiseptics doused the Rider pair as they entered the building and marched deep into its belly. Koji seemed fairly familiar with the place, taking Scylla through a few intersections before they stopped in front of a room at the end of a particularly narrow hallway.

The temperature dropped considerably when they entered. Massive freezers lined one wall - not the kind that held food. Cabinets occupied another, each filled with various medical supplies.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Koji went straight for the freezers. He yanked the door open, releasing a blast of cold air into the already chilly room and revealing heaps upon heaps of dead animals large and small, each bagged and labeled with color-coded stickers.

He turned to Rider with relief. &#39;Eat,&#39; he said, holding the freezer door wide open for his Servant to browse its fine selection of exotic carcasses. 

Hold on. Did he really just take his Servant into a cold room in the middle of nowhere to fine dine on the corpses of animals that were most likely used as test subjects?

&#39;I&#39;ve read that Servants in the old days were able to consume food as a supplement for mana.&#39; Koji continued thoughtfully. &#39;The amount needed seemed to differ on a case-by-case basis, but this much&#39;—he made a sweeping motion with his arm and gestured towards the rest of the freezers—&#39;should suffice, I hope.&#39;

He looked absolutely serious about his suggestion.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Finally free from the burning stare of the sun, and inside the boxy buildings, filled with chilled, chemically cleansed air. It felt odd to breathe in such a place, as though she were sitting at the bottom of a chlorinated swimming pool. Surrounded by the strange smell of nothingness, where anything that might be harmful had been burned away.

That feeling was only furthered as she was assaulted by a shower of even more chemicals, a spray that felt most irritable against her many open wounds. Truly, any germs that she might have one carried were now exterminated... At least, until the next gouts of blood began to pour out from her body. Alas, it had proven to be quite redundant, though she supposed most of those who worked here didn&#39;t tend to be shredded from head to toe.

Still, they were at least getting closer to fixing Koji&#39;s circuit, and by proxy, allowing her to properly heal. She allowed herself an uncharacteristic sigh of relief as Koji marched forth, opening the freezers to reveal...

<strong>&quot;...Is this a joke?&quot;</strong>

Animals. Dead animals, likely specimens meant for study, crammed into ice boxes so they wouldn&#39;t begin to rot. Scylla&#39;s eyes were wide, so utterly surprised by such a genuinely baffling suggestion. Was he concussed? Was he brain damaged?

Rider took a few steps forward, grabbing of the many bags, and tearing it open. From it, she proceeded to pull out a rabbit that was practically frozen over, so rigid and frostburnt that one would think it was an elaborate ice sculpture of a bunny, and not a bunny proper. As if to confirm her suspicions, her knuckles knocked against the rabbit&#39;s rear, which responded with a series of firm <em>thuds</em>.

<strong>&quot;If this is another elaborate attempt to kill me, Naoharu Koji, then it is a terrible one.&quot;</strong></span>

Whatever he had expected, this was not it. For Scylla to regard the dead rabbit&#39;s frigid posterior with such a lackluster eye, it almost looked as if she were some kind of gourmet rather than a beast who would eat anything put before her. But was that really the issue? Scylla, a picky eater? Or-

Of course. It all came back to trust.

Koji sighed. &#39;If I wanted to kill you, I&#39;d have known better than to pick a confined room with nowhere to run. Everything here has been properly sterilized. You won&#39;t have to worry about food poisoning, as ridiculous as that sounds.&#39; 

It <em>did</em> sound pretty ridiculous now that he had said it out loud. Scylla was carnivorous. Humans, animals. It didn&#39;t matter. Meat was meat. It all made perfect sense to him. 

&#39;Now eat,&#39; he pressed on, &#39;and regain your energy. And don&#39;t give me that nonsense about you being immune to exhaustion. Sink or swim, we are currently in this situation together. I <em>need</em> you to last the full night. Every little bit helps.&#39; 

It hadn&#39;t occurred to him that he and Scylla may be dealing with more than just trust issues...</span>

<em>He was serious.</em>

Forget being dumbfounded, now Scylla was straight up aghast. Was this his great plan all along? Have her crunch down a few frigid scraps of meat, as though that would fix things? Who did he think she was, a beast?

...Hm, no, actually, that made sense. Monsters weren&#39;t exactly picky about their meals, were they? They&#39;d devour just about anything they could wrap their maw around. But, this was hardly noble! She was a scourge of the seas, who sated her abyssal hunger with the flesh of sailors fresh off their ships, not puny carcasses from a refrigerator! 

But, he wasn&#39;t going to leave her be until she indulged his idiotic little idea. No amount of posturing or threatening would get him to back off. Fine, so be it!

<strong>CRUNCH!</strong> As Rider took a bite from her rabbit, the sounds of ice being broken filled the air, the outer layers of her frozen dinner crumbling away as she got to the flesh underneath. Every chew was agonising bland, so much so that it made her mouth feel numb... Or, was that just the cold? Either way, it was an unpleasant eating experience. After just one single bite, she looked at Koji again, not with bitterness, but with bargaining. 

A lightbulb had gone off in her head.

<strong>&quot;Dead creatures are far less substantive to feast on than living creatures. It is the process of breathing, existence itself, that generates magical energy within the body. It would be better to allow me to devour some of your birds.&quot;</strong> 

A wholly reasonable suggestion, and definitely not one made to spare her from choking down more frosty, uncooked, unseasoned rabbit, no, not at all. She wasn&#39;t just doing this so she could sink her fangs into some plump, mana-rich, juicy bird flesh, not at all! This was a solely utilitarian decision. No gluttony about it.

...

Well, no gluttony that should be of any concern to her Master, anyway.</span>

<em>&#39;Good girl, you are a brave girl. The bravest girl for finishing up all your medicine.&#39; He&#39;d rub her head fondly, then reward her a piece of chocolate from the candy jar. Then an extra piece. &#39;A little bonus,&#39; he&#39;d smile, &#39;for not throwing up today.&#39;</em>

He blinked, and the puckered face of the child overlapped with his Servant, who was looking at him with an almost placating expression, a gaping hole with teeth marks in the carcass in her hand. She had stopped after a single bite. Not because it was poisonous, but...

<em>&#39;Please please oh please can I have the chocolate first? I promise I&#39;ll be good and take the medicine...uhhhhh, later!&#39;</em>

He winced.

Scylla was trying to stick her hand in the candy jar, which was filled with sweet, palatable, and even downright nutritious treats in the form of his birds. She wasn&#39;t even being subtle about it!

&#39;...And what will you do if I don&#39;t?&#39; He asked, testing the waters cautiously.

It was a low mumble, so quiet that it was almost smothered by the electric hum of the freezers. But, undeniably, Rider was talking to herself.

Though the mechanical semblance of her S.E.R.V.A.N.T rig was covered up by the visage of her Saint Graph, Koji could nonetheless see the gears turning in Scylla&#39;s head. This was strange. Was her blood loss causing her to hallucinate? Had she lost the ability to separate her thoughts from her words?

<strong>&quot;...Because he does not know, I can say whatever I want, and he would likely believe me...&quot;</strong>

Monsters were not good at diplomacy. Rarely, if ever, did they require such a talent. Even within the Holy Grail System, or this modern ramshackle replacement, most had the luxury of being summoned as Berserker, whose lack of sanity meant they needn&#39;t consider such frivolities. But, she could not cling to that ironclad excuse. She was a Rider. A fish out of water.

<strong>&quot;...But, I do not have to follow through, so long as he gives me what I want. Therefore, I should provide the greatest threat possible, to ensure that I have my way.&quot;</strong>

Scylla would suddenly and loudly clear her throat, a hand shooting out to cup Koji&#39;s chin. Her fingers gripped it hard, not enough to hurt, but enough that it could hurt if she put in the effort. Her eyes narrowed, and she allowed her teeth to show as she tilted Koji&#39;s face up towards her.

<strong>&quot;If you don&#39;t give me the birds, I will kill you, eat your corpse, then kill your birds and eat them, too.&quot;</strong></span>

After all, it wasn&#39;t that uncommon for the mind to play tricks in a room filled with the low hum of machines and the scent of death. The atmosphere puts you in a trap within your own head; stick around for long enough, and you&#39;d start having hallucinations and hear all sorts of strange things that weren&#39;t supposed to be there at all.

Scylla did not mumble. She would growl, or yell, or speak like a normal human being who had good lungs and a powerful voice. Being covert was not her thing. Thoughtfulness and her did not match. Koji passed off the words he&#39;d heard as the distorted rumbles from the machines.

Then it happened again, and he watched her lips move in perfect sync to the words he <em>thought</em> he&#39;d heard.

No, no. Not thought. <em>Did.</em> 

He stared, speechless, as Scylla went through the mental gymnastics to come up with a clever response. His mind went blank, his expression frozen in a state of disbelief. He was mildly shocked. Felt severely threatened.

He wished he couldn&#39;t hear shit.

&#39;You know-&#39; He cleared his throat, but Scylla did it louder, shutting him up as she gripped his delicate, human chin in her hand and enacted her genius plan of coercion. It <em>was</em> effective, he&#39;ll give her that. His knees were already weak simply from witnessing her fangs up close...

Though he still wished he hadn&#39;t heard shit. Despite feeling shocked and threatened and weak in the knees, he couldn&#39;t help but think that he was no longer bargaining with a beast, but a-

Koji held up one finger and held Scylla firmly in his eyes. 

&#39;<em>One</em> bird,&#39; he nudged her along. &#39;For one bite of the rabbit, I will give you one bird. For two bites, I will give you two. Finish the whole thing, and I&#39;ll even throw in an extra. A fine deal, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#39; 

It was time to experiment with some positive reinforcement training.</span>

Truly, Koji was a shrewd diplomat, trained to be as iron even in the face of great pressure. After all, there could be no other reason why he would not bend to her demands. Absolutely none. None at all.

It was hardly the kind of feast that would allow her to fully regenerate her mana reserves, not enough to restore her body to its prime. It did not even get her out of eating the cold slab of rabbit in front of her. But...

Ngh, what was she supposed to do about it?! If she were to start thrashing about her master in such a state, it would waste her magical energy, waste his regular energy, and she wouldn&#39;t get any birds at all! What a horrible, horrible state of affairs! It was hardly what she wanted, definitely not what she deserved, but given there were sparse few alternatives available...

<strong>&quot;Fine. Three birds for finishing it.&quot;</strong>

Scylla would let go of Koji&#39;s chin, raising up the chilly rabbit up to her mouth to eat. Truly, she was no different than a dog, or maybe a child? Easy to manipulate, and-

<em>RCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT-</em>

Bones popped and snapped as his skin stretch, her jaw unhinging as it pulled itself open, a waterfall of saliva pouring down onto the bunny. Then, like a snake devouring its prey, Rider swallowed the creature in one gulp, hundreds of teeth within her maw shredding it like paper. And then, as quickly as the body went in, the skeleton came out, bones spat onto the floor at Koji&#39;s feet, the jaw snapping back into place as though nothing at all had happened.

<strong>&quot;Birds. <u>Now</u>.&quot;</strong>

-Perhaps it would not be wise to treat her so lightly. Even if she was intellectually &quot;simple&quot;, she still had plenty of tricks up her sleeve that the good doctor knew nothing about.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That went surprisingly well!

At the expense of three of his birds, Scylla was willing to chow down on a frozen, dead rabbit. It didn&#39;t look like much of an accomplishment; after all, how much energy could three birds provide for a Servant on the brink of exhaustion? It was barely enough to fill her stomach, let alone her mana reserves!

But, for once, their negotiation didn&#39;t escalate to a shouting match or end in an exorbitant amount of blood loss - none for him, at any rate. Scylla didn&#39;t even seem to hate the idea of making compromises. Oh, don&#39;t get him wrong, he could see reluctance written all over her face. But she still relented in the end, didn&#39;t she? Even took up on his meager offer.

It wasn&#39;t much, but it was still a step in the right direction.

&#39;Three birds. You have my promise.&#39; Koji nodded. The idea of offering up his birds as tasty snacks wasn&#39;t particularly appealing. There was no helping deaths by natural causes, but Scylla, a being with clear intent and worldly desires, could hardly be considered a force of nature. 

He couldn&#39;t help but feel like an executioner as he contemplated his choice of avian sacrifices. Which birds would he miss less than the others? The seagulls? The pelicans? The glossy ibis in the mountains? Should he go with the birds with the highest fertility rate? What about the ones who were close to succumbing to natural decay? He had just touched up a few of those recently-

A loud ripping sound filled his ears, and the doctor involuntarily took a step - no, make that several steps - back, as Scylla&#39;s jaw unhinged like a snake and revealed a mouth full of razor sharp teeth. It opened and snapped, then the rabbit was gone, meat tearing off the bones in an instant and leaving behind a pristine skeleton that Scylla deliberately spat out at Koji&#39;s feet.

It almost felt as if she was foretelling him of a certain future if he failed to uphold his end of the bargain.
