Or maybe this was all conjecture, and Nirvana had systems in place to imitate the tide. Who knew what those wacky magi were up to!

Nonetheless, it was clear that the rest of the fighting was over, and the Canopus was now a silent shadow, looming over the part or Nirvana where it had landed. Due to the battle, pieces of debris, tech, and rations were now floating in the ocean, waiting to be pushed ashore by the tide.

Curse the Investigation Team! First they ruined the Nirvanans&#39; day, and now their pristine beaches? Would their cruelty never cease?

After several hours, something too oddly shaped, squishy, and hairy to be a piece of metal ship hull washed onto Nirvana&#39;s shores, having been forced there by a mix of currents and the rising tide.

Despite it all, his mustache remained immaculate. Thank the heavens! Now, where was he?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald had to admit, being incredibly lucky sometimes paid off extremely well. Anything less would’ve kept him stranded at sea for who knows how long. Perhaps he would’ve never even found land, despite it being so close. Water did that. Goes wherever it pleases, not a care in the world. Would throw a boat of children away from the beach if it so desired.

Back onto more important matters, the Scot dragged himself ashore. One heavy foot, each step carrying the weight of water-logged boots, until he was free of the sea entirely. He went a few more feet, just for good measure, before flopping down onto the sand. The grains imprinted on his face, doing little to warm him up. Perhaps hypothermia had set in. 

At least he heard nothing but the waves crash against the beach and the distant call of wildlife. No people. Crazy people. The ones that’d gut him if given half the chance. Use the leftover Servant Frame to summon another demonic entity, just to rub it in his stupid face. 

To play it safe, he rolled himself over with a groan and a body&#39;s worth of aches. If there was no one around, there might be with all the noise that went into the simple action. At least he’d see them coming, despite the dark skies. The moon shone bright, perhaps in honor of those lost on the ship or to the frigid sea itself. 

For a while, he simply laid there. ‘Enjoying’ the beach. ‘Enjoying’ the fact that he wasn’t at the mercy of whichever god had cursed him to this personal hell. Maybe his last few summonings had been too chaotic, and this was some form of divine retribution. Wouldn’t be the first time. Not that he’d know, considering the way that damn Throne stole all his memories every single time he was sent out. Nothing more but a quiet determination that weighed his bones, like they’d been filled with lead.</span>

Unfortunately, he could not fall asleep there. There was a flintlock still missing, and somewhere along the way here his hat had decided to make its own path. Without that, who was he as a person? Just some bloke that was a bit bigger than everyone else. And a really sharp blade. And a gun that was from when humanity had just started to figure out the most efficient ways to kill people.

Donald’s shoulders pushed off the ground, and his arms carried that momentum forward until he was upright. The first thing he saw was that ship. Hard to not see it, with its carcass on display under the white light. To call it eerie was an understatement, yet anything more would start to be disrespectful. Two halves of a great vessel, so close yet so far from each other. Crystals poked out from where something had tried to stitch the holes back together. A pointless endeavor. 

Now, now, time’s a wasting! Saber-number-who-knows picked himself off the ground, nice and slow. He scanned the immediate area, seeing neither of his prized possessions. Of course. 

He picked a direction, his left, and started his long trek. Heavy, measured paces pushed him along to whatever lay in store. Maybe that chunk of flesh that called itself a master was around here, ready to crack open some booze and make all the pain go away.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That was that. The Scot would strike out on his own, and find what he had lost. What was a Donald McBane without two flintlock pistols and his trademark hat?

Oh, and his Master. He should probably find him too. He had all the mana batteries on his person. Without him, Donald would eventually lock up and fade away into the ether, and going hunting for batteries on Nirvana without the help of Mr...

Shoot, had he even gotten his Master&#39;s <em>name</em>?

What was Donald even doing here, anyways? His Master had summoned him, but why, exactly? It was like he was marching off into battle with a great dragon, and the only plan was to &#39;fight and stuff&#39;.

These beaches were nice, though. The sand was nice and silky, despite the occasional bit of metal from the Canopus getting stuck in Donald&#39;s soles.

After walking for what seemed like an eternity, guided by moonlight, he saw an outline in the sand. Either Donald had found the elusive Bigfoot, or that was his Master!

And where Master was, booze was likely to be as well! This was a win-win, as far as Donald McBane was concerned!

Wait, why wasn&#39;t he breathing?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It didn’t take too long to find someone that resembled his Master. Well, not resemble. <em>Was</em>, his Master. Not too many people could look like a miniature tower, each brick replaced with a tendon. At least, he hoped not. 

“Looks like the both’o’us survived Lady Luck’s attempt to kill us,” Donald called out, shambling slightly faster over to the pile in the sand. The closer he got, the more it looked like him. White suit stained with water, blood, and sand. The faint bulge of a backpack underneath him. Chest as large as himself. Come to think of it, he sure was holding his breath for a while. Hadn’t even twitched once as he got closer. 

It was only when he stood over the man that Donald even considered the idea that this was possibly a corpse. A concerning prospect, since this was his lifeline. If this sucker died, he’d be out of luck with an island full of people ready to murder him. Being a turncoat wasn’t an appealing idea, either. 

Curse the advancement of modern resuscitation techniques! If only they’d figured this out during his first life, he’d be able to try and bring the man back to life. Or at least try. Instead, the Scot would have to settle for an approach more tailored to him as someone from when a person got a cut and would die in five days flat. 

With slow movements, he prodded Granel’s chest with his foot. He made sure to put enough force behind it to move him, which was a hellova lot more than he anticipated.

Doing so would reveal Granel&#39;s backpack, still strapped to him. Thank the heavens! Donald was as lucky as ever.

His Master was still dead, though. Hm.

That was a problem. Even with those mana batteries, it&#39;d be difficult to go on without a Master. Would anyone really trust a Masterless Servant, running around aimlessly? Unlikely. Donald needed information.

Wasn&#39;t there something about checking for a pulse? Yeah, that sounded right! It was the typical useless information that the Throne would pour into Donald&#39;s brain, but not the useful information such as <em>why he was even summoned.</em>

Putting a rough hand to the man&#39;s neck, there was supposed to be the thrum of life. A pulse. When Donald did it, there was nothing, however. Maybe his hand was in the wrong place? He moved it again. Nothing.

Crap.

Maybe there was water in his lungs? No air? Wasn&#39;t there a method for reviving people who had drowned? The dreaded kiss of life?

That was not ideal. Donald would implode if he was forced to do that. However, it was likely that he&#39;d have to at least <em>consider</em> the idea. Just as Donald&#39;s gears began to turn, a noise emanated from his Master:

&quot;...<em>cough</em>&quot; The man&#39;s eyes opened.

Donald was truly a pro.

Oh, wait, hold on. His Master just showed signs of life! Vague signs, but anything was a marked improvement over the other possibility! With open eyes and a forced exhalation, the hunk came back to life. Nay a scratch on that perfect skin of his, which was weird considering what the hell they had went through almost half a day before. 

… He needed to stop thinking things worked normally with a man who could bend steel doors with ease. 

Saber knelt down, good arm placed on Granel’s chest. “Oi, you had me worried for a moment there! If yer idea of being a ‘Master’ was kickin’ me to the curb without so much as a compass, I was gonna bring you back <em>just</em> to throttle you to death!”

To show his consideration, Donald pushed Granel further to the side. A bit of a struggle, but it would be all worth it if he could start to rummage inside that knap-sack being crushed underneath. 

Wait.

The booze!

His rooting around got more frenzied.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Why couldn&#39;t he have just <em>died</em> on that ship?

Drowning was surprisingly painful, even if Granel only breathed by habit, and the only thing that was really happening was his lungs filling up with saltwater. Even so, it caused irritation, and pain. Granel was used to those, but drowning was special in how it tortured the large man.

&quot;...cough. <strong>HACK!</strong> Ugh.&quot; Granel groaned as Donald continued to kick him until he rolled over. and the massive backpack was unveiled. Excellent!

&quot;<strong>Shit.</strong>&quot; Whether that was an insult towards Donald, a proclaimation of what he was about to do, or how he currently felt was up in the air. Nonetheless, he slowly rose to a sitting position as sand fell off of his drenched suit.

After a moment, he groaned and waved towards Donald. &quot;<strong>Stop! I&#39;m alive. Give me a second.</strong>&quot; Granel grunted before spitting out seawater. He had probably took in enough to lower the sea levels by an inch or two.

&quot;<strong>Moon? How long has it been, Donald? A few hours, at least? Shit, it doesn&#39;t matter. We&#39;re lucky to be alive.</strong>&quot; Granel said, taking the backpack off and digging into it. He gave out a sigh of relief. The former security guard turned to Donald, who was awaiting the verdict.

&quot;<strong>Booze is good. Nothing got wet. Gotta love Olympian-made survival gear.</strong>&quot;

Finally, something had gone well! He and Donald could celebrate their survival, now that they had made it ashore. Granel looked around, before seeing the Canopus. He groaned. How were they gonna get home now?

It could be worse. Donald was still kicking! His Servant was made of sterner stuff than expected, if he had survived falling several dozen meters into the water, drowned, and had been washed ashore. 

&quot;<strong>Give me a moment. I&#39;m too weak to move. We should hide somewhere in the preserve, unless we want to get torn apart. Common survival strategy.</strong>&quot;

Was this man going to explain what was going on?

Granel proceeded to spill a few pints of liquid out of his mouth. Despite it coming from inside, it didn’t have any bodily smells to overwhelm his nostrils. It was just sea water. Still grossed him out a little, which caused him to back off. 

His Master did a little more talking before finally slinging that knap-sack around to his front. A zipper was undone, and he inspected the contents. Donald tried to crane over and see what was inside, but the man was too bloody big! Was like trying to see past a wall almost as tall as one’s self. 

Granel turned around. Donald met his eyes, the most serious he’d been since his arrival. 

And the good news came.

Saber released the breath he had held onto by mistake, laughing out the stale air. “Oh, heavens! You had me worried there for a moment. Nearly lost me mind, thinkin’ of a trip without spirits!”

And then he saw the ship. A groan escaped Granel’s lips. Looks like that had killed the mood proper. Donald himself couldn’t feel sad about the vessel, as he’d only known it for around fifteen minutes before being dropped out of it like a sack of potatoes. A bad first impression, to say the least.

Speaking of survival, sounded like this brute had more thoughts in his head than previously thought. Concerning. Probably for the best, though. Donald was survival and battle smart, and that’s where the brainpower stopped. If this guy could be intelligent for everything else, they’d hopefully be fine.

Oh, great time! They were sitting here for a few minutes anyway, might as well finally get some information.

“We can sit here for a bit, yea. Doesn’t mean I’m gonna let you stare like a fish at yer ship,” Donald shifted onto his bum, crossed-legged next to Granel. “Spill yer guts like that barrel of salt water you had hiding in there. What the bloody hell is going on here? This is a tour gone poorly, bright as… mon. But I don’t fight for strangers. Or free, but that’ll come in time.”</span>

A wise decision, but one that left Donald woefully underprepared for an excursion into Nirvana. If he didn&#39;t explain everything, Donald would be at a disadvantage.

&quot;<strong>Right. I&#39;ll explain everything.</strong> Granel shifted slightly, sending more sand cascading onto the beach, along with... was that a crab?

It scurried away, back into the ocean.

&quot;<strong>That ship over there—</strong>&quot; Donald pointed towards the Canopus with his chin—&quot;<strong>Is called the Canopus. It&#39;s a massive ship that scoured the world for people willing to investigate Nirvana for its blueprints. This place is a nature preserve. It&#39;s precious.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>However, we&#39;re not the first team to be sent out here. We&#39;re the third. The other two...</strong>&quot; Granel swallowed. &quot;<strong>They didn&#39;t make it. We&#39;re here to find out what happened to them.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Nobody wants to risk super valuable mages anymore. They need them to keep big Stella Maris functional and active. So instead...</strong>&quot; Granel trailed off. It was pretty obvious. Excess mages, unneeded for operations, made up the Canopus&#39;s staff. They were undertalented, and forced to go against an entire city of people.

&quot;<strong>Then there&#39;re people like me. I&#39;m no mage, but I&#39;ve worked jobs like this before. Security. Extraction. Granel Mason is somewhat well-known in a few circles. I couldn&#39;t let everyone just march off to die.</strong>&quot; Granel shrugged. &quot;<strong>Besides, someone needs to bring the corpses home.</strong>&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Donald watched the crab scuttle away whilst Granel gave a rough summary as to their purpose on this cursed island. He waited until the other man was done talking, as they could be here another hour if he interrupted at every opportunity. 

It was good he did so. Finally, a name was given to the face. Granel Mason. Sure fit the bill alright. Especially the Mason part. He had known a few bricklayers in his days, and each one of them was built just as well as their projects. This guy took it a little further, obviously. Whatever floated his– anyway!

“Don’t feel dour, Granel,” Donald tried and vaguely succeeded in throwing an arm around his shoulder, “This was doomed from the start. After two tries is when you send the best of the best to solve the issue, not whatever scraps are lying around. That, or ya call it a wash and drink fer the dead.” 

The Scot didn’t touch on that last part his Master mentioned. Truth be told, they’d probably be needing the lift in a bodybag home as well as the first ones. He himself would get over it, but the living here only had the one life. Pointing it out would kill moral.

“Well, that ain’t much to work off of,” Saber released his hold and pushed himself up off the ground. “But at least it’s nothin’ new. Not from personal experience, mind ya. I was on the winnin’ side. And I don’t plan on losin’ now.”

He held out a hand, “So, let’s get off this bloody beach and find a drier place to set up shop. Find a few sheep you’ve lost sight of.”

Donald wondered how many they’d have to bury. He bet three-quarters.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The man&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. Donald wasn&#39;t mad at his summoning? He had been brought along for what was essentially a suicide mission, and he didn&#39;t leave Granel behind to go roam the preserve as some sort of hatless wonder?

He lucked out.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re one in a million, magic man.</strong>&quot; Granel said with a smirk, cracks showing in his granite face. He took his Servant&#39;s hand, and was lugged to his feet. The man needed to cut back on the carbs. He was <em>heavy</em>!

&quot;<strong>We&#39;ll save as many of them as we can. We&#39;ll kill as many Nirvanans as we can, and then we&#39;ll go home. Assuming we don&#39;t die first, of course.</strong>&quot;

Granel shook his Servant&#39;s hand, formally sealing their contract.

The two looked around. Where were they gonna go? Not into town, definitely. They needed to lay low while they recovered their strength, and drank enough to intoxicate half of the preserve&#39;s population.

The two trudged up a dune, before looking around. Being dripping wet and trudging through sand was a nightmare, so after what seemed like hours, they made it to the top of the sand pile. Granel looked around in the moonlight.

&quot;<strong>That way. There&#39;s a lake. Water and food. We can always disappear into the wilderness should the Nirvanans organize a witch hunt.</strong>&quot;

Granel sighed, before pulling out a water bottle and drinking from it. This was gonna be a long trek.

&quot;<strong>Besides, an easy source of water? We&#39;re likely to hit another investigator. Come on, Donald, we can crack into my stash of beer once we make camp.</strong>&quot;

With that motivation, the two trekked off into the night.</span>
