It hasn’t been maintained in ages, but the system’s self-cleaning equipment seems to be functioning to this day. The lake has a high density of fish inhabiting it, along with small woodland creatures occupying the grassy areas. Rabbits, toads and cats are very common. Unlike other animals on the island, animals residing at the lake are relatively docile and tranquil. As a result, it is somewhat of a safe haven for the investigators.</div>

Moist grass rustled as the group walked by, the veteran confidently leading the way. The Lake area was quiet, profoundly still, a sharp contrast to the welcome committee the islanders had given them when they first set foot. Fighting their way through the crazed islanders wasn&#39;t easy, but the group had ultimately managed to power through. Getting split off from the main body of investigators was a little nerve-wracking, but the pressure was manageable. At least for Ace.

Suddenly, the veteran stopped. He raised a hand, beckoning the two following him to quiet down.</span>

Mere moments after they landed, they had to run for their lives from the islanders who gave chase to them. Two high-energy and dangerous situations back-to-back was straining for anyone. But, she knew that they couldn&#39;t rest yet. They needed to find a place to hide and set up camp. They needed to set up their radio.

That is when she noticed Ace stop. 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ace&#39;s raised hand made her freeze in place. Were they being followed again? Could there be a search party nearby? She didn&#39;t have the luxury of knowing so she just listened to Ace&#39;s command and knelt closer to the ground with bated breath.</span>

Like clockwork, Ace&#39;s suspicion would be confirmed. A lone pebble rolled down the grass, alerting Wendi&#39;s perceptive ears as the three individuals looked ahead. A large hat stuck out in the foliage, giving the man&#39;s presence away as an exasperated sigh could be heard.

A pink obscenity then emerged from the weedier part of the lake, swiping flies away from their body as Wendi instinctively started to act wary towards them. Despite their harmless appearance, their body was much higher in mana density than Ace or Emelia. Wendi could sense it rather easily. No doubt, they were a Servant.

&quot;Ya-hoo! Greetings, neighbors. I trust that your journey has been swell? Well, of course it was. After all, you had <em>me</em> saving your butt.&quot; Shakespeare laughed, pointing to his chest as he praised himself in front of the two investigators and their dog.

None of them were impressed.

&quot;...Why are you all sulking? Shouldn&#39;t you be at ease, knowing that the greatest playwright who has ever lived has come to greet you? You know who I am, right?&quot; He asked, before playing it up even further as he adjusted his hat and waved his pen around.

&quot;None other than William Shakespeare himself. Ta-da! Round of applause!&quot;

....

&quot;...&quot; William stayed immobile, his face stuck in a smile as he awaited a reaction from the three. Anything! Anything at all would do! At least acknowledge his existence...

The pebble rolled down the road, the anticipation grew bigger, the veteran took a long breath, <em>and finally...</em> 

<em>Blink. Blink, blink.</em>

The fly-swatting fellow that came out of the bushes nonchalantly reached out to the group. In an island filled to the brim with dangerous creatures and even more dangerous people, a top hat-wearing fella with pink clothes had just waddled his way to them, as if obvious to the hazards surrounding him. The energy and enthusiasm permeating his every word made this first impression most curious. Curious in the British sense: odd, quirky, eccentric, <em>surreal</em>.

For even if he didn&#39;t know of this Shakespeare guy, it didn&#39;t take a genius to put two and two together: the bizarre mannerisms, the over-the-top way of speaking, the immaculate appearance, not a single fold on their clothes and not a strand of hair out of line—

<em>They were most definitely dealing with a Servant.</em>

&quot;Rookie,&quot; Ace called out, in a wary position still. &quot;You mind telling me who&#39;s this clown that so boldly declared he <em>saved our butts</em>?&quot;</span>

The sight of the servant in question caught Berserker off guard. Just <em>what</em> are they suppose to be?

Slowly, Berserker stood up. Their height seemed to go on for much longer than it should until they stood at their full height. Their small beady eyes watched William with such intensity that if the cold chill around them didn&#39;t already send a chill down one&#39;s spine, then that definitely would! Unfortunately, Berserker appeared to be one of those strong, silent types. What terrible luck to have such an unresponsive member in his audience!</span>

A pink outfit and an obscene hat to top it all off. To say that it was a weird choice of clothing would be an understatement! <em>No one</em> in their right mind would wear such a thing in a place like this.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Emeilia stood up once she heard Ace mention her rank. Shortly after that, she was given a request. Just who was this servant in front of them? The servant already gave them their name so it was pretty easy to remember whatever tidbits she read about him. With a push of her glasses, Emeilia answered. &quot;Well, their name, as they so boldly said, is William Shakespeare. If my memory serves me right, and it usually does, he was the most well-known playwright of his time and our time, depending on who you ask, of course. William was mostly known for his various plays, poems, and acting. There isn&#39;t anyone who wouldn&#39;t recognize him in his respective fields.&quot; 

&#39;Was&#39;?! Did she suggest just that he was no longer famous? The nerve! 

&quot;Primarily summoned as a Caster servant, William Shakespeare isn&#39;t known to be much of a fighter. His parameters are usually quite below average when it comes to servant standards. Even a well-trained magus has a good chance against him.&quot; Ouch. The more Emeilia went on, the more she sounded like she was reciting off of a page with the immaculate detail. However, the &#39;page&#39; was simply what she remembered! Truly, it was clear why she was picked to be in the Scholar Corps! &quot;However, his saving grace comes from his rather impressive capability to support others with his skills. William&#39;s skills allows him to enhance others to perform at levels beyond what they are capable of. In short, there are few that comes close to Caster in that department.&quot; Finally! A compliment!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ace&#39;s reaction was subpar and Berserker&#39;s reaction was even worse in comparison. The gigantic Servant stood up, staring down at the poet like how animals sized up prey. William couldn&#39;t help but audibly gulp.

Thankfully, there was at least one sane person in the mix. Emeilia intervened, giving the other two a proper lecture on what kind of person William Shakespeare was. Though, her focus on his less desirable aspects was not unnoticed.

&quot;Ouch. We truly suffer a lot the few things we lack,&quot; He bit his lip, before contorting it into a smile. &quot;but you won&#39;t see me ignoring the many things I am good at!&quot;

He nodded, crossing his arms before continuing. &quot;Thanks for the pep talk, dear. It will help me get to the point rather swiftly. As you can tell, I really am as pathetically weak as that girl says. Not a good trait to have when my little stunt yesterday cost me a lot of clout here.&quot; He pointed to the ground, clearly meaning Nirvana.

&quot;So, since I saved you all, I think it&#39;s only fair for me to demand compensation: Protection from my fellow Nirvaners until the heat dies down. Sounds like a good deal, no?&quot;

A Nirvana Servant was asking for help? That was interesting. If anything, it made the three think about their current situation. Were there more Servants on the island that weren&#39;t inherently aggressive towards the investigators? This revelation felt like it had slightly tipped the playing board.</span>

&quot;That&#39;s why I shall offer you information in exchange. Just enough to get you going. As a playwright, I wouldn&#39;t want to tip the scales so early into the plot.

An interesting exchange, since they were in <em>dire need</em> of information. The one they had gotten their hands onto prior to boarding the ship was painfully outdated, almost useless to their current situation. They didn&#39;t—couldn&#39;t know what was out there. What sort of dangers lurked beneath the artificial mountains, they could only guess.

This was an opportunity to learn more about their their enemy, about this place as a whole, about the events that transpired within the first two expeditions...

...but however good of an opportunity, there was no changing the fact that the Servant in front of them was <em>one of them.</em> His &#39;fellow Nirvaners&#39;, he called them. Ace&#39;s eyebrow twitched, visibly irritated.

&quot;I didn&#39;t hear shit about you <em>saving</em> us,&quot; The veteran retorted, defiantly pointing to the Servant. &quot;In fact, I distinctly remember something about the <em>entire</em> ship crew dying at the hands of <em>your people</em>. And yet, the first thing you do is come boasting to us, presenting yourself as this saviour that repelled the enemy and saved us from doom, then you proceed to ask for protection.&quot;

Unrestrained enmity and a hard stare. Ace&#39;s hand kept firm on the magnum&#39;s handle, almost twitching in anticipation. 

&quot;But suppose you <em>did</em> help us,&quot; He went on. &quot;We still need to clarify a few things before talking about a deal. For example, who&#39;s your Master? Does he know about the fact that you&#39;ve helped foreigners fight off his <em>fellow Nirvaners,</em> or are you doing this behind his back?

&quot;If you <em>are</em> doing this behind his back, <em>what&#39;s your motive?</em> What compelled you to help those <em>outsiders</em> that so wrongfully stepped onto your land? <em>What are you gaining out of this?</em>&quot;</span>

Once she got started, it was difficult to get her to stop until she was finished. Her superiors, unfortunately, knew that better than anyone. However, what the servant in front of them said managed to do just that.

Protection? From his own people? It did make sense if he went turncoat on them. They didn&#39;t really seem like the most sensible people from what she saw at the <span class="mention">#city-docks</span> when they landed. 

What didn&#39;t make any sense was the reasoning behind it. Why did he decide to help them out and place a target on his back? These questions were shared with Ace who prodded for information before simply blindly agreeing to the offer presented to them. 

&quot;I am curious about that myself actually. Why did you suddenly have a change of heart? Surely, it would have been easier to just aid your fellow Nirvaners in destroying the ship before it made landfall, given your capabilities after all.&quot; Now both of them were interrogating poor William who just seemed to want someone to help protect him. 

Out of all the investigators to encounter first, these had to be the first ones he had to meet.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Now now,&quot; William scoffed at Ace&#39;s accusations. &quot;don&#39;t let a few rotten apples spoil the bunch. Did you expect me, a meek Caster, to hold off so many other Nirvana Servants at bay? Even your little missus seems to have understood my abilities rather well! I am mind over matter. In other words, I do not mind, nor do I matter.&quot;

He laughed at his own joke, before noticing the Berserker&#39;s alert gaze. Perhaps he had tailed the wrong people, since he wouldn&#39;t want to find himself between Wendigo&#39;s jaws anytime soon. He took a deep breath and stowed away that fear, resuming his speech instead.

&quot;Nirvana&#39;s citizens don&#39;t care about me at all because of that. Because they know that I cannot oppose them. Now, don&#39;t take it as me not being famous: I&#39;ll let you know that one of the main reasons they haven&#39;t killed me yet, is because of the fabled <em>Nirvana Times™️</em>, available at your local <span class="mention">#stationery-store</span> or <span class="mention">#merch-store</span> for a discounted price.&quot; He added out of the blue before continuing on.

&quot;Fact stands, however, that I am a playwright first and a Servant of Nirvana second. Why do you think I helped you all live? Do you think I&#39;d find it <em>amusing</em> if you all drowned at sea? Heavens, no! It would be <em>dreadfully boring.</em> Imagine if Romeo died in the first act, or if Macbeth lived happily ever after. I&#39;d eat my own hat if I were forced to pen stories like these!&quot; He snorted in annoyance.

&quot;Now, be proper stage actors and cherish your director, will you? I have been nothing but honest about my intentions so far. I simply seek some temporary protection. Long enough for this shithole&#39;s inhabitants to lose interest in me, at least.&quot;

While his explanation was clear and concise, one thing had yet to be addressed. Ace was quick to pick up on that, as he asked a final question.</span>

&quot;My Master? Hah. They are <strong>dead</strong>, unfortunately. I let them die because I was a coward.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">An eyebrow was raised as the playwright&#39;s tone turned glum towards the end of his explanations. Curious. 

&quot;So this is your answer,&quot; Deadpan, Ace uttered. &quot;Referring to the brave men and women who stepped onto this accursed island &#39;stage actors&#39;, leaving your Master to their death because of cowardice and helping us not out of good will but for the sake of your own personal entertainment. It&#39;s like the more I learn about you, the less I&#39;m willing to trust you.&quot;

The hand gripping the magnum slowly opened up, moving to the bridge of his nose to fix his sunglasses. There was something wrong about accepting help from a Servant who declared having helped solely because dying would&#39;ve been &#39;dreadfully boring&#39;, but even so. Stranded on an island with your allies dispersed and no way of easily obtaining information. Could they really deny such valuable help?

...

No. They couldn&#39;t.

&quot;...but since you&#39;ve been so &#39;honest&#39; with us, I&#39;ll do the same and reciprocate,&quot; He continued. &quot;I fucking hate your guts, Shakespeare, I really do, but I&#39;m willing to pick you up on your offer. You&#39;re not my ally, but you&#39;re not my enemy. Not until you&#39;ve given me a reason to consider you as such.&quot;

While he was ready to swallow his irritation and let logic triumph over this matter, he couldn&#39;t help but bounce the playwright&#39;s words in his head. As welcoming as he made himself be, he had a feeling that it wasn&#39;t that simple. The playwright didn&#39;t want them to fail in their endeavours, but a resounding success wasn&#39;t apt either. Romeo dying in the first act was boring, <em>but so was Macbeth living happily ever after.</em></span>

This <em>Nirvana Times™️</em> might be helpful to procure if they ever had the chance to do so. There had to be some useful information in there. It couldn&#39;t just be filled with nonsense, right? Right?

While Ace reluctantly agreed to the offer presented by Shakespeare, there was something else that she was curious about after she heard his story. Perhaps she felt moved? Maybe she felt bad for the servant?  

Emeilia figured it was safe so she approached the servant with a question in mind. &quot;Caster. About your Master,&quot; The &#39;little missus&#39; spoke up. There was a softness to her tone, as if worried about overstepping her boundaries. &quot;Did they summon you in Nirvana?&quot; Of course he was a Servant of Nirvana. He just told them that he was mere moments ago. That didn&#39;t automatically mean he was always one though. Two expeditions <em>did</em> come before them after all. The possibility was there. She needed to be sure.</span>

&quot;Get in line, Mr. Shades. The list of people who hate my metaphorical entrails is rather...expansive.&quot; He said with a cheery smile. &quot;Ah, such a burden to be famous.&quot; He scratched the back of his head.

&quot;But I am glad that we share a common bond! I assure you that I, the greatest playwright known to mankind, will do my best to stay out of your way.&quot; He stated, before Emeilia intervened and asked her own set of questions.

&quot;My Master? You&#39;re a fan of touchy subjects, aren&#39;t you?&quot; He raised an eyebrow, most likely embarrassing Emeilia as a result. &quot;Eh, no reason for me to be so boorish! I&#39;ll sate your curiosity this once: My Master was a Nirvana inhabitant. They didn&#39;t like the direction the city was headed so boom, headshot.&quot; He mimicked a gun with his fingers and fired at his head.

&quot;Do you get the picture now, dear lass? You will find that Nirvana&#39;s inhabitants are both eccentric <em>and</em> dangerous. Even towards their own kind.&quot; He crossed his arms, looking slightly more serious than usual. A sign that whatever had happened was no joking matter.

&quot;But anyway, enjoy your stay! ❤️&quot; He waved at the two. &quot;I have some business to attend to myself, but do not worry: I am <em>not</em> alone. If you ever need a hand, you can find me and a, uhm, <em>friend</em> of mine over at the <span class="mention">#stationery-store</span>. He will be sure to treat you well. <em>I think.</em>&quot;

The lack of confidence in his voice was not reassuring.</span>

They froze. Ace was a trained soldier, and when something came crushing through the underbrush, you typically filled it full of holes. William, on the other hand, would probably run off into the sunset, never to be seen again...

Shouting could be heard, along with the thudding of something massive. The faintest outline of a voice could be heard.

&quot;<strong>This should do. We&#39;re pretty far from the docks. I think we can stop bumbling about in the brush, now.</strong>&quot;

That voice was similar to both soldier and playwright alike! That voice was deep and rumbled enough to cause Nirvana&#39;s mountains to quake!

A man stepped into the clearing, suit ripped, eating a granola bar. His eyes narrowed and he looked around, realizing what he walked into. He glanced from William to Ace and his assistant, and back again.

What a blast from the past. Ace and the Nirvanan Servant. Plus something else. Did everyone just summon monstrosities these days? 

It seemed that picking a direction and &#39;hoping for the best&#39; did work out after all. Either Granel&#39;s luck was turning, or Donald had a rabbit&#39;s foot hidden somewhere in his mustache!

&quot;<strong>Long time no see, Soldier Boy.</strong>&quot; Granel said, raising a hand. &quot;<strong>And you made friends. Wonderful. Come out, Caster!</strong>&quot;

Maybe after this was all said and done they could sit down and discuss his penchant to ‘hit the jackpot’, so to speak. However, now was certainly not the time nor place. It was time for introductions!

“Sorry, Granel,” Donald stepped into view, hatless and with a nice hole in the front of his shirt. “That ship has— that joke has run its course.”

He coughed into his mouth, “Anywho, call me Donald. Donald McBane. Except ‘Soldier Boy’. You must call me Captain. Might not look the part, but I’ve run a few men around in my day.”

Hopefully no one knew whether that was true or not. It was, but the less they knew about him the more weight he could throw around.

“Oh, it’s you,” Donald finally recognized Caster. “Thanks for that help back there. Got anymore magic juice in your back pocket?”</span>

Before Berserker could fire off a shot, Emeilia ran past them which made Berserker lower their guard. The temperature slowly returned to normal afterwards.

&quot;We didn&#39;t see you when we landed so we figured the worst. You have no idea how refreshing it is to see a familiar face around here.&quot; The rookie sounded relieved to see another investigator alive and well. It also told Granel and Donald that they haven&#39;t ran into anyone else besides the pink Caster until they came around. How scattered were they?

Emeilia noticed the other figure next to Granel, who introduced themselves as Donald. &quot;Emeilia Lewis. It&#39;s nice to meet you, Donald. I take it you&#39;re Mr. Mason&#39;s servant?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite the less than reassuring tone that came with the news, Ace was pleased to hear of this peculiar friend from the playwright. So it wasn&#39;t farfetched to assume there were <em>others like Shakespeare</em>, people who were, at the very least, morally gray in this conflict. 

<em>They were not completely alone</em>. Potential allies lurked around the corner, allies they would desperately need if they were to both survive and bring back Nirvana&#39;s blueprints. If that didn&#39;t spell hope, he didn&#39;t know what else could.

But then the bush spoke.

Abruptly, the veteran locked, two outstretched arms directly aiming at the bush with a firearm, safety off. They&#39;d most likely spent too much time bantering with the playwright, a rookie mistake. Wendigo&#39;s numb cold reached him, a wake-up sign to face-off whatever was in that bush. Waiting for the first enemy to come up, Ace gritted his teeth...

...

But no enemy came.

The rookie was the first to dash, meeting the familiar and the not-so-familiar faces that crawled out of the undergrowth.

Behind him was a mustached fellow who looked tiny in comparison, called himself <em>Donald McBane</em>. The name didn&#39;t ring a bell, but the peculiar facial hair, accent and fashion style told him everything he needed to know: He was Mason&#39;s Servant.

&quot;Friends,&quot; Soldier boy echoed the guard as he turned around to meet the faces of his rookie, his monstrous Servant and William Shakespeare. &quot;Yeah. Lots of friends.&quot;

Slowly going back to a relaxed stance, Ace pocketed the gun and raised an arm to meet that of the humongous man&#39;s, turning his head towards Donald McBane.

&quot;I&#39;ve respect for men who&#39;ve served,&quot; He said solemnly. &quot;But I&#39;m proud to be from Geneva and I take orders only from Geneva. Call me Ace, I’ll call you Donald.&quot;

His magic juice comment didn&#39;t go unnoticed, it seemed like what Shakespeare had previously said was the truth. Reassuring.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ace hadn&#39;t changed. He was still curt, trained, and thoroughly professional. That wasn&#39;t all that surprising, though. He had probably been through far worse than a mere ship sinking, as tragic as that was.

Granel eyed the gun warily as Ace holstered the antique. He could easily tank several bullets, even without healing. He was a large man, but a shot to the head? There was no coming back from that. Ace would probably land it, too. Nine times out of ten.

The man didn&#39;t blink as the gun was holstered. Internally though, he breathed a sigh of relief.

&quot;<strong>Is that you, little Emelia?</strong>&quot; Granel boomed, rushing forward despite Wendigo&#39;s presence, scooping up Ace&#39;s assistant in a hug. &quot;<strong>I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re alright. I was worried sick for you and the other investigators. You all can take care of yourselves, I&#39;m sure, but I was still worried! It is lucky you ended up with Ace. It&#39;d take a dozen Nirvanans to bring him down.</strong>&quot;

The man ruffled the rookie investigator&#39;s hair, before standing up straight. This was wonderful news! Two investigators down, and many more to go. He rarely ran into Ace aboard the ship, but it was hard not to run into Emelia on patrol.

&quot;<strong>And this must be your Servant!</strong>&quot; The man turned towards Wendigo, unsure of what to make of it. Was it always this cold? Granel&#39;s spike was going to freeze the rest of his chest at this rate.

&quot;<strong>I&#39;m Granel Mason, former security guard aboard the Canopus. Thanks for protecting Ace and Emelia.</strong>&quot;

Awkward silence.

&quot;<strong>Ahem.</strong>&quot; Granel coughed, before turning to William. &quot;<strong>You.</strong>&quot;

It was a proclamation, an accusation, and an invitation rolled into one. <em>You</em>. Such a versatile word.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Sure hope so,” Donald said before Granel went to embrace Emelia. She seemed nice enough, and his Master liked her. Probably a good one to have survived the ship going kaputs. Easy to say when he didn’t know about any of them. Easier to not dwell on the thought.

Ace, though… a military man, through and through. Granel also thought of him. So far, he seemed no better than a stick in the mud. These might not be happy times, yet the time for seriousness was for tomorrow! Lightening up would do wonders for his health.

Oh, but the Scot knew all about the military life well enough. Did it for half his life, well enough to live through it and walk free. Not many could boast the same, and especially fewer that could sport the record of foolishness and bold actions as well. It was a very important part of his career and shaped him into the man he had been so long ago.

And he’d rather die than ever go back.

Ace would learn soon enough, Donald thought. They usually did. Or died. Or their neck would become a snake, considering the physical feat it would take to have ones head up their own arse. 

But he did not voice any of these thoughts. Instead, he countered. “Looks like I’ll save the worst rations fer you, soldier! In jest, of course.”

Although, once Granel even showed a sign that there was in fact yet <em>another</em> servant did his cheery mood dim. Almost as bad as that sea monster he had to fight back on the Canopus from looks alone. The very air around them was cold. Too cold for any normal servant, unless this was a reindeer. If they were, then they were doing an absolute awful job of bringing cheer to those who need it the most.</span>

Smelled as foul as the land after a battle, too. This creature was trouble, and there was no doubt about it. Donald put a hand on the hilt of his blade instinctively, yet made no move to draw it. If it hadn’t attacked them on sight and was under Ace’s control, it was fine for now.

Saber took a few steps over to Emelia while Granel focused on the bard. He bent down to be at head height, “Yer friend’s mutt is lookin’ a little… worse fer wear. ‘Ave ya been feedin’ it proper?” He whispered, hand covering his mouth as to protect his words from outside ears.</span>

It had been a while since he had exposed himself to such an audience, albeit he certainly didn&#39;t expect to meet the muscly pair from yesterday so soon again.

&quot;Baldy.&quot; He muttered with a nod, acknowledging Granel&#39;s presence as the security guard and his Servant seemed to have met Ace and his assistant a while back. He let them catch up for a bit, before the spotlight once again fell on him.

&quot;Magic juice? Why, I&#39;ll let you know that my enchantments come from words that can move the hearts of men! Even brutes.&quot; He stated quite proudly, before Granel introduced himself and saluted the group one by one, including him.

&quot;Ahem, yes. <em>Me</em>. It is a hard life, being a master playwright, since I am far too handsome to be unrecognized by others. Likewise, it is incredibly hard for me to forget someone with such a unique haircut.&quot; Shakespeare chuckled.

&quot;But I see that you all have met before. Good, good! I&#39;ll leave it to you to explain things for me, then. Even talented actors get tired of redoing the same scenes!&quot; He stared at Ace, implying that they should explain William&#39;s proposal to Granel. 

&quot;Keep the word out, because I&#39;d very much like to <em>not</em> get punched by your people while I&#39;m roaming around out there.&quot; He said while slowly directing himself towards shrubbery. &quot;You got that? Good! And the curtain falls.&quot; He clapped to himself before disappearing in the realm of foliage. Quite the amazing feat, considering his outfit stuck out like a sore thumb.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A hug. The least thing he would expect coming from a man such as Granel... no, come to think of it, he had had a similarly emotive reaction when Ace scolded that cabin boy back at the Canopus. Was the humongous guard much softer than his hardened muscles let on?

&quot;Not very talkative, is it,&quot; Ace interjected in the awkward silence following Granel&#39;s introduction to his Servant, half-smirking. &quot;It doesn&#39;t do jests like your Donald, but it has its own pros. As a matter of fact, <em>Wendigo</em>&#39;s the reason why the ship was able to make it to Nirvana in one piece. Props to it.&quot;

Noticing the hand Donald had placed on his small sword, Ace folded his arms, analytical. A rational reaction, the very same that he once had upon meeting Wendigo for the first time. As rustic as Donald looked upon first impression, it seemed he was far from being dumb. His military background had most likely played a part in him being that way, or that&#39;s what Ace liked to believe at least. 

It seemed like Granel had gotten his hands on a fine partner.

&quot;You know, Wendigo&#39;s very much like me,&quot; The veteran spoke over the Scot&#39;s whispers, candidly. &quot;It won&#39;t bite you, not unless you give it a reason to. Otherwise, it&#39;s fine to hang around with. <em>As long as you can stomach the stench</em>.&quot;

The playwright&#39;s words monopolized the conversation yet again. There was no denying that he helped them survive the encounter at the Canopus, but good lord, how easy was it for him to irritate Ace. Going so far as to leave the explaining in his hands when a measly ten seconds would&#39;ve been enough to speak his piece, he <em>definitely</em> couldn&#39;t handle him.

&quot;...right,&quot; Ace broke the silence left by the playwright’s swift departure, unmoved. &quot;Think I&#39;ll leave the explaining to the rookie after all.&quot;</span>

Still, it was a shock to witness his strength firsthand like this. It&#39;s not every day you meet someone who could promise to fold you in half and actually be able to do it after all.

Berserker did nothing but stare at Granel once they introduced themselves. Their beady dot-like eyes remained unblinking during the exchange. 

It was only when Ace spoke of Berserker&#39;s true name that they made a move. They leaned down to bring their face close to Ace&#39;s face. &quot;<strong>Ace, Wendigo is a Berserker.</strong>&quot; A slight thud was heard as Berserker patted their chest. Revealing their true name so haphazardly was a dangerous move, even towards allies. Who knows who might be listening in on them? To be scolded by Berserker though was quite an interesting experience indeed.

However, to Granel and Donald, they just heard this thing speak. Not even that, but they spoke with a feminine voice. Berserker was a woman? No. That voice sounded identical to Emeilia. Perhaps Berserker had the power to steal voices for their own. If so, then that is a frightening skill to have for a predator.</span>

This little secretive talk didn&#39;t last very long before Ace requested that she explain the situation to them. &quot;Right, sir! Caster he... oh.&quot; She stopped in mid-sentence once she realized that Shakespeare already made his departure off-stage without her realizing it. It was impressive to vanish with a hat that stuck out like that.

She cleared her throat before she continued. &quot;As I was saying, our Caster friend offered us information in exchange for protection. Because he helped us that day when we docked, he&#39;s being hunted just like we are.&quot; There she went on to catch them up to speed.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Good to know yer worst is a bite,” Donald swiftly responded. “Or the rotten-egg smell.” 

After that, he let Emelia give her lecture on what was going on. Of course, all the information was very important. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have the need to hear it! Saber made sure that he knew the general idea of the information she regurgitated. 

However, his mind was other places. Yea, yea, newspapers and Caster’s whereabouts, pertinent— the bloody dog just spoke. <em>And it sounded just like the lass</em>. This thing being a Wendigo sounded vaguely threatening, but it didn’t drive home the way it should. It was simply a creature that wasn’t present in his childhood. No folktales to instill fear in a troublesome child. 

Instead, his first instinct was mischief. It was as if it stole her voice. Used it as its own. Word for word. No processing the words, just saying them if it fit. 

And it just so happened that Donald had a colorful vocabulary to share with it!

The second Emelia finished recalling what Caster had said, The Scot got to work. He cleared his voice as loud as humanly possible, “My, what a, fucking, good retelling! Bloody, Hell, that was impressive.”

It was impossible to hide the shit-eating grin that sprung to life on his face, “Blimey, that Caster sure is a, lying sack o’ shit. Full of, horse shit. What a, bastard. Fuck. We should’ve strung him by ‘is privates and drug ‘im in the dirt!”

Now, the most important part of this experiment. Would this be a smashing success, or a crushing failure?

“Berserker,” Donald managed to get out between spontaneous laughter, “what do ya make of this?”</span>

Granel grew serious, electing to ignore Donald&#39;s cursed experiment until this was all organized in his head. This man, William, was on the run from Nirvana? What was the point of betraying the preserve for a team of poorly equipped investigators?

&quot;<strong>And why, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, would you throw away your buddy-buddy relationship with Nirvana fo—</strong>&quot; Granel turned to where Shakespeare was, only to see that the Servant had vanished. 

Self-Preservation B, everyone.

&quot;<strong>Wonderful. He&#39;s good at slinking away. Shame. If I could disappear like that, I&#39;d be unstoppable.</strong>&quot; Granel grumbled. The Nirvana Times™️, was it? He&#39;d have to get a subscription. If only so he could get to the bottom of this. Something was off about William Shakespeare, and he was going to get to the bottom of it.

Eventually.

Once he got to the bottom of a can of booze.

This was unfortunate, though. He had planned to assemble all the investigators together, but that seemed unlikely, and even strategically poor. Protecting everyone in a group would be easier, but it&#39;d also be easier for the full wrath of Nirvana to come crashing down on them.

If that happened, death was likely. The security guard grinded his teeth in annoyance. How could he keep everyone safe if he wasn&#39;t able to be everywhere at once? It was good that Ace&#39;s assistant was in capable hands, but what about everyone else?

In that sense, it was quite singular as far as regular Berserkers went. Ace could only shrug at Wendigo&#39;s scolding, not finding a retort or a valid counter-argument. Enemies <em>might&#39;ve</em> been listening to them, but if there truly were any, he had a feeling that Wendigo would be the first to speak up. Not to mention that solidarity, something they were also in dire need of, was built on the foundation of <em>trust</em>. Granel&#39;s Servant had disclosed his name so lightly, he felt like it was only natural to reciprocate in kind.

But the veteran was quick to raise his eyebrow to the Scot&#39;s unexpectedly loud cough, then the wide smirk followed by a flurry of insults. Just what did...

Oh. <em>Oh.</em>

Ace sighed as he came to the realization of what he was trying to do, visibly bothered. As high as he thought of the Scot when he mentioned his military background, it didn&#39;t prevent his image from slowly deteriorating as the laughs and the rudeness kept increasing in volume. A little <s>trolling</s>joking was fine once in a while, it helped build morale back up, but too much got in the way of things, and he had a sense that Donald might&#39;ve been a little too on the jokester side.

Fortunately, his Master was quick to put the discussion back on track. Professionalism, the one thing he would&#39;ve liked to see most in his fellow colleagues. There was at least one person that had some.

&quot;I agree,&quot; He voiced, leaning closer to the guard. &quot;Assembling the entire team&#39;s not doable. We don&#39;t know if any of them made it, nor can we pinpoint their whereabouts. Randomly walking through big-ass Nirvana is like begging to be found by one of those crazy lunatics, so combing through the island is also out of the question. Splitting up and dividing tasks among ourselves does seem like the better alternative.

&quot;We just need to pick a spot where we&#39;d stash those reports. We walked past a <span class="mention">#deserted-cottage</span> at the edge of the Lake, I reckon could use it as our own private stash spot. For now at least.

If the rancid smell of rotting flesh was terrible from a distance, it was far worse up close! This thing either needed a bath right away or given some perfume at the very least. 

Did Saber&#39;s plan work? The lack of an answer made the situation unsettling. Perhaps he made a mistake in grabbing the attention of Berserker.

That mood didn&#39;t stay that way for long though. Soon a familiar voice spoke back to Saber. 

&quot;<strong>Hell, that Caster bastard is a fucking lying sack o&#39; shit.</strong>&quot; The same spontaneous laughter echoed out from Berserker. Donald&#39;s accent was mimicked back to him perfectly. It was a success! If you can ignore Berserker&#39;s stillness as they parroted back Donald&#39;s words, of course.</span>

She wasn&#39;t in the slight mad about Donald teaching such words to Berserker. She was more upset at Berserker for even thinking that mimicking such words was okay! 

Like an owner scolding their pet, Emeilia got straight to telling Berserker why they shouldn&#39;t saying such things. Berserker only responded with confusion. They didn&#39;t understand the reasoning why certain words were &#39;bad&#39; compared to others. But, Berserker merely listened. The more words Berserker heard, the more they could mimic after all.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">No one else seemed to appreciate what he had done, but he didn’t care. He was hunched over, laughing his ass off as Berserker used some select words in his exact voice. Even funnier was the possibilities with how the beast could use this to its amusement or advantage. The idea of the next foe facing down a terrifying creature only for it to shout curses with a scottish accent was downright <em>hilarious</em>.

While Emelia went to scold Berserker for playing ‘monkey see, monkey do’, Donald slowly recovered and turned to face the two others. Who were hoping to get an opinion out of him. A question of ‘strength in numbers’ or ‘harder to hide in numbers’. 

“Not doable,” Donald wiped a stray tear from an eye, “my arse. Bloody sodding difficult? Aye. Impossible? Not at all!”

“You want to find yer people? Follow the ones huntin’ ‘em. They might have an idea on who’ll be where. Long as you don’t get caught immediately, all you’ve got to do then is follow and stop ‘em if they find someone. And I betcha nearly the <em>whole</em> bloody population’s lookin’. Don’t even have to keep ‘em all in one spot. Having multiple teams of small numbers would work.”

Was Donald insane as well as immature? Ace just said that they might not even have anyone to look for, let alone the manpower to search for stragglers. How could his idea even function in practice if it looked silly on paper?

“Granel, let me flip this around fer a moment: how many men did’ya have as ya came here, and how many of ‘em had <em>Servants</em>? Or a frame, like in my case? Cause if you’ve got even, say, eight o’ them…”

That’d make it work. All they’d need is to get lucky with even one fast historical figure. A Rider would suffice if their mount was at all able to traverse the lands easy enough. Sure, getting into contact with such a person would be hard as hell. However, it’d pay dividends to have.</span>

“Besides,” Donald rested his hands on his belt, “don’t think it’ll be necessary to share gossip in a cottage if it’s just us… five. Might need a few more folks to make the hassle worth much.”

He didn’t bother bringing up the fact that it was a certainty all of them present knew what a report was. Wendigo might not, but for some reason Saber didn’t think they’d be writing a report in the first place.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Yeah, <em>ask</em>. Genevan for &#39;I&#39;ll beat them black and blue until they give me what I want.&#39; It was wonderful how innocent one could turn something with a little switch in vocabulary.

Speaking of, Donald&#39;s experiment was paying off! Teaching a Berserker how to swear was like giving a Nirvanan a machine gun—stupid, idiotic, and very dangerous. It <em>was</em> quite amusing though, though Granel had to force himself from smiling. It&#39;d be bad for little Emelia to consider this as acceptable behavior from him.

&quot;<strong>Fine, but encrypt yours specifically. I assume you know Genevan Standard?</strong>&quot; Granel asked, before handwaving the question. Of course Ace did. &quot;<strong>If you&#39;re sharing information, it&#39;ll be valuable. I don&#39;t want anything getting leaked. I&#39;ll do the same.</strong>&quot;

If Granel needed help, he and Donald wouldn&#39;t have the time to write a message and wait for help to arrive. Ace&#39;s heart was logically in the right place, but out here, a few minutes delay could result in death. 

Except for him, naturally. He could survive a shotgun to the chest and stay standing.

Donald was right, but that also required one of the investigators to have a Rider, and also be capable of rounding everyone up. At least until there was an established chain of command, he would keep contact with Ace. His goal was to save the investigators, and to crush Nirvana.

And to fulfill his contract. He wasn&#39;t getting paid enough for this.

&quot;<strong>We&#39;ll be heading off, then. I don&#39;t want to stay here for too long.</strong>&quot; Granel turned away from Ace, before stuffing his hand into his bag and plucking out a can of...

<em>was that beer?</em>

&quot;<strong>Thanks for the info, Soldier Boy. Stay safe out there. You too, Wendi...who? Don&#39;t leave Ace&#39;s side, Emelia! Be safe.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Let&#39;s find somewhere to make camp, Donald. Oh, and here, for good luck.</strong>&quot; Granel tossed the can of beer towards Ace, tossing it high enough for the soldier to consider catching it.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ace shook his head no over the Scot&#39;s words. Risking his group&#39;s safety over a bunch of incompetent fools? This would truly be the worst way to play his card.

&quot;As a matter of fact, I <em>don&#39;t</em> want to find my people,&quot; He retorted, casually. &quot;My goal&#39;s to retrieve what I need to retrieve and figure out what I need to figure out, everything else is pretty damn irrelevant to me. Can&#39;t commit to tail those xenophobic pricks while I still have a <em>task</em> to carry out.

&quot;Besides that, you&#39;re right,&quot; He went on, carefully combing his hair back. &quot;If you two come across more of our beloved colleagues, <em>be sure to let them know about the stash</em>. It won&#39;t be that effective if it&#39;s just us writing in there. We need more brains, more eyes, more ears. Hopefully some that are <em>capable</em>, but really, any will do at this point.&quot;

Moving onto the guard&#39;s words, Ace was surprised to learn that he knew about Genevan Standard. And he was able to <em>replicate</em> it, too? What, did he carry the cipher in his bag? <em>Did he memorize it?</em> Regardless, if he knew about it, this confirmed that his age wasn&#39;t just for show. Big dude had definitely seen some shit. <em>He respected that.</em>

Then, the sunlight was blocked. By <em>something</em>. Reaching out with his hand, soldier boy caught the flying object he was thrown, turning his hand to take a gander at it. A can of... beer?

<em>What the fuck are you doing with a six-pack in your bag</em>, he was compelled to ask but ultimately decided against it. So absurd and unexpected, this couldn&#39;t help but tear a reaction out of him. For the second time since his arrival, the guard had managed to tear a smirk out of the veteran&#39;s face.

&quot;Right back at you,&quot; The vet&#39; uttered, a hint of playfulness in his voice. &quot;I hope to catch your letter soon, can&#39;t wait to see what your handwriting looks like.&quot;

With Ace leading the way, now heavier by one can of beer, the three-man group resumed their walk through the grassy woods.</span>

Much like a lot in his head, though, he kept his mouth shut. Instead, Donald simply shrugged, “Suit yerself, Soldier Boy. My interest in yer two’s crew goes as far as you want it to. No further.”

Not a lie. Any and all observations and thoughts about these missing people scattered around stopped before any true emotions got mixed in. Whether that was because he didn’t care, didn’t <em>want</em> to care, couldn’t care, wasn’t shared knowledge quite just yet. For now, people thought and he thought as well. Might as well make sure they didn’t toss him overboard yet. 

Not when the booze had yet to be drunk.

Speaking off, Granel tossed a can to Ace, much to his own dismay. The trio would watch the pair disappear into the undergrowth, but not silently.

“Granel, are’ya daft? That stuff’s gold ‘round here, and yer tossing it to anyone with a pulse?!”

More curses and exclamations dimmed out and died, enveloped by the gentle sway and call of the flora and fauna.</span>
