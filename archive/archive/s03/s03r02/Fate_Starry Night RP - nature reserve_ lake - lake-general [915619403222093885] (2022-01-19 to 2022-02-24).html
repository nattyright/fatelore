            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A bountiful man made lake created after the implementation of Nirvana’s river and irrigation system. It hasn’t been maintained in ages, but the system’s self-cleaning equipment seems to be functioning to this day. The lake has a high density of fish inhabiting it, along with small woodland creatures occupying the grassy areas. Rabbits, toads and cats are very common. Unlike other animals on the island, animals residing at the lake are relatively docile and tranquil. As a result, it is somewhat of a safe haven for the investigators.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A sharp boom resounded across the damp lands. The sound of flesh hitting flesh, quieted cries of pain. A young man rested on his knees, struggling for air in-between blows. The metallic taste of blood permeated his taste buds and overwhelmed his nose, his teary eyes kept him from getting a good look at his abusers. His then pretty, but now swollen face was the house to many traces of violence. Hues ranging from bright-red to blue-ish green.

<em>Thung!</em>

Another cry of pain, high-pitched. The young man clutched his lower abdomen, barely able to hold his sobs under the strain and the pain.

&quot;...stuhh... stob... blease stob...!&quot; Each word was muffled, accompanied by drool and spitting blood.

The torturer bent down, his hand reached out. The young man winced back, helpless and afraid at the mere sight of the torturer&#39;s fist. His eyes shut, bracing himself for the next blow, which never came. The two stood in silence, long seconds stretching before the beaten man finally reopened his eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ll stop,&quot; The torturer spoke, quietly. &quot;Once I&#39;m done asking you questions, <em>Henry.</em>.&quot;

<em>Thud!</em>

The torturer&#39;s fist hit the young man straight in his face, digging deep inside with the follow-through. Having to move his head hurt more than having his teeth punched in, more hemoglobin flowing into his mouth and down his throat. The torturer grabbed the young man&#39;s collar, shoving him onto the ground on his side. The sudden movement almost made him throw up.</span>

She tried her best to act as the voice of reason between the two of them in this situation. 

It was difficult to watch.</span>

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do it if it wasn&#39;t necessary,&quot; He responded, curt. &quot;The thing with people like him is, they&#39;re <em>obsessed</em>. So much so that they would sooner die than betray the concept or the person they&#39;re infatuated with...&quot;

The young man&#39;s muffled sobs punctuated every word, every breath. It was uncanny how monotone the veteran managed to sound while a grown man cried his guts out right beneath his feet.

&quot;...so the trick is to hurt them,&quot; He continued, leaning over the sobbing cultist. &quot;Again and again, past the point where they would rather die than be left alive.&quot;</span>

Ace couldn&#39;t tell, and frankly, he didn’t care. Firmly grabbing the young man&#39;s hair, he forcefully made him face him. Pain throbbed and thrummed through the cultist’s whole body, his thoughts moving like molasses. The only thing keeping him awake, pain aside, was the dreadful anticipation that there was even more pain to come. He dared not look at his torturer’s face, his eyeballs turning and turning in every direction, unable to focus on a single point.

&quot;I&#39;ll ask you once more,&quot; Ace spoke, tightening his hold. &quot;This <em>angel</em> you keep speaking of, is it a Servant? Did <em>Ruth Naomi</em> summon a Servant? Answer me!”</span>

The allure of blood called out to them. The desire to feed only worsened. How long has it been since their summoning that they indulged in the sweet taste of flesh? Days? Weeks? <em>Months?</em> In truth, it was just one day, but to them it felt like forever.</span>

When he felt the torturer’s grip on his head strengthen, he tried looking away, the furthest possible. Yet, despite his best attempts at ignoring it, he could see it in his peripheral vision still. He could feel its unhinged, infinite glare, the two blue dots slowly devouring what little sanity he had managed to retain from the beatings.

Noise kept building up inside the man’s head, his torturer’s questions now but a distant hum. His body uncontrollably shook, his face contorted in an expression that was far beyond fright. He opened his mouth, but no sounds came out. Forget answering the veteran’s question, the fact his feeble heart hadn’t stopped beating was a miracle on its own.

Mustering what little strength he had left before utter exhaustion, the cultist’s hand reached for the young girl that had passively stared up until now. A puny, last-ditch effort to perhaps…</span>

Emeilia was trembling. She wasn’t a soldier. She was just a rookie. All of this was new to her and, more importantly, it was frightening. She was <em>soft</em>.

It was expected though. All she knew of before this mission was life in Geneva and now she’s taking part of a mission that would certainly test any hardened soldiers of Geneva to their limits. Did the Brainics really think this was the best mission for someone like her to be their first? Ace wasn’t a Brainic himself so the answer was lost on him. However, there is an underlying potential underneath that untested exterior of hers. That much was known even to someone like Ace. 

To think what caused her to crack wasn’t the stress of this mission, nor the odds being stacked against them so much, but the fact that she cared too much about doing what was right.</span>

<em>The rookie.</em>

“Enough?” He repeated her words in disbelief… no, in <em>disappointment</em>. “Did you just tell me to <em>stop?</em>”

Leaving the young man’s side, Ace took long strides towards the rookie. His sunglasses prevented her from getting a good look at his expression, but judging by the bulging vein on his temple, it was fair to assume he was <em>pissed</em>.

Mere inches from her face, <em>way</em> too close for comfort, this scenario was reminiscent of their first meeting at Geneva’s train station: Countless doubts, a peculiar scenario uniting two very distinct individuals, and perhaps most notable…

<em>The clash of two vastly different mindsets</em>.

“These people,” He started, pointing at the beaten man with a finger. “Have declared <em>war</em> upon us. They wrecked our ship, they murdered all of our crew members, they chased us down to the confines of the island at the moment we set foot. And what’s worse? They did it all <em>without speaking a single word</em>.

“If it helps you cope, just remember that they’re <em>lunatics</em> and that they’ve probably done worse to the first two expedition teams. They didn’t pull their punches, we shouldn’t pull ours either.”</span>

While her expression showed fear, her eyes had the tinge of defiance inside of them. Her arms shook and her legs threatened to give out from the pressure of Ace’s intimidating aura alone. That flame was all that kept her standing. The very flame he instilled in her.

“I know what <em>these people</em> have done to us. I remember all of their faces, Ace. The knowledge that those very same people who died by their hands will never leave my memory while others will eventually forget!” Tears welled up in the corner of her eyes. It appears that Perfect memory can be more of a curse than a gift.

“But still, despite all of that, that doesn’t mean we should lower ourselves to their level out of vengeance. We have a mission to retrieve data and figure out what’s going on here. Let’s do that so we can leave this god-forsaken Cynosura and leave the inhabitants to rot. None of this ‘paying them back’.” 

Emeilia felt like throwing up. The tension and fear that built up inside of her made her want to take back every way she said, but it needed to be said. If she didn’t speak up, then who would?</span>

As such, I will fucking enlighten you, so listen to me closely.

&quot;These guys, they&#39;re a little fucked in the head,&quot; He said, loudly tapping on the side of the rookie&#39;s head. &quot;Of course they&#39;re fucked in the head, they&#39;re quite literally <em>fanatics</em>. You do have a perfect memory, but I feel like a little <em>reminder</em> is due: Before I started hurting him, all he would do was cry about how &#39;mother&#39; would come save him from the clutches of darkness, the darkness that the outsiders brought to their undisturbed heaven.&quot;

No matter the words he spoke, the rookie&#39;s resolved flame didn&#39;t budge. No matter how shaky her legs or how scared she really was, she kept up with the pressure. Kept up with the stare, with the speech, with every intimidating thing he threw her way. For someone so soft to resist authority to such an extent—just what was her deal? He didn&#39;t understand, and what he didn&#39;t understand usually tended to <em>piss him off even more.</em>

&quot;You know what I did?&quot; A rhetorical question, of course she knew. <em>Her memory was sublime.</em> &quot;I punched him in his pretty face, broke his pretty nose. When blood started running to his mouth, he immediately understood he was in for a <em>doozy</em>.

He told me the cult housed around 200 members. I kicked him in the guts, again. He almost threw up, but he managed to speak. Surprise, <em>the number went up</em>.

“So I kicked him again, and kicked him again, and kicked him again. The number kept rising whenever I kicked him, until it finally came to a stop. I kicked him around five more times to make sure, and fortunately for him, the number didn&#39;t move. I moved on to the next question.&quot;

The blunt yet painfully simple rendition of the events was suffocating to listen to. Each new word brought more animosity onto the table, not just against the poor boy, but also against <em>her</em>. It almost felt like the veteran would snap at the end of every new sentence.

&quot;Do you see where I&#39;m going with this?&quot; He asked, almost maniacal in his tone. <em>Pain brings out the truest face of men</em>. When subjected to enough pain, no amount of loyalty can keep you from giving answers. On this &#39;god-forsaken island&#39;, where the slightest bit of information can spell the difference between <em>life and death</em>, we can&#39;t afford not to be thorough. Not only are we outnumbered one to a fucking thousand, but we&#39;re also supposed to play nice to every fucker we meet?&quot;

Even closer, his nose almost touched hers. At such a distance, his thunderous voice couldn&#39;t help but hurt the young rookie&#39;s temples.

&quot;<strong>We can&#39;t! Afford! To play! Nice!</strong>&quot;</span>

This would be the last time her voice would have any semblance of strength within it. Whatever strength she had was spent. She was the first to break eye contact as she stared at the ground. Tears fell and dampened the soil beneath her.

“I don’t want to see someone like you become like them either. Geneva can’t lose someone like you.” She did her best to fight back the tears before they fell. The only fight she can still maintain. Ace simply needed to nudge her and it would be over. The rookie would be broken, but compliant.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He couldn&#39;t lose himself, Geneva couldn&#39;t allow to lose him. More than her repulsion for violence, Emeilia had once again spoken like a true Genevi. Putting the motherland first and foremost, it seemed she genuinely believed her words to hold meaning, that she acted for the betterment of the country by speaking up about her superior&#39;s actions. Beyond even that, the passion with which she conveyed her feelings—it had managed to very slightly move the veteran&#39;s heart. In a moment of lucidity, the veteran reached for his inner pockets, fumbling around until he got ahold of the thing he needed.

<em>A bullet</em>.

Instantly, his pissed-off face relaxed. His jaw hung loose, his entire posture shifted. He kept looking at her, his stare beyond range. It was like he was a different man from the one he used to be seconds ago. A nonchalant, perhaps softer man. Analyzing the rookie&#39;s features, this new man was taken aback.

Her pained expression, the shakiness in her arms and in her legs, the weariness on her face—had she been in that state since the beginning of their argument? Was that how she looked while he spat his words with overwhelming rage?

Noticing the tears welling on the rookie&#39;s eyes, he pulled his head back, giving her some much-needed breathing room. This was not worth breaking her psyche over. While it was true that sharpening a blade required it to be ground against stone, <em>there was no point if the blade broke at the end</em>.

&quot;...I haven&#39;t lost myself,&quot; He said, pointing to himself with his thumb. &quot;<em>This is exactly who I am.</em> The day I stop being thorough is the day I lose myself, and also the day Geneva loses me.

As a matter of fact, Geneva can&#39;t afford to lose <em>any of her children</em>. Every soldier falling on the battlefield constitutes a blow, no matter how small or insignificant that soldier might be.

&quot;And so,&quot; He finally added, turning his back to the rookie. &quot;If us two surviving and fulfilling our mission involves doing more of <em>this</em>, then I&#39;ll gladly do it again. A thousand times.&quot;

Faultlessly loyal and devoted to protect his fellow countrymen. Abandoning his honor? Disregarding his humanity? Those were <em>cheap prices</em> if it meant that he could do what he had been asked to and protect whom he belonged with.

Slowly, Ace left the rookie and walked back to the young man&#39;s side, crouching down to take a better look at his swollen face. His eyes were firmly shut, but he was very much still kicking, albeit <em>slightly unconscious</em>. He might&#39;ve went a little too hard on the poor boy.

&quot;...if you couldn&#39;t stomach what I did to this guy, take a hike. He might not be in shape to answer my questions… but <em>Wendigo still needs to eat.</em>&quot;</span>

Instead, he chose to preserve that flame inside of her. An interesting choice to say the least. Was it the best one? As long as it served the betterment of Geneva, then yes, it <strong>was</strong> the best choice.

Emeilia’s mouth opened as the words that Berserker needed to feast still caused her to perk up. This time, however, she had no words to speak in defence of the cultist. She backed down. 

“...Right. Sir.” With a nod, Emeilia took a shaky breath to steady herself and continued on ahead of them.

Emeilia knew it was pointless to keep fighting. If Ace told her that he hasn&#39;t lost himself, and neither will he lose himself, then that would be comfort enough for her to move on. After all…

<em>I don’t want to see someone like you become like them either. Geneva can’t lose someone like you.</em>

The veteran slowly got up from his crouching position, enjoying the quiet that followed the rookie&#39;s departure. A few moments passed before he turned to find his bloodthirsty Servant still staring at the unconscious morsel.

&quot;...come on,&quot; He called out, walking the same way Emeilia had. &quot;You&#39;re up, Wendigo. Make sure not to leave anything behind once you&#39;re done.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Unfortunately time eventually ran out and the order was given. The beast of famine was to feed once more. To indulge in this mortal sin of <strong>cannibalism</strong>. Consumption of the highest taboo. 

<em>Feast</em>

The hunger within called out. 

<em><strong>Feast</strong></em>

It clawed deep inside their twisted mind. This desire needed to be sated. It HAD to be. No other substitute could be able to replace the real thing in front of them. 

Saliva dripped from the inky void under the skull adorning their head. For the first time since their summoning, Berserker was given the opportunity to partake in what made them who they are. Nothing was going to stop Berserker from feasting. Even if Ace were to have a change of heart at the end, the only way to stop Berserker now was the total destruction of their spirit core. 

The cultist’s fate was sealed.

The first sound that echoed throughout the area was not a scream. No. Fortunately for them, they were unconscious. If they weren&#39;t though, Berserker would&#39;ve been too quick for them. It was the sickening sound of their skull crunching under the weight of Berserker’s jaws rang out first. 

Then it began.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Flesh was torn from bones. Bones were snapped and crushed. Organs ripped out and devoured. Blood coated Berserker and the ground beneath them. It was truly a feast for Berserker. One they took most pleasure in enjoying.

Their claws dug deep to get at the parts most desired, leaving behind bloodied frost that coated whatever was left of the cultist. If it wasn’t for the torn clothings worn by the cultist, it would’ve been almost impossible to discern that the pile of shattered bones and gore was actually a person, and not some animal torn apart by another.

Then it was done.

Blood and viscera dripped from Berserker’s mouth as they stood up. Their hands were coated with gore. Berserker wasn’t one to be wasteful. Each hand was picked clean before they continued onwards to follow Ace and Emeilia, leaving behind a twisted fact.

<strong>Berserker had feasted.</strong></span>
