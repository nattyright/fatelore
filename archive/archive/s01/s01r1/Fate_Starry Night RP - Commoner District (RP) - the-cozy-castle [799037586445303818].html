                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal shuffled over to his desk chair, carefully falling down into the upholstery without spilling a drop of his coffee. He set the mug down, reaching over to grab a small container and spilling a copious amount of sugar into the beverage. With a black stirring straw, he mixed in the sugar while staring daggers into that <em>damn</em> S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame.

It sat there, dead center in the middle of the apartment.

Cold.

Unmoving.

The pattern on the floor looked as fine as it did a few days ago, when he smuggled the frame up into his room in the dead of night. Ivan had initially been dismissive of the very idea of having Coal summon a servant remotely close to The Cozy Castle. However, the prospect of saying he had a servant summoned within the very building was too great to pass on. A failsafe in case...no, best not dwell on that.

Yet why hadn’t he been able to get the damn thing to work?!

He turned back to his currently open notebook, messy scribbles detailing the proper chants and pronunciations of all the hard words. The scholar had suggested he deviate from the ‘prim and proper’ but he also knew Phoenix said that as long as he did the chant, everything would work out. Phoenix knew more about this stuff then he did, as he even helped make sure his initial circle was up to snuff. The blood was grabbed from Ivan’s kitchen, hidden under the pretense of a new exotic dish being thought up. The container sat covered up in the miniature fridge, seeping into the metal. He couldn’t get a new one was the worst part.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He reached for his coffee, but his arm went a little too far. The dark liquid spilled all over the desk, quickly soaking into the precious pages. He grabbed the journal and set the mug back upright, but it was too late. The cover was dripping, almost all the pages now dark brown. The already hard to read scribbles turned into an unlegible mess. Thankfully that was all this one contained. 

He remembered most of the words, thankfully. The rest of it was just doodles done during lessons and money accounting. Not the important money accounting, which was safely tucked away in his locked drawer. The money accounting for how much he would need from the Grail. Four tickets off this god forsaken boat and enough money to straight up buy the property for the new Cozy Castle on the next ship over. Or the next one over. The number was stuck inside his head, like a bit of a popcorn kernel 
wedged firmly between his teeth and gums.

This was his chance to escape Persepolis, a dream city turned into an infighting hellscape by corruption and greed. He couldn’t afford to mess up his best shot. 

Life had other plans, as per usual.
Coal muttered curses while he went back into the kitchen, retrieving a few rags to clean up his spill. He kept the metal frame out of sight while walking back and forth, 

worried the sight of it would make him kick and potentially break it.
This worked out the other way, however. He forgot to step over the extended foot of the machine, tripping over it and flying down towards the side of his desk. He flung out his arms to try and catch himself, and it worked for the most part. Only his head collided with the hard wood, pain flaring up immediately. He dropped to a knee, clutching his new wound. His silent curses became very loud.</span>

A surprising amount, considering how fast it all happened. He remembered his mother talking to him about injuries to the head. What was it, they bleed a lot more than other wounds or something?
Great, now he was thinking about his parents. Cutthroat backstabbing worthless useless--
“AHHH,” he screamed, rising to his feet. “God fucking damn it, can I catch a break you fucking worthless machine!”
He turned and stood in front of the frame, emotionless to his anger. “You think you’re better than me?! Think you can do what you want? I’m doing the god damn chant exactly as the damn magic guy told me, as Phoenix told me, is that not good enough for you?! What, you want something special from me? You want my thoughts? Here’s my thoughts, fuck you!”
He wiped the blood from his head, splattering the crimson all over the machine, “Here, you want some of my blood too? Take it! Take it all! I’ll show you who’s the boss around here! I’ll do your stupid ritual:”</span>

Nothing.

Absolutely nothing.

Wrath turned to regret, which turned to defeat. He slumped back to the floor, hands by his side. He could feel the crimson starting to push past his eyebrows and dribble past his eyes. 

“...what more do I need to show I can do this?” he asked, staring past the feet of the 
frame into some unknown distant land.

His attention was stolen back as something caught his eye. A flicker of some sort. No, that was just some blood starting to get in his eye. He sighed deeply and reached over for the rag he had dropped earlier.

And then chaos ensued.

He was thrown back by the circle sparking to life, violently draining him of his magical energy. His back his the far wall as energy swirled inside the circle, a deep red whirlwind engulfing the machine. He could only watch in fear and confusion as magic began to take shape, filling out the details of the frame. Gone were the shiny metal bits and pieces all around, replaced with flesh and fabrics. Form was given to that without, until all that was left was a person much like any other human, but extremely different.

A servant.</span>

The floorboards creaked as loud squeals came from the circle, a feeling of despair and anger washed over the apartment and then silence… The violent magic had stopped and where there once stood a S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame was a hunched over relic of the past. The servant turned his head to see his master, staring him down with his piercing blue eyes, Claudius paid close attention to the wound on his master&#39;s head.  Coal would probably notice something odd about his servant — He was normal —. Claudius didn&#39;t have any magnificent garb or flaunt any magnificent weaponry… He just looked like a bum you could have found laying on the street. The only out of place object on him would have been the noose fastned round his neck.


Claudius turned the rest of his body towards his new master holding his hands deep in his pant pockets. He was waving his eyes around the apartment trying to figure out where he was. “Well now this seems much better than the last place I stood” He said with a chuckle thinking back to the gallows. “From the looks of it i&#39;ve been summoned, so I suppose a proper introduction is in order… Although i&#39;m rather shy about introductions, care to start?” As Caudius finished speaking he flashed a smile showing off a gross yellow pair of rotting teeth.</span>

His summons had finally worked after so long, only costing him any dignity and pride he once had. He was sure there was an odd fellow or two still in the rooms adjacent to his. 

And this is what he gets? No knight in shining armor, no fancy dressed people with only the most extravagant of clothing, not even a grotesque monster only see in nightmares. Instead, it was… a bum, to say the least. Well, those gross teeth were scary at least.

“My name is, uh, Coal. What’s yours?” He asked. Coal was unsure whether to feel excited that he had finally gotten a servant, or upset that he got one that looked like he lived down the block in the trash—wait, maybe that guy <em>was</em> the guy from the trash pile. 

He reached up and grabbed onto the window sill above, hauling himself off the ground. It was only now that he noticed that his possessions were sort of scattered across the room. Pillows were flat against the frames, smooshed by the magical energy. Well, three of them were. The fourth looked to have exploded from the force.</span>

As Claudius’s hand extended the caulius on the underside of his hands became visible, as well as dirt smeared across his arms. Cluadius had the hands of a working man “It&#39;s nice to make your acquaintance Master… But I wish you kept the place a little cleaner… Including yourself” He added referencing Coals injury from tripping.

Despite Claudius’s appearance he actually preferred a well furnished and clean home. Growing up his father was a well renowned Judge in New York. This led to Claudius having a very comfortable upbringing. He only took on his dirty appearance later in life when he became involved in the conflict between the American Colonies and England.

“Hey, it’s not my fault the place is a mess,” he said, taking his hand back. “Or me. I got this thing right before you came along…”

This was a servant. A <em>servant</em>. A real pseudo flesh and maybe blood servant. And <em>Coal</em> summoned him. No one else. Sure, a little help, but it was his willpower, circuits, and blood that made this happen. He knew he could do it, just needed a little elbow grease.

“So, uh… y-Yea, I’m your master! I’m the guy that brought you here! So uh, you know, maybe don’t run off. Please.” He stood confident but exhausted, adrenaline finally wearing off as the toll of his magical expenditure taking hold of his limbs. His shoulders felt hot, a soothing but wearing feeling for the man so adapted to the heat. 

“I’m still just… processing things. Yea. I think I gotta announce to the officials that I summoned a servant for this Holy Grail War.” He paused. He still had no clue what class this one belonged to. Coal didn’t know what classes had been claimed yet, holed inside his room with all major outside communication ways tuned out. Was this a Berserker that had a thing for cleanliness? Hopefully not.

“So, what’s your class? I’m not sure how many Sabers are know for… being hung?”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Claudius narrowed his eyes at Coal as he fumbled with his words. Clearly he lacked confidence, that was something he’d have to get over, or else Claudius will get annoyed rather quickly.

“Oh you get the impression I was hung? I wonder what gave that one away” he said with a chuckle tugging at the rope around his neck. “To answer your question I’m an assassin, and I was hung for doing the right thing, clean and simple.” 

As Claudius spoke he walked over to Coal’s desk taking a seat on his chair. “Now then Master how about you tidy up your room, I don&#39;t wish to live in this filth.” Assassin said drawing an ironic contrast to his present state. “Oh and Master some confidence if you will. Our enemies will walk all over us if you can&#39;t be assertive.”

Claudius ordered Coal to clean his room as a test of character. Claudius figured if his master was strong willed he would put Claudius in his place. If his master was as weak minded as he seemed, then they would have some work to do.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Not only did Coal get an Assassin of all classes, he got one he had never heard of and bossy to boot. If it wasn’t for the toll the summoning took on his body he would’ve been in Claudius’ face. Alright, maybe not in his face, but he would be ready to throw hands. Being the supposed weakest class just gave him the confidence to attempt to beat him up.

Instead, he balled his fists and tried counting to ten slowly. His brother taught him that trick, to help him not explode on people that ticked him off. It worked occasionally! Each number was just a number this time around, neither growing or halting his annoyance to the situation at hand. Man, just had to get a servant of the weakest class that was also just like his parents. 

“First off,” he said tensely, “I won’t let anyone walk over me. That includes you. Second off, I wasn’t the one who made this mess, as I said before. Third off, if you don’t want to live in such a <em>disgusting</em> environment then maybe you should get your own hands dirty. Well, dirtier than they already are. If you catch my drift.”

Coal went over to the closest of the two beds, taking a seat on the soft white covers. “And finally I don’t even know what ‘the right thing’ is, anyway. Slitting a throat or two don’t make you special, it just makes you a lowlife of either of the two factions.”</span>

Claudius stood up from the chair and paced around the room. “Well if it&#39;s not your fault the room is so messy who&#39;s it? You ought to own up to your own actions even if it means taking the consequences” He said pointing towards the rope around his neck.

“I suppose a messy room is nothing to fuss about in the grand scheme of things. There&#39;s work to be done isn&#39;t their Master? Throats to slit as you put it?” Claudius walked his way over to Coal looking down at his seated master “Oh and if I may add one thing real fast… I think this’ll be an important piece of wisdom for the upcoming future” Claudius then leaned over placing his face right in Coals as if he were about to tell him a secret. The smell of rotting teeth would penetrate Coals nose as the dirt man breathed against his face. “It&#39;s not about who you kill, it&#39;s about why you do it… That&#39;s what put me in the right, I hope together we can accomplish the same type of virtue.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And he was nutso. The Throne really spit on Coal this time around, didn’t it? It took his plea for help and threw it into the dirt, and then grabbed up that AND this guy and threw it back at him. It didn’t surprise him that the assassin was justifying his existence or whatever, but something must have gone wrong when the Throne filled the guy in on what&#39;s going on around these parts. Might&#39;ve hit him on the head with a bag of dirt instead. 

And his stench. Scratch off everything else he had to do, first priority was teaching this guy hygiene. “Alright, my first order as your master is to learn how to respect my personal space,” he said, sliding over and standing back up from the soft bed. “Unless you can figure out how to use a toothbrush. And I’m not getting into any arguments with you about ‘right’ or whatever that bullshit is. If I wanted to talk about it I’d just go home and hang out with my family for twenty minutes. Unless we’re going to discuss how you plan on putting just about half the people in this damn city six feet under, minimum.”

Coal went over to the miniature kitchen and started closing the few cabinet doors that had flung open. “Now, I have an actual question for you: do you need to eat at all or anything like that? Let me know now, because Mana Batteries are already expensive enough as is. An extra mouth to feed is gonna put a huge dent into my finances.” He grabbed a round, red fruit out of a basket resting on a counter top, taking a huge bite out of the surface.</span>

Claudius took a step back from Coal as per request and made his way back over to the desk chair. The Assassin was glad that his master didnt care to talk about right and wrong, Claudius took this as a sign of determination, whether his judgement was accurate, who could say.

“Well if you want me to put down half the people in the city I can certainly do it. I&#39;m an Assassin aren&#39;t I? It’s what I&#39;m good at, I kill people before they even have a chance to know their life is in danger” Claudius grinned at the prospect of going on a rampage through the city. 

“Oh and as for food, that&#39;s what mana is for, so no need to feed me… Although I am quite curious about modern day cuisine. Back in the colonies I reckon I ate pretty well for a man of my stature. Baked onions, deer and fowl. Fowl was always my favorite, mum made a pretty good lookin bird for thanksgiving i&#39;ll tell ya.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Colonies. Coal could’ve swore he heard about those things before. Something the Old World had. He didn’t know when in the hell they were around or what the deal about them was, but it narrowed it down to ‘Before the New World’ when everything got covered in Grail Mud or something. 

And then he got back on track. “No the fuck you will not ‘put down half the city’,” he said between globs of fruit in his mouth. “Odds are you’d either be gunned-slashed-beaten down by a police servant, a servant owned by some hot shot, or someone would just activate the kill switch in your frame. You can gamble on which one would be your death, but what I would do is somehow summon you again just to beat the ever living shit out of you. No getting into trouble to get us out of this war before we even start, you hear? Or you got your ears full of dirt too?” Coal swallowed the mush in his mouth, wiping away the sticky sweet juice around the outer edges of his lips

Coal took another bite of his fruit, thinking about how in the living hell he was going to beat the enemy servants with the help of this dirt bag. The concept of fighting a servant alone was suicide, but he didn’t think this guy could stand up to any of them in any situation. Maybe he’d have to call in the scarce few favors he’d been saving for a rainy day. That or they bunker down in some undisclosed hole and wait for there to be just a couple Master-Servant pairs left.</span>

Claudius however, didn&#39;t care much to prove himself to his master. His endeavors were mostly selfish so his Coal’s opinion would have only the slightest of impacts.

“Frustrated with me are ya?” The Assassin asked with a chuckle. “Well now you did summon me, what shame to hate something you put so much work into” Claudius waltzed over to the basket of fruit on Coals kitchen top, pulling an apple from it mimicking his master. “Don&#39;t worry though Master you don&#39;t have ta be scared of me screwing ya over yeah? As far as i’m concerned this relationship between me and you, its supposed to be mutually beneficial.” Claudius then took a bite from the apple curious to see if his resurrected self could taste.

“For me to operate at my best though I should become acquainted with this world.” As Claudius spoke his mouth was full of apple bits, not a pleasant sight in the slightest. “Whaddya say you show an old cowboy his way ‘round town?”

The name eluded Coal, who at this point was just about to give up on where this guy could be from. Maybe a look online later would help narrow it down. 

“I CAN show you around. Not sure how good of an idea it is… fuck it, whatever. You got that thing where you can look normal, right? As long as you don’t cause trouble or give off Servant energy we should be okay to take a look around. We’re not going too far, though. Just down to the place so I can tell the officials that I’ve got my servant summoned and what class you are.”

Coal pushed pass the stealing bum and to the front door, just a few steps from the tiny kitchen. He unlatched the brass lock and swung open the sturdy oak, holding the door open for Claudius. He lead the pair down the old-style hallway, which could’ve been right from ye days of old if it weren’t for the modern lighting and lack of smell.

Down a creaky staircase leads to an open looking lounging area straight from medieval times, reminiscent of the buildings old purpose of temporary housing. It’s mostly empty, but a few blemishes resembling people sit behind the newly installed wall of cloudy glass. On the right are the remnants of a desk stand. Behind stands a burly man dressed nicely but not expensively, currently devouring a bowl of leafy greens mixed with some hints of red and purple. A TV hangs on a wall beside the flight of stairs, quietly discussing the news.”</span>

He felt it was important to become familiar with his surroundings. If Claudius could make himself feel at home he could probably operate to his best of abilities.

“A problem with my appearance is there eh?” He asked jokingly followed by a chuckle. Claudius wasnt dumb, it was easy to assume the outdateness of his appearance. “So be it” and just like magic his appearance would change. His face appeared like a bizarre cross between Coals and his own and his clothes look similar to Coals however the colors were a navy blue. 

Claudius followed close behind Coal peering at the people minding their own business. Did his master own a restaurant or something? 

“The Cozy castle huh?” Claudius stated, he took a deeper look at the place finding he quite liked the surroundings. It reminded him somewhat of his own time, it was certainly cozy to say the least. “I must say Master I quite like it here”

On the way, we can stop and get some mana batteries maybe…” Coal said. He kept going forward, still not taking a look at his servant and their new appearance. As they walked past the front desk Coal gave a wave to the man finishing the salad and approached the front entrance. 

“So I hope you’re able to stand the chill…” he started, only to cut himself off when he finally turned to face Claudius. Well, he didn’t look like the same guy. Instead, it was a near perfect copy of himself, minus the color of his clothes. He even copied the Cog Ring snug around his ring finger. He inspected the servant closely, eyeing him from his short stocky hair to his nice pair of black work boots. 

He sighed and turned back around, pushing open the heavy door. A slight chilly breeze blew into the tavern, causing Coal to shudder despite the many layers he has on. “If anyone asks, you’re my identical twin named… I’ll think of something, give me a minute…”</span>
