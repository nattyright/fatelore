                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Frederick had been a failure.

Not in terms of power. Sabre was strong, perhaps even strong enough to win the war and claim the grail. He was a failure not in strength, but in temperament. His detestable personality and unearned pride gave him the wrong idea that he could bark and bite and trash about, like a poorly trained attack dog. Szrac recalled how the emperor marched about, greeting everyone he passed with a kind smile and warm salutations, all the while treating his master with such disdain.

A weapon that did not act in accordance with the wielder had no purpose on the battlefield. This time, he hoped that the Throne of Heroes could present a more capable blade, better suited to slicing the neck of his enemies.

The cyborg stood once more within the unmarked room, standing next to the terminal across from the S.E.R.V.A.N.T exoskeleton. Cables and wires snaked around his feet, speakers and screens whirring with the gentle signs of life. Yet this time, he had not been joined with the same contingent of hard-working scientists.

That was for one reason, and one reason alone.

<strong>PERSECORP THRONE.OS SUMMONING WIZARD</strong>
<em>Please select the class you would like to summon.</em>

Clicking the text, it transformed into a drop down box, seven classes awaiting him. Many would default to the strength of the three knight classes, or perhaps the wit of the cavalry classes. Yet Szrac had no need of either.

<em>BERSERKER</em>

To trap his servant within the chains of madness, to trade away sanity in exchange for even greater strength. A harsh exchange to make, but the lack of an intact mind would not detract from their task. 

<em><strong>!!!WARNING!!!</strong></em>
<em>Berserkers are notoriously known for their difficulty to handle, and have caused much damage to public property and incurred many deaths.

<em>YES.</em>

Click. His eyes flicked away, down to the bottom right corner.

<em>Would you like to start Summoning.exe?</em>
<em>YES.</em>

Click.

Szrac stepped away from the computer as it set to work. The apparatus surrounding the exoskeleton lit up, accompanied by a fierce array of flashing lights and the noise of static. Soon, the cacophony that offended both sight and sound would grow louder and louder, mana beginning to swirl around the mechanical body like flesh around bone.

It was a summoning, though not how one might remember it. Through the use of machines, Szrac had removed the reliance on luck and chance, of needless pageantry and obnoxious timewasting rituals. It was pure perfection in iron and steel, powered by the very heart of Persepolis&#39; technological empire.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The swirls of magic created a man of old times. Dark skin followed shortly by soft orange silks and expertly crafted clothes. Bulky legs followed a fit torso, which held two thick arms and stocky hands. Golden jewelry adorned each hand, easily three rings for each hand. No jewelry was embedded inside the shining bands, not even a carving of any sort. Perfectly smooth.
And last was the head for the frame. A beard was first, not wide but long enough to reach the top of his chest. Another two bands of gold held the strands together, uniform in presentation. Next 
followed the mouth and nose and eyes, closed to the world. 

And followed the hair, donned with a crown of glimmering gold. It was not the royal hats worn by the monarchs of old, but instead a simple headband-like piece that didn’t wrap fully around his head. Etched into the metal was intricate carvings, swirls and loops going into and out of each other in an almost mesmerising pattern. Energy boomed out as the final touches were applied and the summoning finished its course.

And he was here. 

A Berserker.

And then his eyes opened. Confident orbs surveyed the room, taking stock of all that he could see. The last two rings of gold eyed everything, living and lifeless. It took him about thirty seconds to finish his initial assessment, dead silent as he nodded to himself. Anyone who caught his gaze might look away in terror, as his was merciless. He stood tall and proud as he finally met eyes with the odd one out, a man who looked to be made of metal himself. 

He locked his gaze, “This is not the summoning fit for a king, but I will overlook this slight for the time being. I surmise that it is you that called me here, correct?” He took a step forward, crossing his arms with his hands forming tightly knitted fists.</span>

At first glance, they did not seem to be a Berserker. They were close to human in appearance, and their greeting did not give away any obvious signs of vocal madness. Yet that did not mean that they weren&#39;t worthy of the title. Indeed, it would be difficult to gauge their depths of insanity without further examination, though the cyborg was certainly not lacking in terms of time.

His response did cause a hint of worry to rise. It was that same disgusting aura of superiority that caused him to despise his previous Saber with such utter vitriol. Yet Szrac resolved not to jump to any conclusions, at least, not right now. 

First, a greeting. Something to develop a connection, to give his servant a sense that they were not just a weapon of violence, but a real human.

A false sense, but a sense nonetheless.

<strong>&quot;Greetings, being from the Throne of Heroes. You are correct: I am the one that has called you to the present. There is a war to be waged, and a Holy Grail to be won. I trust from such knowledge alone you can glean the importance of this coming battle.&quot;</strong></span>

“You appear to have a readily available amount of both men and wealth at your disposal, yes? Tell me the assets available, so I may understand who I am working with. After all, those with wealth must be willing to donate to such a worthy cause, a war in your words.”

He slowly made his way even more forward, until he was mere feet away from his new master. He eyed the man up and down, taking stock of every little detail. “A man of metal? Oh how the Throne loves its ironies. If these were less serious circumstances I’d even laugh!”

He put his hand out, “What do I owe the pleasure of working with? A man such as yourself must be congratulated for their achievements. Summoning a king is no easy matter, and even more so for one such as me. For giving me the opportunity to amass my riches once again, as I did in the days of old, before even the notion of technology was foreign.”</span>

An imperceptible gesture, but one that captured his current feelings perfectly. He was caught off-guard by just how articulate this Berserker was, with their ability to speak in coherent seasons, and their overall reason. 

Still, that could all change in any given moment. Madness Enhancement was an esoteric thing, still poorly understood by those who studied it. The cyborg heard many horror stories of Berserkers going on a rampage at the slightest unknown trigger. 

He was determined not to repeat such folly.

<strong>&quot;We work on the behalf of the Aristocracy faction. Through our efforts to attain the Holy Grail, we will receive funding from members of the noble families who work here. It is through their support that we can maintain this position of privilege with the heart of the city, the Power Plant. So long as we remain here, none will be so foolish as to intrude.&quot;</strong> Szrac informed Berserker of the current circumstances, catching them up to speed.

And then, Midas offered a handshake.

Szrac seemed to falter for a moment, unsure of whether to accept the offer or not. Was this some elaborate trick? Perhaps their servant was some vicious murderer, playing dumb to lure him into a false sense of security? That was a risk that could not be afforded. Thus, he remained still.

<strong>&quot;My name is Szrac Vaughn. If I may be so bold, I would offer the same question of identity towards you.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas kept his hand outward for a few lingering seconds. Eyes unmoving until it was certain he would not shake his hand. 

Midas chuckled. A single laugh escaped his lips, a hint of a smile breaking his emotionless facade. He withdrew his hand, reaching over for an object right beside him. The first thing that came to his grasp was a ballpoint pen, as boring an object as they come. Readily available, too. He grabbed the tool and held it forward towards Szrac.

And it <em>changed</em>. Replacing the clear plastic showing the body of the pen slowly turned. Transparency changed into a golden opaque which encroached and ate up the material. It only took a few seconds for this transformation to occur, but once finished the pen shined brightly in the room, light or not. A beautiful treasure, once a few pennies now a very small fortune. 

“Actions speak louder than words, I’ve been told. And Wealth speaks louder than all.” He flicked his ears, which were the most inhuman thing about the man. Instead of normal human ears, he had atop his head a pair of furry triangles. They twitched and scanned the room for anything out of the ordinary.

“You have the privilege of the esteemed company of King Midas. Don’t forget it, or it will be the last thing you do.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The master soon found his decision not to trust his servant a justified one. The pen turned to gold within his grasp, simple plastic corrupted into a new extravagant form. As he laughed at his own display of power, his inhuman ears twitched and shifted, drawing the eye to them.

There was no doubt about it. This was Midas, he whose touch turned all into wealth. The legendary king cursed by Apollo with the ears of an ass. Berserker themselves confirmed as much moments later.

From this knowledge, Szrac was able to better gauge the capabilities of his servant. Midas was a figure from Ancient Greece, deeply entrenched within the mysteries of millennia past. That, paired with the enhancements provided by Madness Enhancement, meant that Berserker was most capable, as far as servants went. Certainly strong enough to attain victory in a Holy Grail War.

And yet, that also made his servant that much less trustworthy.

<strong>&quot;Noted.&quot;</strong> Szrac replied, the distrust in his voice smothered by overwhelming neutrality. <strong>&quot;You have done well to answer my questions. I shall grant you knowledge in kind. Tell me what of this world you wish to know, and I shall answer you.&quot;</strong></span>

Rather, the lack thereof.” He took his hand back and assumed his crossed arm stance once again. “No, the only knowledge I desire is about our current financial status.”

He turned around, pacing around the room with firm shaking steps. Anyone standing in his way would be pushed against, all objects pushed out of the way with the kick of his foot. Said kick sent a chair spinning violently into a wall, cracking the flimsy plastic against the hard material.

“How much money is allotted to us from supposed higher up? How considerable is the idea of demanding more, how much is paid to these miserable lowlifes,” he motioned to everyone in the room besides Szrac. Whether they took it personally or not, he continued. “What options are there for gaining more wealth? Are there any residences nearby we can convince to lend us more monetary aid?”

And then he stopped, back turned away from Szrac. He turned his head 90 degrees, single eye penetrating the mask Szrac wore. “And the most important question of all: How much wealth do you possess currently, and of that amount, how much are you willing to give to your king?” There was a dangerous glint to his eye, hints of anger furrowing his brow.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The king took a turn for the irate, not wishing for any knowledge of the world, but instead of wealth. It was an odd fixation, but certainly one that the cyborg could work around. After all, the Aristocracy controlled all legal flow of wealth within Persepolis.

<strong>&quot;Provided that we can sway the aristocratic houses to our side, then I am certain we can acquire as much wealth as is required. If not, then we will simply wrench it from the hands of the criminal mafia.&quot;</strong> Szrac replied, glancing out the nearby window. This late at night, it seemed peaceful and serene, yet underneath that facade crawled the scum of the earth, killing and murdering for the slightest chance of a quick buck.

They would be crushed like roaches, and cleared aside by the rightful victors.

The topic then turned to Szrac&#39;s own wealth. He had little need or want for currency outside of the essentials. Spare parts for his suit and nutrient paste was enough to keep him alive, and the occasional mechanism to tinker with. As of such, his bank account lay mostly untouched, slowly filling with time.

<strong>&quot;My current balance with the Persepolis Bank is forty thousand five hundred and sixteen dollars. You may possess all of it, should you be capable of obtaining victory in this Holy Grail War.&quot;</strong></span>

Any hint of frustration turned to immediate pity as he turned away from the man, facing forward towards the wall and any scientists in the way. He dropped his arms, fists balled tight. The golden pen still in his hand snapped from the pressure, golden shavings erupting between his fingers. 

“So a fool is still easily parted from his wealth,” Midas sighed. “and here I was thinking I was among an equal. Know this, supposed ‘Master’ o mine. I will accept your offer with disdain, and I will hold your words to your actions soon enough. I expect the money to be all accounted for and present within the coming days, wherever I decide to house myself.”

He paced back towards the door to the room, standing far back enough for someone else to open the door for him, “Now, show me the grounds which we are housed in. I will decide a suitable Throne room and secure enough room to house my future riches. If no such place exists on the premises, then I will scour the nearby land for a location that meets my requirements. After this, you will fill me in on the notable Aristocracy Houses that can be persuaded to lend us monetary aid and commoners we can tax or kill, depending on which faction they align with. It is time the peasantry knew of their new king.”

He would stand in front of the door, waiting for anyone at all to open the flimsy material for him. Whether it was because he did not want to turn the knob into gold and thus potentially hinder their path forward or because he did not see himself low enough to be opening doors, he gave no indication. Along with this, he kept his grip firmly on the now broken pen, knuckles white and pen pointing two non-parallel directions.</span>

From there, you may choose which properties best catch your interest, and the details that would be involved in...&quot;</strong>

And thus, the partnership of iron and gold was born. But would they succeed in laying claim to the Grail? Or only in spreading violence among the populous they sought to rule?
