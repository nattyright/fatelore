                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Several days had passed since the apocalypse itself had descended upon the docks. The aristocracy did nothing, of course, much to Pascal&#39;s chagrin. Sandro and Rider turned out to be right: The aristocracy was far too shackled by their own pride, greed and bureaucracy to care about the needs of Persepolis as a whole.

Granted, this gave him and Armstrong the perfect chance to escape the Crab &amp; Lettuce. At this point, they were fugitives after defeating Saber in plain day. Pascal was paranoid. Paranoid that the metal man and its fellow aristocratic associates had already formed a search party to eliminate him and Rider. He would have done the same if he heard of someone defeating Saber.

Hiding in the apartment buildings was one way of addressing those worries. The commoners were too worried about the destroyed docks and the desecrated graves to notice that two individuals had sneaked inside one of the rooms. But they couldn&#39;t hide away forever. Every journey had to end, and every book had a last page.

When Pascal caught the bounty for Szrac on the news, he knew that it was time for him to take action.

&quot;Rider. Rider!&quot; Pascal shouted out loud in the middle of the morning. He stared at a bounty poster that was on top of his table. 

&quot;The aristocracy isn&#39;t supporting the tin can anymore. They even put out a bounty for him. You know what this means? This is our <strong>last</strong> chance to get rid of him.&quot; He said with a tired pant. Clearly, he wanted Szrac out of the picture as much as anyone else. This wasn&#39;t excitement. It was <em>fear</em>. The last fight had affected him so much that he just wanted to see the tin can man disappear.

Armstrong would most likely approve of taking initiative and bringing the fight to Midas, but who knew if he would approve of his Master being afraid of his own opponent? Confronting someone with confidence was brave, but doing so out of fear was the height of foolishness. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal&#39;s desperate move hadn&#39;t taken long following the defeat of Saber. After their gamble, Pascal was certain that Armstrong had bitten the dust. On one hand, it meant that Pascal had no need to fight in the Holy Grail War, meaning he didn&#39;t need to risk his life, nor was he the target of Szrac and Berserker. On the other, it had been pretty sad to see his Servant disappear, even if it was in a blaze of glory.

That was, until several hours later, he came knocking at Pascal&#39;s door, threatening to fade completely.

Several mana batteries, joyous reunions, and dozens of panic attacks later, the two had come to the conclusion to move their base of operations. An apartment was more expensive than living for next to nothing above a failing restaurant, but they had to move shop, and so they did.

Armstrong had been sitting on the couch, absentmindedly fiddling with some discarded pipe cleaners. He twisted and turned them into some odd, bladed vehicle. He gave it a whirl, and it flew across the room, using its propeller to generate thrust. It made it several feet, before thudding to the floor. Armstrong sighed. &quot;Damn. If only we had some rubber bands.&quot;

He didn&#39;t seem as excited as Pascal had expected. If anything, he seemed down in the dumps.

&quot;Ah, so Berserker&#39;s still kicking? I doubt he&#39;s been sticking to himself, so some Servant probably lost to him. You want to go and fight him, too? Good! However, don&#39;t be so careless, Houston.&quot; Rider said, before failing to elaborate. Armstrong was stretched out in his button shirt and tie, having left his armor in the closet for the time being. Sensing his Master&#39;s confusion, the Servant continued.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;There&#39;s a chance that this is a trap designed to lure the remaining Servants and Masters in. If that&#39;s the case, Gagarin has probably prepared a trap designed to strike down a Servant. If it&#39;s real, we&#39;ll need an ally to face Berserker. Additionally, I want to do a head count on who&#39;s still in the Holy Grail War before we do something as rash as fight against Berserker. What if he an ally?&quot;

With that, Armstrong quickly polished his ID badge, squinting at it self consciously. Was it really that dirty? He&#39;d best polish it again just to be sure. &quot;I&#39;d like to speak with a Servant most likely to know the state of the war. Assassin, who is capable of sneaking around the battlefield without being known would be a mine of information. Caster, for a similar reason. 
 Unfortunately, we have no way of finding out who those two are, or who their Masters might be. Without that, we have no hope of finding them. However...&quot; Armstrong stopped polishing for a moment.

&quot;<strong>Archer</strong> is capable of leaving their Master for a short while, as well as blessed with superior surveying ability.&quot; Armstrong looked up at his Master. &quot;We know who his Master is, as well—an Aristocrat. This is an excellent opportunity to see if Berserker controls the Aristocracy, or to see if the bounty is real.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;So what if it&#39;s a trap? There&#39;s not much else for us to do anyway.&quot; Pascal pointed out, feeling frustrated at Armstrong&#39;s logic. He was technically correct, but his plan wasn&#39;t entirely in the right.

&quot;We don&#39;t know where Assassin or Caster are. We don&#39;t even know if they are still <em>alive</em> either. Archer is under the service of an aristocrat, but are we really going to start knocking on aristocrat doors just to find her? Give me a break.&quot; Pascal scoffed.

&quot;Trust me, this man, Szrac Vaughn...He is our biggest threat.&quot; Pascal muttered before casting a serious glance over to Armstrong. 

&quot;<strong>Because I asked Sandro about him.</strong> You weren&#39;t there at the time, but he told me a few things before he left: He told me that he had never heard of a man called Szrac, nor had he heard of a tin can being affiliated with the aristocracy. I am pretty sure that Szrac is a wild card, just like us.&quot; Pascal pointed out. It was true: Pascal wasn&#39;t even an associate of the mafia. He participated in the Grail War by pure accident. Was Szrac the same? A man who fought for the aristocracy, but wasn&#39;t a full-fledged member?

&quot;Sandro also told me to not trust Archer and their Master. He called them many things. Manipulative, shrewd, opportunistic...and <strong>strong.</strong> If we find them, they will be our enemies, no doubt.&quot; Pascal said with a frown. The time for alliances had come and gone. From this moment onward, it was every man for himself.

&quot;That&#39;s why I wouldn&#39;t trust them. They would most likely just use us as pawns, just like how Sandro and Saber were pawns. In the end, it&#39;s best for us to work alone.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Armstrong twirled a pipe cleaner on his finger. It was good to know that Sandro was being grilled by Pascal while he was lingering on death&#39;s door. Not that he could blame Pascal—he thought he was on his way out as well. Still, it irked the American cosmonaut a bit. 

&quot;All that implies is that Sandro isn&#39;t well connected within the Aristocracy, not that I&#39;m overly surprised. Maybe they&#39;re more fractured than we thought. The entire Aristocracy being pinned down by this Szrac guy is pretty embarrassing.&quot; Armstrong&#39;s American accent butchered the pronunciation of the thug&#39;s name, though he didn&#39;t seem to notice.

&quot;Finding Archer would be a lot easier than you think. Catch.&quot; Armstrong said, quickly folding a paper airplane and tossing it to Pascal. It flew elegantly, doing several loop-de-loops and threatening to knock Pascal&#39;s hat off his head, before landing in his hands. Unfolding the paper revealed...

A completely black piece of paper. Wee.

Wait, this wasn&#39;t a black paper. Squinting closer onto it would reveal what looked like a series of symbols. Was that a +? An x? A sigma sign?

&quot;You solve the paper, and it gives you a string of numbers. Convert them to letters, and you get a message. Pretty cool, eh Houston?&quot; Armstrong actually looked proud of wasting so much time on something so stupid and impractical—he was practically beaming.

Not only had Pascal&#39;s warning of Archer and his Master gone in one ear and out the other, but Rider was spending Pascal&#39;s hard earned money on paper and pen!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A black piece of paper flew into Pascal&#39;s face, nearly hitting his hat. It landed on his hands, right when Armstrong had finished lecturing him about how Sandro wasn&#39;t a fully reliable source. The astronaut wasn&#39;t entirely wrong, but Pascal had already set his mind on the prize.

&quot;...The hell are you buying paper crafts for?! We should be stocking up on weapons or batteries instead...&quot; Pascal complained, staring at a bag that he had kept on him at all times: It contained a mana battery, some cooking oils, a hairspray and a lighter. It was the only thing he could afford with such meager pay, especially since most of the markets had been ransacked by Szrac.

&quot;As long as Berserker exists, we can&#39;t keep living normally. That Servant is slowly draining Persepolis of its resources. He&#39;s turning everything to gold, for God&#39;s sake!&quot; Pascal shouted. &quot;If Archer wants to join in on the fight, then let them. But for now, we get rid of the tin can first!&quot;

Just as he said that, he took the bag and stuffed the black paper in his pocket. He was heading outside of the building. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal didn&#39;t seem impressed with Armstrong&#39;s proverbial waste of time, which was tragic. He had worked hard to write up enough math problems that could be solved in order to form a message. It wasn&#39;t like he could just use 2 + 2 and be done with it.

Additionally, it probably wouldn&#39;t help that Armstrong had sent out a few of these paper airplanes already, expecting Pascal to go along with the idea. Oh well, he probably shouldn&#39;t mention it. It was unlikely that they&#39;d have an adverse effect on the situation anyway. Most likely. Right?

Armstrong got to his feet, heeding his Master&#39;s call to arms. &quot;Right. I&#39;ll get my armor.&quot; Armstrong said, walking into another room. He had advised his Master, and his Master had made a decision. Whether or not that advice was heeded was irrelevant.

After all, he was only a Servant.

A few minutes later, and Armstrong exited the building, decked out in his NASA spacesuit, which was sparkling after a thorough wash. It was impressive what one could do with Pascal&#39;s toothbrush and a bowl of bleach. Despite Rider&#39;s best efforts, he failed to scrub the rune that Sinmara had carved into his suit off. Several hours later, he finally gave up, much to his annoyance and anger.

&quot;Well, Houston! It&#39;s a good day to show Berserker who&#39;s boss.&quot; Armstrong said, his personality becoming more bombastic with the donning of his armor. &quot;Ah, but what kind of Rider would I be if we didn&#39;t go into battle on a mount. One moment, Houston.&quot; 

With that, Armstrong&#39;s magical energy spiked as he summoned Opportunity, which he hopped into. 

&quot;Any last stops you&#39;d like to make? A plan, perhaps? Let&#39;s try to avoid reenacting our previous fight with Berserker and Gagarin. What say you?&quot;

&quot;If anything,&quot; Pascal stared at Opportunity with contempt. &quot;your stupid van or whatever is a problem! Berserker&#39;s Master can control magnets or something. Guess what else is made of metal here?&quot; He pointed at Rider&#39;s vehicle.

&quot;That thing is just a liability to us. We&#39;re better off not using it.&quot; Pascal said. &quot;Once we arrive at the <span class="mention">#mansion-lane</span>, be sure to unsummon your vehicle. You&#39;ve got other weapons in reserve anyway, right?&quot;

He pointed upward while still staring at Armstrong. It was clear he was referring to something in particular.

&quot;The Moon. That will definitely stop Berserker. <em>Right?</em>&quot; He asked, as if wanting Armstrong to confirm. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

Opportunity was just as Pascal had said; a big moving target for Szrac&#39;s Magecraft. As much as he loathed to admit it, this wasn&#39;t a battle for a mount.

&quot;Also, it&#39;s a rover. Call it a moon buggy if you must, but comparing Oppy to a van is absolutely unacceptable.&quot; He patted the dashboard affectionately. &quot;You might hurt her feelings, but I digress.&quot; Rider tapped his visor with a finger as he drove. &quot;You&#39;re thinking with your head. That&#39;s good! Between my Noble Phantasm and you upgrading from a third rate Master to a second rate one, we might have a chance.&quot;

It took a few moments for Armstrong to get his thoughts in order—his head was up in the clouds today, evidently. He typically wasn&#39;t this jumpy with subjects.

&quot;It&#39;ll stop Midas, without a shadow of a doubt. The Golden Touch was given by the Greek God of Wine, meaning it is divine in nature, and is rich in Mystery. However, I am not concerned about Berserker Midas. His Master worries me. Will Apollo 11 strip him of his Magecraft? It will certainly weaken it, but his attachment to machinery makes it hard to say whether or not it&#39;ll shut down his suit. My guess? Probably not.&quot;

The roads that Opportunity drove on became smoother as they passed into <span class="mention">#mansion-lane</span>...
