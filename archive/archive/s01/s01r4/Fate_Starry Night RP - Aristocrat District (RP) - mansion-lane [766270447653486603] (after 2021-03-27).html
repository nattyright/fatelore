It was a relatively easy trek, since security around Persepolis had greatly worsened due to Midas&#39; exorbitant demands coupled with the majority of the aristocracy dealing with the disaster at the docks. It was the perfect time to strike, like Pascal had said. It was most likely the only chance the little man would have to fight back against the aristocrats.

&quot;Alright. Just know that if we get stuck by some magnets bullshit, I&#39;m blaming you.&quot; Pascal said rather bluntly. &quot;Actually, can&#39;t you just unsummon your van when Szrac touches it and resummon it again? Why not just do that?&quot; He asked some fairly important questions during the trek there. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

Few, if any. The biggest weakness of the pairing of Rider and Pascal was that Rider was one of the most mana intensive Servants next to Berserker. It took a lot of energy to fire off the Noble Phantasms that Rider had at his disposal, and his base Mana stat wasn&#39;t all that high.

Berserker and his Master were loaded, and could afford the mana batteries designed to keep Berserker spinning. Archer and his Master, as well. Caster was capable of providing for itself under the right circumstances. Rider didn&#39;t know what Servants were still in the War, but if Caster was still active, they&#39;d be at a tremendous disadvantage. Pascal was broke, and couldn&#39;t afford a mountain of mana batteries, especially with Szrac sucking the city dry.

&quot;I can summon Oppy a few times. She&#39;s not all that expensive to manifest. What kind of Rider would I be if I couldn&#39;t summon my own mount?&quot; Armstrong laughed. &quot;If I use my... <em>other</em> Noble Phantasm, however... I can probably summon Oppy twice. You saw that when we fought Saber. I nearly faded out of existence!&quot;

Armstrong said casually, as if his death wasn&#39;t all that important. Granted, it wasn&#39;t. He had been willing to die for his beliefs a few times, now. Servants had an odd outlook on life and death, after all. He looked out the window.

&quot;Look at that.&quot; Armstrong said, pointing out Pascal&#39;s window.

A manor stood, completely stripped bare of anything worthwhile. All it was now was a skeleton of beams. A sign was placed on the lawn. <strong>SEIZED UNDER PERSEPOLIS PROPERTY ACT</strong>. Armstrong lifted up his visor, his blue eyes reading the sign, and then the next. A few other manors had been stripped as well.

&quot;This is worse than I thought.&quot; Armstrong swore, putting his visor back on.

“Oh, Mr Bayard, put that down, it’s me, Karolina Toveksy, from Rossum Place, you know Mihaly’s daughter? Ok god, oh this outfit? It’s part of my scheme to blend in with the common folk, pretty clever huh?” Kari said, lying through her teeth on that last part, but had to appease him if she was going to get that copper wire. “Yes, we need the wire for part of our plans to take down Szrac, can you spare it for us? We’ll be sure to pay you back as soon as possible. You need some laundry service? I suppose I could send a maid or two to help you with that...”

“Hey Jacques, can you tell your parents that Miss Toveksy is here for an important mission?”

___

What had started out as a simple shopping trip to gather supplies was quickly escalating into a humanitarian mission of sorts. The demands of Szrac and Berserker had stretched across the entirety of the Aristocrat district and turned princes into paupers and mansions into manholes. Truly the demands of the tyrants were insatiable and Kari got a true look into why no one could pay for the services that the rest of the city desperately needed.

It was no wonder why Niemeyer and the rest had come to beg Kari and Ada for help. The whole social order and all the wealth accumulated by it, justly or otherwise, had been ripped out from under them and they sought out a member only barely part of the faction as a whole. Kari had always seen herself as an outsider of sorts to the rest and Rossum Place’s position close to the test site furthered that. However, she could not stand to see these people suffer, no matter how much people like Coal said they deserved it.</span>

Now we should be coming up to the Jenkins Estate and ... holy shit . . .”

The two of them walked right up the grim frame of a manor, it’s beams a hollow reminder of the former grandeur of the mansion before them, a small brutish sign warning of its fate. 

“Let’s.... let’s just keep moving on. There’s other places we can pick up the component ... I think.”

In fact, it sounded even heavier than usual. It wasn&#39;t hard to see why: while Kari pulled ahead, he had been stuck carrying a stack of boxes that had completely obscured his vision and left him seeing nothing but store labels and safety symbols. 

The atrocity did not stop there. His arms were full of bags as well. Tote bags, shopping bags, plastic bags, you name it, each and every one of them filled with random junk they&#39;d been buying and trading among the local stores and the neighborhood. 

The situation was getting out of hand. While any Servant worth their salt had the parameters to qualify as a pack mule, not every Servant took kindly to working such a high risk, low reward job. It had become increasingly difficult to keep all the boxes in balance, and Ada was forced to use his brainpower to calculate the most optimal way to distribute the boxes&#39; weight so they didn&#39;t come tumbling down like a mini avalanche. 

A genius was not to be summoned for manual labor. He should really get that across to the Miss sometime. 

&#39;How many more houses until we secure everything we need?&#39; Ada asked, a tinge of impatience in his voice. &#39;I was not expecting this to turn into a charity run, of all things...&#39;

A new mana signature flared up somewhere ahead, too potent to belong to a mage. Szrac? Ada quickly dismissed that idea. From the information they had gathered, it was extremely unlikely for Berserker and their Master to leave their base of operations.

&#39;<strong>Stop.</strong>&#39; Ada warned Kari in the most steady voice he could muster without toppling the boxes. &#39;Who goes there?&#39; He sighed. So this is what being blind felt like.

Pascal was right. Szrac was sucking the city dry, and soon, there would be nothing left. 

Armstrong was a being ultimately designed to bring forth progress, even if his existence as Armstrong sprinkled in a bit of humanity into that goal. While NASA would simply progress for the sake of progression, Armstrong would progress for the sake of humanity. Because of this, the state of the locale was even more infuriating. There could be no progress if Persepolis regressed. Rider would gladly take stagnation of regression under the thumb of the Aristocracy.

A ping from the dashboard snapped Rider out of his lull. Opportunity quickly halted. &quot;Enemy Servant. I&#39;m not sure, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be Berserker—the signature is too consistent and calm to be that tightfisted ruler. I recognize it, however.&quot;

If it wasn&#39;t Berserker, and Saber was eliminated, then that left only one option: Archer. As if to confirm that, Archer came into sight. Rider looked at Pascal excitedly. Out of all the Servants that Rider had encountered during this war, he liked Archer the most. Ada was a man of science. Rider could work with that.</span>

Armstrong turned off the mic and looked at Pascal. &quot;If they&#39;re here of all places, they obviously aren&#39;t going to pick a fight with us. We should meet them, Houston. This may be a Holy Grail War, but we all have a common enemy. What are your orders?&quot; Rider asked, shockingly enough. He typically never asked for Pascal&#39;s opinion.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal wasn&#39;t a fan of the sight in front of him either. It was one thing to hear rumors of Szrac draining the aristocracy of riches, but it was another thing entirely to see it actually happen. It was rather appalling to see an entire faction be brought down to its knees by a single man. It made Pascal even more afraid. He wondered if he was strong enough to confront such a terrible opponent...

Of course, Armstrong brought him back to reality once he started to talk about a possible Servant signal nearby. Pascal sweated, wondering if it was Szrac. His worries were immediately shot down by Rider&#39;s analysis.

&quot;Archer? Are you sure? Could it not be Caster or any of the other Servants?&quot; Pascal wondered. &quot;Either way, let&#39;s try to avoid them. We already have our hands full with--&quot;

Before he could finish, Armstrong had already established contact. He greeted Archer, much to Pascal&#39;s chagrin.

&quot;W-What are you doing?! Just letting them know we&#39;re here? We could have sneaked past them or something!&quot; Pascal complained, not sounding amused as Armstrong even banged on his window to let Ada know their position.

Rider then explained himself and although Pascal wasn&#39;t fully sold on the plan, he didn&#39;t have any choice now since Armstrong had so graciously exposed him.

&quot;<strong>Uh, this thing on? It is? Okay.</strong>&quot; Pascal spoke through the mic. &quot;<strong>Is Archer&#39;s Master over there? Say, mind letting us past? We aren&#39;t after you. We are after Szrac. The man in the metal suit. Rings a bell?</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Sounds like he&#39;s been taxing the aristocracy worse than how you aristocrats have been taxing the commoners. Since we both hate his guts, how about we get rid of him first before getting back to business? Seems fair, right?</strong>&quot; Pascal proposed rather casually. It was a side effect of being nervous, giving him no time to form his thoughts and appear more dignified. He was just a lowly c(r)ook after all. <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

While it was definitely a nice gesture and made the downtime before experiments shorter, she did not get why Ada insisted on carrying everything that they had gotten so far. They had homunculi and servants for that, unless he considered himself Kari&#39;s own personal servant...

&quot;Huh, someone behind us?&quot; Kari said, turning around to see a strange metal vehicle towering over her and then greeted by two voices, one eccentric and filtered with static and one more meek but decidely human in nature, though neither were aristocratic in nature. They were surprisingly considerate enough to identify themselves as well though the vehicle and space-age aesthetic was all Kari really needed.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m here, why wouldn&#39;t be I here with my servant?&quot; Kari said sarcastically, moving quickly to the side of the rover and gently tapping Ada&#39;s side to indicate he should do the same. 

&quot;And hey if you want to go after him now, knock yourself out. We&#39;ve still got preparations to make as I can&#39;t have my servant&#39;s metal legs being bent out of shape before the fight even begins. Warm him up for us, why don&#39;t you? Hold him out for like a day and we&#39;ll be ready,&quot; Kari seemed to joke about Rider&#39;s odds against the Berserker team while she hoped they didn&#39;t inquire too much into why they needed to prepare, the obvious should be enough.

Pascal didn&#39;t know Kari at all, but her attitude from the restaurant and now was enough for him to judge her character. She couldn&#39;t be called an ally. An accidental accomplice at most.

&quot;<strong>Warm him up and let you two backstab us for the prize? I don&#39;t think so.</strong>&quot; Pascal replied quite bluntly, while motioning for Rider to ready Opportunity&#39;s weapon systems in case something went awry. He was on edge, knowing that dealing with aristocrats was like dealing with snakes.

&quot;<strong>Why take a day when you could simply attack Szrac&#39;s base yourself? If we both attack him at once, then I doubt he would stand a chance. Unless you&#39;re purposefully waiting on people to soften him up for you.</strong>&quot; Pascal accused, sensing that he had Kari&#39;s plan figured out. Did she really think someone with challenge Berserker willy-nilly without fearing the remaining Servants ganging up on them?

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re either with us or against us, sis. I don&#39;t plan on being a pawn of the rich, so you better do things my way.</strong>&quot; Pascal made his ultimatum.

<em>Searching...</em>

<em>Searching...</em>

<em>Ding!</em>

&#39;Spaceman. It has been a solid two weeks.&#39; Ada warmed up to the staticky voice. To find out that the restaurant owner and their Servant were participants of the Holy Grail War was unexpected but ultimately, unsurprising. Servant sightings were a common occurrence on the island; as such, any Master and Servant pair could be a potential competitor. 

Or they could not. But now that Ada reminisced about the restaurant, he only realized how ridiculous it was for three rival Servants to wind up in the same building without razing it to the ground. 

Though it seemed that their Masters were more than happy to pick up their Servants&#39; slack. Ada felt like facepalming. Weren&#39;t they both after the same goal?

&#39;Think logically before you speak, Master of Rider.&#39; He calmly addressed Pascal while staring at the marvelously...boring sight of his stack of boxes. &#39;You came marching into the aristocrat&#39;s territory on your own accord. That could only mean you have planned for Berserker and his Master sufficiently. Otherwise, what difference is there between your operation and a suicide mission? Surely you did not foresee a chance encounter with us for a potential team up?&#39; He interrogated Pascal, refusing to believe that the discomposed man back at the restaurant was capable of thinking more than one step ahead.

&#39;Szrac is a natural enemy against technology. Have you not done your research beforehand, you will simply be a liability instead of an asset and succumb to him before we can intervene. There is no reason to backstab you. I hope there is no hard feelings.&#39; Was he trying to soften the blow? It certainly didn&#39;t sound like it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Opportunity went silent at Ada&#39;s questionnaire. Were Rider and Pascal discussing the Archer&#39;s critique of their strategy? A shoddy microphone? Neither, for it was simply Rider looking at Pascal with a smug look on his face—he and Archer shared identical concerns.

A plan? There wasn&#39;t one. Pascal and Armstrong were marching forward blindly, putting their faith into Armstrong&#39;s Noble Phantasms. Powerful? Yes. Foolproof? Absolutely not. Saber and Sandro had shown that to be the case. Despite that, here they were, repeating the same mistake twice. Actually, it was worse. At least against Saber, a plan had been formulated.

&quot;I told you this was an unwise move. We should avoid a direct confrontation so close to Gagarin&#39;s territory.&quot; Armstrong grumbled, flipping dials as Opportunity&#39;s weapons whirred to life. He was Pascal&#39;s Servant, and Pascal had proven himself to a be a capable Master. As his Servant, it was his job to follow orders. Even if it meant that he had to raise his arms against Archer. Even if he didn&#39;t want to.

Armstrong flicked at the microphone. &quot;If you&#39;ll mind me interjecting... Preparations are unnecessary with two Servants working together. Archer and I could teach that bumbling Berserker that there&#39;s more uses to gold then just statues.&quot; Rider looked towards Pascal. It would not be wise to reveal his Noble Phantasm, even to someone he personally viewed as an ally.

They are just waiting for someone to be bait so that they can swoop in and get rid of Berserker and the bait in one blow.&quot; Pascal replied to Armstrong as he turned off the microphone. Sure, they didn&#39;t have a plan, but there was nary the time nor the opportunity to have one when your opponent wasn&#39;t out in the open like Saber.

&quot;I agree that you and Archer could probably take down Berserker together, but that doesn&#39;t seem like this stuffy aristocrat&#39;s intention.&quot; Pascal pointed out before turning on the mic again.

<strong>&quot;Archer, maybe I could trust you, but could I really trust your Master? You have been here for barely a few weeks. You have no idea how aristocrats act.&quot;</strong> Pascal said with a disdainful voice. <strong>&quot;An alliance between an aristocrat and a commoner is like asking the scorpion to not sting the frog. The fact that you two have been waiting around here instead of confronting Berserker speaks volumes of your intentions.&quot;</strong>

At this point, negotiations had started to break down. Pascal was incredibly suspicious of Kari&#39;s intentions, plus he had heard of the rumors of cutthroat aristocrats. He certainly didn&#39;t want to expose his weaknesses to others in this war.

<strong>&quot;It was going to come to this one way or another.&quot;</strong> Pascal cryptically said before turning off the mic and staring at Rider.

&quot;Alright, Rider. Run them over! Might as well use your van to its fullest since it won&#39;t help us against Szrac at all.&quot; He whispered to his Servant, planning to surprise Ada with a sudden attack. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>&quot;Alright, Rider. Run them over!&quot;</em> Pascal hissed at his Servant, causing Armstrong to look at his Master as though he were mad. Run them over? Seriously? With no provocation? Wait, no. That wasn&#39;t right. There was the ultimate provocation already in place: a wish from the Holy Grail. 

Any alliance was bound to break down eventually, as no two Servants could keep the Grail for themselves. This was typically the point where alliances began to break down, as well. A few Servants had been defeated, but Rider had been hoping that the threat of Berserker looming overhead would keep things civil, but Pascal was afraid, and his fear resulted in action.

Fear of something ultimately lead to dealing with the source of that fear. That was progress. Maybe Pascal and Rider were far more similar than they knew... It was a shame. He liked the Archer, their scientific and modernistic approach to things pleased the American cosmonaut, but he liked Pascal more, and was his Servant, on top of that. Duty outweighed all.

All of these calculations and thought processes went through Rider&#39;s head in the blink of an eye.

A heavy sigh erupted from Armstrong as he placed the helmet back on his head and eyed Archer. Running a quick calculation, he saw that Ada would have but a small handful of seconds to dodge Opportunity. This would be a good chance to see the capabilities of Archer. &quot;Keep an eye on the Master, Houston. Gagarin&#39;s taught me that Masters can be just as dangerous as Servants.&quot; He warned Pascal, before flooring the accelerator.

A wall of steel bore down on Archer and his Master.

We are just taking a day to prepare so he doesn’t use our - errr- Archer’s metal parts against him. You know because Szrac can bend metal? And having some on you is asking for it?” 

Kari said, getting agitated as Pascal failed to understand her earlier sarcastic remarks. Seriously what was happening to the city if you couldn’t take even a bit of her teasing. Perhaps it was a sign of how much of a toll Szrac had taken on everyone. The voice did sound a bit familiar but she couldn’t quite place it yet.

“Also probably a good idea to figure out a way to seperate or eliminate Zerker’s gold since they’ve been gathering more and more of the stuff. Plan helps when your enemy stays put, it’s called a siege. You run up to the enemy without a plan, you get fucked. So excuse me if I’m not willing to get caught in whatever harebrained scheme you cooked up!”

Could Kari put what she said a bit more diplomatically? Of course and Ada was doing better on that scale than her. However there was something to say about bluntness when dealing with idiots and that was getting your point across by any means necessary. Couldn’t they see they were driving around in a big metal box that Szrac and Zerker would gleefully turn into a golden coffin?

Though the only response Kari and Ada would receive was the vehicle lurching forward and threatening to crush them underneath. Despite accusing Kari of playing with their lives, the master behind the wheel was real eager to put an end to hers without a second thought and all she did was open her mouth.</span>

However, she did not do so out of ignorance but timing. As it was about to smack her, Kari made use of her self-defense training from Mage’s Acedemy and enhanced her own jumping ability to bring her on top of Opportunity. 

Dodging the instruments and possible weaponry on top, she positioned herself low to the roof and began pressing down on the surface with her hands. Given that this was a contruct and likely some noble phantasm, she wasn’t able to instantly alter its physical state. However, she could slowly feel the metal begin to bend and give way to her will. She could only hope that they didn’t notice the weakening metal spot until it was fully liquidated.

Rider&#39;s silence, Pascal&#39;s outbursts, and the awkwardly long stretches of silence in-between ended up earning the chef negative brownie points. As the Master of another scientist, Ada had expected Pascal to be a little quicker on the uptake. But listening to his accusations was like extracting toothpaste out of a near empty tube. Ada wished he had a fast forward button to speed up Pascal&#39;s dawdling. Had that been invented yet?

Though his wish would soon be granted. No sooner had Kari got on Pascal&#39;s case than the rover lurched forward, ready to recreate a classic traffic accident on a deserted street. Kari had prepared for the worst and got out of the way, but Ada was stuck in quite the dilemma. He considered the boxes in his hands.

Should he dodge, the contents would spill. At best, it would make a mess on the street. At worst, however, they could become utterly useless. Broken. Turned into scraps. Now, he wasn&#39;t saying those boxes were worth more than himself, but the thought of discarding something while they still held value irked him.

Hence, there was only one logical conclusion.

<em><strong>CRASH!!!!</strong></em>

Pascal and Rider lost sight of the street as the rover drove into Archer and his stack of boxes. Cardboard was all they could see on their surveillance for a while, and the cacophony of various objects hitting their shell was all they could hear as the contents of those boxes rained down on the vehicle. Then came the sound of metal against metal, an annoying, high pitched scraping noise dialed up to eleven through their speakers.

Ada peeled himself off the accelerating van with a grunt, one hand furiously massaging his back while the other helped himself into a half kneeling position.

Overhead, the small laptop morphed and expanded hundredfold into a mechanized horse, then came crashing down on the rover&#39;s softened roof.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">NASA&#39;s engineering had never failed Pascal or Rider, even when fighting against metallurgy and fire giants. Capable of surviving atmospheric reentry, as well as being durable enough to work under the heavy effects of metallurgy and the scorching heat of fire giants. Compared to that, a young lady and a Servant carrying boxes were nothing, right?   

Wrong.

A familiar thud came from Opportunity&#39;s rooftop. Archer&#39;s Master was fast! Armstrong made a personal note. He had gotten used to fighting slow, hard hitting foes like Szrac, Midas, and Sinmara. He had expected the young lady to fight the same way. He would not make that mistake twice.

Armstrong swerved expertly, hitting Archer while turning off the road towards the skeleton of an abandoned manor. Kari held firm, much to Rider&#39;s annoyance. He wasn&#39;t sure what he expected after facing Sandro, but this Aristocrat was already putting up more of a fight then her fellow Aristocrat.

As they sped towards the manor, Armstrong took a glance at the top of Oppy&#39;s cabin. The cabin roof was... melting? No, melting would imply an extremely high heat. It was simply turning to liquid. Rider swore profusely, pointing to Pascal, then to the roof. &quot;Magecraft is absurd. How am I supposed to calculate how to deal with that when I don&#39;t know any of the variables? We&#39;re going to hit that dead manor in twelve seconds. The building&#39;s skeleton is barely higher than Oppy. That&#39;ll knock them off when we pass under it.&quot; Armstrong quickly told Pascal, before speeding up.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Luckily, Kari was trying to liquefy a Noble Phantasm. Otherwise, she would probably be inside the cabin.

Through his window, Archer winked at him, before climbing up the rover. Tsk. Now that it was against him, that smug attitude was beginning to get on his nerves. However, nothing could prepare him for Archer&#39;s next move.

<strong>FWOOMP!</strong> The ceiling sagged down several feet as the Chicago Typewriter threatened to crush Rider and Pascal. Acting quickly, Armstrong put his hands up to stop the horse from quickly crushing them. Instantly after, Opportunity hit the manor, speeding through walls and beams alike with literal ease. The manor collapsed under the damage as the rover drifted back around aimlessly, lacking Rider&#39;s precise steering. They didn&#39;t even manage to hit Archer or his Master, who had jumped out of the way.

&quot;Get out!&quot; Rider ordered Pascal as the ceiling buckled any more. He kicked his Master out of the vehicle, before leaving it behind himself. Rider hit the ground running, pulling out his laser rifle, before shooting several shots at Archer and Kari. Was he testing their capabilities? A wise move. However, no matter how smart Armstrong was, he was ultimately engaging an Archer in a ranged battle. He was destined to lose.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To dislodge a magus from a vehicle of one’s own creation seemed easy enough for a servant to do. One little kick or ramming against a wall would be the obvious fix. But the formulation changed drastically when Kari could sink her hands and knees into the roof like wet sand. It wasn’t taking long for her to become flush with the surface.

While she did not see the initial impact, she could hear and especially feel the scraping of metal against metal, the screech sending an involuntary shiver into her teeth and down her back. The loss of material was going to be a headache but as long as Ada survived, they could always recover. 

She could not hear Ada’s apology from her perch, the wind stealing the words away from her ears. Her attention was elsewhere, further liquidating the compromised metal underneath her. Only a bit more and she could jump right through and give that master a piece of her mind.

Yet Ada had a better plan in mind, which Kari would discover instantly as her servant effortlessly removed her from her handholds. She moved to instinctually sock him yet his voice disarmed her and gave her satisfaction as their plans converged. 

“Well so much for my plan of talking to them again. Guess we’ll just have to beat some sense back into them, eh Ada?” She tilted her head and pointed her thumb at the pair stumbling out of the totaled rover. Collisions with animals were dangerous back in the old world but a fully metal horse? Only thanks to the quick response of Armstrong was Oppy even functional.</span>

If the master tries to rush us, leave him to me, I’ll knock him flat on his dumb ass. Oh and feel free to take any of these new vials, especially those ones,” 

She swept aside her bomber jacket and cocked her hip to reveal a few new vials on her belt, colored a sickly mix of pea green and a dull orange.

. “Should degrade and rust just about any metal easily. Go wild with them, we got the perfect enemy to test them on!”

Kari then saw Armstrong start firing off what looked like stray laser beams. They weren’t much of a threat by themselves but they had a purpose. They were to probe their defenses and buy a bit of time to come up with a counterattack. Kari had done this herself many times back when she was part of the Gymnasium’s youth magical dueling team. 

A proportionate response was needed but nothing that revealed her greater abilities. A few icy prisms should do the trick, she thought as she stood up from her cover and sent the shards into the line of fire. 

If the few lessons in physicks that her dad taught her were to be believed, all she needed to do was send the reflective ice at them and the optical qualities would divert the laser’s trajectory and sap its kinetic potential as it warmed the ice. Hopefully, her hypothesis was correct.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal&#39;s reactions were subpar compared to Rider, Archer, and even Kari. The moment he realized that the Opportunity was being attacked, Rider had already planned countermeasures of his own. At first he thought that the roof had been dented by Ada, only to realize in horror that it was his Master instead.

<em>&quot;Another freak Master?!&quot;</em> Pascal panicked in his mind. He was hoping that Szrac was an outlier. That the rest of the aristocracy had lived pampered lives devoid of training or suffering. Sandro fit that bill pretty well, from his biased viewpoint. Kari, however, was as different from that as she could be. In terms of Magecraft, she beat him by a billion years.

Rider knew that, hence why he knew that his Master was a liability. He had inadvertently gotten them into a fight that they had no preparation for, after all. But it was still his duty to protect his own Master, hence why he kicked Pascal out of the buggy and left it behind, instead using himself as bait to lure Kari and Archer away.

It seemed like Kari bit the bait, taking this as a chance to fire off more mysterious spells at Armstrong&#39;s location. Pascal crawled out the buggy and hid behind some alley walls, observing the fight from a safe distance as he cursed himself for letting things get to this point.

It was two against one. Rider had no chance of surviving that long. The odds seemed to be worse than him against Surtr, even. The most reasonable option would be for Pascal to run away and give up on the Grail War...but he had already told himself that he wouldn&#39;t fall back.

He wanted to <em>live.</em></span>

So, he placed his hand inside his bag, and dug out one of his few valuables...

Kari grit her teeth as she felt something impact the back of her head. It hurt, but it wasn&#39;t lethal. She felt shards running down her hair along with some viscous, smelly liquid. Her mind instantly panicked: Glass shards? Sticky poison? Whatever could it be?!

It was only when she touched her head and found traces of yolk that she realized what happened.

Pascal had egged her, and was now calling out at her from an alley.

&quot;You like that, aristofart? All that Magecraft didn&#39;t do you any good there, did it?&quot; Pascal stuck his tongue out as he quickly retreated into the darkness of the alley. He was trying to get her attention. <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;By my estimate, it would take more than a few essays to dissuade Rider&#39;s Master, but much less time for him to convince Rider otherwise.&#39; Ada wasn&#39;t very keen on the idea of persuasion. Any sensible Servant would sooner listen to their Master than actual common sense, should they happen to differ. He was a sensible Servant, so was Rider. From the moment Rider floored his vehicle, Ada knew he was a lost cause.

While Opportunity careened around the corner and kissed the skeleton of an old mansion, Archer took his time selecting his new toys. Kari had been keeping herself busy. While those new vials bore rather...repulsive shades, Ada had no reason to doubt their effectiveness.

&#39;A bit hard on the eyes, don&#39;t you think?&#39; Of course, that wasn&#39;t to say he was giving the vials a full pass. Ada pocketed the vials, while Opportunity&#39;s door tore open and out popped Rider, guns blazing. A shoot-out, between a Rider and an Archer? Ada was almost amused by how cute the premise sounded. This was his element. Rider was trying to gauge his capabilities, but all he had managed to achieve was exposing his own standard, by-the-books weapons handling. As such, there was no way Archer could lose...

&#39;Miss Kari. I urge you to remain calm.&#39; Ada looked at Kari with a solemn expression. &#39;It seems that I have prematurely discarded my weapon.&#39;

The Chicago Typewrite was still on top of that blasted rover! This wasn&#39;t a shoot-out. It was a one-way slaughter!

...It <em>would</em> have been, had Kari been a total amateur.

A flurry of ice met the laser beams head on, doing their best to deflect the shots. However, Archer wasn&#39;t so optimistic. As a modern Servant himself, he had no reason to believe that any weaponry wielded by Rider hadn&#39;t been enhanced to hell and back during the crystallization of their legacy.

He broke into a run, separating himself from Kari and her shield of ice, trying to draw fire away from her. Even so, his pace was far from impressive. It looked barely faster than a jog, something even Rider could handle. It seemed that Archer was only doing the bare minimum of avoiding the most problematic shots.

Moreover, it didn&#39;t seem like he was keen to get to Rider. Instead he circled around Armstrong, heading towards where he had <s>parked</s> crashed his vehicle-

Alarms went off in Rider&#39;s head. Experience? Survival instinct? One look at his beloved moon buggy and he would understand his predicament: the head of the mechanized horse split open, and in its place mounted the mouth of a blazing cannon. Hold on a second...how long had it been sitting there, charging up?

&#39;Good-ah! Good bye.&#39; Archer stuttered in his witty remark as another laser shot seared his skin. But his slip-up would pass unnoticed, as the Chicago Typewriter unloaded a cannonball pulsing with mana in Rider&#39;s direction.

If he got out of this, Rider would need to make some very specific adjustments to Opportunity. Then again, how was he supposed to defend against all the various Magecraft that existed in this world? An interesting problem, true. However, now was not the time.

Firing several lasers towards Kari, her theory proved to be correct, but Armstrong&#39;s lasers melted the ice upon being bounced around, and he could fire far more consistently then she could cast her Magecraft. He fired several more lasers in her direction to keep her busy. Dividing her attention between himself and Pascal would be pivotal to victory. However, he had no time nor desire to get into a physics match with this woman. He would simply outgun her. A boorish and hardhanded solution, but a solution nonetheless.

Archer concerned him more, a few shots struck, leaving irrelevant damage. The range was too great, Armstrong&#39;s weapon too weak, and Archer&#39;s defenses too sturdy. The Knight Class was perfectly capable of giving Rider the runaround, as loathe as the Calvary Class was to admit it.

&quot;Come now, Archer! With all that scurrying around, I might mistake you for an Assassin. Hit me with something befitting of your class. Surely, you&#39;ve got to have something tucked up your sleeve!&quot; Armstrong laughed as he peppered Ada full of holes. The Archer gave him a smug look as he hopped over Opportunity, where a horse was standing, menacingly.

The laugh died in Armstrong&#39;s throat. &quot;Oh—&quot;

In fact, he was lucky that the cannonball wasn&#39;t smaller; anything with a smaller mass would&#39;ve torn through Armstrong and his armor. As is, it was like getting hit by a small Titan Rocket. 

Armstrong and the cannonball flew into the ruined manor&#39;s wreckage. It looked like that was the end. Taking Chicago Typewriter to the face would irreparably damage most other Servants, and many of those were far stronger than Armstrong. Rider had been eliminated. Archer won.

Well, it was time to recover the Chicago Typewriter. At least Ada could ride it back to Kari in boastful vic— It was gone. Well, no. That wasn&#39;t right. The Chicago Typewriter was right there. The rover it had been standing on, though... Was missing. Perhaps it had simply vanished when Rider was defeated.

The manor&#39;s ruins began to stir... Before all of a sudden, Opportunity came barreling out, using the wreckage as a ramp to gain air superiority. This, combined with low gravity, allowed Armstrong to sail comfortably through the air. This time, it had weapons blazing. A speaker blared to life.

&quot;<strong>Hello there, Archer! I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for not crumpling up like foil back when you shot me. Then again, I <em>AM</em> an ace when it comes to objects flying through the air!</strong>&quot;</span>

However, one did not simply <em>kill</em> Neil Armstrong. If he could survive experimental tech and flying into the vacuum of space, then a mere cannonball wasn&#39;t going to stop him so easily.

It did hurt, though. That, and summoning another Opportunity. That was the last time he&#39;d be able to perform a trick like this without leaving other options open. In exchange, though, he had gained a useful bit of information regarding Archer&#39;s identity. His Master had called him &quot;Ada&quot;, and his Noble Phantasm could switch forms. One of which was a laptop, and the other, a horse. However, nothing instantly came to mind. A male called Ada who used technology? Nothing was making much sense. Could it be...?

Rider waited until he was on top of Archer, before tapping a button. The rover hummed as gravity turned normal, causing the rover to fall towards Ada at a remarkable speed. Let&#39;s see how <em>he</em> liked a taste of his own medicine.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was good to see her theories being proved correct, but while Kari could easily deal with a few lasers sent her way, there was no feasible path for her to counter Rider&#39;s entire barrage. Though if it could keep a few rays from scorching Ada, she would take the risk and keep up a meager icy counterfire while ducking behind an upturned pile of concrete and earth. If all she had to deal with was Rider, they were sure to come out on top sooner or later. 

That seemed the most likely outcome until Kari felt something collide with the back of her head and release a truly rotten smell. Out of instinct, a few icy shards were sent in the direction of the attack though she was very much concerned with what the opposing master had struck her with and began to comb through her hair only to discover it was nothing but egg shells and yolk.  And to add insult to nonexistent injury, the enemy master popped out to give some remarks fitting for someone half his age. 

Over the course of her time in Persepolis, Kari had cigarette butts flicked in her face, giant golems sent after her, dodged gun shots and survived a direct assassination attempt, not to mention the many hate-filled words of a man who lost it all and wanted to take her down. To get egged and name-called by what looked like a common cook, it was, in comparison, kinda funny but also kinda sad.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Due to how bizarre it was, Kari felt like it would be wrong to just instantly pummel the man. Instead she took out a vial filled with a milky white solution, encased it in ice  and sent it flying over Pascal&#39;s head. It erupted in a flash of light that soon softened to a steady glow, hovering over his head and emitted a soft sizzle like a flare. 

&quot;Why do you even fight us?  We have the same enemy, this stupid class war thing shouldn&#39;t even matter right now!&quot; Kari said, doing her best to shake the egg out of her hair and her attention briefly turned away from Armstrong and Ada. Something about this whole fight didn&#39;t add up, it seemed to happen way too quick. She said one snarky thing and the man wanted to run her over. Wait, was he the waiter from that restaurant? There was no way he had developed a grudge against her in that short encounter. That crazy Saber was the cause of all the craziness that day, not whatever little thing Kari did. 

Of course, a few seconds was all Armstrong needed to position himself for a second run on Ada and Kari could hear the shriek of tires and the roar of an engine. Oh no, that wasn&#39;t good at all. Was it possible Rider could summon his ride again? She turned away from the distant master to see the rover launch itself into the air. Crap, she let herself get distracted and now the enemy was going to turn their own tactic against them! She had to act fast.

She sent two frozen missiles flying towards her servant, the air behind them rippling from the cold and the impressive speed. The first would burst in front of Ada to form a gelatinous mass that rapidly grew upwards as it sensed the coming impact and the second followed behind it, activated by Kari&#39;s words. &quot;Flash Freeze!&quot;</span>

When the cone made contact with the gel, the mixture of the chilled water and biting wind instantly froze the tower of gel. It would not hold up the rover by itself but it would provide just a second more for Ada to hopefully dive out of the way and place himself in a position to make use of the Typewriter and the vials she gave him.

She couldn&#39;t help but curse as she realized she was going to have to try to keep an eye on both master and servant until Ada was able to do so, a very hard task indeed and one she desperately hoped she would not have to keep up for long.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Contrary to Kari&#39;s belief, Pascal was already running away from her the moment he tossed his egg. Therefore, he was only able to hear the barest amount of words from her in the darkness of the alley. Something about a stupid class war?

&quot;Damn straight, sis. I&#39;m really sick of you aristocrats, just going around and trampling everywhere you please!&quot; Pascal groaned from afar. It probably wasn&#39;t loud enough for Kari to hear, but he still felt like saying it to vent a bit.

That&#39;s when he noticed a strange concoction rolling at his feet. It blew up, scaring him a bit before he noticed a light on top of his head.

&quot;The fuck is this?!&quot; Was his initial reaction, wondering what sort of odd spell had been placed on him. He thought that Kari might be approaching and mentally prepared himself for an encounter. He waited...and waited...and waited...

Until, a minute into waiting, he realized that no one was approaching. He slowly took a few steps forward and peeked from the alley entrance. Kari was focusing more on Rider than on him! At this point, his Servant would just get double teamed.

That wasn&#39;t something Pascal would let happen.

&quot;Two against one? You certainly play fair, don&#39;t you? At least Szrac trusted his Servant enough to finish the job. You? You don&#39;t even seem to trust Archer to finish things off.&quot; Pascal taunted Kari from afar, taking a bottle from his bag and tossing it at Kari.

The woman was caught off guard. If she turned around, she&#39;d find a mysterious bottle with an odd liquid within it. The color was vile and repulsive, giving her the idea that it might be poison. Could this be some sort of magic concoction? If Pascal was truly a Master, then maybe he did have some magical arts under his sleeve...

Should she really underestimate him? <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Oh? Archer was startled by how well his not-a-sneak attack had performed. The cannonball sent Rider flying, then crashed them both into the manor&#39;s remains. If that wasn&#39;t enough to flatten him like a pancake, then the sheer concentration of mana pervading the cannonball would&#39;ve fried him like a piece of toast. As if to convince Archer further, even Opportunity fizzled out of existence soon after.

&#39;...Perhaps it&#39;s high time that future scientists go through a regimen of speed and endurance training before being handed guns and missiles.&#39; Ada quietly made note of Rider&#39;s spectacularly underwhelming demise. The death of the moon walker saddened him. It almost felt as if he had personally appended a Q.E.D. to the proof that modern Servants were inferior compared to ancient spirits and mythical beings. The whole ordeal left a bad taste in his mouth.

However, he still had a job to finish. Rider may have been eliminated, but his idiot Master was relentless in his pestering from the alleyways and completely oblivious to the fact that he had been removed from the game. Ada didn&#39;t feel like delivering the sad news to Pascal; that brat can perish on his own. He motioned for the Chicago Typewriter-

Then the mountain of rubble quivered and out burst a brand new Opportunity devoid of scratches and dents, looking like it had just left the assembly line! It sailed the air in an unnaturally flat curve that could not belong to a vehicle of its size and weight, then was upon Archer in an instant. Archer&#39;s eyes widened as Rider greeted him through an obnoxious speaker. More than disbelief, the resurgence of the moon buggy had filled him with an odd relief.

&#39;That&#39;s more like it.&#39; He cackled like a mad man in the face of Opportunity&#39;s laser beams. &#39;Your expertise against mine, this is how it should be. This is how it will be. Do not even <em>think</em> of going back to the throne before I&#39;ve dismantled every trick as your disposal.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Chicago Typewriter moved in between Ada and Opportunity, tanking the multitude of laser beams with its body alone. That had taken care of the danger of his body turning into a sieve, but the Opportunity was now dropping onto him like a meteor!

Thankfully, Kari had come to the rescue, throwing up a pillar of hardened gel that aimed to temporarily halt the rover&#39;s advance. Of course, she had every right to be concerned. This wouldn&#39;t be the first time Ada&#39;s vanity had gotten the better of him and let him throw himself under the bus just to prove some illusory point. But now that she had given him a clear way out, surely it wouldn&#39;t take the genius more than an instant to figure out the most optimal approach?

Ada did not disappoint. As Opportunity&#39;s front wheel hinged itself on the gel block, Ada was already fast at work, using the precious few seconds provided by Kari&#39;s cushion to dismantle his steed. As the gel cracked under Opportunity&#39;s weight, the Chicago Typewriter shed its bulk and transformed back into an elongated submachine gun. Ada swung the firearm&#39;s muzzle towards Opportunity&#39;s underbelly-

Then the rover chewed through the hardened gel and slammed into the ground, crushing both the weapon and its owner under its chassis before speeding off towards god knows where.

Had Rider succeeded?

<em>Drip.</em>

A metallic stain appeared on the ground after Opportunity drove by. Several more followed, each drop larger than the one before until the stains connected and turned into a steady stream. Opportunity was leaking metal from its underside, while its driver was alerted to an extra weight slotted under its chassis. Something was hanging onto the underside of the vehicle, and it wouldn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what or in this case, who.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider had been intent on giving Ada a taste of his own medicine, but he had forgotten to take the nature of his ride into account: a moon buggy designed to traverse uneven terrain would naturally come equipped with extra cushiony wheels on top of a lifted chassis. There was more then enough leg room for a human shaped Servant to hitch a ride underneath without the rover ever flattening him against the paved tarmac of a modern city!

&#39;We rendezvous once again, Spaceman. I have to say, this has turned out to be more snug than I had expected.&#39; A hole bore through the rover&#39;s floor as Archer&#39;s smug mug appeared from the underside of the vehicle. The hole steadily grew larger, until it was big enough for Archer to toss his laptop through.

Tendrils shot out of the laptop and started to worm their way into every suitable crevice they could find within Opportunity. It didn&#39;t take long before the rover&#39;s command screens started outputting nonsensical garbage alongside their usual readings. Opportunity&#39;s underlying system was under siege. 

In other words, it was being hacked.

&#39;Please don&#39;t get me wrong, Rider. I respect your love for space. I really do. However, I prefer something a bit more tethered to the ground.&#39;

Now that its gravity was back on, Opportunity&#39;s speed visibly decreased as it started sagging under its own weight. At this rate, it would slow to no more than a crawl before it could even hit the next intersection. Mobility was one of Rider&#39;s strongest weapons, but now he was being robbed of it under broad daylight!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Tsk. You are <strong>really</strong> irking me, woman! This is a battle between two modern Servants in a war meant for gods! Don&#39;t you <strong>dare</strong> interfere!&quot; Armstrong bellowed in rage. 

Kari&#39;s makeshift barrier stopped Ada from becoming a pAdacake. Opportunity&#39;s lasers turned towards Archer&#39;s master, before charging up an ominously sized laser. As they fired towards Kari, several hit the ground, bringing up massive clumps of dirt and dust. A smokescreen. Were these things lasers or artillery shells? For someone like Armstrong, was there really much of a difference? Ultimately, it didn&#39;t matter. The sky turned brown with dirt, nonetheless.

Ada&#39;s mad laughter caused Armstrong to start shaking with laughter in response. Yes, this felt <em>right</em>. Two scientific and engineering geniuses who progressed their respective fields to new heights were now facing off in a battle of not just brute force, but wits as well. This was how it was meant to be. In this moment, Rider was glad to not be fighting Berserker. He was a bore when compared to Archer.

&quot;The same to you, Archer!&quot; Armstrong&#39;s roar was indiscernible from Opportunity&#39;s electric motor. &quot;I won&#39;t be satisfied until I feel outplay every trick! Every attack! <strong>EVERY</strong> action must be countered and beaten! My victory will be absolute! And only then do you have my permission to be crushed under my wheels. Don&#39;t you <em>dare</em> lose to such a boorish attack!&quot;

The gel shattered, and Opportunity fell. Ada went silent.

Armstrong allowed himself one moment to ponder whether not this was it, before shaking his head. No. Archer wouldn&#39;t fall so easily. They were to fight tooth and nail for every inch. Something as braindead as dropping a rover on the other would be an insult to intellectuals everywhere. If Archer did somehow perish, Rider would revive him just to slap him to death.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Several pullets flew from between Armstrong&#39;s legs. Without missing a blink, he looked down. Much to his pleasure and annoyance, Archer was still kicking. Pascal was fighting for his life (Read: Egging Kari), and Armstrong was getting into a competition with the enemy Servant. What kind of Heroic Spirit was he? Despite that, analytical reason and game theory took a back seat, letting passion and fervor take the wheel.

&quot;I can tell that you don&#39;t lift a wrench very often, Archer. Otherwise, you&#39;d know to tweak the suspension on the wheels up before trying to crawl under a vehicle.&quot; Armstrong said as Ada&#39;s face became more and more clear as he made swiss cheese of Opportunity&#39;s hull. Several bullets grazed Armstrong&#39;s suit as he looked down. There weren&#39;t many methods to stop Archer. He had chosen an excellent position to assault Rider from. There were no viable offensives that Armstrong could enact without jumping through hoops. Luckily for him, sometimes the best way to do something was to take the simplest approach.

Ada&#39;s smug face disappeared beneath Armstrong&#39;s boot at he stamped down on him.

Again.

And again.

And again...

Was it underhanded? Probably, but something told Armstrong that Archer would do the same thing to him in a heartbeat. Besides, in a fight, nothing was too underhanded.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was lucky that Opportunity only needed one good leg to steer. Between stamps, Ada quickly tossed the Chicago Typewriter into Opportunity&#39;s cabin, where it began wrecking havoc on his systems. It didn&#39;t take Armstrong more than a moment to realize that this was an attempt at a hack.

Opportunity, being a mix between a rover and a moon buggy, had a central computer dedicated to managing the various data that was fed into it as it explored unknown bodies. A few of these systems were disconnected from one another in an attempt to prevent hacking, but the Typewriter&#39;s greedy tendrils allowed it to casually skirt that hurdle. The A/C shuddered to a halt, and more importantly, the laser cannons peppered about the vehicle. Several blue screens of death appeared on various monitors across the dashboard, and more and more were turning blue by the second. 

&quot;Come on, Archer. You can do better than that! Tossing one of those &#39;TI-84s&#39; into my cabin and hoping for the best? Well, spit on your keyboard and piss on your hardware. If you think something like this can stop me, then watch and weep.&quot; Armstrong yelled down at Ada between foot stamping intervals. 

Opportunity, being Armstrong&#39;s mount, had an interface that allowed him to interact with Opportunity manually. As if on command, a keyboard appeared to his right. After popping the joints in his hand, Armstrong began mashing furiously on the keyboard.

This was unexpected, to say the least. Archer had little knowledge of Armstrong being more than meets the eye. Neil Armstrong was not a famous programmer, and he certainly wasn&#39;t known for any major leaps in computer engineering. He was a competent pilot, and excellent when it came to astrophysics. These were understandable. Programming? No way. Absolutely not.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">But it was. NASA was made up of America&#39;s most competent engineers, physicists, scientists, and programmers. All of which played their part in getting a man on the moon. Rider knew Opportunity like the back of his hand. Down to the last screw. Down to the last wire. Down to the last digit of binary. It was with this knowledge that he started fighting against Ada Lovelace&#39;s Chicago Typewriter. The two refused to give the other an inch of ground, trading corrupted programs like stocks and attempting to trap the other like a hunter traps a rabbit.

Slowly but surely, using every ounce of knowledge on Opportunity&#39;s inner workings, Armstrong managed to bring the Typewriter to its proverbial knees, stalling it to a halt. It still held several subsystems, such as the sensors and A/C, but Armstrong was in control of his mount yet again. Originally, Opportunity&#39;s gap in maximum and current speed was like its list of needed modifications; growing longer by the minute. Now, it was looking up.

However, such ability had a tremendous weakness. Armstrong was now processing three different battles at once. Stamping down on Archer, driving Opportunity, and protecting said vehicle from the Chicago Typewriter. Even if one counted the formermost to be a casual passtime, Armstrong was still doing two extremely taxing things at once. It was unlikely that such a good opportunity™️ would come again. Now was Archer&#39;s time to strike...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kari was getting real sick of the nonsense Pascal and his servant were spewing like tired old trope characters. One was airing the typical grievances against the aristocracy, ones she felt did not really apply to her but rather the supposed common enemy they had while the other was sounding less like a scientist and more like a generic villain from a sci-fi film. It was hard to tell if they thought they were putting on a show or were beginning to lose their minds. Plus that damned egg smell kept lingering around despite her efforts.

While she wished to watch Ada begin his counter-attack, Armstrong&#39;s lasers forced her to hit the floor and generate a frozen sheet above her head to shield herself from the resulting debris. She coughed as the sky became congested with dust and her line of sight of the two servants completely disappeared besides the occasional flash of light or glint of metal from the rover.

It was a relief that she was able to save Ada from himself and Rider&#39;s attack but now it was all up to him. She could easily force open a path through the dust though Rider would then also have a clear shot at her as well. 

The one good sign she received from the obscured chaos was the slight pull of mana as Ada likely used her corrosive vials. Good, they may not do much at first but he was using a liquid that was a poison for metal. It would spread from the impact and spread across the hull, eating away at the integrity of the rover and ultimately bring it down upon itself. They only had to buy a bit more time.

&quot;Why play fair in war? The duty of a master is to support their servant and help them gain the upper hand by any means. Likewise for a Servant and Ada has done the same for me many times. We compensate for each other&#39;s faults and are strong because of it. Can you really say the same?&quot; Kari bit back, trying to see if the guy even knew the importance of the relationship between servant and master. How such an odd guy got this far was a miracle.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Though she would be surprised by the sudden appearance of a bottle of a liquid flying towards her face. Oh she was not about to have a repeat of the egg from earlier nor risk whatever the contents were inside. She skewered the bottle with one slender dagger of ice and then reshaped the draining liquid into another shard of ice, now discolored by its contents. 

Pascal might see Kari take out a clear vial and fashion its contents into what looked like a spear, fusing the mystery liquid one to its front like an arrowhead. She then grabbed the whole weapon and and threw it like a javelin at Pascal, using the light over his head as a guide. The thing took off with great speed and seemed to propel itself with frosty air, rushing towards him like an icy missile. 

&quot;We&#39;re not playing that game again, cook. I think you should taste your own creations before you send them off. You can have this one back!&quot; It surged toward him and ruptured in the space in front of him, aerosolizing the contents of the bottle into a pressurized spray that would douse him in it along with a side of ice fragments from the javelin, threatening to puncture his skin. 

She began to ready several other projectiles as well. Kari was not taking chances today and it was looking like she was preparing for a fight with someone within her own caliber of magecraft. In her mind, it might just be good practice for the future. She&#39;d figure out Pascal&#39;s skills soon enough.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>&quot;Yikes.&quot;</em> Pascal thought as he witnessed his almighty bottle be skewered like nothing. Well, that wasn&#39;t surprising, considering it was a mage he was up against, but he expected his opponent to react far more cautiously.

<em>&quot;Well, that&#39;s fine! I can still salvage this...I hope.&quot;</em> He prepared himself, hiding a lit lighter behind his back. He knew that he had to play risky in order to keep Archer&#39;s Master away from Rider, but this might be a risk that he couldn&#39;t afford to take.

What he knew, however, was that he could not forgive himself for not trying at the very least.

&quot;Hah. Sounds to me that you&#39;re just not confident in your own Servant. You got Archer, a Knight class Servant, and still feel doubtful about his chances of success? If you want to be an aristocrat, at least play the part right! If I were him, I certainly wouldn&#39;t need my Master to baby me at all times.&quot; Pascal spewed, mocking Kari&#39;s line of thought. Rider might have left him for dead several times, but they had grown stronger from it as a result. He could not sense this sort of growth from Kari or Ada.

&quot;Rider could take down two chumps like you in a heartbeat, if that&#39;s the case! However, I&#39;ll be generous and spare yourself the embarrassment. Your fight is with me--&quot; Before Pascal could finish his goading, he got what he deserved as Kari proceeded to weaponize his bottle&#39;s contents and fling a spear at him. This was followed by numerous ice shards. It would have been a truly painful attack, had Pascal&#39;s bottle been filled with magical contents.

Alas, it contained something far too plain for a trained magus to predict.

Pascal tossed his lighter at the spear in a panic. It reacted with the contents of his bottle, causing a sudden explosion that sent shards of ice flying everywhere.</span>

Being so close to the blast, Kari would be surprised to find two ice shards penetrate her body. They collided with her chest and stomach, piercing her as she failed to summon her defenses in time. Blood dripped from her chest as she cursed her lack of caution. She had no idea that fire would elicit such a reaction from her projectile. But how?!

Pascal was no worse for wear, as he failed to dodge in time as well. Two shards embedded themselves in his knee and his stomach. He cried out in pain, but bit his lip and endured it. He knew this would happen.

As he stared at the injured Kari, he grinned a bit.

&quot;...<strong>Gasoline.</strong> What you thought was some magical potion or weird concoction was just gasoline.&quot; Pascal explained. He had saved a bit from the warehouse, since Saber had reminded him that explosives could be brutally effective, even against Servants. 

&quot;I definitely didn&#39;t expect it to still work while inside ice, but hey. It did! <strong>BLEH!</strong>&quot; He said before spitting up droplets of blood. The shards still hurt like hell.

&quot;...See what I mean? You&#39;re too focused on your little plans to account for the people involved in them. The moment something out of the ordinary happens...BOOM! Typical aristocrat. I wonder if Archer is laughing right now.&quot; Pascal taunted. Despite his injuries, he wasn&#39;t worried at all. After witnessing Saber and her destructive might, his worries started to look a lot simpler in comparison.

He swiftly placed his hand in his bag, as if about to bring out something else to finish Kari off.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ada and the Chicago Typewriter were separate entities. While he could command the device like an extension of himself, its inner workings remained a mystery even to him.

And he was content to leave it that way.

Ada wasn&#39;t an engineer. Nor had he ever aspired to be one, as much as he liked designing machines that were more imaginative than feasible. He had dabbled in the sciences, but only as much as was needed to fulfill an immediate need. Even the piece of code that had coined him as the mother of programming was not the crystallization of decades of practice, but rather a byproduct during his crash course in calculus and trigonometry, which he only took up in order to decipher Charles Babbage&#39;s study notes.

A flight of fancy, a spark of inspiration. These were the true driving forces behind the man who was currently engaging in an all out war against the world&#39;s finest technological hivemind. 

Naturally, he was fighting a losing battle.

Ada witnessed the power shift rather than felt it: the ground below him became a blur as the rover regained its former speed, then sped up some more. Rider had plugged the hole on the floor with his foot and cut of visuals to Opportunity&#39;s interior, but that only confirmed Ada&#39;s suspicion that the Spaceman was somehow managing to keep up, and even outpace the Chicago Typewriter without undergoing a system reboot.

Was this even feasible? A mere astronaut, being him at his own game? Ada moved his bespectacled face out of the way of Rider&#39;s latest stomp and laughed. Who was he to question Rider&#39;s identity when his own was nothing but a patchwork? Rider clearly had him beat in the game of hacking, and all he had to do was simply accept that piece of truth and move on.

After all, programming had never been his forte.

Now that you have shown me just how passionate your are about your beloved moon buggy, who am I to stop it from reaching its full potential?&#39; He loosened his grip on the rover with one hand and started rolling up his sleeves. &#39;Please! Let me help.&#39;

The Chicago Typewriter retracted a portion of its cables. It stopped messing with Opportunity&#39;s nonessential functions and instead focused fire on the ones that mattered. Namely, its central computer and an array of peripherals such as steering, fuel, and its weapons. The number of system failures spiked at first, but Rider quickly got it under control. 

In fact, it felt even easier fending the vehicle now than before. Perhaps the Chicago Typewriter should&#39;ve stuck to its old strategy of overwhelming him with numbers. Now that he only had to deal with a handful of subsystems, Rider felt like he could even afford to stomp Ada with both feet! The steering wheel turned smooth as butter, and Opportunity sped down the street like a mini rocket. Its acceleration was sublime, it was insane! Any faster, and Rider felt like the rover would take off the ground like a jet-

Wait. Wasn&#39;t this a bit...too fast?

Rider was confident in his steering ability, but had Opportunity ever been able to accelerate like this? The Chicago Typewriter had gone silent ever since he had crushed the final bug. Everything should&#39;ve gone back to normal, but now that he had taken a closer look...

What is this? Was Opportunity overperforming? Its readings were off the charts! Speed aside, Rider was certain that its laser beams now packed at least twice the punch. His rover had received a free upgrade...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Chicago Typewriter extended a single tendril towards the hole on the floor and wormed its way through the crack between it and Rider&#39;s puffy suit.

Ada had been waiting on the other side with another cable extended from under his sleeve. He wasted no time connecting it to the one from the Chicago Typewriter the moment it poked through the hole. A spark lit up where the two cables met. Ada&#39;s body started dissolving into a storm of glitch flakes as he established a new link with his laptop and then, Opportunity. 

He was gone in the blink of an eye as his entire being was turned into data.

Opportunity&#39;s radio flared to life.

&#39;I hope you find this gift of mine satisfactory, Rider.&#39; Ada&#39;s voice came through the radio with twice its maximum volume. &#39;Now, why don&#39;t you take some time off and tour the earth as you did the moon? You&#39;ve earned it for successfully completing your first hackathon.&#39; 

The radio went silent for a moment, then came back with a blast of pure static. It had started switching channels and occasionally, Rider would hear a few words being spoken or tunes being played as the radio captured a few signals from Persepolis and its neighboring cities. Was Ada trying to annoy him to death with an amped up sound system? Then he could&#39;ve simply kept up with his chatter. Was there a point to using the actual radio? What other purpose-

<strong>Radio was an excellent carrier of data.</strong>

How many seconds had it been since Ada had last spoken? How fast did radio waves travel? Faster than the speed of sound, on par with the speed of light? Could Opportunity travel at the speed of light?

Actually, where was he even headed right now?

Ada&#39;s laptop accompanied Rider in his lonesome cabin, still connected to the rover, still boosting its system. Opportunity was getting farther and farther away from the two Masters...

Ada alerted Kari as he popped out of an antenna on top of a neighboring house. He took a running start and jumped far out towards his Master, landing with a less-than-graceful <em>thunk</em> as his legs dented the ground. 

&#39;I need you to liquify yourself. Can you do that? If not your entire body, then your legs would suffice for now. We have but a brief moment before Rider reconvenes.&#39; He said, urgently, not even stopping to fuss over the state of his shirt, which now bore a few unsightly metallic stains. He held his glasses steady as its lens started displaying a radar of sorts. 

A single red crosshair the size of one&#39;s palm appeared a few inches over Kari&#39;s left thigh. 

&#39;Attribute selection, Master.&#39;

A new dot showed up on his lens. Deep in the alleyway, Pascal would suddenly find a palm sized crosshair over his left thigh as well. While it didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything other than hovering and being an eyesore, he knew that having anything appear on him without warning rarely lead to good news.

&#39;Target lock-on.&#39; 

Ada looked Kari in the eye as he held out his firing arm and started recalling his weapon from Rider&#39;s van. &#39;I am going to shoot you in a few more seconds. I ask that you trust me.&#39; He said clearly and slowly, watching Kari&#39;s movements in case she thought that he was turning on her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Armstrong was a Rider, most definitely. However, that didn&#39;t mean he liked riding a ticking time bomb, which Archer had created for him. 

As he struggled to keep up with his various tasks, Armstrong was acutely aware of Archer mocking him through his rover. That angered him, but what was he to do? This whole &quot;Riding&quot; thing was hard! As such, all he could do was push back the Chicago Typewriter for control of his rover. However, when he did, Archer pulled a fast one, pun intended..

Opportunity sped up. Armstrong breathed a sigh of relief. The fight was over. He could focus on taking out Archer. However, Opportunity continued to speed up.

And up.

And up.

Several alerts went off as Opportunity reached its performing limit and surpassed it with ease. Opportunity was capable of outspeeding even the fastest of Servants, but at this point, the terrain outside was becoming a blur. The last thing Armstrong saw was Ada on the roof of another manor. After that, everything turned to a mix of gray and blue. 

&quot;Blasted Archer. What did you do?!?&quot; Armstrong bellowed as he heard Ada&#39;s smug voice through the radio, before disappearing. Opportunity&#39;s hull rattled as it breached the speed of sound. NASA&#39;s engineering was impressive, but it couldn&#39;t hold up much longer. 

Armstrong was really getting tired of this thing. He locked the wheel in place, manifested a mechanical saw, and starting hacking away at the tendrils. True, they were durable. However, Archer gave his Typewriter a specific order to enhance Opportunity. As long it was still doing that, there were no issues.

Besides, he was going to need the speed.

Using a massive manor&#39;s front yard as his turnpike, Armstrong unlocked the wheel and turned <strong>hard</strong>, strafing back around to charge back towards Archer. He left a small remainder of Typewriter&#39;s tendrils intact. Already in the distance, he could see the faint speck that was Archer.</span>

<em>Five. Four. Three. Two. One.</em> Armstrong lowered the gravity.

Liftoff. 

Opportunity sailed in the air, aiming for a presumed location near Pascal. Armstrong wasn&#39;t sure of his specific location, but hopefully he&#39;d be able to run towards the rover quickly. It wouldn&#39;t squish him, at least. Probably.

Armstrong waited until he had sailed past Archer, but before he reached Kari and Pascal. just before he got near the two, he opened the door to the cabin and hopped out.

Armstrong spread his body wide as he flew out of the sky. Suddenly, he was glowing with magical energy. He was like a shooting star, burning up in the atmosphere. However, he would still make it down to Earth.

<strong>&quot;Confirming texture of Earth. Confirming texture of Luna.  Magical energy sufficent. Superimposing Reality Marble onto Earth. Calculations are clear, Houston!&quot;</strong>

Armstrong increased the gravity of Oppy, coming in line with Perespolis... And most importantly... Archer.

<strong>&quot;For the sake of humanity&#39;s progress, I will take the first step! APOLLO 11: THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.&quot;</strong>

For the first time since Neil Armstrong was summoned, an eagle truly did land as both Servants and Masters were encompassed in the gray embrace of the moon.

Being pierced by her own projectile was bad enough. It was a cold, sharp and persistent pain that brought Pascal’s criticisms into an uncomfortable focus.

“Damn, that was some trick, you weasel. Just don’t expect your tricks to work every time,” Kari begrudgingly replied as she moved her hand to cover the chest wound. Odd, she could almost hear the blood drip at a constant tempo, doubtful Pascal would notice. 

Though what the cook said next surprised Kari almost as much as the bomb she unwittingly made, but not for the same reason. It was more as if what he said was the last piece of a puzzle she had been putting together for a while and shocked how well it fit.  

“Hehe, you know, you actually have a point, fry cook. I’ve kept myself bound up with meaningless rules and “plans,” trying to stop the slightest mess or disruption.  It’s gotten me nowhere except pursuing some old hate. We can see where selfish desires ultimately lead,” she thumbed towards roughly where Szrac’s mansion laid. 

“So it’s time to let that go and remove all that lead to this wretched mess in the first place. We all need to change and I’m not going to hold anything back to do so…”</span>

The natural beat of the blood called to her and together with the pain, forced her to recall the discovery of her origin but also whispered to her the promise and beauty of its potential. It was a disconcerting experience in some regards, the call of chaos tempting her away from a comforting order, but if she was to win and surpass the limitations set before her, there was no other choice. 

As such, she flattened the ice to where it was no longer protruding and forced the blood to dry up and clot around the wounds instantly. Yet the rhythm remained, perhaps it was simply the natural flow of things or perhaps her own heart. Regardless, Pascal would see Kari cause her injury to virtually disappear and no longer bother her. She had an odd smile on her face as well.

‘I’m sorry but your path ends here, and no trick can stop the coming tide…” Kari said before throwing three vials in the direction of Pascal. While he braced for impact, they never came, instead colliding with the walls and floor of the alleyway, bursting in a frosty mist before covering them in thin sheets of ice like a fresh canvas. 

Pascal may look away briefly as he got his bearings but that was just enough for Kari to close the distance. When he looked back, all he would notice was the sound of a large splash as something collided with a pool of water, yet there was none around other than a ripple spreading across the concrete wall. Now that was odd…</span>

They waited until Kari shot out from one icy wall towards the other, swiping at Pascal with what looked like a blade of ice, the shards then firing off themselves like bullets in a crowded hallway. It would be difficult to dodge all of them but this was not a one off attack. 

No, the process repeated itself like a tide, ebbing out and flowing in, first slow and few in number but gradually picking up number, size and speed. A leaky drop taking only a moment to become a torrent that threatened to carry Pascal away. Kari herself showed no caution at all, letting herself get hit yet she never got knocked down.

 Curiously, Pascal’s attacks first bounced off her but soon started to phase more and more through her body as if it was nothing but a moving stream. Yet as soon as it had started, the storm had stopped for a few seconds. A temporary calm, a measure of rests, the tempo still present underneath only to be ended dramatically by the ice starting to boil violently around Pascal’s feet. It would erupt in a simulacrum of flame fashioned not of gas, heat or smoke but rather of biting wind, pressurized water and impossibly twisting ice.</span>

They would attempt to burn Pascal in their own way while the violent cracking of the icy sheets would send yet more shards to cover the alley in a punishing hail. Sometimes Kari would emerge out of one and blast him with a blossoming spiral of ice, her clothes now starting to take on the same flowing properties as her body, the edges fraying and coursing as if caught in their own current. 

Yet these fires would not die down into embers but rather began scatter their contents into the area seemingly at random, propagating a disorderly tide of ice, water and wind that was rapidly growing into something like a wave, starting at the entrance of the alley. It picked up more and more material as it drew closer and closer to Pascal, now more like a tidal wave that threatened to sweep all before it off their feet. It was impossible to avoid in this instance, the alley itself made sure of that, picking Pascal off his feet and send him tumbling, tumbling within this sea of change only to be slammed against the hard, uncompromising wall at the end of the alleyway. Yet while he was pinned against it, the wave continued on through the wall, emptying out who knew where. 

What was left of the alley was an altogether different nature, decaying concrete had been smoothed and washed, mysterious stains on the walls morphed into wavy swirls and lines of pigment and the ground once littered with refuse and trash now adorned by the flotsam and jetsam of the wave, small artistic decorations and icy recreations of flowers, bushes and trees and the woman at the opening was just as changed herself.</span>

Ada would notice how she already seemed to be in a partially liquidized form and for the first time was altering her as well. The definition of Kari Tovesky had become somewhat harder to define, approximations needed where absolutes once were. Her eyes were the best example of this, her pupils and irises seemingly filtered through a layer of cloudy water and her clothes seemed to change color ever so slightly as they danced in an unseen current.  She was truly fluid in this moment, having touched down to the root of her origin and embracing it in the moment as she gave in to her inner self and had focused on the art of creation rather than the rage of vengeance. 

“Of course I can, Ada. I don’t know how but I can hold this state across my entire body without passing out. I think I might have just exceeded by own limits and became who I am really supposed to be!” She said rather excitedly gesturing to her altered state, though she sobered up rather suddenly when Ada put her in his crosshairs. She knew what he intended to do and it was a grim task but if Ada was here, this was probably their last chance to end this quickly and move to end Szrac’s tyranny and inflexible demands on the populace.

<em>sigh, deep breath in, deep breath out.</em> “Very well, Ada. Do what you have to do, I trust you completely. After all we’ve been through, I couldn’t do anything less…” She matched Ada’s stare as he prepared to attack Kari and Pascal with one keystroke. Right as he pulled the trigger, Kari closed her eyes and waited for that sensation to return though she would not waver this time, she would not show fear nor anger. She was fluid, she was accepting of what flowed her way and it would pass through harmlessly, the pain deadened, the damage mitigated.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The battle between Servants was getting far too chaotic for Pascal to grasp. Rider and Archer were two Servants based in the realm of science, something that was far, far distant from him. He could not compute their complex strategies and constant one-upping, so he entrusted his hopes to Rider and tried to keep Kari at bay instead.

He grossly overestimated his chances.

Not only was Kari barely fazed by the two icicles in her body, she proceeded to heal those same wounds. Pascal was the only one who had suffered from it, having two projectiles stuck on him as Kari proceeded with her next attack.

&quot;...Water? She&#39;s...What?!&quot; Pascal reacted in disbelief. Kari was melting right in front of him. A scary prospect for someone who had never witnessed this type of Magecraft. He thought about retreating, before being forcibly dragged back to the alley thanks to Kari&#39;s tampering. She had completely morphed the environment around her, along with her own body, in order to strike at Pascal in a flurry of blows.

Ice from one side, fire on the other, coupled with the running water of Kari restraining him and tearing his body apart. It was painful, far more than any magical or cooking incident he had been involved in his life. Burns from oils and explosions from failed spells were nothing compared to this pain.

His mind was crumpling. He would give anything to be set free. Even giving up on the Grail War started to sound appealing. He noticed a cross hair on his leg, realizing that Archer had changed targets.

The pain would be over soon...

At least, until he saw the moon. No, not in the sky. From the ground.

Apollo had landed and Armstrong was right beside him.

That&#39;s right. He wouldn&#39;t give up. <em>He couldn&#39;t.</em> Not when they were so close to victory. Not when they had survived Saber.

...Not when he was so close to making up for his brother&#39;s dream.</span>

Ada eyed the tiny dot in the sky, blowing up pixel by pixel until he could make out the shape of Rider&#39;s moon buggy. To say that he and Kari had a brief moment to spare was a massive overstatement. Rider had chosen to keep the Chicago Typewriter connected until the very last second, which meant that as fast as he drove himself out of the block, he was now coming back just as fast. 

Opportunity was upon them in an instant, crashing towards the trio like a meteorite. Ada narrowed his eyes. He doubted Rider was delusional enough to kill his own Master, and he was certain Opportunity&#39;s laser blasters lacked the precision to pick Kari off in such close proximity. Hence, the rover could only be a distraction to throw him off his game.

The situation hadn&#39;t changed a bit.

The Chicago Typewritet reconstructed itself in a flurry of glitch flakes. Ada pulled Kari close with his other arm, holding her liquidized form steady as he pressed the barrel of the gun into her thigh. The crosshair shifted closer to Kari in accordance until its center matched the Typewriter&#39;s muzzle. 

&#39;I apologize for not testing it thoroughly beforehand. Feel free to hit me if it hurts, but do take off the glasses first.&#39; Ada warned Kari, then pulled the trigger.

An excruciating pain blossomed from Pascal&#39;s leg.

He hadn&#39;t seen it coming. He couldn&#39;t have seen it coming. As the Chicago Typewriter fired a contact shot into Kari&#39;s thigh, a mana bullet of the same caliber manifested over the fabric of Pascal&#39;s pants, then pushed into his skin with the same force. While Kari&#39;s bullet went through her liquified form and hit the ground behind her, Pascal&#39;s ordinary human leg received the brunt of the damage as the bullet burned through skin and flesh before lodging itself within him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The shot had been completely duplicated down to its material, firing point, and effect. It didn&#39;t matter how good Pascal was at dodging, so long as Archer had another cooperative target who shared a few of the same traits with him, there was nowhere to run. Opportunity sat waiting, mere steps away from him, but could he really make it there in time?

Even if he somehow made it inside, what difference did it make if Archer could target him through Kari, anywhere, anytime?

Pascal was doomed. 

But not if Rider had anything to say.

Reality trembled. A curious weightlessness was upon Ada as the backdrop of the aristocratic mansions phased into the pitch black nothingness of space. The ground was replaced with the grainy surface of the moon, while the temperature around them dropped by a few dozen degrees. 

An utterly uninhabitable reality marble.

Up ahead, Pascal started showing symptoms of being stranded in space. So that was what the rover was for. Rider&#39;s noble phantasm targeted everyone indiscriminately. Ada made a mental note as he shifted the Chicago Typewriter towards Kari&#39;s other leg, intent on finishing his job. Humans weren&#39;t meant to survive in space. If he could put Pascal out of his misery soon, then Rider would perish and Kari wouldn&#39;t need to suffer-

Ada&#39;s eyes widened as the liquid form in his arm began to stir. Something was interfering with Kari&#39;s origin, making it harder for her to remain liquidized. A complication of Rider&#39;s noble phantasm, no doubt, and one that Ada was powerless to help. What were the chances that her origin would malfunction if he shot her right now? Should he still test it out? Kari had given him her full trust. Dare he tarnish it all for an impromptu experiment?

Rider couldn&#39;t stop him. Pascal was cornered on multiple fronts. He was <em>so close</em>.

Ada ground his teeth and withdrew his gun.

<em><strong>Attribute selection, Male.</strong></em>

A crosshair appeared over Ada&#39;s own chest. Two dots showed up on his radar, one for him, and the other for Pascal as the chef received his own crosshair in the same location-

<em>Two?</em>

Ada frowned. &#39;<strong>Attribute selection, Male.</strong>&#39; He repeated the command, but the dots on his radar remained the same. Him and Pascal. Rider was crosshair-free.

This wasn&#39;t right. His programming was flawless. For Rider to avoid being targeted could only mean one thing: he did not qualify as a male. 

Were people that progressive back in the 60s? Or had Armstrong been summoned just like him, an anomaly that had veered off from history as it had been recorded? 

Ada did not have time to entertain his hypotheses. If one tag failed, he&#39;d simply select another. 

<em><strong>Attribute selection, Female.</strong></em>

A single crosshair illuminated Kari&#39;s translucent form as the dots on his radar reduced to one. A bust.

<em><strong>Attribute selection, Machine.</strong></em>

His own chest lit up from the crosshair, as did Opportunity. Rider remained spotless.

<em><strong>Attribute selection, Servant.</strong></em>

Ada breathed a sigh of relief as both him and and Rider were properly targeted this time. Rider was still a bona fide Servant, even though his convoluted spirit origin had inadvertently saved him. Ada released the crosshairs.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This solution was suboptimal. Rider had proven his hardiness in their earlier bout; Ada didn&#39;t like the thought of putting a bullet through his own chest without knowing for certain that it would penetrate Rider&#39;s in the same way. He had to tag both Master and Servant at the same time to maximize the damage, but generic tags such as &#39;<strong>human</strong>&#39; or &#39;<strong>leg</strong>&#39; either excluded one of those two, or included Kari in the calculation. He didn&#39;t want to jeopardize his Master. Was there something that Rider, Pascal, and even himself shared, that Kari didn&#39;t?

...

<em><strong>Attribute selection, Left Shoulder.</strong></em>

Four crosshairs appeared, one on the left shoulder of each moonwalker. It was futile to target something like the heart, for a Servant&#39;s heart was not an actual heart. However, to only target Spirit Cores meant leaving Pascal out of danger. As such, Ada deemed the neighboring left shoulder to be a suitable alternative. So long as he amped up his shot to a mana bomb, the blast radius would more than suffice to eat through one&#39;s torso, should they leave themselves unguarded. While Rider&#39;s durability remained an uncertainty, Ada had no doubt that it would be devastating for a mere Master like Pascal.

And Kari.

A few cables extended from under his sleeves and plugged themselves into the Chicago Typewriter, raising it above him as they maneuvered the gun to point at its operator&#39;s back. With both arms liberated, Ada spun Kari around, then wrapped them around her from behind in a tight embrace.

If he couldn&#39;t exclude Kari, then he&#39;d just tank the shot for her instead. Servants could be repaired and, at worst, resummoned, but a magus and their bloodline couldn&#39;t be so easily replaced. Kari&#39;s importance outweighed Pascal on multiple fronts: both her role as his Master and her aptitude as a magus. Therefore, the choice was clear. Out of the four of them, Kari alone must survive.

And Kari would be safe.

&#39;Stay absolutely still.&#39; He whispered in her ear. &#39;This won&#39;t take but a moment.&#39;

The Chicago Typewriter grew white hot as mana concentrated in its barrel. Then it fired.

Four shots brimming with energy headed towards their respective targets&#39; left shoulder, each shooting from exactly ten inches away. One zoomed in on Rider, the next went after Pascal&#39;s helpless form. The third and the fourth overlapped as they raced towards Archer, before burying themselves both into his torso-

While a single step from anyone else would send them careening into the inhospitable void of the Reality Marble, Armstrong simply strut about, confident in his ability. 

Confident in the notion that Archer and Kari were incapable of existing in such an inhospitable environment. Kari, especially.

Archer was safer than most, secure in the fact that Ada Lovelace did not gain her power from myth or legend. Secure in the fact that she formed the foundation for modern computer science. Secure in the fact that she was modern.

Still, this gravity was annoying for the Adam Lovelace of today.

&quot;This is what my existence was created to do. This is all I strove to reach. This is my everything.&quot; NASA spread out its arms gracefully, just as it did for Saber. &quot;Sorry to cut our game of cat and mouse short, but this game ended as soon as Houston was put in harm&#39;s way.&quot;

Even on this lunar recreation of the moon, the effects still applied. As such, Pascal was doomed to die within thirty seconds. That was adequate. He could win within thirty seconds, especially if he was ordered to do by Houston.

And so he had been.

Words were a waste of time. Neil Armstrong simply nodded  in the direction of Pascal, his face unreadable behind the visor, however, his determination was apparent. He would not lose here. Not so close to Berserker. Not within his own Reality Marble. This would <em>not</em> be a repeat of Saber!

And so the timer began.</span>

In these temperatures, Kari would solidify quickly. If that wasn&#39;t the case, then her Magecraft would fail. It was only a matter of time. Unfortunately, time was an issue. He&#39;d need to deal with Archer manually, and secure Pascal, and then he would incapacitate Archer&#39;s Master. Killing her, if needed. The chance of her killing Pascal as he turned his back was too high to risk. Not this far into the War.

He sprinted towards Archer, using short, precise hops to control his movement. It had been but a moment before Rider was upon his opponent.

<em>Twenty-five seconds.</em>

Archer&#39;s Chicago Typewriter took aim. The specific attribute to target was locked in. This was checkmate for Rider and Pascal. He&#39;d never win before he got close enough to crush Archer&#39;s arm. It was over.

Archer, no, Ada Lovelace failed to fire. It took Armstrong off guard for a second as he came face to face with his opponent. Crosshairs appeared on various places throughout the battlefield. First Pascal and Archer, then Kari, then Archer and Opportunity, and then finally Rider and Archer.

By the time Archer got to the &quot;Machine&quot; tag, the gig was up. Rider saw Archer&#39;s mechanical legs, and also saw Opportunity. He laughed. He laughed hard. He began roaring with laughter at the absurdity of what was going on. It wasn&#39;t even that funny, but the situation was so stressful that Armstrong couldn&#39;t help but lose his mind over something so trivial. He hadn&#39;t been saved by his own skill or clever outwitting of his opponent. He had been saved by something fundamental and out of his control. Neil Armstrong, NASA, the first man on the moon... laughed.

<em>Twenty seconds.</em>

He impaled Ada Lovelace through the chest with a drill.</span>

I think it&#39;d be best if I explained:&quot; Archer said, producing the ID card he had on his shirt back at the Crab and Lettuce Restaurant. He let it dangle between two fingers. It simply read: <strong>Neil Armstrong, Astronaut, NASA</strong>. It was positively unremarkable. Just a simple identification card.

Suddenly, it changed.

<strong>Robert Gilruth, Project Head</strong>.

<strong>Alan Shepard: Test Pilot</strong>.

<strong>Katherine Johnson, Mathematician</strong>.

<strong>Jim Schultz...</strong>.

<strong>Janine Grumman...</strong>.

The list began to flow faster and faster, the photos of each individual becoming a blur of colors and information that even Archer&#39;s trained eyes could barely identify. However, one thing remained consistent among every form the card took.

NASA. The light reflecting off Rider&#39;s visor disappeared as he stared at Archer. &quot;Neil Armstrong is not a Heroic Spirit, sorry to disappoint. He died back when this world was flooded a century ago.&quot; With the finality of a prophet pronouncing the doom of his people, Armstrong removed the drill.

&quot;<strong>However, my existence was not a mistake. For the sake of my—his wish. I will bring the Holy Grail to my Master.</strong>&quot; <em>Not Houston, but Master</em>. &quot;With my head held high. That is what it means to be a spaceman!&quot;

First, take down the Servant.

Then, take down the Master.

And Pascal would be safe.

That was the mission given to Rider. However, it would be harder than expected to finish that mission with flying colors. He still had issues to resolve. Archer would not last long with such a gaping wound in his chest. However, Archer was a being of practicality and logic. These two commendable traits were paramount in achieving victory.</span>

His face contorted into a mix of fear and concern for Houston, as well as admiration and rage towards Archer. Here he was, monologue about his identity, while his enemy was still thinking of ways to win.

After all, there were no truly hard feelings between the two. They were simply Servants fighting the Holy Grail War with their minds, and Rider had been unwilling to risk his body in the same way that Archer had. Rider thought about this as he desperately ran towards Pascal, just barely managing to cover his shoulder with his body. It wasn&#39;t nearly enough. Even if he was capable of body blocking his own crosshair, he wasn&#39;t nearly positioned well enough to stop Pascal from taking a massive blow. He had failed as a Servant.

<em>Damn you, Ada. You were the smarter Servant after all. I salute you.</em> Armstrong thought morosely as he closed his eyes.

It enraged him how his final thought hadn&#39;t been towards his Master, but towards the enemy. He was truly a terrible Servant.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">$ Kari only nodded as Ada gave a warning with a dashing of his characteristic wit. This was neither the time or the place for her to rasp back. Nothing but total trust and cooperation was needed in this moment, though in her case, extreme concentration as well.  She let her breathes sync up with those of Ada as he readied Chicago Typewriter for the maneuver, their chests raising and falling as one.

BANG! The bullet ripped through her leg and shot out the other site in but a moment. If she had not been in touch with her origin at the moment, the pain would have been crippling but instead it was if someone had slipped a thin needle through. She could visualize the ballistic ripples tailing behind the bullet that would spread and resonate across her entire body, dispersing the energy before it could seriously harm any one part. It was an oddly beautiful and serene image for something so brutal in aesthetic. She tuned out Pascal&#39;s scream and continued to focus on the goal at hand only for the world to drop away from her.

They were no longer on the earth, she knew that for certain, staring out into the black, unending vacuum of space, the ground she was on did not respond to her flowing touch but rather sought to suck all of the warmth out of her form. it was cold and uncaring, uncompromising in its jealousy of her life and the fluids that she bore. 

Then the lack of air hit her and a primal fear gripped her mind. In a vacuum, the boiling point of any fluid would drop precipitously and turn to gas at or below room temperature. Suffocation was a terrifying prospect but to simply vaporize into a gas and dispersed across an infinite void was many times more dreadful.</span>

If the reality marble of Rider wanted to overturn her origin and its intrinsic mystery, so be it; however, Kari was going to use it to her advantage. She bled off some of the coolant from her body and let it harden around her entire body, forming an air-tight seal. Now she likely had a minute or two left as now it was just a matter of air supply. 

Now she could slow her breaths down without the fear of forever losing that air and take in the situation. Good timing since she narrowly dodged the drill that Armstrong thrust through Ada&#39;s chest. She moved to launch a few ice shards at the servant only for her power to fail completely as there was no water vapor or atmosphere for her to pull from. On the earth she was strong, but here she was at the mercy of the gestalt being assaulting her own servant.

Though perhaps it wasn&#39;t true to say there was no fluid she could pull from but it was highly limited so each thing she did would have to count. To win here meant to keep Ada running as long as possible so that he could finish the job against Pascal and NASA. There was no time to ponder the big blue marble before them or the fact they were face to face with one of the world&#39;s greatest scientific organizations that worked to defy boundaries just like she aimed to do. No, that was a luxury for another time. 

There was a hole to patch and seconds to do it before Ada unleashed his final attack, the victor here would be however was left standing and Kari was going to weigh the odds in both her and Ada&#39;s favor. She couldn&#39;t just die now and she damned sure was going to make sure Ada did as well. She took one of the few remaining vials off her belt, a mana battery... it would have to do.</span>

However, it would not stop there, now flowing into Ada&#39;s own veins, mixing his own with hers to fortify as much of his mechanical body as possible. Kari&#39;s strength was not just melting down unjust boundaries that stood in the way of man&#39;s progress but also strengthening the bonds one held in order to move forward and she was not about to let the man go in vain. They would survive, they had to survive together. 

There was no words that she could say in the void but her actions spoke far more than any collection of words or numbers ever would. Even as Ada sacrificed his own body so that Kari could live, she still worked to strengthen Ada and shared her convictions with him. It was the third time she had her back to him but neither would take advantage of that weakness. They had finally moved beyond their flaws in that moment and became what they should be

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The three-way confrontation between Rider, Archer and Kari had reached its peak. Pascal couldn&#39;t even feel the air around him as his face turned blue from the lack of oxygen. They were on the Moon, meaning that even he was affected by Armstrong&#39;s Noble Phantasm. With this injuries and a lack of breath, he wouldn&#39;t last long...

And neither would Archer&#39;s Master, it seemed. Archer had sensed Rider&#39;s intent to finish Kari off, so the pressure was on him as well. He raised his gun, deciding to finish it all in one shot. He fired his accursed bullets, one aimed at Pascal and the other aimed at Rider. Strangely enough, two bullets aimed for Archer himself...

Well, Pascal couldn&#39;t waste time thinking about Archer&#39;s own self-sabotage. He was more preoccupied with surviving himself. Rider had tried, and failed, to catch the bullet for him. The bullet penetrated the cook&#39;s torso, adding one more injury to the pile of lacerations, penetrations, burns and frostbites that he had received in the last minute.

He was a dead man walking.

Barely able to remain conscious, Pascal merely leaned on the transformed alley wall, blood pouring from his stomach as he passed out. Rider could still feel mana surging through his body, but it felt faint. Unless he attempted to administer first aid to Pascal quickly, then his Master would surely perish. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pain, numbness, then an emptiness spread through his torso as it fractured under the strength of his own shots. Fortunately, Kari was quick to recover from the shock of being teleported into space, using her mana to fortify his body. Otherwise, Ada wasn&#39;t sure if he could tank both shots at once. 

Despite being summoned as a Knight class Servant, the boost he had received to his strength and durability was minimal. Sickly and repressed, Ada Lovelace was never meant to manifest as someone who could fight on the front lines. Every time that he did, he had to push himself to the absolute limit. It was inefficient, masochistic. 

It was a gamble.

Even now, as all odds stacked against him and as his own mana bombs wreaked havoc on his frame, Ada clung to a sliver of hope that he&#39;d pull through. No, it was more than just hope. He knew he could do it. He understood his body more than anyone, more than the mad Rider who had just drilled a hole into Archer&#39;s chest in favor of saving Pascal, more than his own Master who had thrust her hand into the hollow in his chest in a vain attempt to fix him up.

Well, if it was Kari, then maybe she could understand too.

Light dissipated as the mana bombs exhausted themselves. Kari was still being held in place, but what had been a full hug was now clumsily executed through a single arm. She looked down, then saw pieces of fabric, flesh, metal and a greenish liquid forming a small ring as they floated around her. Every piece of scrap had once belonged to Archer, and what used to be Archer&#39;s body now bore a gaping hole where its left half should be. Wires and flesh twisted around each other in a mangled mess, blood and fuel leaked from blood vessels and tubes alike. Cracks formed over his exposed skin, dissolving into pixels that were more transient than snow.

What stood in front of her was not a human but a machine.

Memories stirred. Kari hesitated to face her Servant.

Ada coughed to get her attention.

&#39;This S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame you procured-&#39; He began, and Kari would almost be tempted to finish the sentence for him. Here it comes. Ada&#39;s favorite pastime, complaining about everything that had gone wrong to make a fool of her. Ada&#39;s voice overlapped with the one in her head, down to every word, every syllable. If she didn&#39;t know any better, she&#39;d be inclined to believe that the previous Ada Lovelace had possessed the current one in this very moment just to mock her a second time-

&#39;-well, that wouldn&#39;t be a fair judgement now, would it?&#39; 

Ada sighed, then broke away from Kari before his gore could contaminate her ice prism even more. 

&#39;I suppose this is the best this frame can do under my possession.&#39; He acknowledged matter-of-factly, without a trace of sarcasm. &#39;Frankly, I am impressed by how well it held up. Your quick thinking has saved your life, Miss Kari. It was I who failed to preserve mine.&#39;

&#39;With all due respect, I hope this is the last time we ever meet. Please strive to summon a proper Knight class Servant instead of a pretend Knight like me, should you ever find yourself in need of a Servant again. A mechanical body can only get me so far. Such is the limitation of machines.&#39;

More liquid oozed out of the wound on his torso - if it could even be classified as a wound at this point. Blobs of red and green lined up along the cavity, sticking to him like tumors under microgravity. Behind him, the Chicago Typewriter broke down, no longer able to maintain its form as massive amounts of mana evaporated from Archer&#39;s body.

Yet Archer stood firm, shrugging off his injuries without so much as a grimace.

To think that it was human error that ended up crashing my program...such behavior must be intolerable for an organization like you.&#39;

&#39;But, ah. It still turned out to be a good learning experience. So, no hard feelings?&#39; Ada extended his only arm for a handshake, his eyes briefly flitting to the mess he had made of Rider&#39;s Master. Humans were helpless in space. Without him, Kari would be completely at Rider&#39;s mercy. It would only be natural for Rider to repay what he had done to Pascal in kind.

But, well. It was still worth a try. Archer harbored no internal grudge against Rider. He could only hope the spaceman felt the same.

&#39;&quot;Houston&#39;s&quot; injuries are far from fatal.&#39; He stated calmly. &#39;Miss Kari is both a capable magus and entrepreneur. Since it is no longer likely that I can accompany her to face Berserker, the merits of stabilizing your Master outweigh the cost. Leave her be, and I will gladly terminate my program. A fair proposal, wouldn&#39;t you say?&#39;

Ada delivered his best smile. Skin cracked where muscles were pulled, pixelating and revealing the circuitry underneath.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Why did it have to be like this?

Rider thought morosely as he stood over Pascal&#39;s body, dazed and adrift. There were so many wounds. Combined, they created a net capable of entrapping even the most lively of men. Pascal was certainly not lively, and several of his wounds <em>were</em> fatal. Armstrong searched within himself, trying to look for someone, <strong>anyone</strong> with medical knowledge that would help him save his Master.

There was nobody.

&quot;Come on, Pascal. You need to get up. There&#39;s no way you&#39;re dying in some godforsaken field. The moon doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot; Armstrong murmured to him as it bent over. There was no doctor that Armstrong could pull out of NASA that would help save Pascal. Nobody. What was a group of engineers, programmers, pilots, and mathematicians to do in this scenario?

Solve the situation as an engineer might.

Tearing off a piece of armor from when the Chicago Typewriter shot at it, Armstrong pried open Pascal&#39;s jaw and put the tough material in the cook&#39;s mouth. &quot;<strong>Bite</strong>.&quot; He ordered, before pulling out a blowtorch. This was going to hurt, assuming Pascal&#39;s senses weren&#39;t overloaded. Even if they weren&#39;t, this might cause the Master to pass out.

An inferno of pain blossomed in Pascal&#39;s torso, unlike anything he experienced ever before. It was as if boiling cooking oil had been poured directly down his throat and through his intestines. Rider spoke to him as he seared Pascal&#39;s flesh shut.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;See? I told you so. Anybody can be strong enough, given they put enough work in. You said something about not being able to turn into Heracles overnight, and you were right. You know what, though? I think Heracles would turn green with envy if he saw what you managed to walk off. Keep going. You don&#39;t get to die until the mission is over.&quot;

Being cauterized was not a pleasant experience. Rider looked over his work. It wasn&#39;t enough. He had nothing that could save Pascal. He had bought the cook... what exactly, besides a mound of pain? Seconds? Minutes? Not enough.

Pascal Poirot would die. Neil Armstrong had failed. He turned to face Archer, face as unreadable as the surface of the moon. He eyed his former foe with trepidation as their eyes locked officially. Rider&#39;s visor had shattered during Archer&#39;s ultimate gambit.

&quot;Heh. Archer. Call me whatever. Am I truly NASA? Would I... No, Neil Armstrong even exist NASA wasn&#39;t sustaining the Spirit Origin? I call myself NASA, but right now, as my Master dies, I feel very much like Neil Armstrong.  Makes me question my own claims on who I am.&quot; Rider took Archer&#39;s hand and gave it a firm handshake. &quot;What would be the point of something like landing on the moon if human error wasn&#39;t involved? You know how many monkeys and humans alike I shot up into the sky to see what worked? The fact that we succeeded at all despite human error is what makes the achievement so satisfying.&quot;

Armstrong said thoughtfully, before shaking his head. He was rambling, and even worse than that, he seemed far more flippant than usual about his motivations and goals. Maybe it was the fact that he was about to fade into the Grail, since Pascal was so close to death.

&quot;I have no qualms with you, Archer. This is a war, and this is what soldiers do. I am a slave to the notion of progress, even as I wish to fly among the stars. Progress is everything, unfortunately.&quot;</span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">So? What&#39;s wrong with that?</span> A tiny voice, the chorus of a thousand employees being poured directly into his mind. Armstrong&#39;s face went slack. This had never happened before.

<span class="pre pre--inline">Pascal&#39;s death is ultimately irrelevant. Your only goal is to usher in a new era of progress. There is still another Master available, now that Archer is doomed to self destruct.</span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">The boy is useless. Soviet! Unreliable! Inferior! Cast him aside, and use the other Master. Now that her Servant is gone, she will gladly ally with you.</span>

<span class="pre pre--inline">Why does the Master matter if all we seek is the Grail? </span>

The voice was right. The journey was ultimately irrelevant. The Master? Trivial. The destination, the fruits of Rider&#39;s labors were the main prize. Who cared if a Master got crushed underfoot if it meant that the world would progress beyond the confined existence on a flooded world.

<span class="pre pre--inline">Yes... Kill him! Kill Archer! Contract with the other Master!</span>

&quot;I will.&quot;

NASA manifested its gun. This was unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected. They were still foes, so Rider finishing the job and killing Archer and Kari was not unexpected. However, that wasn&#39;t the case. NASA turned around towards Pascal.

It readied its gun.

No. This wasn&#39;t right. This didn&#39;t make sense. He was Neil Armstrong. A man of the people! He couldn&#39;t just—

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">KILL HIM!</div>

NASA fired. Neil Armstrong missed. The blast missing Pascal several feet off. Armstrong dropped the gun, he scratched the back of his head awkwardly. He had become a demon of rationality, if only for a moment.</span>

&quot;Tsk. It&#39;s lucky there&#39;s actually <em>still</em> a little Neil Armstrong floating around in there. What a load of space wreckage. I must say, we at NASA are far too good at predicting what will happen in one year instead of the years that follow it. On top of that, Houston&#39;s cooking has grown on me in recent days. I must be mad. No, it was mad to even consider getting rid of the little rascal. Or should I say Pascal?&quot; Armstrong joked lamely as he picked up Kari by the back of her shirt.

He was relieved. If Archer was willing to put in a good word for Kari, then who was Rider to decline? The fact that he had even elected to consider killing Pascal for a better chance at victory disgusted him. NASA may be the majority of Rider&#39;s power, but they were directed by Armstrong. Despite that, they were a whole. NASA was Armstrong, and Armstrong was NASA. There was no reason for him to refer to himself as one or the other. In the end, he was Rider.

&quot;Kari, eh? Sounds Russian. I suppose I can take care of her for you, from one genius to another. However, I&#39;d like to make an addendum to our agreement.&quot; Rider cracked a smile. &quot;Let me take a look at your legs, next time we meet. Steam power is nice and all, but a few rocket boosters would do wonders to your mobility! Think about it.&quot;

What a stupid thing to ask. Next time they saw each other, if ever, they would never remember one another. Archer knew this, and Rider had to know this as well.

Rider saluted Ada Lovelace in his final moments. &quot;Make sure to give the Grail one hell of a stomach ache. It better be <em>bawling</em> for release by the time I get there to join you. Sayonara, Archer.&quot;

With that, Rider took one step for himself, and one gigantic leap towards winning the Holy Grail War. Even if it was, admittedly, bittersweet. However, he couldn&#39;t look back. He had a Master to attend to.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the mana bombs converged on Ada&#39;s back, Kari still kept letting her mana flow from her back into the icy lattice she had woven into her servant&#39;s false veins, fuel lines and circuits. In a sense, they were but a mirror of her own complex internal wiring, an extant of her own hopes and desires that she could not allow to simply fade away, even in a noble yet calculating self-sacrifice that also sought to extinguish the lives of others. To win this gamble was paramount.

Yet even her own skills and knowledge of Ada&#39;s systems could not divert a servant&#39;s ultimate fate: to die for their master&#39;s benefit. She could feel the layers of ice begin to flake off, crack and ultimately shatter under the intense stress. She kept pouring in her own mana to reinforce the few remaining layers even as the flesh and machinery of Ada began to disintegrate. She could feel the vibrations rattle through him and into her, chattering her teeth and shaking her skull in an attempt to disrupt her focus yet she would not stop until the blast was over. That second felt like an eternity yet it ended like any other moment. 

As it ended, Kari saw that only one arm was left cradling her loosely.Then she saw the ring of fragments beginning to orbit around the pair. She turned to face Archer and saw the truth. Even with her solidification at work, she still couldn&#39;t stop Ada from vaporizing half of his body. She saw the discordant mixture of flesh and metal, blood and fuel, scraps of fabric and lines of code. 

She paused as she looked at Ada&#39;s compromised frame and paused, the memories flooding back from the first time she lost Ada yet they were both different people then, their view of their machinery both overwhelming negative and shameful. It was hard for her not to feel a bit of that looking up on Ada&#39;s true self yet it was not what she really felt this time.</span>

If half her body was violent ripped to shreds, she could visualize the hellish mess left behind resembling that of Ada, wires and fuel lines would be replaced with thick tubes of coolant, heat sinks, vents and the associated mechanisms, the pungent green and yellow fuel replaced with a liquid a deep shade of purple dense in depleted mana not to mention the filaments that made her early artificial circuits in her limbs or the metal casket that entrapped her heart. To see Ada as a machine would be to call herself inhuman as well. 

She had always wondered what in particular drew Ada to her on that fateful day and perhaps it was not just fate that had a hand in the decision but rather how similar the two were. Where one stood, their reflection was never too far behind. Their minds had pulled them together in the end and their metal infested bodies bound them together.

God, she could predict what Ada was going to say and match the condescending tone perfectly, she almost did finish his line as she did back when she summoned the genius a second time yet there was something in his face that Kari instinctively felt was one more of gratitude than derision. 

She was proven correct  and the trust further vindicated. However, Ada pulled away from her even as she wanted to pull him closer in that moment. She was going to lose him again and say goodbye to the chances they had at victory.</span>

She had been given a second chance to navigate and control the flow of their shared experiences, yet no matter which direction she redirected the river they were on, it would always flow into the same sea in the end. 

The one comfort she had was that this second trip was far longer and richer in its route, the experiences molding both of them into better people made stronger from the journey itself rather than any particular reward at its end. It seemed her origin had still had much to reveal.

When the reality marble finally dissipated, the makeshift space suit around Kari collapsed on itself and ran off her in purple streams, not unlike that bust water main had doused her last time. The sound of the dripping water pulled her mind back to the great act of kindness Ada had done for her and while there was nothing Kari could do to save Ada&#39;s life, perhaps there was another kind of gift she could repay and make their entrepreneurial partnership complete. 

With fresh air in her lungs and strength in her arms, she brought the broken form of Ada into one final embrace and pulled him close enough to whisper into his ear. 

&quot;Ada, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single spirit out there that could ever replace or outdo what you have done for me. You may have machine parts but there&#39;s nothing that could be interchanged to make yourself better. Not a better vessel, not more flesh, not more metal,&quot; 

As Kari pressed into him, Ada would not feel the regular chill that her systems provided but rather a soft warmth that seemed to spread into Ada&#39;s own body and sink towards his own core, a gentle fluid that would for just a moment make him feel complete. Her own power sought to sink into his very spirit core and modify a single piece of code.</span>

It is not ultimately a matter of flesh or metal that makes one human, its their spirit, their dreams, desires and their flaws. You made me realize that Ada and I want to share that gift with you. Even if you forget everything else, I want you to remember this and make it a part of yourself, your own origin.&quot;

The gentle pull of Armstrong reminded her that it was time to go and thus, she had to pull herself away from the machine that had given her humanity back to her. It was perhaps the most painful thing she had to do that moment, compared to pulling herself away from her companion, losing a shot at the Holy Grail or letting the rest of the Aristocrats down were insignificant.

&quot;Good bye, Ada Lovelace. You will always be the bright shining star of humanity&#39;s self-improvement to me and I will make the world a better place in your stead. In that, you have my guarantee as your master, business partner ... and your mutual confidant.&quot; Kari said, feeling the corner of her eye begin to well up with a fluid she hadn&#39;t felt in three years.
