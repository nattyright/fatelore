                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A few minutes later, Opportunity rolled up into an alleyway between a restaurant and a supply warehouse. Opportunity was so massive that it barely fit between the two buildings with the doors open. It was about mid morning—the fight between Rider and Saber had taken several minutes, as had the retreat itself. Saber&#39;s destructive Noble Phantasm had been left behind at the docks. There was no reason to chase an enemy when the whole city would become a tomb.

&quot;I must say, Houston...&quot; Armstrong said as he shifted uncomfortably. Sandro&#39;s addition had cramped up the cabin significantly. Rider&#39;s helmet rolled around by his legs. &quot;...I understand the need to retreat, but this is a bit of a drive, but nowhere in Perespolis is safe. So we should make a plan as quickly as possible.&quot;

Armstrong hopped out of the rover, kicking aside a discarded barrel as he did. He walked around the exterior of Opportunity. He scratched his chin thoughtfully, and banged his fist on the exterior of the rover. It gave a satisfying clang! Rider smiled.

&quot;NASA engineering never fails. Giants from the Age of Gods? Hah! I spit on them. We&#39;re still good for another voyage. I won&#39;t need to make any makeshift repairs just yet.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re aristocracy, aren&#39;t you? Can&#39;t you call your aristocrat friends and tell them about Saber? They probably have far better Servant frames than Rider. Don&#39;t you guys stockpile the entirety of the island&#39;s Knight class Servants?&quot; He asked.

&quot;Well, get them all out! We need as many Noble Phantasms as we can get if we want to take that beast down!&quot; It was a sound plan, but one with a very huge flaw.

“Plus it wouldn&#39;t matter, if we let multiple non contestants get involved I doubt it would go over well…. On Top of that my father would sooner see me die then lend me a hand” Sandro had very few ideas coming to mind, he needed to calm down and think straight 

He shook his head stomping at the floor, this was all his fault, failing was one thing but now everyone&#39;s life was in danger. His fit of rage was however interrupted by a flaming boat flying overhead. Watching the terrifying act jolted something in his mind 

“There is one thing I know… it makes sense considering she&#39;s a saber class and all, but all of Sinmara’s power comes from her sword. It has the power to generate fire and destruction like i&#39;ve never seen before… Maybe her sword is the key to the problem” It certainly made sense to Sandro. He thought back to the fight at the scrapyard where Sinmara’s sword gave off a godly display towards the end of battle.

We probably have a few hours at least, a day at most. Besides, I don&#39;t think any Noble Phantasms could compete with that constant spewing of magical energy. Sinmara could match us pound for pound.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m almost willing to try knocking her into the ocean, but at this point, she&#39;d probably just evaporate it and keep on going. She survived the moon. A little salt water isn&#39;t going to hold her.&quot; With that, he began muttering to himself. At a current rate of growth, factoring in maximums and minimums... Magical energy output... Every mind at NASA solved the equation in the blink of an eye.

&quot;The world has about sixteen days, at the most aggressive estimate.&quot; Rider said gravely, letting the words sink in. Was it possible for a Servant to destroy the world in just over two weeks? A boat soared overhead.

&quot;Her sword&#39;s probably a divine construct. We can&#39;t break it. Separating it from its user would be best, but I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;d do it. Houston can make a terrible omelette, capable of sending anyone to the bathroom for hours, but I&#39;m not sure how&#39;d that help. Nothing tastes so bad that it could disarm a fire giant.&quot; Rider said jokingly.

What was the point of the mafia and the aristocracy? What were they good for if, despite all of their power, they were completely incapable of defending the city they had worked so hard to gain control of?!

It was ludicrous. Pascal was no stranger to abandoning places, cutting off ties and being an aimless vagabond, but he considered himself an outcast. One unable to fit in society. He didn&#39;t expect that same society to be so consumed by pride and greed that they were willing to let a city sink instead of joining forces.

The aristocracy truly was a stain on this world.

Rider and Sandro bickered with each other, discussing plans and stratagems. Saber&#39;s sword seemed important, but Pascal trusted Rider&#39;s theory on it being unbreakable. Sixteen days was too short of a time limit, especially if Saber got stronger with each passing day. They had to take her out now if they wanted to survive.

Of course, Armstrong seldom lost his sense of humor in desperate situations. The omelette joke made Pascal frown due to its poor timing, but it also lulled him in a sense of deep thought...

...He saw himself years ago.</span>

<em>&quot;Pierre, why do you want to summon a Knight class Servant so bad? That&#39;s only three choices out of seven!&quot;</em> It was a windy evening at the Poirot manor. Mama and papa had gone out for a long walk, leaving baby Pascal and teenage Pierre at home. Pierre was busy reading history novels and biographies about famous men and women. In particular, he had focused on knights, warriors, heroes and so on.

<em>&quot;Ha. Foolish Pascal. It is simply the mark of an aristocrat. Servants are our weapons, so it is their duty to appear dignified. Swords, lances and bows are all weapons that have been part of nobility for generations. It is only normal for us to summon similar Servants.&quot;</em> Pierre explained.

<em>&quot;Really? But I heard that all the cool kings and queens were summoned as Riders and Casters! Oh, oh! Also, Assassins are super cool! Don&#39;t they just snipe the masters for you?&quot;</em> Pascal imitated a gun with his fingers.

<em>&quot;...Heh. This is why you&#39;re still immature, Pascal. Cool factor only gets you so far. Plus, the aristocracy bows to no one. Why would I summon a king and share my kingdom with them? A queen no matter how attractive, is just a manipulative Servant after my own riches.</em> <strong>They should serve me.</strong> <em>Not the other way around.&quot;</em> Pierre replied while adjusting his hair.

<em>&quot;Besides, while most kings are Riders, the class itself is still associated with peasantry. Riders have vehicles, horses, chariots. The wheel was invented for kings, but it is not used by kings. It is used by the peasantry to transport the king&#39;s riches to their rightful owner. The aristocracy has no need for cart drivers in a war, dear Pascal. They need only powerful, impeccable weapons. Be sure to remember that...Eh. Who am I kidding? You won&#39;t need this knowledge anyway...&quot;</em></span>

Pascal felt like punching his past self. His brother, too. He felt like punching them in the gut, yet he also wanted to hug them at the same time. What a douchebag.

However, Pierre was right about one thing: Rider didn&#39;t have much going for him. If even his trump card had failed to stop Saber, then realistically, what could Rider do?

He was yet another cart driver. A complete peasant.

But on that fateful evening, Pierre said something else...

<em>&quot;But, if you really have to ask, the only Rider I&#39;d summon...would be</em> <strong>Odysseus.</strong> <em>You probably don&#39;t know them, but they seem like the ideal Servant for a king. A smart, ruthless man that acts less like a king and more like a devious strategist. His strategy of using the Trojan Horse still amazes me to this day. I recommend you read up on him, if you really idolize Riders.&quot;</em> 

And Pascal did. And he hated them. Found them boring, even. How was he supposed to find the adventures of some bearded guy funny? Pierre had some weird tastes.

But he had to admit, Odysseus&#39; strategies were quite applicable to the current world.</span>

&quot;...Rider. How much can this vehicle carry?&quot; Pascal asked, tapping at Opportunity&#39;s insides. &quot;Kilos? Pounds? What measurements do you use?&quot;

&quot;Also, turn left, then keep going straight ahead until you see a restaurant called &#39;Bemfoy Hooters&#39;. After that, turn right.&quot; He was guiding him somewhere? For what purpose? Had the gears in his head begun to spin?

&quot;<strong>Clearly, you&#39;ve never made an omelette.</strong> The first thing to learn about them is that you cannot make them halfheartedly. Breaking and mixing the yolks well is essential. Well, I&#39;m going to turn Opportunity into an &#39;omelette.&#39;&quot; It sounded like Pascal was speaking nonsense, until he explained his plan.

&quot;Or, if you&#39;ve ever read it, I&#39;m going to turn it into a <strong>Trojan Horse.</strong>&quot;  <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span></span>

His face was grim, but his eyes were still bright despite the fate of the world resting on their shoulders. He turned to face his Master.

&quot;What do I look like to you? Some backwater American physics teacher stuck in the 60s? Come now, NASA uses the metric system, kilograms and whatnot.

Since that was the case, swapping systems of measurement was nothing to the space agency turned Servant.

&quot;It&#39;s good to know that despite the world ending, the Hooters brand remains.&quot; Armstrong said dryly, moving past it. More flaming debris flew overhead. Armstrong turned past the restaurant Pascal had signified, and arrived at some sort of building. Was this a warehouse?

&quot;Odysseus?! Ah, he&#39;s fun to talk about, not fun to meet. Always talking and his wife this and his wife that. At the Thron—&quot; Armstrong stopped, and turned over to Pascal. His helmet was still rolling around the floor of the rover. He seemed to understand where Pascal was going with this.

&quot;Master.&quot; Armstrong said, looking at him seriously. He hadn&#39;t used his traditional name for Pascal. &quot;Do you mean...?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal didn&#39;t say a word, stepping out of the vehicle once the three arrived at the warehouse. Like he had expected, there was no one there, most likely because civilians were too busy panicking at the sight of a gigantic fiery demon approaching their neighborhood.

&quot;There are two places in Persepolis that use massive amounts of oil, methane and gasoline: The docks and the restaurants. We need cooking oil to cook. Methane to light our stoves. This warehouse is packed with those items.&quot; Pascal explained.

&quot;That&#39;s our <strong>omelette.</strong> A gigantic bomb. We&#39;ll grab these methane tanks, oil canisters and so on. We fill your Noble Phantasm with them and let that horned bitch snack on it. Once it&#39;s inside her, we blow her up.&quot; Pascal said, sounding quite stern and serious. It sounded like something that he had done before, but Armstrong couldn&#39;t possibly imagine that. Meek and cowardly Pascal? The same man that was whimpering upon facing Szrac?

Little did he know, was that he based this plan on Pierre. <strong>In more ways than one.</strong>

Pascal stared at the ground, being reminded of bad memories before tuning them out and slapping his cheeks silly.

&quot;Do you get me, Rider? This is a trip with no returns. Now, don&#39;t go bitching at me with stuff like &#39;This is suicide!&#39;. <strong>I KNOW IT IS!</strong>&quot; Pascal stomped the ground in frustration, his cool demeanor shattering as he returned to the irritated adult that he always was.

&quot;But...But...&quot;

&quot;...I can&#39;t think of anything else.&quot; He lowered his head in defeat. &quot;So please, <strong>blow yourself up for this city, Rider!</strong>&quot; <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span></span>

Poor Sandro had been beyond stressed since he summoned his servant. “Well if we can&#39;t do anything about the sword I’ve got no ideas “ Sandro answered shaking his head 

Upon hearing Pascal speak Sandro picked his head up listening closely to the plan. “A-are you crazy?” Sandro asked, spitting his cigarette out in surprise. Pascal would purposely lose to save this dump. “To ask your Servant to die? Where’s your honor…” Sandro looked to the side almost immediately realizing the hypocrisy of his statement. 

“Ff that&#39;s what we’re gonna do I can help…. I&#39;m well versed in Alchemy and I can make almost anything combustible… on top of that I should be able to make the combustible properties of fuels more volatile…. I might also be able to make your servant&#39;s suit resist the heat from the bomb… But I can&#39;t do anything about the force of the explosion.” Sandro wanted to lend a hand in the problem he created, if he could help them take down Sinmara he would do whatever he could.

Strapping a man to a rocket and shooting him up at the moon was difficult, and it took many attempts for NASA to figure out how the math was supposed to work. An entire satellite was lost because someone forgot to carry a zero. When you were racing against the Soviets, time was everything, and math was bound to fail unless double checked. Sometimes it wasn&#39;t double checked, and sometimes people blew up. Not on paper, anyway. Never on paper.

&quot;I figured as much. Packing ol&#39; Oppy full of explosives is insane and suicidal, but what the hell. Not much we can do. If it explodes, everyone in the area will be...&quot;

Incinerated. Neil Armstrong, the crystallization of NASA itself, the individual filling the Rider slot in this Holy Grail War would perish. Not even for the Grail, or for the shot at a wish. He would be burned to ash protecting the last scraps of humanity.

&quot;Pascal, I...&quot; Armstrong began, unsure of what to say. Silently, he turned around, and opened the door to Opportunity. He fished out his helmet, and turned back to his Master.

&quot;**Sir, it would be an honor! I will gladly sacrifice myself if my Master demands it. If humanity itself is threatened, then I shall do whatever it takes to keep it safe. It was an honor serving you, despite our ups and downs. Thank you, sir!&quot;

With that, Armstrong put on his helmet. He clasped his hand on Pascal&#39;s back as he walked past him, his voice quietly subdued.

&quot;Come on, we have work to do.&quot;

But Armstrong was fine with it. It was their only hope. If anything, he seemed to be glad that Pascal was willing to set all of his cards down just to take out Saber. Was this how it felt to be a Master?

&quot;...We had ups? You&#39;ve been nothing but downs for me so far!&quot; Pascal shouted back, but you could hear the gratefulness in his voice. He was glad that his Servant trusted. 

&quot;Wait...you know combustible Magecraft? Shit! Why didn&#39;t you say so earlier?&quot; Pascal turned to Sandro, surprised that the pampered aristocrat actually knew something useful for a change. He pointed the man to nearby barrels filled with gasoline, along with methane tanks.

&quot;Help me carry these over to the Noble Phantasm. You too, Rider.&quot; Pascal pointed at Opportunity. Perhaps Rider should explain to him what a &#39;van&#39; was, since he was getting rather tired of constantly having his vehicle be referred to as a Noble Phantasm. What happened to good old cars and scooters from his lifetime?

&quot;Once they are inside, you can work your magic.&quot; Pascal turned to Sandro.

As proof of that, they could feel a subtle shaking on the ground, distant screams of panic and fear, and the slightest gleam of light upon the horizon. Each was nothing to be afraid of on its own, but together, they painted a clear picture.

Surtr was coming.

Sandro nodded as Pascal ordered him to help move the explosive goods over to the Opportunity. Dropping the butt of his cigarette on the floor and stomping it out, he would walk over to the fuel canisters hoisting them up in his arms with an ‘oof’

“Just let me know when we’re good and Ill get to work with my magic” Sandro stated with a nod. He placed the canisters down in the Noble Phantasm moving out of the way for the others to get in, Sandro would however find himself tripping backwards and landing on his bum. It seemed that the ground was shaking ever so slightly, and it had knocked him off balance.

“I dont think we have much time.” He said getting nervous as doom approached

It was impressive how quickly a toaster and two Masters could work when certain death was upon them. Armstrong&#39;s superhuman strength was the greatest asset, as he was able to load Opportunity at a rate that far exceeded the other two Masters. It had only been a few minutes since they started, and Rider&#39;s rover was filled to the brim with dangerous explosives. One match could kill them all.

Despite making record time, Sinmara and Surtr had made substantial progress. Being massive DID make you slower, but it also meant that you had less ground to cover. A single step from the fire giant was worth about five Armstrong hops. That meant that despite being fast workers, time was almost up. Rider grimanced, already picturing Sinmara&#39;s smug face as she prepared to squish them flat.

This would give her something to chew on.

&quot;All right, she&#39;s all filled up.&quot; Armstrong yelled, banging on Opportunity&#39;s chassis. &quot;Work your magic—er, Magecraft, Sandro. We&#39;re on a schedule! Being her Master isn&#39;t gonna give you credit in her book. Chop chop!&quot;

&quot;Anything else we need, Houston? This is your mission.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal watched the preparations proceed smoothly, but it was barely half of the battle. He could feel the ground shaking, a sign that Surtr&#39;s steps were getting closer. They were running out of time.

&quot;Aristocrat guy! Light &#39;em up. Do your magic or whatever. This amount of tanks and canisters should be enough.&quot; Pascal said as he counted them.

&quot;Also Rider, there&#39;s not much else. It&#39;s a simple plan, meaning that it&#39;s easy to mess up. We are carrying delicate canisters, meaning that Saber could just slap your Noble Phantasm and we would all explode.&quot; Pascal pointed out. That was something Armstrong had completely overlooked. Sure, carrying bombs was a good idea in theory, but in practice, it just meant that you were a living landmine.

&quot;...So we need someone to distract Saber. Keep her busy and make her ignore your vehicle. I think we all agree that you&#39;re the only one capable of doing that, Armstrong.&quot; Pascal admitted, albeit reluctantly. That made sense, but something was amiss. If Rider would handle the distraction, then--

&quot;<strong>I&#39;ll drive.</strong>&quot;

Pascal didn&#39;t say that with confidence. If anything, it seemed like he was shitting his pants as he gulped down empty air. He was incredibly terrified at the prospect of driving that clunky vehicle to its destination.

But he said that anyway. Despite his lack of confidence, he knew that he was the only other person on Persepolis who had a grasp on how the vehicle moved. No one else could ride it better than him, besides Rider himself.

It was a suicidal plan, with around a dozen or so ways for it to go wrong, but it was their last chance.

&quot;Let&#39;s go, then. I&#39;ll sit in the front.&quot; Pascal said, getting on Opportunity as he sat in front of the steering wheel. He cooled his nerves and took deep, heavy breathes as he felt Opportunity shake from Surtr&#39;s steps.

Saber was coming... <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span></span>

Sandro didn&#39;t like being classified as an Aristocrat, it only made him feel like more of a slave to his lineage.

The young magus reached his hands out placing them on all of the makeshift bomb pieces one by one. He stayed on each canister for barely a second. Making already combustible material even more combustible was a walk in the park for him.

After a few seconds he stepped back from the vehicle giving Pascal and rider a nod. “Alright she’s ready, it&#39;ll be one hell of an explosion”

Sandro couldn&#39;t help but feel bad about the situation. Both Pascal and Rider were putting their lives on the line to clean up his mistakes. Sandro watched Pascal hop in the front seat, the man was suicidal. 

“A-am I just supposed to sit here and do nothing?” Sandro really would be fine with sitting back, he didnt have any intentions of dying, but compared to the two brave souls in front of him… he felt useless.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal&#39;s offer to drive Opportunity was surprising to Rider. For a moment, he was prepared to tell him off. Oppy was <em>his</em> mount. It couldn&#39;t just be loaned to anybody, and Pascal couldn&#39;t drive it as well as him. The Servant shook his head. There was no reason to be so petty now, with so much on the line. Besides, Opportunity was as much Pascal&#39;s as it was his own. He was a Servant, and Pascal was his Master.

As the Master of Rider settled into the driver&#39;s seat, his Servant leaned into the cabin, and began going over controls. &quot;...most importantly, the gravity can be altered here.&quot; Armstrong tapped a small lever on the dashboard. It was indistinguishable from the rest. &quot;If—<strong>when</strong> you&#39;re about to give Saber this snack, press this button.&quot; Armstrong tapped a bright red button, blazened with NASA&#39;s logo as well as an !. &quot;Ejector seat. Time it right as you reach the height of your arc, and you&#39;ll get maximum lift. The explosion should push you away.&quot; Armstrong frowned. &quot;You might disintegrate on explosion, as will the parachute. Hm... Good luck and Godspeed, Houston.&quot; 

Armstrong shut the door to the cabin, and walked over to Sandro. &quot;Oh no, you have a <em>very</em> important job to do: You&#39;re going to find us a boat. According to my calculations, a detonation of this size with these winds will send my Master flying towards the docks. There better be a boat waiting for him, lest he drown. Remember, it doesn&#39;t matter if the mission is a success if the people don&#39;t make it back home alive.&quot;

With that grim reminder and a cheery salute to Sandro, Armstrong took a large hop to the top of Bemfoy Hooters, the best place for a last stand against a fire giant. Every person had a part to play. This would be the new world&#39;s Apollo 11. Armstrong tapped his visor.

Inside the rover, a radio blared to life.

Just as they had made the last preparations, they heard a mighty roar, one able to strike fear into the hearts of beasts and gods alike. Though perhaps describing it as a roar was disingenuous - it was a battle cry, a scream of war, a declaration of violence towards whomever happened to cross its path.

Namely, Rider, Pascal, and Sandro.

Surtr finally became visible, barging through a luxury five-floor WcDonalds in the process. The giant had grown since last they met - up to eighty feet tall, and still expanding with every second. It was clear that this thing, this horrid Noble Phantasm, fed upon destruction. Given the volatility of this stratagem, it was evident that should this plan somehow backfire, should Pascal miss and Opportunity fail to blow him up, then they would have missed their chance. 

They had to stop Sinmara and Surtr here and now, or else everything would be over. Now, it was time to do or die.

&quot;...Got it.&quot; He said, even though it was clear that he would have wished to know more. Armstrong knew that too, but both of them understood that it was time to act now. Sandro knew this too, and would feel glad that Armstrong gave him a chance to prove himself.

Unfortunately, their battle had already begun: Surtr had appeared, now far bigger than Saber as he prepared to raze the restaurant district to the ground.

It was time to act.

&quot;...I&#39;m off. Good luck, Rider. This is probably the last time we&#39;ll see each other.&quot; Pascal shivered, turning around and waving Armstrong goodbye on the car window as his Servant headed over to Hooters.

Now it was his turn. He took a deep breath and thought about his life. He thought about Pierre. How he had wanted to do nothing with Grail Wars ever since that incident.

But he wouldn&#39;t let those regrets consume him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Opportunity sped forward, Pascal having finally mastered how to start up a vehicle. He drove forward, steering the wheel around just as he learned during the fight against Berserker.

His destination? <strong>Surtr&#39;s head.</strong>

&quot;Rider, start distracting him or something! If he sees me, he&#39;ll just squash me like a bug!&quot; Pascal radioed using Opportunity&#39;s transmitters. They were conveniently linked to Armstrong&#39;s comms.

As he said that, he sped forward with his vehicle. It was approaching over 100 km/h, yet he seemed to be headed for a dead end. He was driving straight towards Surtr&#39;s gigantic foot...

A crash?

<em>&quot;Please be the correct button. Please be the correct button. Please!&quot;</em> Pascal pleaded in his head as he pressed one of Opportunity&#39;s billion switches.

<strong>LOW GRAVITY ENABLED.</strong>

A robotic voice said, as Opportunity now started to float. But it didn&#39;t lose its earlier speed. It was almost flying!

&quot;Yes!&quot; Pascal exclaimed. His plan was a success. He wasn&#39;t going to crash on Surtr&#39;s foot...

...<strong>He was going to drive on top of it!</strong> Thanks to the low gravity, Opportunity was now driving on top of Surtr&#39;s leg as if it were driving on a vertical wall. At the speed of 100 km/h, it had surpassed his foot and was now climbing up to his knee. Opportunity kept accelerating...</span>

Armstrong confidently jested over the radio, before killing the connection. He swallowed. As the commander of the Apollo 11 mission, he knew how to put on a brave face. If he showed anything but his best, how could he expect to bring out the best in others. He put a gloved hand on his visor. Today had been an emotional roller coaster, but it was finally coming to an end. Showtime.

Saber and Surtr stomped into view, towering over the tallest buildings in the distrct. It was like those kaiju movies that Americans had fallen in love with. Armstrong had never cared for them, but now he was in one. Only a Holy Grail War would offer such an opportunity.

Bracing his legs, Armstrong took the largest leap upward that he could. Combined with his low gravity and power as a Servant, Armstrong was able to reach Surtr&#39;s chin without much of an issue. He saw the outline of Sinmara amidst all the flames, unified with her lover through fire and brimstone. Unhooking the laser gun from his shoulder, Armstrong took aim at Surtr&#39;s face.

From the corner of his eye, Armstrong saw Opportunity and Pascal driving up the foot of Surtr. Pride blossomed in Rider&#39;s chest. Here he was, worried about Pascal, when he had already gotten a hold on driving his rover. The man didn&#39;t need the help of his Servant anymore, he was just fine by himself.</span>

My drive is like a shooting star. <strong>Die, Saber!</strong>&quot; Rider roared as he powered up his gun to maximum output, before blasting Surtr in the side of the face and filling Sinmara&#39;s vision with a bright green light.

Saber didn&#39;t die, naturally. Sinmara and Surtr were far too durable to be stopped by a simple attack, but it was bright, loud, and annoying. He was like a fly, a fly Saber was longing to swat. As soon as he got close to being finished, Armstrong would simply strafe away.

Armstrong produced a tether used by astronauts during spacewalks, before swinging it like a lasso.

<strong>Chink.</strong> A roar of pain and outrage as it landed in a depression in Surtr&#39;s face. Eventually, it would melt, sure. Armstrong didn&#39;t mind.

He had a lot of cable.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Restaurants burst and stalls ignited into flame. Delivery trucks and bikes were knocked aside before exploding. Each one added more and more might to Surtr, increasing his overall power with every passing moment. Such a destructive area, so flammable and destructible! It wouldn&#39;t take long to erase it from Persepolis.

But then, intervention. The Opportunity Rover, which had once ran away from the giant, was now barreling towards it, clambering up the colossal leg like a spider. What was the plan? What did they intend to do? Did they simply wish to die a warrior&#39;s death? Foolish. 

There would be no Valhalla when she was done here.

But then, a distraction, and a bright one at that. Surtr was struck by a blast from Armstrong&#39;s gun, momentarily blinding it. However, if the astronaut had hoped to damage him at all, he would be sorely mistake. Just like Sinmara, Surtr also possessed a Giant&#39;s Outer Shell, one thick and durable enough to easily dismiss such a blow.

However, it did succeed in diverting attention. Rider soon found himself in the path of Laevateinn as the giant swung the Divine Construct, aiming to cleave him in half and destroy his Noble Phantasm in the process.

Sandro ran out of the restaurant after Pascal had made his heroic exit ready to blow the enemy sky high. Running along the side of the docs Sandro tried to ignore the screams of terror and the commotion being Caused by his allies.

It was harder than Sandro expected to find an unmanned boat, maybe people had taken them to try and get away from the crazy monster on the horizon, not like it mattered anyway. 

Coming up on an empty boat Sandro would run along the little strut to the entrance and hop in the captain&#39;s seat. Luckily whoever last used the boat left the keys in and the boat was on. Whoever&#39;s boat it was must have hopped off only to later run away when they saw imminent destruction. 

Unfortunately there was one problem…. Sandro couldn&#39;t drive a boat… well it couldn&#39;t be that hard could it? His whole life he could always hire people to do the steering for him. He had until Pascal made his move to figure it out. Sandro would fiddle with the controls pulling the shift to the R for reverse, that much made sense.

He soon passed the groin area, now driving on top of Surtr&#39;s stomach and heading towards his chest. At this distance, it would be rather hard to not notice the Opportunity. Pascal dreaded to know what Surtr would do in case he saw him.

&quot;Rider, I&#39;m near the chest. He&#39;ll probably see me soon, so try to do something by then, got it?&quot; Pascal quickly radioed out before continuing his journey. Fortunately, it seemed like Surtr was too busy with Armstrong for now to notice Pascal approaching his chest...

...but he forgot someone else. Sinmara wasn&#39;t only Surtr&#39;s wife, but his eyes and ears too. She laughed at Armstrong&#39;s pathetic attempt of an attack, but she was also mesmerized by the chaos and destruction caused by her husband. Her longing gaze had accidentally directed her towards Surtr&#39;s own chest area...where she saw the Opportunity drawing upward.

She sensed something suspicious afoot. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

Pressing a button on his belt caused the tether to retract, bringing him closer to Sinmara and Surtr, all while dodging the sword. He then turned around and fired a blast as Surtr&#39;s hand.

<strong>pew pew pew.</strong>

Giant&#39;s Outer Shell laughed in the face of such paltry attacks, but the move had enough force behind it to push Surtr&#39;s hand by about a foot. Laevateinn fell, missing Opportunity by a scant few inches. As long as Pascal was safe, that was all that mattered.

He saw Pascal driving upwards towards Surtr&#39;s chest. However, there was only so much the astronaut could do to distract the giant for so long. Eventually, Saber would notice Opportunity and Pascal, and the gig would be up. 

Saber noticed Opportunity, and the gig was officially up. 

Armstrong swore and disconnected the tether, falling towards Opportunity. He predicted where Pascal would be as he drove upwards, and his calculations were correct. He landed atop his Noble Phantasm with a loud THUD! Inside the cabin, the radio crackled to life.

Houston, we&#39;ve got an issue. You&#39;ve been noticed much earlier than I anticipated. Who knew that driving up someone&#39;s chest would invite their attention? I&#39;ll try my best to redirect incoming fire.

At least, it should have been. However, there was one more obstacle that stood in their path.

Sinmara.</span>

A ugly, pestilent thing, a foul attempt that wished to retain the natural order of things, no matter the method.

How foul. How plain! It must be wiped away.

Scowling, the giantess drew a sigil in the air, carving it into the smoke and steam that billowed off of the fire giant. The rune hovered in the air ominously for a moment, before glowing a brilliant orange and launching a stream of flames towards the swiftly ascending rover, one that was also filled with combustible explosives.

This was the wall that waited at the edge of eternity.

Just like physics dictated, Surtr&#39;s massive size led to him being massively slow as well. The smaller an ant, the harder it was for a human to notice it unless they were paying extreme attention. This was the boon of the weak. They were so insignificant that ascended beings like Surtr could barely notice them.

Of course, Sinmara was not like her husband. Just like in her legend, she was devious and much more sinister. She wouldn&#39;t let the weak escape unscathed. In fact, she was almost excited by the prospect of wiping the Opportunity and its owner out. Those who rebelled against her husband deserved a slow and painful death...

Armstrong took notice, and landed on the Opportunity just seconds before Sinny had retaliated.

<strong>THUMP</strong>

&quot;...Armstrong? That you?&quot; Pascal asked out loud, hoping that he didn&#39;t have a demon suddenly standing on top of his vehicle. Armstrong assuaged his worries with a radio transmission afterwards.

&quot;...Wait, they saw us? Crap.&quot; Pascal muttered under his breath as he witnessed a mass of flames headed towards their general direction. Sinmara had taken action.

They were moments away from leaving the chest area. The next route would take them directly to Surtr&#39;s neck, where Sinmara was resting next to the giant&#39;s shoulder. Of course, the path had now been blocked by flames...

&quot;Rider, you know that if even one of those flames touches us then we&#39;re <strong>dead</strong>, right? I&#39;m carrying most of Persepolis&#39; gas funds!&quot; Pascal shouted out loud. He couldn&#39;t do much to avoid a fiery death, but maybe Rider had something planned. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

Well, that wasn&#39;t <em>exactly</em> true. Armstrong had a few fire suppression systems he could summon, sure, but nothing on the scale that they needed. It turned out that NASA didn&#39;t carry fire suppression meant to fight fire giants, shockingly. He&#39;d have to make a memo for that in the future.

However, that still left a predicament: how to deal with Sinmara&#39;s magic? Armstrong looked down at the roof of Opportunity. Hmm... Rider knelt down and pulled out a laser cutter, before cutting into the roof of Opportunity. When the Servant created a decently sized rectangle, he reached down with his gloved hands, and pulled it out. 

&quot;Nothing to be alarmed by, Houston.&quot; Armstrong said, his voice coming from above Pascal and from the radio. &quot;Just improvising. It&#39;s what we astronauts do! Shift slightly to your left, don&#39;t want to get any molten metal on you. The heat shouldn&#39;t detonate the explosives.&quot; Armstrong frowned from behind his visor. &quot;Probably.&quot;

With that, Armstrong tethered himself to the rover, took the slab of armor that he had hewn from it, and took a firm leap up to meet Sinmara&#39;s stream of fire and fury. Opportunity was resistant to extreme temperatures, as was Armstrong&#39;s spacesuit. He aimed to bodyblock it.

Fire met metal, and NASA&#39;s engineering held up, albeit barely. It looked as if Armstrong might actually make it to Sinmara.

Twenty meters... Fifteen... Ten...

While the metal plating took the brunt of assault, Rider could still feel the heat upon his suit, the flesh underneath sizzling from the flames.

Still, it was better than the flames striking their payload. They had made their way up the chest, and were now mere moments away from the head of Surtr. He could not counter-attack with Laevateinn from this range - not without wounding himself, at least. However, the great giant felt no concern for this. It was invincible, invulnerable, capable of bringing an end to gods and men. No simple rover would bring an end to it. It was too weak.

Sinmara thought the same thing. At least, until she caught wind of a familiar scent. Not one familiar to her time, but to this one.

<em>Gasoline.</em>

<strong>&quot;Surtr, WAIT!&quot;</strong> The ashen giantess screamed, her glee turning to terror as she watched the rover rush towards the head of the giant of Ragnarok. However, it was too late.

However, that was not what brought an end to the monster. Instead of the damage of the explosion, it was the force that pushed it back that would spell defeat. Surtr would sway backwards, and in that single moments, Sinmara lost her grip, and slipped the slightest amount.

For a single millisecond, she was not touching Surtr Romantia.</span>

The form of Surtr lost all shape, devolving into an explosion of pure energy akin to a supernova. It was exceedingly violent in terms of heat and force, causing the surrounding buildings to burn and shatter and break from the sheer rage within. Armstrong and Pascal would experience the same miniaturized armageddon, the scorching inferno blistering their skin and the force fracturing bones.

Yet they weren&#39;t the only ones caught in the crossfire. Sinmara, completely starved of mana and with no means of protecting herself, found herself in the exact same situation. The conflagration burnt her flesh to a crisp, and the force of the fall was enough to cripple what remained.

Not that it mattered. Now that Surtr had vanished, her fighting spirit was gone with it. Judging by the golden shimmer that was crawling up her body, the rest of her wouldn&#39;t last long either.

Opportunity charged straight ahead, running through the flames as Armstrong started being toasted in response. Pascal wasn&#39;t fully unaffected either, his childish delusion of invulnerability being shattered as he felt the vehicle burn hotter than a sauna.

&quot;You told me it was fireproof, you dick! AAAGH!&quot; Pascal screamed in pain , but endured it as Opportunity drove up to Surtr&#39;s neck. Then his chin. And then...

<strong>--BOOM!</strong>

Pascal didn&#39;t know what had happened. All he knew is that the moment he was staring down Surtr&#39;s gargantuan eyes, he almost pissed himself and pressed the eject seat button on flex. Lucky him, since the Opportunity crashed into the behemoth a few seconds later.

He was now floating in the air, having been launched several hundred meters high. He was slowly descending back to Persepolis, witnessing the results of the destruction from afar. Surtr exploded like one of his broken microwaves, taking several blocks and restaurants away with him. He wondered if the Crab &amp; Lettuce were still intact...

...But what mattered the most, was that they had won! Surtr had been defeated, and Rider could most likely take care of Saber on his own now. It was too late to celebrate though.

&quot;...Wait, what IS this thing?!&quot; Pascal exclaimed in confusion. He had never used a parachute before! It was tethering him in mid-air, but he was still descending downward?

&quot;Crap! Where&#39;s the boat? Where is it?!?&quot; He asked himself in terror. After defeating Saber, the lamest way to go would be to accidentally drown at sea! He desperately surveyed the destroyed docks for any signs of a boat to land on.

<span class="pre pre--inline">Of course it is, Houston. It&#39;d be odd for something made from the same material as rockets couldn&#39;t withstand atmospheric reentry.</span> The radio crackled in and out as the heat caused Armstrong&#39;s radio to misfire.

&quot;Hnnngh!&quot; The plate of armor was tossed aside as Rider got close to Sinmara. His calculations told him that all he would need were a few seconds, and they were correct. As such, the plate of armor had to go. Opportunity&#39;s payload prepared to reach Saber, but half measures couldn&#39;t be taken with someone as threatening as Sinmara. He would have to go all the way, even if his life was extinguished.

Sinmara noticed Opportunity&#39;s payload, and moved to intercept it. Armstrong manifested a drill he used at the beginning of their fight, and moved to stop her from casting any magic. 

&quot;<strong>The formula for victory has been fulfilled, my fellow Servant. Now... DIE, SABER!</strong> Armstrong roared as he moved in to attack Sinmara.

The radio crackled one last time. <span class="pre pre--inline">Beautiful view. Isn&#39;t it something, Houston? Magnificent view.</span> Armstrong grinned as he got within a foot of his foe. <span class="pre pre--inline">Bon voyage, Pasca—</span></span>

Even the proverbial cockroach known as Armstrong would feel his skin blazing as his armor crumpled and burned as the visor shattered. Unlike Sinmara, his whole body had survived, thanks to his durability and not being connected to Surtr. He still crashed, however.

Dust filled the area where Saber and Rider had landed. Armstrong couldn&#39;t move—he was far too weak—but much to his surprise, he still found the strength to speak.

&quot;Ack. This is the worst. What&#39;s the point of having awesome last words if I don&#39;t even <strong>die</strong>. You still kicking, Saber?&quot; It was a rhetorical question. Even Rider could tell that Saber was on the verge of fading. He sighed in annoyance and pity. &quot;Come on, chin up, Saber. You did well. You might&#39;ve even won if you weren&#39;t fighting your antithesis, not that you care, anyway. Hell, you probably have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s any compensation, you&#39;ve got 100 trillion years before the universe dies off. You&#39;re bound to get summoned with your husband eventually. Maybe you&#39;ll get to witness the end of everything, but it won&#39;t be as pretty as you want it to be.&quot;

&quot;<strong>Anyways, goodbye, Saber.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro continued to fiddle with the controls constantly checking over his shoulder to make sure Pascal wasn&#39;t descending yet. Pushing up on the acceleration the boat began to back out bumping ungracefully against the poles accompanying the dock. He felt bad for denting a strangers boat but Pascal&#39;s life was more important than a potential lawsuit. 

Finally pulling out he turned the boat towards the water ready to move he pushed the accelerator all the way up and then BANG, the boat slammed into the dock he had forgotten to switch it from reverse. Sandro now sweating at the prospect of driving the boat switched the vehicle back into drive, it seemed he had done it at just the right time also

As Pascal made his descent from a successful mission he could hear the roar of an engine followed by Sandro letting out a nervous yell. “I see you!” He called out, then pulling the accelerator of the boat…. But wait it was still moving. “A-ah crap I forgot about inertia!” Sandro pulled at his hair how could he be so dumb, boats still move aftert you cut the gas, everyone knows that

“No worries ill be fine” Sandro reassured Pascal of his ability to maneuver a boat, when he should really be reassuring him that he wouldn&#39;t drown.  Sandro pulled the boat&#39;s lever after switching it in reverse to try and get it to slow down. With a shake of his head Sandro decided that this boat thing was too hard. 

Reaching his hands out on both sides he began to push the boat by pushing wind out on either side until he was stabilized under Pascal allowing him to float down gracefully.

Suddenly, Sinmara stood up. Her body, broken and crumbling and covered in soot, still had some life in it. In her death throes, she appeared to be able to muster a last gasp of energy. She staggered over to where Rider lay, breathing heavily as stained blood poured from her face.

<strong>&quot;No... You! You were capable of bringing him forth! You&#39;ll... you&#39;ll... you&#39;ll do it again! I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;</strong> She exhaled shakily, stretching out her blackened arm at dragging it against Armstrong&#39;s suit. Her flesh broke away with every motion, but the charred remains marked what remained, forming some kind of long-past glyph.

<strong>&quot;Neil Armstrong, the man who breached the sky and reached the stars. Forget me. Forget my husband. You... you will be worse! You will bring about greater cataclysm than any Ragnarok of my dreams! Oh, if only... we could watch it together... Surtr...&quot;</strong>

With that last gasp, Saber&#39;s body was consumed by the shimmering gold and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the dormant rune lingering on Rider&#39;s chest.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Luckily, Sandro had finally got his ride working. Pascal saw a lone boat in the distance of the vast blue ocean, before realizing that it was getting closer to him.

&quot;...Is that you, aristocrat guy?&quot; Pascal asked out loud, only to answer his own question once he got closer and saw Sandro&#39;s face. &quot;It is!&quot;

He laughed, as if all the tension from the fight had disappeared. All that was left was joy. The joy of having survived. The joy of not seeing Persepolis sink. He was alive, and that mattered the most. Judging by the radio signal he got from Armstrong at the last minute, Rider was most likely fine too.

Pascal landed on the boat, watching Sandro attempt to be self-confident about his driving skills as the two were now roaming at sea. The docks were destroyed, but they could probably still anchor themselves somewhere nearby and let Rider pick them up.

&quot;So, you&#39;re fine with what happened to Saber? I don&#39;t know jack about you and her, but I still can&#39;t believe you aristocrats let a monster like her run around. What are you going to do now without your Servant?&quot; Pascal asked out of mild curiosity. It was rather odd to see an aristocrat willingly let one of the most powerful Servants ever be defeated. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Attacks</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

He looked over to Pascal thinking about how to answer his question. Pascal was right to be curious, usually Aristocrats had pride… Sandro did have pride, but when it came to his father, Sandro would do anything to escape his expectations.

“Well…. My Dad’s definitely gonna give me hell for it…..” Sandro looked down at the floor pausing for an awkward silence. “My whole life has been living under the expectations of a dying bloodline…. I spent a long time trying to prove myself… I wasn&#39;t in the war because I wanted to be, maybe this way I can actually go and be my own person” 

Sandro then turned his head out to the sea feeling oddly good about losing. He moved the acceleration pushing the boat forward at a decent speed, he was kind of getting the hang of it. He would drive the boat to a low hanging edge near where the docks used to be.

Against all odds, he managed to crawl to his feet despite the lack of magical energy or strength. He glared down at Saber through his shattered visor. His eyes narrowed as he looked down at the rune on his armor&#39;s chest.

&quot;I am a demon of progress, and eventually, mankind will reach a point where it destroys itself. Their ability to improve will be their undoing, and even then, I&#39;ll help them do so.&quot; Rider laughed bitterly as Saber faded into dust. &quot;I just can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s in my nature, just as it&#39;s in yours to destroy.&quot;

With that, he turned away, and trudged off. NASA, an agency created for the sole purpose of beating the Soviet Union to the moon. An agency stemmed from hate and fear in what the enemy might do in the sky above. As such, any &quot;progress&quot; that Armstrong advocated for was flawed, even if it was meant to be used for humanity. 

NASA was a perfect fit for a Holy Grail War; motivated, a clear wish in mind, and a capable competitor. The Noble Phantasms that would manifest alongside NASA were dangerous, but there was one fatal flaw: they couldn&#39;t be summoned. They had no body. They needed something to latch onto, with a strong connection to both them and the feats that NASA had helped create. There were very few viable candidates, but their choice was clear from the word go.

Neil Armstrong.</span>

As such, Neil Armstrong the Servant became NASA the Servant, with Neil Armstrong being pushed aside. However, something odd happened. Armstrong became the base, but retained portions of his personality. NASA lost possible Noble Phantasms, and gained Apollo 11 in its current form instead.

With that, his wish changed as well. Infinite progress had been swapped out for the simple desire to fly among the stars. Armstrong turned from Saber. He had a Master to find. He walked away as Saber turned into golden light and faded. One of the Knight Classes had fallen.

Hopefully Pascal wasn&#39;t all that surprised to see him still alive.
