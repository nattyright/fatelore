                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio stood at the edge of an apartment complex. He&#39;d seen it in movies. The desperate struggle scene with epic soundtracks playing in the background, as the camera zooms on the protag, capturing every slick of nervous sweat rolling down his forehead and every twitch of muscle between his knitted eyebrows. Tapio&#39;s forehead wasn&#39;t rolling in sweat and his eyebrows looked quite normal, but he still felt as if he was, in spirit, with the many movie protags who had to walk along building edges with safety wires strapped on their waists.

Cool wind rippled through his coat, carrying with it the cold air from the abandoned wasteland at the old test site. In front of him, Aratron, his dear Caster Servant, stood a few meters away, ruminating under his signature expressionless mug. Below him, an empty street stretched out all the way to the rosy tinted sky of the Entertainment District. Dazzling in the dark of the night, hazy hues of yellow and pink catching themselves in a warm fringe on Tapio&#39;s hair and clothes. 

The boy took a deep breath, shifting one foot backwards until the heel of his boot lined up against the edge of the rooftop. An open threat to his Servant. One more step back and he&#39;d fall. A few dozen meters, straight onto the thick tarmac coating the mechanical platform that served as the base of Persepolis. 

This was it. The moment of truth. The moment of do, or get dragged back into a fake desert for another 18 hours of boring magic theory.

&#39;Caster. I&#39;ve come to bargain.&#39;

Tapio unrolled the poster he&#39;d been clutching and thrust it in front of him, corners flapping about in the wind, at his Servant in question.

&#39;Look, a Holy Grail War!&#39; He jabbed hard, repeatedly at the fine print on the poster in order to get Aratron&#39;s attention. &#39;Let&#39;s drop the whole magic theory 101 at Aratron&#39;s perfect classroom jig. I know you&#39;re bored. <em>I&#39;m</em> bored. Doesn&#39;t this sound a hundred times more exciting?&#39;

Aratron sifted through a small booklet, its spine made out of marble and its pages being hard rock. Yet he could turn the pages rather easily, wielding a book that resembled an archaic e-book more than anything else. He was looking at Tapio&#39;s report card, a record of the boy&#39;s studies and accomplishments in the last two weeks.

Clearly, he had failed all of his modules. Were Persepolis an educational institute, Tapio would have been one of the first to be kicked out. Yet, Aratron was still stuck with this ungrateful student. Suicide was always an option, and it would have benefited them both: Aratron would have returned to the Throne while Tapio would be able to summon another Servant. However, that meant admitting defeat: It meant accepting that Tapio was an individual that could not be taught.

Aratron wasn&#39;t fond of that idea. He, the almighty governor of Saturn, could most definitely enlighten even the most ignorant of buffoons. He just lacked the proper materials and environment. The current Earth was a far cry from the lush lands of centuries past. However, it was rather obvious that a field test would be necessary to force Tapio out of his comfort zone. Something big. Something important. Perhaps even--

&quot;...A Holy Grail War?&quot; Aratron&#39;s eyes bolted out of the window, staring at Tapio who was waving a poster at him. However, the teacher was more preoccupied with the boy&#39;s risky position.

&quot;Student, get down immediately and show me that poster. Dangerous activities are prohibited inside of the classroom!&quot; Aratron snarled, considering the apartment room to be yet another classroom. He inched closer, ready to drag Tapio away from the window.

&quot;And what is this Holy Grail War that you speak of? Are there slots open? And also,&quot;

He glared at him with almost murderous intent.</span>

Physically speaking, I&#39;m about halfway out of this &quot;classroom&quot;, so your rule is at most 50 percent effective.&#39; Tapio refused to budge as he challenged Aratron with words befitting of a classic F-tier student. At least his math was accurate. Perhaps Aratron could take solace in that?

But no. Instead of simply taking the poster from him and reading it like a normal person, perhaps even forgetting their unpleasantry altogether, Aratron just had to go for the overkill and ask Tapio a question equitable to a death sentence.

&#39;...What homework.&#39;

Tapio could suddenly hear his own heartbeat thrumming in his ears.

&#39;If we can grab a spot, I doubt we&#39;d have any spare time for homework and the like...&#39; He trailed off as Aratron looked at him like he was dead meat. &#39;You can pass for an Assassin with a look like that,&#39; He suggested, half-jokingly, as Aratron reached his hand over. Tapio couldn&#39;t tell whether the hand was going after the poster or his neck in the heat of the moment, so he shrunk away, shifting his weight ever so slightly to the heels of his feet-

&#39;Eh,&#39; He felt the scale tip, gravity laying claim to him as it tugged at the small of his back. Tapio sputtered and fumbled, ripping the poster almost completely in half as he swung his arms wildly to regain balance. He fought for quite some time too, swinging back and forth delicately, looking like he&#39;d fall off one moment then reeling himself in just enough the next.</span>

Any sort of excuse, from saying that the homework got eaten by a stray capybara, to him having simply forgotten. Aratron wasn&#39;t one to accept slackers. In fact, he would usually double down on Tapio&#39;s lessons for the day as punishment, leading to the dreaded <em>&#39;study until you collapse&#39;</em> style lessons that Tapio greatly loathed. 

This was no different, even with the scapegoat that was the Holy Grail War.

&quot;How am I supposed to let my student participate in a Grail War, when they couldn&#39;t even pass the <em>Holy Grail War History Test</em> from 7 days, 7 hours ago?&quot; Aratron chided. &quot;You are far too inexperienced. It would be like sending a lamb to a slaughter. We will sit this one out, until you have progressed enough as a Magus. By my current calculations, you will be able to participate in a Grail War in...&quot;

He paused for a second, making a mental sum in his head.

&quot;<strong>...77 years.</strong>&quot;</span>

Tapio could already tell that it wasn&#39;t a joke. He envisioned himself in the future, an old grandpa saying his nephews goodbye as he walked over to battle while dragging himself on a wheelchair. That fate sounded terrible! Not to mention, would he even live that long? Aratron really had no idea on how brief human lives could be, especially when the Earth was mostly submerged. 

Not to mention, he sounded rather ticked off. The homework fiasco had most likely soured the Servant&#39;s mood. If only Tapio had brought more than just a poster to bargain with...

...The shock of envisioning himself as an old man was so great, that Tapio lost his balance. Just before something dangerous could happen, however, his body stopped. It stopped moving altogether. Part of it, at least. Did Aratron grab him?

No, the teacher was still standing a few feet away.

...

A chill went down Tapio&#39;s spine as he stared at the half of his body that was inside of the classroom. It had been petrified completely, removing any sense of touch or feeling as he could no longer move the left portion of his body. On the bright side, the added weight of his now stone body had restored his balance, preventing his fleshy, right half from dragging him out of the window. Eventually, the weight of the stone body overcame his needless flailing, causing him to stumble and fall back into the classroom, his face landing right on top of the half torn poster. He was now, once again, under 100% of Aratron&#39;s influence.

The teacher sighed, crouching down and snatching the poster away before Tapio realized that he no longer was <em>rock hard.</em>

&quot;A Holy Grail found by the mafia? <strong>Abhorrent.</strong> Criminals have no respect for the magical arts. It is rather unfortunate that these are our hosts. See? Yet another reason to sit this one out.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Thankfully Aratron hadn&#39;t petrified his airway, otherwise he&#39;d probably be rolling in pain now. The boy made no effort to get up even as his Servant undid the petrification, instead taking his sweet time enjoying the lush carpeted floor. He did roll onto his back, however, crossing his arms as he stared up at Aratron&#39;s visage, a shit eating grin stretched from ear to ear.

&#39;That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, <em>professor</em>.&#39; He wagged his finger, mimicking Aratron&#39;s lecturing tone. &#39;It&#39;s not just the mafia. It&#39;s the city itself. I thought <em>my</em> hometown had it bad, being industrialized and all, but then I got here, and saw that they&#39;re trying to run an entire city on only two leylines. Two!&#39; He brought up his other hand and made a cross shape with his index fingers, indicating the two leylines divvying up the Dhruva type city.

&#39;The mafia isn&#39;t as bad as they&#39;re made out to be, because I seriously doubt their ruling class has it better,&#39; said Tapio, &#39;Ever took a stroll around the block? I&#39;ve been here a few weeks more than you, and I can count the number of Servants I&#39;ve seen with one...&#39; He paused, ran some numbers in his head and frowned. Shit. He&#39;d seen more than ten. He needed two hands for that.

&#39;<em>Anyway</em>, that&#39;s not the point. The point is you should go out more. And I don&#39;t mean sending your rocky envoys out on errands. I meant you, maybe with me. I can be a good guide, see.&#39;</span>

&quot;Two leylines? Grotesque. Then again, a city with four ends didn&#39;t give me much hope. The ideal constructions would have involved more protrusions, enough to house multiple districts and artificial leylines. Four is too little, while ten would be too many. Yes, the perfect number would have been--&quot; Before he could continue his rant, Tapio started defending the mafia, running his tongue in an attempt to pique Aratron&#39;s interest. A slight jab at the man&#39;s familiars followed suit.

&quot;With you? Need I remind you what happened last time, student? Your own folly almost resulted in a scuffle with an enemy Saber. One with Magic Resistance, nonetheless. Had I not been the grandiose Magus that I am, we wouldn&#39;t have survived.&quot; Aratron praised himself, while curiously omitting his own flaws with that encounter. Tapio could vividly remember his Servant bossing the Saber and their mechanical monstrosity of a Master around...

&quot;So, unless you have a death wish, you would be wise to not move a single inch from this classroom. There is a reason that education is compulsory.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Mmmm.&#39; Tapio narrowed his eyes and pouted like a spoiled brat. He was not convinced and it showed. He stayed on the carpet and refused to budge, forcing Aratron to lower his head should he wish to address his student directly. 

&#39;No,&#39; He said with some finality. &#39;Unless <em>you</em> have a death wish, you&#39;ll let me join in on the fun. You can give me homework all you like. But at the end of the day, I&#39;m the one you are bargaining with. Not the other way around.&#39;

Tapio tapped his own chest where the human heart resided, the same location (normally) for a humanoid Servant&#39;s Spirit Core. An intellect like Aratron should easily catch the implication of this small gesture. All Servants were hostage to a steady supply of Mana to keep their Spirit Cores intact, and with the knowledge granted to them of the present world, their options to obtain said Mana were quite limited.

As incompetent as Tapio was, he was born and raised off the values of a magus. A poor hand was still a hand, and he was going to move mountains with his poor attempt at negotiation.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio could definitely sense Aratron&#39;s scorn from afar. Not towards his Master, but towards the impolite and inadequate manners that he had demonstrated. He was simply built like that: He seemed to find people&#39;s traits more despicable than the people themselves. In this case, Aratron was annoyed at the boy&#39;s reluctance to leave the carpet, like a dog trying to sleep.

&quot;...Hmph.&quot; Aratron scoffed, as he started reading the poster again, analyzing the finer details. Normally, it would take an instant for the Caster to digest a sheet of information. However, he took his time, almost as if reminiscing about something else. Something that happened in the past, perhaps?

After a minute, he tossed it back to Tapio.

&quot;Understood. If these are your demands, <strong>then I shall present mine.</strong>&quot; He raised two fingers, Tapio almost shivering at the thought. His Servant had accepted his deal...but was scheming something of his own.

&quot;Do you perchance remember our first encounter, student? Your knowledge in bounded fields was lacking, therefore, I proposed tracking down Rider and Assassin, since I was rather confident that I had been summoned for a Holy Grail War.&quot; Aratron bit his lips while saying that last bit, as if he couldn&#39;t admit that one of his assumptions had been wrong.

&quot;Well, it is time for us to return to the basics: We shall once again focus on bounded fields, meaning that engaging with enemy Servants should help bolster your defenses. On field testing seems to be our only hope left.&quot; He said with a solemn tone, as if he had no idea on what to do next in case his plan failed.

&quot;In case that, too, fails...<strong>Then I shall deactivate myself.</strong> Understood?&quot; Same ultimatum, different day. Tapio didn&#39;t know whether to admire or despise his Servant for being so strict.</span>

&quot;Those are my two conditions. If you really want to participate in a Holy Grail War, then I expect you to be proactive. If you fail to meet my standards, I shall resign from this institute. Oh, and also,&quot; Aratron paused for a second.

&quot;...<strong>I would rather face a Saber, this time around.</strong>&quot; He glared, reminiscing his brief scuffle against Szrac&#39;s Servant. &quot;Do you have any objections? It is not part of your coursework, so you are free to drop out.&quot; Surprisingly, he gave Tapio the option to rein him in. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Gone was his sulky attitude, the boy bounced back to his feet in a second and looked Aratron in the eye as if nothing had happened.

&#39;Don&#39;t be so glum,&#39; He slapped the stony-faced Caster across the back to tell him to loosen up a bit, despite himself being 100% the source of Aratron&#39;s brow knitting the past few weeks. &#39;I haven&#39;t forgotten. All I have to do is showcase my bounded field in a fight against another Servant and survive, yeah?&#39; Tapio reached into his pocket and withdrew and small packet.

&#39;Deal.&#39; He said, tossing the packet towards Aratron. It turned out to be not just one, but two fresh sets of mana batteries. &#39;I don&#39;t need these as wager now, so you can take them. You&#39;ll need them for Saber anyway.&#39; He stated matter-of-factly, as if he had already acknowledged his own Servant&#39;s disadvantage by default. Would the prideful Aratron take it sitting down?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio tried to lift the spirits, but it was hard when he was trapped with such a stuck up Servant. Even the act of tapping Aratron&#39;s back felt unnatural. His clothing, if it could even be called that, felt rough and scaly, like he were caressing and iguana. 

The Caster caught the batteries in a second and understood their purpose quickly. He had been given them plenty of times in the past few weeks after all. What he didn&#39;t appreciate, however, was this &#39;friendly&#39; gesture being accompanied by Tapio&#39;s teasing.

&quot;I&#39;ll <em>need</em> them? Do I appear that incompetent to you?&quot; Aratron raised an eyebrow, as if pondering that himself. &quot;Perhaps I require a smarter look. This attire was based on current trends of the era according to the Grail data, but judging from the stares we received during our rare excursions outside...&quot;

He mulled over, as if puzzled on how to work on his appearance. He quickly shrugged that off and returned to his student.

&quot;Saber won&#39;t be a tough opponent. <strong>I assure you.</strong> All I require is for you to be uninvolved in the fight itself. Magecraft that pierces Magic Resistance is Magecraft that would corrupt even the most formidable of Magi.&quot; Aratron warned.

&quot;...Besides, if my spells could not affect Saber, then what hope would your Magecraft have? Hmmm, perhaps I should fight Saber and his Master on my own. How does that sound?&quot; He asked in a way that sounded like an insult, albeit he seemed oblivious to that fact. The nerves of this guy... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

In an era where walking tin cans became the norm, Tapio heavily doubted that it was Aratron&#39;s appearance that always attracted unwanted attention. The Servant, despite <em>looking</em> the part, had the idiosyncrasies of his grandpa, or maybe great-great-grandpa. A living fossil with incredibly shiny shoes. Tapio coughed, hiding a laugh as Aratron moved to inspect his own clothes.

&#39;I never said you&#39;re incompetent!&#39; He quickly assured his Servant. &#39;You can beat a hundred of me without lifting a finger. But it&#39;s Saber we&#39;re talking about. A Saber! The strongest and coolest class <em>ever</em>.&#39;

Tapio&#39;s eyes sparkles as he not so subtly fanboyed over the Servant class. Was he even aware that he was in the presence of his own Servant, who was obviously <em>not</em> a Saber?

&#39;No. Denied. Absolutely not. You can&#39;t cut me out of the fight. Do that and it&#39;ll be me who&#39;s going to stalk you 24/7.&#39; Aratron&#39;s next suggestion had Tapio sulking harder than even when the Servant threatened to deactivate himself. &#39;I won&#39;t hold you back, I promise, I&#39;ll just hide somewhere safe and watch.&#39;

It was, in a way, perfect self-assessment. So perfect that even Aratron couldn&#39;t find an excuse to assign it anything lower than a B, surely?

The boy perked up when Aratron chimed in with his own bias on the Saber class.

&#39;Heheh, that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, professor. Let&#39;s say that you can make the coolest looking sword in the whole world. But can you wield it just as expertly? Swordsmanship isn&#39;t just about the weapon!&#39; He spun on his heels and clasped his hands together in excitement. He didn&#39;t even notice Aratron&#39;s irate undertone, taking his Servant&#39;s annoyance as invitation for more fanboying. 

&#39;I&#39;ve read that the greatest swordsman can fight with a stick, no, a blade of grass and still come out on top. They don&#39;t even need tools or fancy magecraft. To think there actually exist heroes who have honed their body and skills to such perfection that they can kill with their eyes. Isn&#39;t that just the <em>coolest</em>?&#39; 

Tapio made a chopping motion with his arms and swung them down, mimicking a sword slash. Someone had most definitely spent way to much time reading trash novels that paying attention in class...

&quot;Spare me the fantasies. A swordsman is a mere master of one. Ask them to do anything unrelated to swordsmanship, and they come up short. I, on the other hand, am more versatile than any other tool on the planet.&quot; Aratron reaffirmed, pointing to his elegant form and letting his hair run wild.

&#39;...Says the one who was dead set on locking me up at home just now.&#39; Tapio ribbed his Servant, spitting out hairs and moving closer to the open window. He gestured towards the city at large, glowing faintly under the night sky. &#39;If you are really so versatile as you say, why don&#39;t we go look for a Saber right now? Maybe I&#39;ll be more convinced to read your sandy tomes if you can best them in a match.&#39;

&quot;Hah. Child&#39;s play, dear student. I could track down Saber in an instant if I willed it so. The question is: <strong>Am I allowed to eliminate them?</strong> Or would that go against the Grail War&#39;s rules? It hasn&#39;t started yet, from what I know...&quot; Aratron smirked, before returning to his cold demeanor. Tapio definitely felt as if his Servant were willing to go through extreme lengths just to prove their strength. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

&#39;...Well, you know what they say, nothing ventured nothing gained. Only one way to find out!&#39; Tapio beamed at his Servant, a clear sign that he had not thought this through at all. &#39;The better question would be, <em>can</em> you eliminate them? The extra mana batteries can only get you so far...&#39;</span>

They would probably have time to find out more information on the Holy Grail War during their search for Saber.

&quot;And if that&#39;s the case,&quot; He tossed back the mana batteries to his Master. &quot;then keep your batteries. I shall only take them <em>after</em> the fight.&quot; He said, staring to march towards the room&#39;s exit. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
