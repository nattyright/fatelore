It wasn&#39;t as if he was expecting much else. He long knew of the Church&#39;s expanding power, and even with such inclusive endeavors (he nods slightly at the scriptures of Buddha along with the other holy texts), it wad inevitable that an organization like this would simply dissolve into bureaucracy. Despite those reservations, this was the first step in atonement. The first step to cleaning a lifetime of sin from his soul...

He arrives finally at what he had to assume was some sort of help
 desk, a lone island surrounded on all sides by towering book shelves that draw long shadows, only to be bent back by the single candle flickering on the counter top. He approaches, slight trepidation creeping in as he lays both hands on the counter, referring to the person behind. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know who you would tell, but I am here to turn myself in to the judgment of the church. I am Jampo. The Master of Saber.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Orecchiette had been doing a lot of reading lately. From <em>How to Recognize a Joke: A Guide to the Art of Humor</em> to <em>How to Get Along with Your Supervisor: The New Office Professional&#39;s Handbook</em>, he had dusted off the covers of every single title that seemed useful and relevant from the bookshelves at the Church&#39;s base of operations, then proceeded to peruse them with much care. Pappardelle&#39;s recent attitude towards him had been befuddling at best, and he wasn&#39;t the type of person to sit around and do nothing.

No. He was a man of action. If Pappardelle refused to tell him what was wrong and if he couldn&#39;t get a coherent answer out of the other Church employees, then he would take matters into his own hands. One book at a time. One <em>word</em> at a time. 

The process had been immensely rewarding.

...Which wasn&#39;t to say that he had figured out why Pappardelle liked comparing his hair to lemons, or why she was so opposed to being picked up by the waist when she couldn&#39;t reach a top shelf. What he <em>did</em> learn was that whenever his supervisor stopped making sense, chances were high that she was trying to make a joke.

He could start from responding favorably to those inefficient and nonsensical actions of hers first. Or anyone&#39;s for that matter. Understanding would soon follow.

As the light dimmed on the horizon, the Executor put away <em>The Essential Guide to Office Etiquette</em> and exited the reading room. Usually, reports would be flying in at this hour, with 80% related to Saber&#39;s unending rampage, 15% on bureaucratic matters and disturbed neighborhood cats, then the remaining 5% on the rest of the CGW participants. Orecchiette would take the jobs that he could handle, then leave the rest (the ones that required written reports and cataloguing) to Pappardelle.

...It did make him question why he had even bothered seeking these self-help books in the first place. But alas, he had grown quite fond of reading them in the absence of excitement.

With measured steps, Orecchiette made his way down the hall, golden hair glowing in the sweep of light cast from the hallway windows. When he did not speak or transgress, his existence was quite majestic.

The executor stopped by the front desk. He glanced at the withered old monk as he slide the book past the receptionist, and smelled gunpowder and blood.

<em>&#39;—I am here to turn myself in to the judgment of the church. I am Jampo. The Master of Saber.&#39;</em>

&#39;You?&#39; Said Orecchiette, but he did not meant for it to be a question. A brief examination of the monk&#39;s features was enough to coin him as the Master of Saber, courtesy of the Church&#39;s scouts and wild gossip on the City Wide Web. 

&#39;If you wish to turn yourself in, the police station is just four blocks away.&#39; He told the old man matter-of-factly, Jampo&#39;s harrowed feelings all but lost as he approached the situation systematically. &#39;If it&#39;s assistance that you need, I can take you there personally. Can you walk?&#39;

The receptionist was at a loss for words. He quietly pulled out an old-fashioned looking phone from under the desk and punched in a few numbers.

Pappardelle&#39;s office phone rang.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To say that Olympia was in disarray was an understatement. Missing people reports, requests to pay for damages and citizens still reeling back from the aftermath of Dolorous Gard. It had lasted for a week at most, yet it felt like a lifetime for Olympia&#39;s citizens, who had endured the torture of Saber and his Copper Knights.

Of course, this left a pile of paperwork and documents for Pappardelle to address. Complaints, requests for aid, the vapid journalists asking for news on Saber and his short lived empire. It was all so tiresome.

Events like this made her reconsider her career path. At least, until she sucked it up and started getting to work. Mountains of paperwork? Documents to sign? Further notes required? Bah!

They were no match for her <em>pen.</em>

<em>&quot;Missing person case #451? Send it to the station. Broken boiler at the industrial district? Does Olympia even need more heat? Public complaint about the Church&#39;s handling of Saber? To the bin.&quot;</em>

Efficiently and energetically, Pappardelle&#39;s own arms more so resembled the limbs of an octopus. Switching from paper to paper, tapping each page lightly with her pen before moving on to the next. She was writing at the speed of three, no, four typists at the same time.

Granted, she still got a lot of weird looks for insisting on using a pen and paper pad. Despite the fact that a personal computer could be found in a lone corner of her office. Covered in cobwebs and never plugged in.

What Pappardelle did occasionally use, however, was her office phone. Rarely to call, but always to answer. Today would be one of those days.

&quot;Hello? This is the office of Pappardelle, supervisor for executors residing in Olympia. How  may I help?&quot;

&quot;He is doing <strong>what?</strong>&quot; Her alarm bells immediately started ringing. Of course it was them. It was always <em>them</em> when something absurd was involved. The papers could work, as she immediately ditched her job and focused on her other job instead. The road to the reception hall wasn&#39;t too far.

Indeed, Orecchiette would hear the all too familiar hurried waltzing that he had attributed to his supervisor whenever they brushed shoulders. She was so expedient with her work that she rarely deigned him a glance, instead walking past him with unprecedented speed.

&quot;Master of Saber.&quot; Pappardelle arrived, standing next to the reception desk as she scanned Jampo and Orecchiette in an instant. Judging by the monk&#39;s condition, he would be no match for her pupil in case the situation escalated to violence.

&quot;I applaud you for approaching us yourself. I trust that you have come here to repent and confess your sins to our humble institute?&quot; She said with a commandeering tone, as if knowing of the numerous sins Jampo had committed. It was hard to ignore Saber&#39;s handiwork.

&quot;In that case, I suppose you have no objections to staying here? A police station is not fit to put people like you on trial. As a Master of Olympia, it is the duty of Olympia to punish you as well. For there would be no Holy Grail War were it not for the generosity of our almighty Lord.&quot; Pappardelle nodded, doing a simple praying gesture with her hands before turning back to Orecchiette.

&quot;Orecchiette. I trust you were taught on how to escort criminals, prisoners of war or defeated Magi? I shall leave this to you. Bring him to the waiting room while I contact the war&#39;s overseers.&quot; She ordered. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

It wasn&#39;t clear, they seemed too well dressed for such a position, but regardless, the reply was confusing to say the least, enough for Jampo to quietly collect himself before mustering up the courage to respond. 

&quot;I...yes, but I was led to believe there was a Bounty for me-&quot; he started before hearing a hurried waltz. One might even call it ditzy, as if trying to overcome exasperation with a dignified, professional gait. The monk turns, just in time to be addressed by hair as bright and nauseating as cotton candy. He was subjected to a stream of lectures, prayers and even a momentary denial of his existence before he took the time to cut in. &quot;I&#39;m not just here about Saber, good sister.&quot;

His mouth dries up as he thinks of how to broach the situation...these were sins he had hoped to leave behind, to cleanse away by this war itself. However, by the end, it only sought to wrestle responsibility out of the monk, nodding his head as he places a hand against his chest. The warmth of Ashura pushes back, as if to reassure him...</span>

I am Jampo...but in some circles, I was considered &#39;The Mad Monk.&#39; I have killed thousands over the past 50 years, including the hundreds that lost their lives between my fight with Lancer of Olympia.

The breath almost seemed to be sucked out of the monk&#39;s very chest, the air still around them all as he recounts his prior deeds. Not only was Saber his responsibility, but so was countless tolls of death across the sea that was the world. He didn&#39;t know if the Church truly kept up with such incidents. Nor did he truly care. He simply sought some form of atonement...even if that might mean death. &quot;I will do whatever is necessary to receive judgement...&quot;</span>

Contrary to his supervisor, Orecchiette had never once considered Jampo a threat. A criminal? Laughable. A Master who had lost in the City Grail War was just that - a loser. No longer would they hold any influence over the proceedings of the War. Punishing them would amount to nothing; it certainly won&#39;t make the repairs on the city go any faster. 

In fact, to detain and punish Saber&#39;s Master meant spending more resources on a magus who no longer held any value. Orecchiette&#39;s first priority was to ensure that the War produced a winner. What became of the losers...well. Jampo had just asked to be arrested, did he not? 

Sending him to the police station was the only natural decision. Which was why Pappardelle&#39;s words perplexed him so. He stared at Pappardelle, about to reply with a rebuttal...

Then he recalled the books.

Was Pappardelle being nonsensical right now? Yes.

Was she opting for a largely inefficient solution without batting an eye? Yes she was.

...

&#39;That was a great joke.&#39; He commended his supervisor. &#39;But I&#39;m afraid that now is not the time. The Lord punishes those who oppose him, but the Master of Saber opposed no one. It is not in our direct interest to intercept him, unless you have a sufficient reason for doing so that I&#39;m not aware of.&#39;

He turned to Jampo, his face serene, impassive, as if what Jampo had just passed was nothing more than small talk at the dinner table. Such professionalism might impress the old monk: even when faced with a walking catastrophe whose name sowed fear into those who had crossed paths with him, he would find respite within the Church and be treated like an ordinary human being. As expected of a man of the cloth.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">...But Pappardelle knew better. What others may have taken for professionalism was a deeply ingrained indifference to the fate of others that did not actively involve themselves with the Church. She was almost afraid of what her subordinate would say next. If only Jampo had come in a bit later so that Orecchiette could leave the building ahead of time-

&#39;Is that all?&#39; Orecchiette asked. He shook his head. &#39;If that is all the sin you wish to confess, then you are free to leave.&#39;

-she should have made <em>him</em> leave instead!

&#39;But if it&#39;s punishment that you seek&#39;—the Executor continued, completely unaware of Pappardelle glaring daggers at him—&#39;then my offer still stands. I will accompany you to the police station, where you can repeat what you have just said to the stationed officers, then serve a sentence befitting of the crimes you have committed.&#39;

<strong>&#39;The Church is not obliged to absolve you of your guilt.&#39;</strong>

Orecchiette turned to Pappardelle.

&#39;As you have heard, the Master of Saber is of no grave concern to the Church. None of his crimes were committed to undermine the Lord&#39;s authority. Moreover, with his Servant gone and his role in the City Grail War concluded, we no longer need to keep him under surveillance. I will see to it that the bounty is distributed to the Masters who took down Saber...that is all I have to report.&#39;

Orecchiette delivered his verdict with no room for negotiation. He extended an arm to the old monk and invited him to take his hand.

&#39;Shall we?&#39; His lips curved into just the slightest smile at the mass murderer, a cordial and angelic presence that contradicted the detached words that had rolled off his tongue. &#39;If we hurry, we can even make it to the police station before dark.&#39;</span>

The accomplice to the Servant that had caused such a ruckus in Olympia for the past week. Pappardelle was truly fortunate, staring at her golden goose (with golden bald spot) while they admitted to even more crimes. They were truly willing to repent, something that worked quite nicely for her.

After all, personally handing over Jampo to the Church&#39;s overseers would not only deliver justice to Saber&#39;s Master, but also benefit Pappardelle and Orecchiette. The other executors stationed at Olympia had yet to encounter even a single Master, while they had been pulling all stops to make something out of the war. The confrontation with Lancer was but one of many opportunities.

If they handed over Jampo, they would no doubt be praised, something that benefit their future care-

Orecchiette swiftly dismissed Pappardelle&#39;s claims, going as far to put her down further.

<em>&quot;That was a great joke.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Joke. Joke. Joke. Joke. Joke. Joke.&quot;</em>

The word echoed in her mind repeatedly. Until it completely lost any form of meaning, besides giving her a feeling of frustration and anger. She started desperately wishing she were taller, if only to tower above Orecchiette and administer a flick to his forehead.

Her pupil was once again being dense, and she didn&#39;t feel like lecturing him yet again, especially in front of Jampo. She could not afford to waste time on such trivialities when the opportunity of a lifetime was standing right in front of them!

Then, of course, Orecchiette affirmed his decision above hers without a care in the world. His sanctimonious attitude ticked her off numerous times, because he wasn&#39;t even doing it deliberately to annoy others. It was just part of his nature.

She wished she could rewire his brain at times.</span>

While she was lost in thought, she finally realized that her pupil was attempting to seal the deal. He extended his hand, while whispering the idiotic suggestion of accompanying Jampo to the police station. She could not let this happen.

With all of the strength of her tiny frame, Pappardelle immediately stepped forward, grabbing the end of Orecchiette&#39;s hair with one hand and pulling it back. The executor would be surprised, feeling something weak and pathetic drag at his behind, but paying it no mind. It merely slowed him down by about a fraction of a millisecond.

Surprisingly, that was enough time for Pappardelle to catch up, putting herself between the two men as she extended her hand and forcibly caught Jampo in a handshake.

&quot;I admire your honesty, o pious soul. Let me assure you that the Church will take your further crimes under consideration as well.&quot; She said with a benign smile, trying her best to hide her irritation towards Orecchiette. &quot;If you may follow me, I shall lead you to the waiting room. Please ignore my pupil, for they are quite tipsy tonight. Too many holy salts.&quot;

She started dragging Jampo away, but not without glancing back at Orecchiette on the way there and giving him the stare of a lifetime. It felt like being snarled at by an angry cat.</span>

This man, Orechiette the woman had called him, must have been one of <em>them.</em> The eyes had an almost feline aloofness to them, a sort of distance that only had room for logical rulings and reasoning. He may be the assistant, but Jampo could sense the valley between Orechiette&#39;s ideals and that of his superior. The perception of banality that came from hearing such a death toll...it struck Jampo not only as steel-hearted, but also as if they&#39;d seen such acts of ferocity before. That they may have conducted such acts before. 

<em>We could kill him if we were at full strength.</em>

<em>We are not at full strength. And you know as well as I do that an <strong>Executor</strong> is not to be taken lightly. We have trained our lives to harnessing Qi; he has trained his life to killing us.</em> 

Jampo was prepared to take Orechiette&#39;s hand, seeing perhaps that this was a wall that could not be reasoned with, but before he could his superior managed to squeeze her way between their metaphysical pissing contest, straightening her gown and still sequestering an air of professionalism.</span>

&quot;Perhaps it would be wise to heed the words of your superior...your Lord does state the necessity in honoring thy father and mother. As well as heeding thy master,&quot; the Monk states, shaking Papardelle&#39;s hand while never breaking away from Orechiette&#39;s gaze, returning the favor with his own stone-faced glint. Finally, he tears himself away, walking alongside the...nun? It had been awhile since he acquainted himself with the Church&#39;s hierarchy, the old man took to scratching thoughtfully at his chin before deciding to rest on &#39;Sister.&#39; It seemed to work favorably last time. 

&quot;Sister, my apologies for accosting your assistant. I simply have no idea on how proceedings take place within the Church. I have lived as a hermit for the past 50 years,&quot; he remarks, gazing at the high vaulted ceilings and fluted columns that guided the two through these vast halls. &quot;I do thank you for your generosity in aiding in my punishment...I have requests of my own, but they shall simply wait until I meet your superiors.&quot; He lets the condition hang between them as he absently soaks in the architecture, all while a demon inside bristles. 

<em>You cannot trust the church.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A moment&#39;s hesitation was all Pappardelle needed to win an edge over Orecchiette. Her dubious action perplexed the Executor; as he turned around to question her, she slid through the crack between him and Jampo like a cat and claimed the old monk&#39;s hand for herself.

That earned her a frown from Orecchiette. He hadn&#39;t expected Pappardelle to take a joke <em>this</em> far. Though, looking at the nun&#39;s face, she didn&#39;t seem to be in what the books had described as a &#39;joking mood&#39; either. Whenever she looked his way, her lips were pursed and her eyes hard, almost as if she were <em>reprimanding</em> him. 

All she needed was a slap to the wrist or a kick to the shin to complete the holy ritual. But alas, her hands were occupied, and so were her legs: she started dragging Jampo away and Jampo, without giving away his true intent, immediately latched onto the nun&#39;s words and allowed her to escort him away.

Slowly, as if waking from a trance, Orecchiette notched his head to the side and met the receptionist&#39;s glance.

&#39;You called for her.&#39;

&#39;...Yes.&#39; The receptionist gulped, feeling as if he were being scrutinized under a lens. Should he not have done anything? He wasn&#39;t aware that Orecchiette and Pappardelle got off on the wrong foot. Did he contract the Executor&#39;s ire by meddling with his job?

&#39;Is Pappardelle qualified to handle an ex-Master by herself?&#39; 

&#39;I promise I won&#39;t call her next t-sorry, what?&#39;

&#39;Jampo is an ex-Master of the City Grail War, not to mention a criminal who has singlehandedly destroyed three nomadic cities.&#39; Orecchiete calmly relayed what Jampo had told him back to the receptionist. &#39;I repeat, has Pappardelle received the necessary training to handle an ex-Master without any assistance?&#39;

&#39;I...I don&#39;t think so. Not in Olympia, at any rate. I haven&#39;t heard much of her before she came here, you see...&#39;

Hot and stale, the air in Olympia&#39;s religious sect didn&#39;t smell like death. It didn&#39;t smell like anything, despite the massacre that had occurred a few blocks away. Inside the consulting firm, the air could even be called <em>refreshing</em>, thanks to the hundreds of air filters and AC units slaving off 24/7. 

The floors were sparkling clean, the windows stripped of dust and grime. The lights hanging overhead even adjusted its color and brightness to the ambience, leading to an overall pleasant experience navigating these halls. It was enough to put Pappardelle&#39;s mind at ease.

But not for long.

Soon, her ears would pick up the heavy yet brisk steps that always accompanied her junior. The clinking of multiple belts and accessories soon followed, and Orecchiette&#39;s golden hair emerged from the corner of the corridor to join the pair in their late day stroll. Catching up with them proved to be an easy task. The next act?

Not a problem.

Pappardelle was an excellent typist, but she wasn&#39;t known for her grip strength. All it took was one hand over her wrist and the slightest pressure to make her let go of Jampo&#39;s hand. 

&#39;You forget your place,&#39; he told her calmly. &#39;And I forget mine.&#39;

He held Pappardelle&#39;s hand above her head, unaware of the discomfort he had caused his supervisor as he parted her from the old monk with his frame.

&#39;It is my duty to make sure you are well protected at all times. I do not recall you signing any consent forms for damage outside of field missions. Thus, you are not to leave my side while approaching an ex-Master. More specifically, an ex-Master who has claimed to display violent behaviors.&#39;

Her authorization preceded his own; if she wished to throw herself into danger, he had no choice but to follow suit. 

&#39;Two things.&#39; He said at last. &#39;You are mistaken on two things. One, I am not Pappardelle&#39;s assistant. Her duties and mine do not intersect. If you really must, you may refer to me as her servant, much the same as you refer to Saber. Two.&#39;

He paused, regarding the old monk with a curious expression. &#39;<strong>I only serve the Lord.</strong>&#39;

&#39;And the Lord states that I serve him and only him, because he is my master and my progenitor. Do not confuse my <strong>faith</strong> with yours,&#39; he said finally. His tone wasn&#39;t vicious, rather it sounded almost instructional, as if he were talking about something different from religious faith.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Orecchiette could be an utter nuisance at times. Like a dog that couldn&#39;t stop barking. Anytime Pappardelle employed her usual, shrewd tactics that had been learned by half a decade of bureaucratic experience, Orecchiette responded in orderly fashion with his dogmatic Church scriptures. She had never seen him pray to God even once, yet she was confident he knew the commandments of the Lord by memory. It was robotic devotion that she felt.

Regardless, she wasn&#39;t foolish. She had noticed that his normally barebones office (one that he barely frequented in the first place) was now being populated by books. Books on social behaviour, social interaction, addressing employees and co-workers. It had started ever since their fight with Lancer and Pappardelle couldn&#39;t help but feel embarassed once she found out about his &#39;secret&#39;.

But that&#39;s why he ticked her off so much. What use were those books if he ended up acting the same? Was he even reading them properly?!

&quot;You humble me, monk. I vividly remember your profile from the list of candidates in the City Grail War.&quot; Pappardelle explained. &quot;A wandering monk, who had taken refuge at our religious district. We saw you as a good match for the Church&#39;s ideals, so it is utterly disappointing for you to be led astray by your own Servant. I hope you can find some repentance during your punishment.&quot;

She gave him a light nod as they reached the waiting area. All Pappardelle needed to do now was call the overseers and let them handle things. Of course, this would be interrupted by some very familiar steps.

Orecchiette towered over her, grabbing her by the wrist and putting himself between the nun and Jampo.</span>

&quot;Orecchiette! Unhand m-Ouch!&quot; Pappardelle attempted to struggle, but considering her pupil&#39;s grip strength, all it was doing was causing her unneeded pain. She relaxed her limb and let him have her way with her for now.

She listened in to Orecchiette&#39;s sanctimonious explanation. He felt like it was his duty to look out for her, a thought that gave her much embarrassment. These feelings were, however, washed away once the executor directed his attention towards Jampo. He talked down to Jampo&#39;s faith and reinforced it with his own, albeit neither the monk and the nun could sense any malice in his words. To him, it was simply stating a fact.

A fact that Pappardelle did not approve of.

The way he repeated those tired dogmas as law, along with his distant gaze that celebrated the difference between him and Jampo. It was all too familiar to her. Something she had witnessed as a child, living in a Church controlled city.

She wanted to slap some sense into him.</span>

&quot;And I only serve <strong>you</strong>. Hmph.&quot; She replied with a harrumph, before extending her free arm and pinching at Orecchiette&#39;s stomach, as if saying &#39;release me if you don&#39;t want me to repeat last time&#39;.

&quot;The reason I&#39;m handling matters myself is because, as a supervisor, my dutiful work directly contributes to your profile. I am simply making you eligible for more field missions in the future.&quot; She explained. 

&quot;I appreciate your concern, but do you really think so lowly of me to let my guard down around a Master who destroyed three cities? I may not be your Lord, but I believe that I am at least somewhat competent.&quot; She scoffed. It was clear that the mention of Orecchiette&#39;s Lord irritated her, but her pupil couldn&#39;t understand why.

&quot;...But thank you. Now, if you may, I simply need to make a phone call. The overseers can handle the rest once they arrive.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

Another beat passes before Jampo takes a seat, audibly heaving a content sigh while regarding the candy-haired nun. &quot;Saber has fallen...I know that the church separated itself from me well beforehand, and I do not blame such actions. If, however, the church truly has no interest in punishing its masters that extend beyond its realm of control, then I simply have no more matters to attend to here.. The Servant has fallen, and I&#39;ve made sure to damage the Servant Frame beyond repair. Consider that only one step towards making peace with Buddha. 

&quot;Of course, if that is the case, perhaps you can tell me of the efforts of the other Masters. I&#39;ve managed to make quite a few interesting companions...such as Lancer of Delphi and Olympia. Its my understanding that there is only one other Olympia master besides them, however...surely you can spare some information for a former master on where Olympia stands, and of the Fate of those two lancers?&quot;</span>

However, your overseers...well, I&#39;d like to make my request now so that you may relay this information to them. It would be far less of a hassle if all cards were present.&quot; 

Another beat passes before Jampo takes a seat, audibly heaving a content sigh while regarding the candy-haired nun, holding a single finger in the air. &quot;I will not divulge information on the defeat of Saber. The Servant has fallen, and I&#39;ve made sure to damage the Servant Frame beyond repair. That should be enough. 

&quot;And second, I wish to say farewell to a few individuals before my punishment. These, too, shall not be divulged. It is simply a last request...after all, I can&#39;t be certain whether punishment by the church will allow for such fraternities. In that sense, I will keep their identities close to the chest.&quot; 

&quot;Anything else is open to discussion regarding my past. However, these requests are non-negotiable.&quot;</span>
