                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider hadn&#39;t been herself ever since the luncheon with little Miss Informant. Kun Wu couldn&#39;t tell whether she was holding a grudge towards him for working her like a slave back in Laura&#39;s kitchen, or that he had subjected her to a few more vomit-inducing train rides homes afterwards, or that he had received this month&#39;s credit card bills in the form of a 20-page, double-sided, bound booklet. It seemed that everything he had done lately was enough to darken her mood, and Kun Wu was not so dense that he didn&#39;t know when to back off.

So he simply let Rider be as he went about his days like normal. Brainstorming new plays, choreographing his dance routines, and of course, checking Olympia&#39;s weather every hour, 12 hours a day. The contract with the bank had been established without a hitch, which meant that the bank was confident in fulfilling his request: hacking Olympia&#39;s weather dome.

Any day now...

Kun Wu swiped the weather app absentmindedly as he enjoyed his afternoon tea. The motion had long since been ingrained into his muscle memory and became something as natural as breathing. He could do it while working, eating, or even while half asleep. 

The weather app updated with a <em>ding</em>, and Kun Wu managed a casual glance at the screen halfway through his plum cake. 

Rain.

He set his phone down and went back to his tea-

<em>Wait just ONE minute.</em>

&#39;<strong>RIDER!</strong>&#39; 

The youth barged into Rider&#39;s room, intent on dragging her out even at the risk of losing his hands. &#39;Bring the doggie bags. We&#39;re heading out!&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was late afternoon when the prodigious street performer got to Olympia. The simulated sky was fat with clouds, dark and mutinous and accompanied by the occasional drizzle. The heat had dispersed. Not nearly enough for Olympia to feel like a habitable city, but enough for Kun Wu to march into it in his normal outfit. Minus the fluffy collar. It was a painful, but necessary sacrifice.

The youth walked with a spring in his steps as he looked left and right at the drab cityscape and admired his - or rather the bank&#39;s - handiwork. The contract had been a success. Olympia&#39;s weather dome had been hacked in just three days, which spoke volumes of their security system - or the lack thereof. He was now even more pumped up at the idea of staging a play here. All he had to do was to find a suitable spot, one that was far away from the smog-infested districts and the boring religious sects. 

&#39;Any preferences for our next stage so far, Rider?&#39; He tipped his oil-paper umbrella back and asked his companion. Hopefully a stroll in another city had lightened her mood a bit, even though there wasn&#39;t all that much worth looking at here at this time of the day.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It had been a terrible week for Ching Shih. Perhaps the worst week she had since her first husband died so many years ago.

A Servant was an ethereal being. One that was, all things considered, immortal and forever present. As long as the Throne existed, a Heroic Spirit could never truly die. They could only be kept in stasis, or repeatedly summoned by the whims of a Master.

However, Ching was a spoiled Servant. She coveted not an immortal life in a glass cage, but an illustrious mortal one. Of course, this meant being threatened by things that Servants would normally not fear. Mortality was one of them.

Guan Yu had awakened that facet of her. The overwhelming powerlessness she felt on that day was beyond humiliating. Being the chess master is fine, until you see yourself being played a pawn. Ching felt less than that when she met Laura&#39;s Servant, feeling insignificant and tiny in comparison.

<em>It was happening again. It was like she was cursed.</em>

....

&quot;Why are we even here, milord?&quot; Ching said with a downwards gaze, not even bothering to hide under Kun Wu&#39;s umbrella as she fully embraced the rain.

&quot;I already told you our plan. Gather as much currency as you possibly can. Gold, silver, paper money, coins...Anything you can think of. Even your so-called digital money, maybe.&quot; She said with a scowl. 

&quot;I already told you to not waste any of our funds on non-essential items, yet I saw your Amazones™️ package arrive outside our apartment doorstop just a day ago. Not only am I not wearing your ridiculous idea of a maid outfit, but I am here to remind you,&quot;

She stared at him with an inquisitive glare.

&quot;have you started depositing our funds in a safe place? Considering your informant knew where you lived, it is in our best interest to hide our &#39;secret weapon&#39; in a place they have never visited. Well? Have you done that?&quot; She asked further, as if implying a severe punishment in case Kun Wu&#39;s answer came up short. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

You&#39;ve been reminding me nonstop for a few days.&#39; Kun Wu&#39;s eyes flickered to Rider, then narrowed. &#39;But I&#39;ve also been telling you, it&#39;s not easy to gather these so-called &quot;riches&quot; that you seek. It takes time to import precious metals, and paper money, well,&#39; He stuck his hand out from under the umbrella and felt the rain, &#39;If you aren&#39;t aware already, rain turns them into mush. We&#39;ll need a big enough storage unit that&#39;s both secure and climate controlled...&#39;

&#39;Rings a bell, doesn&#39;t it?&#39; He paused, clearly waiting for Rider to fill in the blanks herself. That&#39;s right. Delphi already had storage units that fulfilled all these conditions, and Kun Wu himself had already been a client of theirs way before Rider had been summoned: the Delphi bank.

There was a moment of silence. Kun Wu led Rider along the empty entertainment streets until the buildings began to thin, overtaken by freight train lines and piles of precious cargo crates, stamped and color coded and ready for shipping. 

&#39;If you&#39;re thinking what I think you are, the answer is no.&#39; He said flatly. &#39;I&#39;m not trading the security of bank deposits for a few wooden crates on the side of the road. Not unless you give me a compelling reason to do so...&#39;

He stopped in front of Rider, then turned and faced her. 

&#39;One good reason. That&#39;s all I need.&#39; He stated firmly. &#39;You don&#39;t get to lecture my spending habits if you don&#39;t share yours.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s demeanor was getting on Rider&#39;s nerves. Not his usual parlor tricks, nor his childish behaviour that got them into trouble. She was having trouble handling his scheming, independent side. The side of him that probably kept him alive in Delphi&#39;s dog-eat-dog world of businesses competing against each other. Both Laura and Rinne saw him as a charlatan that got involved in a fight beyond their own abilities, but Ching knew differently. The man behind that facade of a boy could be quite treacherous indeed.

It was harder to manipulate someone who also had a tendency to manipulate others.

&quot;Time is not a luxury, but it&#39;s all we have at our moment. It will take some time until the tournament starts, correct? Then just do as I say and stop complaining.&quot; Ching replied with a stern glare. The two kept walking, before Kun Wu accosted himself next to a pile of wooden crates. They walked past those before the boy mentioned a few things to Rider&#39;s expense.

&quot;...Pray tell, how is a bank more secure that a pile of crates lying around the road? Not only are you allowing others to manage your wealth, something that always goes terribly as time passes, but you&#39;ve put a target on your bounty. It&#39;s not like hooligans wouldn&#39;t attempt to rob your bank, after all.&quot; She said, having no interest in the &#39;security&#39; of a proper banking business.</span>

People were snakes. Even she was comparable to a cobra. After seeing how people divvied up her husband&#39;s empire after his death, she had no trust to give to other people with their finances. Perhaps, that is why the Throne gave her this ability...

&quot;At least a crate is inanimate. It cannot betray me, nor it can tell others about my wealth. If my treasure ever gets stolen, I would only be able to blame myself for it.&quot; Ching stated coldly. &quot;Would you rather trust a stranger with something like that? Hmph. Perhaps you&#39;re far more trusting than I thought, milord.&quot; She mocked Kun Wu&#39;s ideals of security.

&quot;But you need not worry. I already found a good place for us to store our riches. In fact, I&#39;ve already been using it as my own deposit for a few days now...&quot; Kun Wu&#39;s ears would be shocked. Did Rider just say that she had been hiding money behind his back? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Let me get this straight. You prefer crates because it cannot betray you?&#39; Kun Wu rubbed his temples, trying his best to hold onto Rider&#39;s so-called justification. It almost sounded as if she treated these inanimate containers with more reverence than another human being. Of course, it wasn&#39;t as if Kun Wu himself didn&#39;t get the appeal of having absolute control over his own possessions - he stole a glance at Rider - but to trade the convenience of a modern bank for a hole in the ground, or a treasure chest at the bottom of the ocean?

&#39;Have you considered the fact that crates can&#39;t protect themselves from danger?&#39; He kicked at the crate by his foot, producing a wet <em>thud</em>. &#39;That&#39;s why they get stolen, and that&#39;s why you can&#39;t blame them for being stolen. Or eroded, burnt, whatever natural disasters that would&#39;ve befallen on them. I wouldn&#39;t call something so one-sided &quot;trust&quot;. That&#39;s just being a liability, and I&#39;m not so conceited to think that I&#39;m great enough to take care of these liabilities...&#39;

&#39;Not by myself, at least.&#39; His gaze softened when he saw Rider&#39;s expression. &#39;You conduct yourself like a true pirate, Rider, and I applaud that. I really do. But you have to realize sooner or later that there are only so much you can do on your own, even as a Servant. Why don&#39;t you tell me what&#39;s really going on? Right from the start, I think the <span class="mention">#detectives-office</span> would do for now-&#39;

Whatever he was about to say next died on his lips when Rider finally revealed her schemes.

&#39;You&#39;ve been <em>what</em>?&#39; He asked, incredulous. Was this what she&#39;d been up to when she was supposedly only going out for some fresh air? &#39;Why would you-no, that&#39;s not it. If making treasure chests really is a favorite pastime of yours, then I won&#39;t stop you. But why didn&#39;t you say anything?&#39; He dropped the umbrella and grabbed Rider&#39;s hands. &#39;Why didn&#39;t you consult me?&#39; He sounded confused, hurt even. &#39;I don&#39;t mean to doubt you, but <em><strong>you don&#39;t even know how to use the map app!</strong></em>&#39;</span>

&quot;That might have been true at one point in time, but do you really see me as an helpless individual? I&#39;m not a princess for you to protect.&quot; She said with disdain. &quot;<em>I learned.</em> I merely didn&#39;t show the fruits of my learning in front of you. Do you expect me to be fully truthful after leaving out details like your little informant or those men in suits? How do I know you aren&#39;t still hiding things from me?&quot;

&quot;In a sense, a crate is more trustworthy than you.&quot; Ching spat venom, her words feeling sharper than her own nails as Kun Wu felt somewhat hurt. Was this a case of miscommunication? Did Ching Shih misinterpret some of his actions?

&quot;Do you think I had someone to guide me while working at a brothel? Do you think the head mistress even cared about my health and well-being? Of course not. I was merely a tool for pleasure. Goods to be used until they were spent, especially thanks to my upbringing. You have no idea how they treated people from the sea back in the past.&quot; She started to narrate her own experiences. &quot;But did I give up back then? No. I clawed back from that hell. I made a name for myself. I went from an insignificant nobody to someone whose name is even remembered in the far, far future.&quot;

She sounded proud in that instant. But it was only an instant, before her face narrowed into a frown as if she had regretted some of the things she had said. She continued on.</span>

&quot;You&#39;re no brothel, but I&#39;ve grown tired of your foolishness. I&#39;ve constantly made attempts to reinforce our own defenses. To improve our own offense. Because I know that we have a Holy Grail War ahead of us. What have you done instead? You kept preparing for your obnoxious performances and wasted our resources on costumes and useless gadgets.&quot; It felt like Ching could go on and on with what she felt were Kun Wu&#39;s mistakes. His lack of care and attention, not to mention his lack of seriousness, had finally taken its toll on her.

For a moment, it felt like time stopped for the two. Even the rain droplets had frozen in mid-air.

&quot;You&#39;re from the same birthplace as me, aren&#39;t you? You know Guan Yu. You know how formidable of an opponent he is. You know that his Master is a shortsighted, impulsive woman who could order him to kill you without a shred of pity. Yet, I&#39;ve never seen you take precautions. Anytime I try to inform you on our next plan of attack, you only listen to me for a few minutes before returning to your usual activities. Activities that lead to us gradually losing more and more resources and being forced to recoup them with your...stupid parlor tricks!&quot; 

She snarled, feeling furious as her intensity rivaled Olympia&#39;s own. Ching&#39;s demeanour felt unrecognizable to Kun Wu. She wasn&#39;t teasing him and neither was she pissed to the point of flicking him. She just seemed angry, disappointed.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m not here to die again.&quot;</strong> She stated sternly. &quot;So, you can either help me stay alive or you can waste your time.&quot; After saying that, she turned around, as if about to storm off with or without her Master. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching Shih had snapped. 

For a while Kun Wu stood frozen, too stunned for words as his own Servant lambasted him for not acting the way he should have. All her bottled up grievances against him spilled out like pure venom; this time, she truly held nothing back.

Kun Wu felt as if he were caught in a tempest, with nothing but driftwood to keep himself afloat. When was the last time he&#39;d been subjected to another&#39;s ire like this? How long has it been? Three years? Five?

He had lost track of the time, but he would never forget the look on that face.

Rider&#39;s expression pained him.

Ching Shih turned to leave. Kun Wu hurried over to pick up his umbrella before the wind could carry it away. Then, as predictable as clockwork, he chased after Rider, sticking to her side like a piece of gum as he jogged to keep up with her pace.

If she really wanted to ditch him, she would have to use her full strength.

Kun Wu was betting on the off chance that she wouldn&#39;t.

&#39;Alright, you win, I am officially worse than a crate,&#39; He said, opening up the umbrella to shield it over both their heads. &#39;But can you walk - run, I dunno - a little slower? The umbrella is big enough for two, but at the pace you&#39;re going, no amount of cover is going to be enough.&#39;

He adjusted the umbrella so that it blocked more rain from the front. 

&#39;You don&#39;t have to sacrifice your good looks just to spite me, you know. Soaking yourself in the rain doesn&#39;t prove anything - even world renounced athletes know better than to get themselves wet. It certainly doesn&#39;t make you look any more princess-y than the rest of us. So can you slow down, please? Pretty please?&#39; 

He put on his puppy dog face again as he tried to appease the raging tigeress, but clearly, Rider had had enough of his antics. Kun Wu sighed, dropped the puppy dog mask, and recomposed himself.

&#39;No one is after your life.&#39; He said.

On the other hand, if I&#39;m out, then Delphi will be short one contestant. As for what happens to you afterwards...&#39; 

He looked away, towards the towering monstrosity that was Delphi&#39;s landscape. 

&#39;Well, if I&#39;m dead, then you&#39;ll be free, and my suite will be yours for the taking! I&#39;ve got more than enough mana batteries to last you a while, until you can find a new Master. A pretty good deal if you ask me.&#39; He spoke casually, as if he were talking about the weather. 

&#39;Oh, but don&#39;t take that as an invitation to sell me out, okay?&#39; He squeezed Rider&#39;s hand a bit harder as if to issue her a warning. It seemed that Rider&#39;s revelation about acting behind his back had affected him profoundly. 

&#39;You may not have much trust for me, but I still intend to place my utmost trust in you. After all, you are the only one I can rely on to win this War. If that means repurposing all my resources to help you stay alive, then so be it. Sun Tzu can roll in his grave all he wants, but outlasting the enemy is as good as any strategy in his book.

&#39;So, how about that hiding spot? Care to tell me about it?&#39;

He was a menace that would bring ruin to her. She kept repeating that statement in her head numerous times, as if hoping that she could brainwash herself and abandon her no-good summoner in a ditch somewhere. Unfortunately, Kun Wu was far more persistent than she had anticipated. He approached her again, as expected, but he didn&#39;t rely on schemes or deceit to gain her favor. Instead of relying on his strengths, he relied on his greatest weakness: His recklessness.

&quot;...What are you even saying? Do you want me to cut your tongue out?&quot; Rider faltered, stopping momentarily as her body twitched upon hearing Kun Wu&#39;s words. There was no mistake: He was willing to offer up his own life if it meant earning Rider&#39;s trust.

He certainly couldn&#39;t mean it, right? This was yet another scheme! An attempt to seem genuine so that he could manipulate Rider fur-

Now he was even showing the rest of his hand. Offering Ching his suite. Telling her that in case he died, she would still live comfortably for at least a few weeks. He was putting a huge target on his head. There was no reason for Ching Shih to not take him up on his offer and end him right there. An older, more experienced Master would probably be Rider&#39;s companion of choice.

Yet, for some reason, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to commit to that plan. The boy was honest to a fault. His trust in a Servant that had not only insulted him, but kept away several things from him was beyond stupid. Her Master was an idiot and she wished that she could shred him to pieces.</span>

But his hands felt warm to the touch. His words made her quiver from anxiety. When was the last time someone had been sincere to her? Not even her own husband had loved her. Loved her as a woman, perhaps, but not as a person. After an entire lifetime spent seeing people as assets, Ching Shih had no idea why someone as smart as Kun Wu would not come to the same conclusion as her. Why was he caring for a Servant that could betray him at any moment?

She could not rest until she found the answer to that question. Her departure would be postponed.

&quot;...If you felt this way, you should have just said so!&quot; Ching Shih shouted, sounding frustrated. She gripped Kun Wu&#39;s hand tightly and dragged him closer. Once in proximity, she released his hand and instead started pinching at his cheeks, bending them like molasses.

&quot;Do you expect me to read minds? Do you?! How am I supposed to understand what you&#39;re thinking when all you talk about is your egocentric plays? You son of-&quot; She stopped herself from saying things that should not be said.

&quot;Ugh!&quot; She released her grip, letting out hot air as she realized that she was acting unreasonable. &quot;...Your plan is beyond stupid and you should have never placed your trust in someone like me, milord. Unbelievable.&quot; She shook her head, overcome by embarrassment. Suddenly, it felt like the load on Ching&#39;s shoulders had grown bigger. Not only did she have her own goals to achieve, but now a brat was fully determined in using her as their golden goose.</span>

She didn&#39;t know whether she was being played or not. All she knew was that Kun Wu wanted to win the war as badly as she did, albeit his methods were...questionable at best.

&quot;...I hid it on that ship.&quot; Ching Shih pointed at a gigantic ship in the distance, one that Kun Wu had heard rumors of. The Brobdingnagian, notorious not only for its size, but for its horrendous name. Apparently, it was abandoned because of its old age and because of the number of typos caused by its presence alone in the docks. Good riddance.

&quot;Since it seemed to be an old derelict, I suspected that no one would venture there to take a gander at our riches. My last check was yesterday and everything was fine. I suppose we could do a daily check today, to make up for my betrayal.&quot; She said while looking downward. Seems like even the pirate queen felt bad when confronted by Kun Wu&#39;s words.</span>

Kun Wu staggered back, clutching his cheeks with tears in his eyes. It seemed that Rider had bottled up more than just her rage these days: she had suffered a relapse in cheek pinching as well, to the point that she had almost kneaded Kun Wu&#39;s cheeks into rice cakes after abstaining from it for so long. His cheeks had long since passed the point of hurting; now they just burned, and Kun Wu looked as if he was wearing a permanent blush. 

&#39;I thought my plan was pretty good,&#39; He mumbled, hissing between each breath. &#39;I mean, if <em>I</em> don&#39;t trust you, then who will? I&#39;m the one who dragged you out of the Throne, of course I have to take responsibility,&#39; He huffed, &#39;I&#39;m not heartless.&#39;

He gingerly massaged his face, missing his fridge of ice cubes dearly. Meanwhile, Rider continued to shower him in new insults, albeit to a lesser degree. She still looked every bit as furious, but something else had crept onto her face. Embarrassment, uncertainty, a mixture of emotions that betrayed the woman behind her well-worn mask - but then they were gone in a flash, and Rider went back to her cold and calculating self. 

Kun Wu didn&#39;t know what to make of it. Rider rarely exposed her weaknesses, preferring to manipulate others with sticks much like how he did the same with the promise of carrots. They were truly two peas in a pod... or was that why they could never see eye to eye?

No. The issue ran much deeper than that, the youth realized with abject horror when Rider finally revealed the location of her treasure vault: an enormous, hulking shadow in the distant waters, a giant ship by the name of Brobdingnagian, which Olympia had repurposed into a battleground for the City Grail War. 

She did her riches on that ship?!

You are a pirate, and pirates are supposed to be good at reading maps. But maps don&#39;t tell you everything. The ship you chose to hide our money, it&#39;s been cleared to use as a battleground for the City Grail War!&#39; 

<em>This is bad,</em> he thought to himself as he paced back and forth, trying to recall all the battles that had been reported so far. Didn&#39;t a fight occur on the ship just a few days ago? Was that before or after their meeting with that informant? When did Rider first discover the ship?

&#39;If we are lucky, your treasures should still be intact. But given the nature of the Brob...the ship,&#39; He smoothed over his small hiccup as if nothing had happened. &#39;As a battleground, there&#39;s no guarantee when another Servant is going to sink it with a Noble Phantasm. A battle could be happening right now even as we speak! Come on.&#39; He went over to Rider and touched her face, the back of his gloves rubbing her chin, tipping her face up, and his eyes held hers for a fraction of a second.

He dropped his hand. &#39;A pirate never lets go of their treasure,&#39; He said, pressing the umbrella into her hand. &#39;And a prostitute does not lose their grace. I can&#39;t fault you for something you didn&#39;t know. So chin up. Let&#39;s relocate the crates first, and I&#39;ll show you how to use CityNet when we get back.&#39; (To <span class="mention">#brobdingnagian</span>)

His way of brushing off her insults and turning them back into praises directed towards her could make even the coldest heart melt. Thankfully, Rider was reinforced by slabs of concrete and gravel, so she was safe from the boy&#39;s clutches for now.

In fact, she was far more worried to Kun Wu&#39;s reaction to her little cargo box. &quot;Hmm? A battleground? Aren&#39;t all city areas a battleground when it comes to Grail Wars?&quot; She asked out of curiosity. Could it be? That she had no idea that was a rule implemented for this particular tournament? Maybe she was right about Kun Wu not talking about the CGW enough...

Regardless, her Master soon realized the urgency of the situation and tapped her face, catching her attention before giving her a dose of pep talk. It was clear that he wanted to make sure that the treasure was safe and secure. Rider had no qualms with that, albeit seeing it happen in such a quick motion caught her off guard.

&quot;I&#39;m not ignorant! I know how to use City-Hmph. Whatever. Let&#39;s just get this sorted so I can show you how it&#39;s done later.&quot; Ching scoffed as she dragged Kun Wu by the neck and started running towards the Brob&#39;s general direction with the umbrella in hand. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
