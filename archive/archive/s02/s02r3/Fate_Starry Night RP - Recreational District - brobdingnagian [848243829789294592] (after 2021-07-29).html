As a result, the aristocrats have decided to turn it into a battleground for the upcoming Holy Grail War. Brobdingnagian is a giant ship which has numerous rooms, cabins and storerooms, meaning that it is an ideal location for a battle between Servants. The battle will also be conducted at open sea, far away from the city docks to minimize collateral damage.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A few weeks into being alive again, Simo had quite the exciting time. Firstly, his master was a man with a dark past and willingness to kill. Secondly, That Knight which defended the musician in the park. Thirdly, Those who inhabited The Clinic and helped to heal Gustave. And now, He and his master had contracted with another former master to be in an alliance

There was just something… cowardly about this <em>Laurent Mackenzie</em>. While not having interacted with him personally and only hearing what Gustave described after the meeting, Simo has determined this man is a rat, hiding behind the thin veil of a CEO. Just the way he held himself, was as if he had always gotten what he wanted. 

Needless to say, Laurent was one of the thoughts occupying Simo’s mind as he rid himself of what remained of his Wintery wardrobe. Changing into more casual clothing, along with a yellow raincoat, for this trip into Olympia. 

According to Gustave’s current lecture some malfunction occurred within the weather dome to produce this rain. Again the lecturer spoke on and on, Simo showing his engagement with ‘ah’s’ and ‘ooh’s’. Really, the ships Humanity constructed are a miraculous feat of engineering and magecraft. 

“All I can say is, I am glad the heat is not as bad as last week.” He spoke with some relief as the pair approached the rendezvous with Laurent. “And Gustave, have your legs been holding up?” The sniper spoke with some concern for his master, he didn’t exactly know the procedure he went under but it was not a painless operation.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Simo and Gustave would arrive on the deck of the ship. It was large, one could do cartwheels with a truck without hitting the edge of the boat. Olympian ships were a wonder in the New World, famous for carrying capacity and sustainability on the open waters. Shipbuilding was a lucrative market for men lucky enough to be born into the right family. The ship, however, was empty and unnerving.

To further enhance the eeriness of the ship, the two could see a man faintly outlined in the constant stream of rainfall. Gustave&#39;s mind was sharp, and it was fairly easy from body size alone that this was Laurent. Besides, who else could this be? An enemy Master? Unlikely. Only a man used to his presence dominating any given space would be so arrogant to stand on a decommissioned cargo ship as if he were its king.

Laurent was wearing a dark blue business suit with a black tie. Simple and efficient, a combination that warranted respect. Gustave and Simo would most likely find this foolish, however. What sort of idiot wore a suit to a rainy battleground? A foolish one, presumably.

Though they had to admit: he <em>did</em> look sharp.

&quot;I must admit. You made it here fast, despite the cane. You must have legs of steel, Gustave. I barely had time to gather your requests, Laurent said, walking over to meet them, he carried a duffle bag, which he presented to Simo. &quot;As a sniper, I trust in your instincts and capabilities. Please give your Master advice on what to use.&quot; Laurent&#39;s eyes flitted to Gustave. &quot;No offense, but your Archer is probably better suited. You don&#39;t strike me as a gunman.&quot;

Now that Simo finally had a look at this man, he was, at the very least, a little shady, though he conducted himself well.

A well-tailored and fine looking suit, but still a suit. <em>’no wonder he lost his servant.’</em>The Finn thought to himself as his eyes met Laurent’s. 

The CEO brought quite the assortment of tools for Simo to make use of. “We make quick time when needed.” He began to inspect each weapon, especially taking his time with the heavy caliber rifle. Strangely enough, Simo began to remove the scope from the rifle. 

“Laurent, you strike me as the kind of man who could kill someone, with only their back turned to him. Be weary that I won’t hesitate if you make <em>any</em> moves towards him.” Assassin’s tone was cold as ice, and his hands kept busy finally removing the scope and then pulling out the pistols. “Do you want one, master?”

That was the mark of a true teacher and focusing on such a talent made the long trip from Delphi to the abandoned ship in the breakers of Olympia tolerable for a certain old man. By discussing the nature of the weather domes and how such an error could allow for rain in Olympia&#39;s, the residual pain in his legs seemed to fade completely away from mind and the rain nothing more than a presence to keep tempo to.

Simo made for a wonderful audience of one and his curiosity allowed their conversation to meander from one topic to the next like the rivers that once wondered across land.

&quot;Here here, another instance of that and I&#39;m not sure either of us would be standing, even before we fought our opponent!&quot; He chuckled  before coming to a stop underneath the eaves of the ship&#39;s cabin. &quot;Oh of course, couldn&#39;t get here otherwise. Old Toulouse continues to make miracles happen and one day I&#39;ll find out what exactly makes them work...&quot;

After a few moments of listening to the rain tapping away at the metal around them, the pair spotted the silhoutte of a well-dressed man trudging towards them, a pack slung behind him.  There was no doubt that it was their contact from Olympia. Who else would emphasize form over function but a consumate businessman who knew first impressions mattered.

&quot;Greetings to you, Mr. MacKenzie. Glad to see even the odd rainstorm couldn&#39;t put a damper on your mood, perhaps its the energy in the air?&quot; Gustave nodded to their acquaintance and shook their hand before ushering him inside the old helm station of the ship. &quot;And thank you kindly, I would not be here before you today if it were not for the aid of my servant and the wonders of leyline transit.&quot;</span>

He was a painter and a scientist, far, far removed from the rigors and specifications demanded of a soldier. He only smiled and nodded again as Laurent commented on his lack of knowledge and skill in the matter at hand.
&quot;Yes, hand me something simple. Light too if possible. A little insurance policy only could help here,&quot; Gustave huddled by the stash of weaponry but then noticed the absence of something. &quot;Perhaps I should have mentioned it in our previous conversation, but did you happen to bring along any passive protection, something like armor or a bulletproof vest? Might be a good idea to further protect the frailest of the bunch, no?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent had expected Archer to be at least somewhat grateful. He had serviced Gustave&#39;s request, bringing enough weapons to supply a small group of people. He had not brought any weapons for himself, however. Nothing but his trusty revolver. As such, being told by the Servant he intended to ally with was...

Infuriating.

Laurent turned away from Gustave, hiding his face. To the old man, it would look like he was simply looking overboard, waiting for the eventual arrival of their foe.

To Simo however? This man <em>oozed</em> a cold malice, all focused in one eye, which turned to look his way so that Gustave could not notice it. It screamed <em>GET AWAY FROM THIS MAN, HURRY!</em> It was more chilling than the cold Finnish winter that Simo Hayha was known for fighting in. It vanished quickly.

&quot;That&#39;s a smart thing to do, Archer. Make sure, however, that you don&#39;t get too focused on me that you fail to notice what goes on beyond the sights of your rifle.&quot; 

With that, Laurent, sat beneath a slightly covered cargo container, staying out of the rain as best he could. He checked his watch.

Everything he had done today had been for a specific reason.

&quot;There&#39;s six grenades in that bag, use them wisely. I have six, myself, but I am uniquely qualified to use them.&quot; Laurent didn&#39;t elaborate. Was he a mage? Most Olympian heads were, but their magecraft was largely flaunted. The abilities of several families were known to the public. Laurent didn&#39;t flaunt, though several workers had received a glimpse of his powers during the incident with Berserker last week.

&quot;<strong>I did not.</strong>&quot; Laurent lied through his teeth. Years of experience made lies indistinguishable from truths. &quot;I highly advise you stay far from any Servant or Mage that appears. I am young and spry, and I have excellent health insurance. I am, unfortunately, a perfect bullet sponge.&quot;

He had worn a suit specifically for this reason: there was no way to see a bulletproof vest beneath it.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was a cold, murderous glare coming directly from this man, all but for a moment. A split second that Simo should have shot the man, or ran away from the man. But as soon as it was noticed, it had gone away. Perhaps it was a flight of fancy, some trick of the brain to make him seem more menacing. 

“I’ll keep that in mind. A nice vantage point will keep me well aware of the surroundings.” The Finn responded to Laurent, while placing the rifle back into the bag and retrieving two pistols. 

The sniper passed two pistols and accompanying clips to his master for safekeeping. Both of which where handed over with the utmost of care. 

“Safety’s are on, Gustave. The little button above the trigger will need to be pressed before firing. Remember ‘red and they’re dead’.”Simo gave a small  demonstration as he pressed the safety on one of the handguns he held, turning it off, then turning it back on. “If nothing else is required of me, I’ll be taking my spot. I assume it’ll be a similar signal for firing.” And without another word, Presence Concealment kicked in and the yellow rain coat clad sniper was gone. 

He brought along the duffel bag of supplies and made his way towards a vantage point for sniping. The Sniper was more nervous about this excursion than the previous, all because of the addition of one man who he didn’t very much like. 

The Finn set himself up on top of a few cargo containers, making sure that the two men he left were well in his line of sight for the time being. After all, if they moved he could too.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Gustave tilted his head to the side as Laurent turned his head abruptly away after Simo&#39;s biting words. While he had informed his servant that Laurent more than likely had an ulterior motive for aligning with them, for Simo to be this blunt about it was a potential risk to the success of the mission.

&quot;Now now, Archer, there is room for healthy caution against our acquaintance. We should not be bearing our fangs against those who bring us gifts. Let&#39;s work towards knocking another servant out of the ring first.&quot;

He watched as Laurent pocketed the grenades and made a mental note of it for later. There was one potential mark against him, withholding explosives and another would reveal itself soon.

&quot;No protection? I would have thought such a thorough businessman like yourself would have come a bit more prepared. Perhaps we may have to alter the deal if you keep making these mistakes...&quot; He could only shake his head in disappointment before getting closer to Simo and listening to the world&#39;s quickest gun handling course. It was special to be the student for once and he was lucky to have a master to teach him, even if it was just the basics. 

&quot;Similar signals yes, and it would be for the best to keep an eye out for Laurent too. He is an unproven partner, I would not want to leave this contest prematurely, if you understand.&quot;

With Laruent doing his own procedures and Simo disappearing into the rain, Gustave set out his own work and began painting his own devious plans across the ship with techniques that could alter space and bend distance. The performer and his aide would be unknowningly walking into a stage primed with shortcuts, hazards and three men planning their demise.

Thanks to their close proximity to the sea, it felt as if the woman had boundless stamina to work with. Her and her Master were now at the docks, just a boat ride away from the fabled Brobdingnagian.

&quot;Milord, procure us a ride.&quot; She told him as she released her grip on his neck. Kun Wu would most likely rub it a bit, having felt a tight squeeze during the entire trip.

&quot;But so far, it seems like you were wrong. Look, the ship is fully intact.&quot; Ching pointed out. Indeed, the Brob didn&#39;t seem harmed in the slightest.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu flopped onto the ground as soon as Rider had released him, clothes disheveled from where she had been pulling at it. They had arrived at the port at lightning speed, but at what cost? He sure hoped no one was out and about to witness him being dragged around like luggage.

&#39;Aiyah...&#39; He groaned, smoothing out all the wrinkles in his clothes in a hurry. &#39;Next time, can we go back to the princess carry? My coat will thank you,&#39; He cracked his neck, hearing the joints grind and pop, &#39;and so will my neck.&#39;

He shielded his eyes and squinted at the Brobdingnagian next. Unlike Rider, he wasn&#39;t able to make out much from this distance, especially with all that rain, but so far, the ship seemed to be floating quite happily in the water. A sign that it hadn&#39;t suffered much internal damage. 

&#39;So far, so good.&#39; He patted his chest, breathing a sigh of relief. &#39;But just because it looks okay right now, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to be tomorrow. I&#39;d rather move the money somewhere safe than to come back the next day and find Big Bob halfway under the sea.&#39;

He looked around the dock and spotted a single ferry at the terminal.

&#39;That&#39;s our ride!&#39; He signaled for Rider to follow as he fetched his wallet and started for the boat. &#39;I sure hope they don&#39;t charge a premium. Think they&#39;ll give us a discount if we told them we are participating in the War?&#39;

I remember you complaining about it last time.&quot; Ching replied with some snark in response to Kun Wu&#39;s comment on a princess carry. Of course, the conversation immediately shifted towards the Brobdingnagian as the boy talked about various possible theories that could involve the ship. He really, <em>really</em> didn&#39;t want to use it as their storage box of choice.

&quot;Hmph, fine.&quot; Ching puffed out hot air, feeling repudiated at her grand master plan being shot down. &quot;You better have a good substitute ready.&quot; She warned before seeing her Master hard at work, having already found himself a ferry.

&quot;W-What? Do you even hear yourself, milord? That would be giving away our identities for <em>free</em>.&quot; Ching immediately blurted out. &quot;And I <em>hate</em> giving things away. So no! Maintain a low profile. It&#39;s always important to hide our traces away from any possible enemies. How do you think pirates avoided enemy fleets?&quot;

She shook her head, motioning for the boy to follow her as the two approached the ferryman. It took only a few words from Rider&#39;s luscious lips to convince the ferryman to give the two a 90% discount. Kun Wu&#39;s wallet actually felt heavier than before. Perhaps it was the guilt of having practically scammed a man.

Rider paid no mind, keeping a smile on her face as she rode the ferry to the Brob. It was clear that she had done this a few times already. Kun Wu wondered how the poor ferryman was doing, having been ripped off repeatedly now.

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Rider said, the two getting out of the ferry and boarding the decrepit ship. It was certainly old, to the point that even some fauna was present on board. Traces of crab shells and starfishes desperately clinging to the old relic of the past.

&quot;I&#39;ve hidden the booty inside the captain&#39;s chambers. It&#39;s in a secret compartment.&quot; Ching explained.</span>

The ship creaked and groaned as it rocked about, somewhat distanced from Olympia&#39;s harbors. It was clear that Olympia&#39;s aristocracy didn&#39;t want whatever happened on this ship to affect their primary source of exportation.

As the two stepped around a shipping container...

<strong>BANG!</strong>

A few hairs from Kun Wu&#39;s beautifully styled head disappeared as a bullet made an elegant groove through the young adult&#39;s head. Standing besides the cargo container where the bullet originated from was a man, elegantly dressed. 

&quot;<strong>I missed.</strong>&quot; The man said, as if disappointed in himself. &quot;Who would&#39;ve thought that using once of these accurately would be so tricky.&quot; Laurent sighed as he reloaded a bullet into the revolver.

&quot;You hid something in the captain&#39;s chambers? <strong>I was wondering why that door was tightly shut.</strong>&quot; Laurent said. This didn&#39;t make sense, didn&#39;t he say that he had just arrived when he met with Gustave and Simo? When would he have time to check the captain&#39;s quarters? Why would he even GO to the captain&#39;s quarters?

Nonetheless, that didn&#39;t matter much. It was clear to both Rider and Kun Wu that this man had no intention to barter or bargain if he was willing to take such an underhanded shot. Was he a Master? If so, where was his Servant?

Oh well, that didn&#39;t matter.

Laurent tapped the bullets in his revolver, hoisted it upwards, and unloaded several shots towards the Master of Rider.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The murmur of the waves as they lapped against the hull of the ship put Gustave in a serene mood as he waited for the targets to arrive, it fostered the ideal environment for his mind to wander in itself while its body sat primed for action. The first action of the holy grail war had brought him failure and nearly to death&#39;s door, a miracle he could even walk yet now he stood at a position he had once found himself on the opposite side. As a young student, he had sought to defy convention and push the boundaries of magecraft beyond what they were established to be and there were professors who stood in his way, some who wished to actively stifle his efforts. Now he stood a wizened old coot himself about to impede the rising star of Delphi&#39;s performing world for the chance at a true miracle made manifest. It left a bittersweet mote in his mouth, even though ideas were not tangible, such was the power of the mind. 

Then he could hear two sounds rise above the waves, still murmurs themselves but belonging to those he had conspired to bring down with the Winter Ghost and the Tyrant of Industry. So this must be Kun Wu and his servant. Yet their voices were cut down by the staccato crack of a pistol. 

<em>Laurent seems to have spared no expense in greeting them. Why am I not surprised</em> He thought to himself as he grabbed hold of the propane tank he had found during a previous investigation. Not quite full but the potential as a hazard was ever present. When he heard Laurent speak again, it was time to add his own efforts to the party. Being behind the taller part of the cabin he had a clear view of the back and he knew all he had to do was roll the canister over the side and his magecraft would do the rest. So with a shove, he let gravity reclaim the pressured gas and watched it hurdle towards the ground</span>

Through the beauty of his efforts, a fat white canister, would simultaneously shoot up from the floor beside the Rider Team like a rocket. And then it would come hurtling back down.

The ball was now in Simo&#39;s court and all he needed to do was spike the ball.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Sniper relaxed in his perch. Watching for their targets to make an entrance, keeping an eye on Laurent and his master. 

This was his favorite portion of sniping. The stake out. The waiting for the target to appear. The quiet that came with isolation from others, thoughts just left to wander. Of course they went to one of his only thoughts from the past week, The Knight. A frown came across Simo’s face as he thought of the Golden haired gentleman. But they were cut short as he saw the targets, A tall woman and a child. 

Gustave had a conversation with Simo previously about how while the enemy might seem to be a civilian, they are not. He simply had to agree with this, especially with what might be at stake in the war. 

Laurent showed an uncivilized side, opening fire upon the pair. While Gustave’s magic went to work, the pattern revealing itself then spitting out a canister. Without another moment to waste, Simo shot the canister as it neared the enemies. Going to cause an explosion. Without firing again Simo set off to change positions. 

Mana drained and the Finn went invisible, his trail of snow melting in the rain. Using his enhanced speed to take up a new position still keeping an overlook on the battlefield. 

Presence concealment dropped, and now Rider would be able to tell another servant was in this battle.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu sat on the ferryboat with a heavy heart. He had finally witnessed Rider flexing her charm in close proximity, and the result was devastating. To watch the ferryman accept a measly fare of only a few coins for a party of two with delight was absolutely horrifying. From one merchant to another, he couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for the man...

But then he saw the fat bills in his wallet, still very much intact and waiting to be splurged away at the next shopping venue, and the weight lightened. One man&#39;s loss is another man&#39;s gain, and perhaps, if Rider was willing, things didn&#39;t haven&#39;t to stop at a single ferryman.

&#39;You should do that more often.&#39; He nudged Rider, whispering out of the ferryman&#39;s earshot. &#39;This is like getting red packets, but better!&#39; His eyes sparkled. &#39;Forget Amazones™️, the <span class="mention">#shopping-center</span> is the future and the future is now!&#39;  

Who cared if Rider wanted to treasure horde like a dragon? She&#39;d be making all that money back and possibly more if she could charm her way into getting almost-free meals. Kun Wu fantasized about his newly discovered money making scheme; even the salty ocean breeze now bore a sweet tint as they whipped hair about his face.

He got off the ferry with a spring in his steps. 

&#39;Lead the way,&#39; He commanded Rider merrily. The cold, decrepit, plant-infested steel of the abandoned galleon doing little to dampen his mood. &#39;You should be old hands at navigating this ship-&#39;

A tremendous <em><strong>bang!</strong></em> erupted next to his ear at the same time a heated metal bead shot through his hair. His hand instinctively reached up, feeling the singed ends of a few hairs that had bitten the dust. It was <em>almost</em> a professional grade jump scare on a would-be ghost ship, had the perpetrator decided to outfit themselves in something more ghastly than...

...a snazzy suit.

Of course, she had no idea that someone would attempt to <em>monetize</em> her ability to smoothtalk people. Kun Wu pitching ideas at her felt like she had just received a sudden curve ball.

&quot;You are something else, milord.&quot; She sighed, but she did not mind the praise. The only thing she was worried about was dying from overwork. Perhaps she should give her Master a set limit on how many people they could swindle at the mall per day.

Before they could continue their idle chatter on future <em>get-rich-quick</em> schemes, they were interrupted by an unexpected foe.

The sound of a gunshot rung in Ching&#39;s ears, an all too familiar tune that reminded her of fleet battles. She turned to Kun Wu&#39;s position to make sure the boy was alright. Thankfully, the bullet had missed its mark, but the insult still remained. Someone had tried to assassinate them.

She looked above and saw a well-dressed man, albeit not sharp enough to resemble the Caster they had met at the mall. If anything, it was apparent that they were a human. A random thief or an enemy Master after something more?

&quot;Do not push the blame on me!&quot; Ching shouted, annoyed at Kun Wu&#39;s remark. She aimed to disable the gunman first, but eventually she noticed the looming canister that threatened to circle them from behind.

She had never seen a propane tank in her life, but she knew that whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t good.

&quot;Milord, run towards me!&quot; She ordered while extending her arms. It was clear that whoever had attacked them was after her Master first. She would deny them that satisfaction.</span>

Between a gunman who was inaccurate yet way too close for comfort and a metal canister that he had seen all too many times in an open air kitchen, the relief Rider provided was immense. She was the safest cover there was within immediate reach!

&#39;Not a very fast shot, are you?&#39; He matched speed with the suited man, hand flying to to the holster on his waist and withdrawing his iron fan as the other reloaded his revolver. He counted the man&#39;s motion. One shot. Two. Three...he raised his fan, snapping it open with a flick of the wrist.

His magic circuits flickered to life. Meanwhile, the fan taunted Laurent, giving him an unobstructed view of its obnoxiously calligraphed front side. <em>The one and only, throughout heaven and earth,</em> he could almost hear it in the youth&#39;s voice, having just recently watched his insufferable summoning video. 

Fortunately, there wasn&#39;t nearly enough distance between Laurent and his target to let such inane self-glorification deteriorate his aim any further. The bullets largely flew towards the young Master, but then he brought the iron fan down on the ones that did manage to find their mark, and they ricocheted off its smooth surface to god knows where.

&#39;Two guests, possibly more. No reservations. Get ready for unpaid work, Rider!&#39; Kun Wu kept his mouth busy as he played the most intense game of ping-pong with Laurent&#39;s bullets. &#39;Though I&#39;ll appreciate you a lot more if you can find me somewhere to hide! The captain&#39;s room is sounding a lot more enticing by the second!&#39;

Not exactly a hiding place if he just flat out announced it, was it?</span>

Soft and supple, enough for someone to fully sink into them. That&#39;s how relaxing Rider&#39;s chest felt to Kun Wu, who made sure to enjoy his temporary cover. Of course, it didn&#39;t take long for Ching to notice.

&quot;You little-&quot; She gave an irritated smile, a vein popping on her forehead as she chose to ignore his act in favor of actually surviving the fight. There would be punishment, but it wouldn&#39;t happen now.

At least she was pleased by her Master being actually competent in a fight. With the way Kun Wu hyperfocused on his shows and on vain performances, one would immediately assume that he was an incompetent idiot. However, he deflected the assassin&#39;s bullets with the greatest of ease. Did her Master even need cover?

&quot;Understood, milord....But could you not phrase it that way?&quot; Rider said with a sigh as she flicked his forehead. &quot;It makes me wish I was on the other side, almost.&quot;

After taking the time to toy with her ally, Ching would be reminded of the incoming propane tank. Thankfully, Kun Wu had long since stepped away from the tank&#39;s trajectory, rendering it a harmless heap of junk.

Of course, she wasn&#39;t naive enough to believe that. She eyed it suspiciously, waiting for any signs of a sneak attack. And then it happened.

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

Simo witnessed an explosion that rivaled that of tank artillery. Whatever was in that propane tank, it could have probably lasted several cookers a few years or more. Rider and Kun Wu were last seen within the blast&#39;s range, so there was a high chance that Rider&#39;s Master had perished in that instant.

Plus, there was also the fact that the explosion really <em>did</em> feel like tank artillery. No matter how sturdy the Badabing was in its prime, it was a shell of its former self. Its hull would most likely not hold against the might of modern warfare and Simo wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the ship started sinking. Perhaps Laurent should steal the ferry and leave before the Brob sank entirely?</span>

.....

Loud coughing could be heard, chilling Laurent to the bone. It came from near him, a sign that something had survived the explosion. Smoke obscured his vision as Simo wondered whether his one shot moniker was a curse or not. At this rate, it would take him a while to line up a second shot with the smoke covering the ship. Maybe that&#39;s why he never used explosives back in the war...

&quot;Ohohohohohohohoho <em>huff hack cough</em>!&quot; A proud, feminine voice could be heard laughing their worries away, until they fell into yet another coughing fit. &quot;I&#39;ll say, you charlatans could have probably used better fuel for your fire. Were you trying to kill me with tuberculosis?&quot;

The smoke finally dissolved, revealing the extent of the explosion&#39;s damage. Kun Wu was no longer hugging Rider&#39;s ample cleavage, but instead wrapped around her back while the woman glared at Laurent with a grin. There were burn marks on portions of her clothing along with traces of singed hair strands, but she seemed to be completely fine.

Even more peculiar: The Brob was still standing. Its surface was completely undamaged. All the explosion had done was to kill any of the flora and wildlife inhabiting its carcass. In a sense, Simo had completely cleaned out a portion of the ship, free of charge.

This wasn&#39;t logical. There should be at least <em>some</em> damage. But Rider&#39;s smirk gave it away. She certainly had something to do with it.

&quot;So...Two of you and one Servant, is it?&quot; She pointed out, having detected Simo&#39;s presence after he relocated. &quot;Oho. Well, that&#39;s certainly unfair...&quot;</span>

Her eyes turned cold as she seemed to be sizing Laurent up.

&quot;You&#39;re not the first group of hooligans that tried to invade a ship of mine. Pirates are a rowdy bunch and have no shame in raiding the boats of fellow lawbreakers. Unfortunately for you, I am quite experienced at dealing with people like that.&quot; She exclaimed, shifting back to a benign smile.

&quot;Now, we can do this expediently and efficiently: Simply tell me where your allies are, and I&#39;ll spare only you out of this hopeless trio. There is a ferry nearby. Feel free to take it.&quot; Rider was bargaining even when their life was in the line? Kun Wu didn&#39;t know whether to admire her nerves of steel or not.

&quot;Of course, if you refuse...I don&#39;t think I need to finish that one, do I?&quot; Ching threatened while inching closer, walking towards Laurent as she carefully observed his gun.

<em>&quot;Milord, watch my back.&quot;</em> She whispered loud enough for Kun Wu to hear. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget the Malnourished</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If Laurent&#39;s shot had been the drum that proclaimed the beginning of a battle, than Gustave and Archer&#39;s explosion had been the start of the actual conflict. It was certainly loud and hot enough, having slightly singed Laurent&#39;s eyebrows from behind the shipping container.

It was a good choice to ally with such a brutal and clever duo. What had Gustave gone through at Lemuria to become this heartless? Laurent scoffed and shook his head slightly. The rush of battle was making him listless.

This was good, though. The explosions and mayhem that ensue in this fight would raise the stakes higher and higher. Both sides would become more and more brutal in their attempts to oust the other. Eventually, Laurent&#39;s trap would snap shut around both brat and old man alike. It would also give him an alibi for what was to come.

After all, he hadn&#39;t wasted time getting explosives from the warehouse for no reason, after all. 

Laurent mused to himself as he reloaded a few bullets into his gun. His revolver was loud, and Kun Wu&#39;s Servant was clever. It was foolish of him to think it would be so easy as one, two, three bullets.

After fighting Berserker, Laurent was certain that a simple explosion wouldn&#39;t kill Rider. Laurent squinted around the corner, where smoke and dust were billowing into the sky. As Kun Wu taunted him with his fan and a mix of dance and song, Laurent allowed himself an involuntary twitch of the mouth. He fantasized about shooting the aspiring DelphiTuber™️ overboard to calm his nerves.

And now he got to negotiate with Kun Wu&#39;s chaperone. Wonderful.

As words flew from her mouth like gilded flowers and buttered words, Laurent found himself wanting to listen. Abandoning this fight? What a wonderful idea! There was no way that a pitiful businessman like himself, an old man with a leg injury, and a sniper could defeat somebody this majestic and beautiful!</span>

Laurent&#39;s mouth opened to take the offer. Selling out Gustave had been part of the plan from the word go. He prepared to say the magic words.

<em>Wait.</em>

The shrewd businessman within Laurent hissed and screeched and kicked. This was a trap. This had to be. He did not accept anybody as his superior. He didn&#39;t even trust the Church, his fellow aristocratic families, or Delphi itself.

He had barely trusted his own wife.

Laurent MacKenzie did not show affection. He himself was two-faced in his dealings, kind to Gustave, while thinking about how to stab him in the back. This woman had to act in the same way. Someone this beautiful and cunning had to have a shrewd side to them as well. It was the same reason he never trusted the Church—perfection always had a dark side.

He bit down, <strong>hard</strong>. Blood spilled into his mouth, hot and metallic. He spat out a globule.

&quot;I applaud your natural talent in the ways of temptation and bartering. You would, or perhaps, you did make a good businesswoman. That, or an excellent cup for men to fill their misery with.&quot; Laurent&#39;s mouth twisted into a sneer.

&quot;However, the fact that you offer a deal like that proves that my existence here as the potential to turn the tide. People like you or me don&#39;t make deals like this solely for the benefit of the other party. Besides...&quot;

Laurent sized Madame Ching up in reply, he snorted.

&quot;Your ship? Everything in Olympia belongs to me. I helped <strong>put</strong> this ship here. I don&#39;t know how you managed to enhance it, but I loathe people like you.&quot; 

Laurent reached into his suit pocket, produced a grenade, and pulled the pin. The Magic Crest on his shoulder glowed brightly, and Laurent threw a curve ball that went past both Kun Wu and Rider.

Until it rebounded, attaching itself to to Rider.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The shot was perfect, that woman and child should be swallowed up by that explosion. Simo could only marvel about the advancements in military technology, specifically this rifle. Helping to create an explosion similar to that of heavy tank artillery. 

While this ship was once sturdy in its prime, an explosion of this type would absolutely rattle the fragile hull of this decrepit ship. <em>’I need to make sure I can reach Gustave and get away cleanly, just in case…’</em> he thought to himself, not even caring for the safety or escape of the scummy ally. 

Smoke began to cover the field, obfuscating the sniper’s vision from getting another shot in. Something felt off about this also, sure it was a heavy explosion…. But that woman she had to be a servant. And if that Knight in the park was <em>anything</em> to go by, some servants had tricks which could easily protect their masters. Maybe even in the face of high powered improvised explosive artillery. 

This, this is exactly the reason why Simo never attempted anything as reckless as this during The Winter war. Explosives are powerful, but also limit line of sight with their aftermath. 

Then a cough could be heard, he needed to set up his next shot. The Sniper had used his opportunity to relocate, but the damned smoke kept his vision limited. 

Slowly it dissipated as he awaited Gustave’s next move. Seeing if his master would warp space to get out of there. The woman was still standing, this child wrapped around her back like a baby koala. 

She took a step forwards towards Laurent, surely the ship should be sinking… but all the explosion seemed to have caused was just a bit of cleaning. Something about Ching screamed confidence, screamed authority, <strong>screamed that she was a woman who wanted to own the world</strong>. And what a better way to start an enterprise in the new world than on this decrepit ship, enhanced by one of her skills or Noble phantasms perhaps.</span>

Surprisingly however, The CEO made a bold move. Tossing a grenade towards the enemy Master and Servant, where it went Simo could only guess. With the smoke clearing it looked as if the grenade disappeared. 

Either way The Sniper was given a clear line of sight. He became visible to the world again, no longer surrounded by the gentle drift of snow. A yellow hooded specter. At a perpendicular point which gave him a shot at either master or servant. 

Kun Wu was the next target within his iron sights. The boy performer was the better bet, less potentiality for a missed shot. Unless he had some reality warping magic like his master, which doesn’t seem very likely. 

Without another moment of deliberation, Simo pulled the trigger. A split second between his appearance and finally lining the shot up. 

<strong>BANG</strong> 

The high caliber rifle fired, aiming to eviscerate  the boy. Simo made another quick adjustment, and another split second decision. 

Before the bullet shell even hit the ground another shot rang out. This one going right for the servant’s head, sure she’s durable… but this, was something that should dent a servant.

They would then have to anticipate the following question: 

 <em>(A). If a 12 g conical object with a maximum diameter of 7.85 mm and a height of 10.54 mm is propelled forward at a velocity of 812 m/s, given its kinetic energy, will it penetrate the container from earlier. (B) What is the force of the resulting pressure wave from rapid deflagration and explosion of the pressurized propane? (C) What is the probability of harm to objects alpha (165 cm, male, assume average weight, width) and beta (178 cm, female, assume average weight and width) if they are within a 2 meter radius of  the center detonation?</em>

The answer to that last question should be a high number boarding on guaranteed. The flames would play a minor role, fit only for spectacle, a facade to hide the true killers of any explosion: pressure waves and high velocity shrapnel that would embed itself in flesh and metal alike. While Gustave did not expect Kun Wu and his pirate servant to outright fail this diagnostic test, he expected them to sustain a few errors at the very least. No one entered his class with perfect marks, there would be no point to attend in the first place if they did.

Yet when Gustave peaked around the corner, the servant seemed barely fazed besides a few pieces of charred fabric. This was an outcome unexpected but not impossible, very few things were and he could not make a full assessment until he saw a better profle of the master, too heavily obscured by Ching&#39;s body at the moment. Laurent and Simo served on as worthy proctors, seeking to probe the skills of performer and pirate alike with shell and shot.</span>

Any and all variables involved had to be isolated one by one until exploitable flaws were discovered and mercilessly used until the law of dimishing returns proved such a measure futile. The means of armor and regeneration would be the first to be explored.

Just before the engagement, Gustave had asked Simo for a few of his bullets so that they could be &quot;improved.&quot; The means for which he would improve them was contradictory because instead of strengthening the jacket or altering the material of the bullet itself, he had shattered the surface of the bullet and put deep spawling cracks into each one, the results of which looked like the dizzying fusion of a spider&#39;s web and the old world&#39;s grand canyons scrawled across orange sandstone. He had no doubt one of the few bullets currently flying towards Ching would be of his design. The results of which was not to penetrate the body and race through the next, no it was to shatter upon impact and scramble the innards of a victim in such a way to prove healing, even of a magical variety, a great challenge while crippling any affected parts and lowering capabilities. 

Opening a portal he had prepared by his side, Gustave suddenly materialized beside Simo. &quot;Here are the rest of the bullets as promised. Let&#39;s see if our new pupils can stand up to this test...&quot;

Between him and Ching Shih, it was clear as day who made for a better shield. Seeing the woman emerge from the explosion almost completely unscathed only further cemented his suspicions. No wonder she had elected to hide their money all the way out here. The ship, together with the proximity to the ocean, had given his Servant an immense home-field advantage.

A nigh invulnerable ship was only the beginning.

&#39;So...what else are you hiding from me, hmm?&#39; Kun Wu lifted Rider&#39;s hair off her shoulders with the tip of his fan, then took advantage of the piggyback ride and spoke next to her ear. The little devil on her shoulder. &#39;At this rate, I&#39;ll have to start keeping tabs on our secrets. One point for me, two points for you. Winner wears the bunny suit at our next show. Deal?&#39; He tapped Rider&#39;s shoulder with his fan, before pointing it straight at Laurent.

&#39;He&#39;s not invited, though. Too rich for my blood.&#39; He grimaced, thinking about the stunt he had just pulled off. Between a chamber of bullets and a barbed tongue, he&#39;d much rather take the latter. Since when had words ever killed, anyway?

&#39;Though if you want to serenade him, then do me a favor and do it right here and now. Pretty please? I know you&#39;re good at this.&#39; He nuzzled his face against Rider&#39;s and purred, not just coaxing the woman, but also making her wish she had the luxury to impale her Master under her heels. <em>Sigh</em>. So much for keeping him away from her chest. <em>Anything</em> would be better than having a monkey strapped to her back, whispering nonsense into her ear and making it that much harder to focus on the Olympian Master&#39;s snide remarks...

But perhaps that had been his plan all along?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Negotiations broke down as soon as they started. Laurent&#39;s venomous tone and his attempt at harming Kun Wu&#39;s life made it readily apparent that he had no interest in getting on Ching&#39;s good side. Even worse, she could sense hints of megalomania and delusions behind his actions. What a pathetic creature.

&quot;There is such an expression as, don&#39;t count your chickens till they have hatched. In your case, however, I believe that you&#39;re counting way beyond that.&quot; Ching laughed, criticizing Laurent&#39;s grandiose plan. People who viewed themselves to be above others were, surprisingly enough, very easy for Ching to deal with.

People like Kun Wu, on the other hand...

&quot;A-Again with the bunnies?&quot; Ching blurted out, taken off guard by her own Master suddenly whispering in her ear. Couldn&#39;t he read the room? They were literally being attacked!

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that nonsense when it&#39;s <em>you</em> who started hiding things in the first place.&quot; Ching spat out. Laurent would most likely feel confused, wondering if the quarrel between the two was an elaborate trick to fool him, or whether they were looking down on him by ignoring him.

Kun Wu pushed even further, suddenly snuggling with Ching&#39;s face like a sleepy puppy, whispering sweet nothings in her ear as she instinctively blushed. Oh, how much she wished she could have tossed him overboard right now...

&quot;Keep this up and the only thing he&#39;ll be hearing is your screa-Look out!&quot; While the two were fooling around, Laurent had taken advantage of the situation and tossed a projectile at them. Ching gracefully avoided it like her flying swan, her fast reflexes seeming rather unbecoming of a famous pirate, almost as if something was powering her capabilities.</span>

Of course, a simple toss wasn&#39;t enough as the bomb turned around and homed towards Kun Wu instead. Great! Maybe that would shut him up!

&quot;Milord, you know what to do!&quot; She instantly cried out, putting her faith into Kun Wu and being glad that he could no longer torment her. It&#39;s not that she didn&#39;t want to help him, but her hands were already tied, since she had sensed another incoming attack.

The sniper.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu continued to fill Ching&#39;s ears with pointless drivel, even seamlessly switching to one of his stories when he had finally run out of things to comment on. It was difficult to ignore Laurent&#39;s words, but even more so to tune out some dumb tale of a winged tiger who lost his ability to fly because he ate too much. What was worse, the performer inside him seemed to have decided that <em>now</em> was the time to act. Kun Wu reached behind him for the pouch strapped to his waist. The next time his hand came back around, a small, white, four-legged creature paced in his open palm.

&#39;<em>Meow~~~</em>&#39; The white &#39;furball&#39; roared, translucent flames wavering in the rain. Kun Wu&#39;s eye twitched at the pathetic sound, then flicked the creature off his hand with the back of his thumb. He fetched for his fan again, while the story flowed.

&#39;<em>The other animals laughed at the tiger. Birds ridiculed him, circling him from above and swooping down to pluck delicate hairs from his tail, feathers from his magnificent wings...</em>&#39;

He slowly fanned himself, feeling his hands warm up as mana streamed out of him and into the creature, who was bulking up at a rate visible to the naked eye. Its mewling turning to a guttural rumble deep in its throat...

The white tiger lowered its head and began to growl.

While Laurent and Ching Shih continued to trade choice words with each other, Kun Wu busied himself by feeding mana into his familiar. Soon, the flames began to solidify, the creature&#39;s body no longer translucent and susceptible to the buckets of rain pouring out of the sky. A white, glowing tiger prowled at Rider&#39;s side, winding its tail around her legs at its owner&#39;s whim. The sight was almost regal...if only her Master would stop ruining the moment with his silly tale!

Could this be the fabled Presence Concealment I&#39;ve heard so much about?&quot;</em> She thought in her head, piecing information together by exclusion as the noise of a gunshot pierced her eardrums. It seemed like Kun Wu was also planning something of his own as a tiger wrapped around her body before leaving to do its master&#39;s bidding.

With the boy focusing on Laurent, it was her duty to protect him from the other two opponents.

&quot;Hold on to me tight!&quot; Ching warned as she realized she would have to take drastic evasive manuevers. She hopped around like a graceful rabbit, putting even Kun Wu&#39;s stage play to shame as she expertly dodged the bullet aimed for Kun Wu. This would only reinforce the boy&#39;s beliefs further: No matter what, he <em>had</em> to see her in a bunny suit!

Before Ching could gloat, however, she finally noticed the second bullet. This one was aimed towards her with eerie precision, as if it had accounted for her dodges. It was just inches away from her own forehead!

&quot;...!&quot; She didn&#39;t even have time to scream. She just widened her eyes in shock and instinctively raised her hand, aiming to let her arm take the bullet instead.

Indeed, it pierced through her, but it didn&#39;t leave her arm.

&quot;Urk!&quot; Ching screamed, blood dripping from her mouth as several pieces of shrapnel emerged from her arm, erupting like miniature volcanoes all around her arm.

But she didn&#39;t falter. No, this was perfect. She had given up her arm in exchange for her life. Plus, her Master was completely unharmed.

She had experienced far more humiliating things than this. A bullet wound was <strong>nothing.</strong>

&quot;Milord,&quot; Rider said assertively. &quot;ready yourself. <strong>We are heading towards the booty.</strong>&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s attack came in the form of a single grenade, missing the Rider pair by an even wider margin than intended as Ching Shih carried her human luggage across the ship to evade the sniper. The grenade shot off to god knows where...only to wind right back, as if Rider had a target painted on her back. Meanwhile, Rider evaded the first bullet with grace, then tanked the second with her arm - a mistake.

Fighting out in the open against gunmen was never a good idea. As Ching Shih recovered from the shock of being blasted by the equivalent of a Servant-grade shotgun, Kun Wu cut his iron fan through the air and pulled his familiar towards the arching grenade.

&#39;<strong>Fetch!</strong>&#39; He ordered the tiger clearly and concisely, not a single word wasted. The white beast leapt into the air, fanged maw clamping down on the grenade and swallowing it whole. It landed back on the ship front paws first, about to revert back to a neutral state, but Kun Wu had other ideas for it. He brought the fan across his body in a wide arc, and the tiger followed his lead, kicking off the ground at an almost U-turn and pouncing at its newest target in the opposite direction, a ticking bomb lodged in its throat.

A yellow raincoat, dancing in his peripheral among the dull grays of steel. He would be blind to not notice its sudden appearance.

&#39;<em>The tiger had had enough. Never in his life had he suffered being the laughing stock of the forest. He swatted the air, bared his fangs, but the birds wouldn&#39;t leave him alone...</em>&#39;

Kun Wu delivered the next chapter of his story, comparing the sniper to the little birds as if to taunt him. He responded to Rider by tightening his arm around her, signaling her that he was ready for a rough ride.

&#39;It better be a good one,&#39; he said.</span>

Is there even a message to them?&quot; Rider asked in disbelief, as if legitimately curious. Her questions would wait till later, since she wasn&#39;t looking at the prospect of getting focused down by three different opponents.

She immediately sped towards the ship&#39;s innards, avoiding Laurent&#39;s line of sight and leaving him in the dust. Now that she was covered by the ship&#39;s interior, not even Simo could see her from afar. He could see bits and pieces of her hair and fabric through the tiny ship windows, but it wasn&#39;t enough for a clear shot.

The only thing that Laurent could hear was the clack of Ching&#39;s high heels. She was clearly running about, and he had an idea on where it could be: The captain&#39;s chambers.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there, milord.&quot; Ching said without losing breath. It was truly an accomplishment to be able to talk and run at the same time. &quot;The captain&#39;s chambers are right around the corner. Speaking of...&quot; A vein popped on her head.

&quot;...You can get off now. <strong>I insist.</strong>&quot; She snarled, feeling Kun Wu rub further on Ching&#39;s soft cheeks. She flicked him on the forehead in response. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget the Malnourished</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span></span>

Arrogance. Let Rider have her moment of glory. He would be the one left standing once this was all over, just like he would stand over the rest of Olympia and Delphi once this City Grail War was over. These two didn&#39;t find him a threat, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be quarreling right before his very eyes. A trick? Doubtful. If Laurent had not kept up appearances with Assassin, they would have just as much, if not more friction than these two.

The brat simply failed to adopt a persona.

&quot;It&#39;s not counting, actually,&quot; he smiled as the two argued. &quot;It&#39;s moreso... double-checking your math before you turn your exam in.&quot;

Laurent eyed the rapidly growing tiger with the same interest that one might eye a flock of birds on the side of the road. He seemed... unimpressed by Kun Wu&#39;s performance. What kind of cold, dead heart did this man possess to not be moved by such an impressive performance!

&quot;Magecraft.&quot; He said, as if reading the word on a paper. &quot;A trivial trick. You could easily substitute it for a tool or an explosive, and little would change besides you looking like a sloth on a tree.&quot;

What the heck was a sloth?

The tiger ate Laurent&#39;s grenade, much to his irritation, and went after Gustave and Simo. That was fine. Let them realize the severity of this situation. Wait... fire? Laurent laughed for a moment. Was there something else at play here?</span>

Falling was faster than running, though he had to make sure not to fall too far, or let his speed increase too much, lest he break his legs. He was next to useless if he couldn&#39;t <em>see</em> Rider or Kun Wu. An annoying requirement of his Magecraft. Why did his forefathers make a spell with such a stupid gimmick?

Laurent moved through the ship with a quick step, his finely shined shoes clacking on the metal of the floor, making an irregular rhythm with Rider&#39;s heels. He obviously knew his way around the ship, and he knew it with easily as much confidence—and perhaps more—than Rider did.</span>

A few hallways in, and in the hallway before the captain&#39;s quarters, Laurent caught up with the two. Which one would he take out first?

He hated the Servant, but the Master took far more priority.

He adjusted his direction of falling, and his perception switched. If he caught up before they reached the corner, Laurent could change his direction and lessen the impact. He would need to be quick.

Doors, pipes, and small round windows blurred past him as the hallway became an elevator shaft as he fell towards Ching. She was not stupid, far from it, nor was she deaf. It was easy to know he was coming. <em>Falling</em> though? That, at least, was unexpected. It didn&#39;t help that all one could hear was the flapping of his suit as he fell.

He gave Kun Wu a loveslap on the cheek as he nuzzled Rider. Laurent quickly adjusted his direction of fall, falling towards both walls, floor, roof, and even Ching himself to lessen the impact. It made him feel like utter garbage, however. No man could alter their fundamental perspective of gravity so many times without wanting to puke their guts out. Even one as experienced with it as Laurent felt the burn of such an unpleasant effect.

He swallowed his vomit. He would not look like garbage in combat.

Laurent looked towards Kun Wu, and then past him, towards the other end of the hallway that the duo had just passed. 

There was very little time for Kun Wu to prepare for something like this. Gravity and the way you stood on the ground were rarely high on things you notice. It was something you just accepted. It was not just an attack on Kun Wu&#39;s life.

It was an attack on his perspective.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The first shot, missed. This woman had the grace of a dancer, after all. Or at least that’s the impression given to Simo. But the second bullet, struck as it was intended, a few centimeters off of a head-shot but this should suffice. There was a present in that bullet after all. 

A miracle was woven into that bullet, or perhaps a curse, all thanks to the powers of the artist he was summoned by. The simple explanation given by Gustave was that it would simply cause an immense amount of shrapnel upon impact. Enough to cripple a limb, and even means of magical healing could be terrible. 

Even with that, Ching pressed forwards. All the while, Kun Wu spoke a story into existence. Creating and weaving together something, which gave an impression of magecraft. The Sniper needed to get the pirate in the leg, halt her forwards movement. Another shot was lined up. 

Timing was unfortunate for Gustave’s sudden appearance, startling Simo just enough, and causing the next shot to go wide and the current clip to be empty. Ching Dipping into the inner workings of the ship. “Gustave, I missed….” These words were spoken with the utmost of disappointment, and if he were not wearing a facial covering there would most definitely be a visible smile. 

He held a hand out for the extra bullets and pocketed them. Every now and then, as if she was mocking him, a piece of garment or hair would appear then disappear in the windows. Even with the Mackenzie Rifle, he would have no chance of getting her through the walls… The Explosion earlier proved that this ship was too durable now.</span>

I could care less if she kills the man.” Simo spoke matter of factly. 

There were a few opportunities The Finn could have taken. But by the time they presented themselves and the time he realized it they were already gone. She was smart to head for a less open space. 

“I say we stay out here for the time being… too many variables to deal with in there.” Assassin spoke his opinion on what to do next, still scouring the entirety of the ship. 

That’s when the distraction left by the their opponents entered his view. It had just swallowed something. 

A magical tiger, on the prowl… no, not on the prowl. The creature was headed right for Simo and Gustave. “Gustave, company… a little gift was left.”

The Finn warned as he reloaded the heavy rifle. What better way to meet something like that than a a bullet to its face. Not just any bullet also, but a Gustave Renoir special.

Another shot rang out, looking to deal with the tiger. Aimed directly for its head.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A bullet was nothing more than a molded piece of metal, propelled forth by a controlled explosion in a hollow rod, capable of crippling or snuffing out life with a single pull of a finger. It was exactly the kind of elegant solution that Gustave liked, a simple solution for a complex problem. And Simo was the equation that could deliver such solutions with a near-perfect precision, refined by but a few months of war. A natural killer, yet not one clouded by delusions of glory or obtaining some tyrannical power over his fellow man, simple service to his nation, it was. And simple service to his master, it now is. 

He watched with muted satisfaction as the second round, one altered by his own hand, dug deep into Ching&#39;s arm and erupted in a hellish fractal of flesh, bone and lead. Every fragment from the bullet would carve a new corridor into her arm and create intersections of muscle and nerve as they too broke apart into smaller and smaller pieces, repeating the gory process ad nauseum until there was little that would distinguish her arm from a thin pipe.  In that moment, the brutal truth of Gustave&#39;s power would be made apparent. Yes there was an art to magecraft but all his actually did was to accelerate matter&#39;s inevitable march towards entropy, to throw ordered states into disarray and observe the alien landscapes they wrought, be it an artist&#39;s canvas or an opponent&#39;s mangled body. There was the true beauty of the world.

&quot;Excellent shot, Archer. We have dealt a proper penalty to our newcomers. It seems we do not have to worry about regenerative or physically-resistant capabilities. Neutralization of the hostile team should proceed normally then, with the necessary precautions, of course,&quot; Gustave lightly patted Simo&#39;s yellow-clad shoulder with fatherly approval. &quot;Do not stress a missed shot, we will have another opportunity to strike soon enough.&quot;</span>

He is still an unproven man and while he has already done right once, that means little in the end. I feel his traps may potentially catch us in the crossfire, yet that does not mean we should remain idle out here,&quot; Gustave fiddled with his pocked until he pulled out that small little box decorated in abstract patterns of concentric shapes that seemed to defy traditonal geometry and bend back on themselves.  He was about to open it until Simo drew his attention back towards a rapidly approaching familiar constructed of flame. &quot;Ah I see what you mean. Our new pupil noticed our presence and gave us a little pop quiz to handle in the meantime, how considerate, haha!&quot;

<em>Stories of brave creatures reaching out for the impossible are admirable and to be enjoyed for a moment and pondered for a few more. Yet in the end, even the mightiest beasts must bow to the inarguable rules of the world in which they live, surrender their bodies back to the earth and air from which they came and fade into legend. The Tiger before me shall be honored in such a way</em>

Locking eyes with the tiger, Gustave made not a step away from its path but rather walked towards it, the magical currents in his body concentrating in his hands and leaking into the air around him. Fire was a good choice for any aspiring mage to use to write a new reality into being yet it was an unpredictable element, forever dancing to unseen winds and dedicating itself wholly to the principle of entropy, destined to bring all closer to such a state who came in contact. As it sought to bear down on the elderly man, it would find its arms scattered to the side, expanding greatly in size and constantly swirling further away from the center, scattering from the source of its magical fuel. Swinging his arms apart, Gustave widened the beast&#39;s mouth wide open and providing a clear shot for Simo&#39;s bullet to exile the foul present inside far away</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu glared at Rider. &#39;The message is that they make a lot of money,&#39; he boasted, &#39;and something along the lines of the eight great virtues...maybe. Something like that. <em>The point is,</em>&#39; he pressed on relentlessly, &#39;Everyone loves them, and I&#39;ve got more stories to tell than the coins in your treasure chest. Take the winged tiger for example, my original plan was that depending on the time of the day-&#39;

Before he could divulge his fantasies any further, Rider flicked him hard on the forehead, turning his incessant rambling into a well-deserved whine. 

Kun Wu rubbed the reddening spot on his forehead with renewed tears. &#39;Don&#39;t leave me here, you know I can&#39;t run as fast as you. I&#39;ll need to take a look at your arm once we&#39;re at the captain&#39;s quarter.&#39; He bargained, doing the very opposite of what Rider had asked and tightening his arm around her shoulders even more. &#39;I know! How about I continue from where I left off...&#39;

A chill ran down Rider&#39;s spine as she realized what her Master was about to do with that stupid mouth of his. No...he couldn&#39;t possibly be thinking of polluting her ears with more of that winged tiger story he had clearly made up on the spot!

Too late. Kun Wu took in a huge breath, shook open his fan, and spoke.

The halls were soon filled with the his voice, recounting the epic battle between a tiger on a diet and a flock of birds. Somewhere down the line, the story stopped making sense. It seemed that Kun Wu had arrived at the finale, then decided to <em>skip</em> it and keep going. Suffice to say that Rider had never been more glad to finally see the door to the captain&#39;s quarter at the end of a long and narrow hallway. Once they were inside and safe, she would make sure to shut her Master up for good...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s cheek met flesh. That took the breath out of him, and the youth whipped his head around in surprise. He caught sight of Mr. Snazzy Suits, silently rolling and diving through the air like a drunk acrobatic. There was nothing natural about his movements. Every turn lacked grace. It felt as if the man had subjected himself to an invisible tumble dryer, yet he had successfully caught up with the Rider pair with such haphazard maneuvers. 

Kun Wu rubbed his slightly violated cheek, then looked down at his gloved hand and spotted nothing. What was the slap about?

He decided to address the wildly swinging Master.

&#39;How much did you hear?&#39; He asked, raising his hand to rub fingers together at Laurent. &#39;I usually ask for gratuity at the end of the show, but just for you, I think I&#39;ll charge per word-&#39;

Butterflies fluttered in his stomach. Kun Wu blinked, confused. Was he nervous? He held onto that suspicion for a split second, but a split second too long. The moment he realized that he had started falling <em>backwards</em> down the hallway, his hand had already slipped off Rider&#39;s shoulder. Instinctively, he grabbed onto the only thing he could reach: Rider&#39;s silky hair.

&#39;Uhhh...&#39; He seriously debated whether he should heed Rider&#39;s words and let go. No woman appreciated having their hair yanked, regardless of the excuse.</span>

The tiger pounced on the Assassin pair. Even as the old man dispersed its front legs, even as the Servant locked onto its skull and fired its magically enhanced bullets, the creature kept up its pursuit, making a beeline for its targets with just two hind legs. Was it confident? Did it still have one more trick up its sleeve? Or-

Gustave locked eyes with the creature and found not a shred of intelligence behind those orbs.

A lack of sentience led to a lack of fear. A well-sculpted ball of flames had no way of knowing defeat. As such, the creature simply pressed on with its attack, oblivious to the fact that Gustave had just wrenched its jaw wide open. 

Assassin had finally found its mark. The metal bead penetrated the grenade in a shower of shrapnel...

But perhaps, a bit too close for comfort.

BOOM!

The hull of the tiger expanded tenfold as it fought to contain the explosion, but then it broke, scattering flames and shrapnel in every direction. Gustave would no doubt be caught in the collateral, being the one who had wrestled with it head on, but at least the familiar had gone down-

Not yet, Simo would realize as the air pulsated with a concerning amount of mana. The scattered flames started pulling themselves together at an alarming rate and in no time at all, the tiger was back on the deck with brand new legs. The flames that Gustanve had swirled away didn&#39;t seem to chip away its size at all. If anything, it felt as if the creature had bulked up even more than before.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;....You&#39;re making it up on the spot, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Ching groaned as Kun Wu attempted his best to defend the artistic integrity behind his stories. She didn&#39;t believe it for a second. No one was stupid enough to write about a flying tiger of all things, let alone with such a stupid moral behind it.

She instead focused on getting the boy off, but he latched on to her even harder like a duck that had accidentally imprinted itself to a peacock.

&quot;Ugh!&quot; Ching grunted, as her Master dived his face closer to hers and hugged her like a palm tree in a childish fashion. &quot;G-Get off! I&#39;m not your mother! You can walk on your own two le-&quot;

Most fortunately, Laurent had come to crash this sickly display of attachment. He slapped Kun Wu right on the cheek, causing him much discomfort and displeasure. Who dared intrude upon his alone time with Rider?!

Of course, the former was glad that her Master&#39;s attention had been taken elsewhere. &quot;Such an ungraceful fall. No wonder you need superiority in numbers to even stand a chance.&quot; She muttered, aiming to trigger Laurent and catch his attention. This was her chance to drop Kun Wu on the floor and rid herself of that other pest in her suit.

She thought so, until she felt her silky, delicate hair get roughly grabbed from behind. Her nerves tingled as she felt her body go under shock. It reminded her of the rough treatment she would receive by the flowerboat&#39;s clients at times. It was akin to a tiger having its tail pulled.</span>

&quot;M-Milord...&quot; She gave him a sideglance, struggling to turn around due to his strong grip. Kun Wu could barely see the murderous glare in her eyes. &quot;Let go...Or else.&quot; She threatened while flashing her nails. The message was clear...

...Or was it? No, Rider hadn&#39;t raised her arm to just intimidate Kun Wu. She actually directed it towards a nearby door handle! She twisted the handle, aiming to open the room...

...And broke the door off its hinges.

Perhaps to stop Laurent from witnessing this shameful display, she had torn off the door to the captain&#39;s chambers and instead weaponized it by tossing it directly at the suited fellow. A collision was inevitable at this distance and in such a tight hall, which is what Ching was counting on. Less room for Laurent to see! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget the Malnourished</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu swore that he had just caught a glimpse of Rider&#39;s murderous face in the reflection of her nails. Either that, or the woman&#39;s icy tone had scared him so much that he had started hallucinating. Either way, Rider&#39;s message was clear: if Kun Wu dared yank on her hand any longer, she would not hesitate to dice him right then and there.

&#39;Y-yeah. Got it. I&#39;m going to uh, catch you later. Meet back up at the captain&#39;s chamber, was it?&#39; Kun Wu needn&#39;t be told twice. He promptly let go of Rider&#39;s hair, letting the now perpendicular gravity claim him as he fell through the hallway. Horizontally. If he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine himself dropping down an elevator shaft...

...which was a <em>terrible</em> idea, mind you!

Right now, his first order of business was to stop himself from freefalling. Kun Wu grabbed the first doorhandle that came within arm&#39;s reach, stopping his descent with a grunt. He was now dangling sideways, feet kicking at the smooth wall of the ship and failing to find any foothold. Not ideal, but at least it would give him ample time to figure something out.

Up ahead...or rather, up <em>above</em>, Rider seemed to be taking her anger out on Laurent quite well. However, watching her wield the huge slab of metal from his newfound perspective was quite the nerve-wracking experience. What if that door decided that sideways was down?

Kun Wu tuned out his vivid imagination with a nervous laugh, then started fanning the air with his iron fan, all the while mumbling to himself. He&#39;d need an extra pair of hands to climb back up the hallway.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s fall was not haphazard. It was free-falling with <em>style</em>. 

Such style was, of course, haphazard to the point of being extremely self-destructive, but Laurent&#39;s ego tried to justify his descent. He did not practice with Magecraft. He simply used it. Now, it was coming back to bite him.

Judging from the lack of loud noises or the sound of snapping bone, Kun Wu had managed to grab hold of something. Rope? Hair? Doubtful. Rider would not be so graceless, or so he hoped. It was becoming increasingly clear that Rider and Kun Wu were not professional. Perhaps he should&#39;ve realized it from the summoning video, or perhaps the sickeningly sweet and disgusting shows of affection.

It was more likely that his ego simply refused to accept that such a group of <em>idiots</em> had managed to make it further into the war than him and Assassin.

&quot;Are you serious? What are you, a brutish Berserker who tosses around garbage like it&#39;s a weapon?&quot; Laurent scoffed, watching as she ripped the door off its hinges. As scary as it was, Laurent instead focused on the lack of tact. This person was not noble. They were a sheep in wolf&#39;s clothing.

The door whistled towards him. Dodging was unlikely. It was too big. However, that was also its biggest weakness. As the door moved forward, it clanged and banged against the walls, floor, and pipes that made up the hall of the ship. Its current speed would not last long. Neither would Laurent if he was hit by it now, for that matter.

He lashed himself towards the far end of the hall, hoping to make more space before he was torn to shreds. No bulletproof vest would save him then. As he fell away from the wall, Laurent unearthed grenade #2 from his coat pocket, before pulling the pin and lashing the grenade to the door.

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The door lost most of its momentum and mass in the blast, turning into shrapnel that went towards Rider&#39;s side of the hallway, as well as Laurent&#39;s. Both would be hit by small pieces of metal.

Except that they didn&#39;t. All pieces of shrapnel that was supposed to hit Laurent instead disappeared, leaving a blur around Laurent&#39;s entire body in a sort of ring. Laurent smiled in satisfaction for a moment, before the remains of the door smashed into Laurent.

It was heavier than him. His Magecraft was useless in this specific scenario. Despite losing most of its speed, it was still like getting hit by a sandbag. Or perhaps a very hot, very sharp train.

Laurent&#39;s bellow of rage could be heard all throughout the ship. The orbiting bits of shrapnel fired Ching&#39;s way as well, and Laurent <em>desperately</em> hoped that a few would find their way into Kun Wu&#39;s soft and very vulnerable flesh. Maybe if he was lucky, Kun Wu would let go of whatever insignificant door handle he was attached to, and snap his neck. Pain made him vindictive, and vindication fueled malice.

&quot;Y-you...&quot; In his rage, Laurent almost reached into his pocket. At the last moment, rationality kicked in. Not here. Not yet. He would get nowhere by stamping his feet like a child. Oh, but how he longed to. Oh, how he <strong>would</strong>.

There was nothing stopping Rider from entering the captain&#39;s quarters...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Gustave had moved towards the oncoming tiger, somehow coming to a deeper understanding of what that thing really was. Simo understood too, as Gustave caused the creature to spread apart.  As if he were Moses spreading a sea of fire. 

The sniper took aim once more and fired upon the creature, and finally found out where Laurent’s first grenade had went. 

The explosion rang out, and Gustave was too far from his position to reach in time and save from shrapnel. But even more concerning, the creature only momentarily dispersed. 

The flames licked to life, joining themselves back together again. The air around its core was heavy with mana, piece by piece the tiger began to reform and bulk up. 

Without a moment to waste, Simo went invisible again. Snow melting into then rain again, as he moved to Gustave and collected his master in a bridal carry. For spectators he would just be a floating elderly man, with the occasional snowflake collecting upon his dark skin. 

Thankfully the creature was almost docile now, meaning that ridding them of this thing should be significantly easier. Still it was worthwhile to get distance between them and the familiar. 

“Gustave, you have a portal ready? I think kitty needs a bath…” He spoke with the same tone you would if you were talking with a pet. Was Simo wanting to pet the flaming beast?

It remained completely immobile as Simo slipped past it to pick up the old man, with its growth in size being the only indicator that it was still &#39;alive&#39;. Perhaps the Assassin pair didn&#39;t even need to get rid of it if all it was going to do was to stand there and look big!

&#39;<em>Grrrrr.....</em>&#39;

The tiger suddenly let out a low rumble, startling them both. Had it finally finished resting, or simply decided that it had bulked up enough? It certainly looked more animated than before, with its tail swaying back and fro and its whiskers twitching as it looked about the deck, searching for a certain someone...or something.

The beast trained its eyes at the Assassin pair, then closed the distance between them with one giant leap-

-only to soar over their heads, landing on the opposite side. Then it kept going, racing aross the deck until it was right on top of the ship&#39;s entrance, then dived right in.

The creature was making a run for it!

A series of crashing noises could be heard from the innards of the ship. Meanwhile, glimpses of the beast could see seen from the windows, charging blindly into walls and ceilings and forcing its way through the multitudes of hallways by pure trial and error. This was no intelligent beast. It almost felt as if someone had been pulling at it by an invisible string and trying to reel it in!

<em>CLANG!</em>

The tiger pawed against the wall, denting it with its sheer bulk. It had become more agile, its movements obtaining more speed as it stopped crashing randomly into obstacles and ran down the hallways with renewed purpose. Rounding one last corner, it declared its presence with a resounding roar.

It had finally caught up with its creator.</span>

It had been no small task trying to figure out which hallway connected to which from his warped perspective, all the while maintaining his connection to the tiger and pulling it through the maze with nothing but his iron fan and gut feelings. But now nothing else stood between them. The youth swung his fan upwards and directed the tiger to run up the hallway, then loosened his grip on the door handle and let gravity take him.

He started freefalling through the hallway in earnest, but the tiger was already waiting for him, barring the hallway with its sufficiently bulked up body and cushioning the youth before he had accelerated into breakneck speed. 

Kun Wu landed on the tiger&#39;s belly with knees half bent for extra safety measures. Now that he had the equivalent of a flying carpet to stand on, things were starting to look up. He straddled the tiger and hugged its neck, raising his fan to guide it towards Rider and Laurent-

Shrapnel cut into his arm, shreding his sleeves and gouging out flesh as they sent searing pain through his nerves. Kun Wu clenched his teeth, biting back a scream as even more shards blasted down on him from above. He retracted his arm in a hurry, clinging onto the tiger and huddling up behind its head to make himself a smaller target.

<em>It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts GOD DAMN IT HURTS!</em> The pain was maddening. It took everything he had not to cry and whine like the brat Rider thought he was. He tried to formulate the next part of the story in his head. Where was he at again?

&#39;The winged tiger,&#39; said Kun Wu through gritted teeth, &#39;Didn&#39;t want to be a tiger anymore.&#39;

The maw of the tiger jutting from its skull and replaced by the ridged snout of a dragon, its fur smoothing out into scales. An oriental dragon burst forth from the coccoon of the white tiger and was now slithering towards Rider and co. like a giant snake. Its speed was less than stellar. It didn&#39;t seem to be intent on running anyone down.

...It did, however, keep expanding like a balloon animal.

Clinging to the dragon&#39;s back and hiding behind its mane, Kun Wu dropped the winged tiger&#39;s tale and spun up another about some painter who accidentally breathed life into a dragon through his vivid paintings. With each verse of the story the dragon puffed up by another few inches. It would soon fill the majority of the hallway, bringing Kun Wu ever closer to his Servant while leaving Laurent little room to hide.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The great tiger of flame before Gustave maybe have been forced back by his techniques but not before it could deliver its special gift to the magus in a dazzling burst of flame and metal  that threatened to strike him down where he stood. Yet the artist had seen similar blasts before in his life, even experienced them and there was a certain failsafe he had at the ready for such events. He threw the small little box in front of him, lid opened, tumbling through the air, catching several of the grenade fragments and flame, recoiling back before vomiting right back out at the beast.  In the end, the old man&#39;s body would be spared the worst of the fiery tribulation though a few new cuts were still made on his shirt sleeves and pant legs. 

Yet even with Simo and his combined efforts, the tiger still persisted in its efforts though it seemed to have calmed down to some degree. 

&quot;Ah thanks again, Simo. A good soldier you prove to be, looking out for me like that,&quot; Gustave said to his invisible guardian as they moved quickly out of the way. He pointed over to another ledge. &quot;Noted, set me down over there and I can prime the old exit we used in the trap and just make a new hole that leads out into the ocean, though it may take a bit of time to properly form...&quot;

Of course, as they managed to get to the site of the old trap, the familiar had already started to move again, this time towards the captain&#39;s chambers.

&quot;Alright, change of plan. We need to head to the hallway before the Captain&#39;s Quarters. I believe that is where the enemy servant said they were to head to. Its time to lay down our trap and for you to make sure our business partner doesn&#39;t meet a grusome end just yet.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was satisfying to see Laurent go splat against a robust door frame. Ching hoped that she had fractured a bone or two. Enough to make the man lie down, at least. Her suspicious proved to be incorrect, as Laurent responded with another grenade out of spite.

<em>&quot;You don&#39;t know when to give up. I can&#39;t tell who&#39;s more bothersome: You or Kun Wu.&quot;</em> Rider lamented in her head, observing pieces of shrapnel eject from the grenade as they aimed to perforate anyone in the vicinity.

Thankfully, she was right next to her objective: The captain&#39;s quarters. All she needed to do was slide inside the room and voila.

The shrapnel just flew past her! A flawless-

<em>zick zack</em>

The sound. It didn&#39;t seem like shrapnel colliding with metal. No, it had hit <em>flesh.</em> Someone had fallen victim to it. The only one behind her was-

&quot;That brat!&quot; She shouted in her head, swiftly peeking out of the room just to make sure her Master was safe.

She was greeted by an oversized balloon animal. One that made a sorry impression for a dragon. Kun Wu was currently riding it, a few shards of shrapnel embedded in his arms. Judging by his pained expression and the fact that he was biting his lips while simultaneously narrating his stories, he was most likely in severe pain.

Ching felt a tinge of guilt, but that would soon be overridden by her sense of urgency. &quot;Milord, hurry up and get here! Once I get what we need, we can leave on that...dragon of yours.&quot; She was struggling to call it a dragon in the first place.

While Laurent was incapacitated, Ching returned to the captain&#39;s chambers and started ransacking the place. She had hidden the treasure in the most obvious spot ever, since the obvious spots were so obvious that no one bothered to check them! Under the bed was the best bet.</span>

&quot;Milord, catch!&quot; Ching raised her luggage and waved it around for her Master to see.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The thick of battle was far more brutal than Laurent had expected. It was far more destructive and dangerous than the bout with Berserker. Perhaps it was the lack of a Servant to buffer the gap between Laurent and his foes. More likely is that there was a Master in the picture. Kun Who made this far more irritable than it should&#39;ve been.

The middle class was infuriating. Especially Rider&#39;s brat. Jumping around with cheap words and a light show? Please, you didn&#39;t even need Magecraft for that. What a waste of energy. Laurent wondered how long it took Kun Wu to hone his craft. The businessman smiled. He would trump Rider&#39;s male concubine with nothing more than latent talent.

First, he lashed the piece of rubble to the wall, removing it from his body. His suit smoking, but it was nothing a dip in the rain outside couldn&#39;t fix. Laurent stood to face Kun Wu&#39;s dragon. He would not get away. Laurent would not rest until his ego had been avenged.

Centuries of buildup, centuries of passively chasing after a false dream had left Laurent with a Magic Crest that rivaled most master mages. However, Laurent had not had to lift a finger for this power. He simply pried it from his father&#39;s lifeless hands.

Hundreds upon hundreds of minute spells activated within Laurent&#39;s Magic Crest, checking and double checking variables, as well as subtlety making alterations to reality at large. It was like his gravity manipulation Magecraft, but on a far more condensed scale.

Once, Laurent&#39;s father stated that they had worked alongside an American organization called NASA to discern the finer points of gravity. It was through this bit of collaboration that this bit of Magecraft was founded. 

Laurent&#39;s hand sparked, and then within his palm was the true power of gravity: a black hole. A void in the world itself. Something that brought even the wisest in the world to heel.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The hall began to shudder and quake as nuts and bolts came loose from the wall, and the flames that snorted from Kun Wu&#39;s dragon began to be sucked into the gaping maw. Eventually, the dragon itself followed, plopping Kun Wu himself to the ground. However, Kun Wu could see small streams of blood billowing from his shrapnel wounds.

That hole had sucked the shrapnel out of his body, and blood was spilling out as a result. It hurt like hell, as if someone was pulling metal out of his body with rusty tongs..

To add insult to injury, Laurent dropped grenade #3 into the black hole. He really liked using those like they were going out of style.

Wait. To the ground? He wasn&#39;t going to fall to his death? Did Laurent need to focus all his power into making... that? Perhaps he simply didn&#39;t care, and thought this would be enough to kill Kun Wu. 

If that was the case, he had to run, <em>fast</em>.

As the last traces of Kun Wu&#39;s dragon disappeared and last bits of odd metal were sucked away, Laurent&#39;s singularity began to spark wildly, and Laurent&#39;s glasses cracked slightly. Nothing else was being absorbed into the garbage disposal that was Laurent&#39;s piece of Magecraft. That included the money. It made a satisfying <em>thud!</em> as it landed next to Kun Wu. 

Speaking of him...

The brat was too far away. An entire hallway? That&#39;d give him plenty of time to flee. That left one other target.

<em>That egotistical woman. I&#39;ll show her. I&#39;ll show them both what happens when they mess with Laurent MacKenzie!</em> The calmness of Laurent&#39;s thought process was betrayed by such a illogical desire.

Laurent took a few shaking steps forward, before turning to look into the captain&#39;s quarters, where Rider had been standing in order to toss the bag to her Master.</span>

In such a confined space, dodging would be hard.

The artist gave his thanks to the Finn as they continued forwards. Simo have a nod in return, as Gustave went for the plot. Then a noise was heard behind them. 

The Tiger, ran once more towards the assassin duo. Simo had readied to give this thing more holes through its fiery exterior. Yet, right before the trigger was pulled it soared over his invisible head.  Being flung across the ship, as if it were a child’s play thing. And heading right towards the captains quarters, where Laurent was presumed to have been too.

“On it… I’ll see you there… and I’ll do my best to protect that man… stay safe okay, Gustave?” Gustave would then hear as the heavy rifle clattered to the ground and Simo began his sprint for the interior of the ship.</span>

A fair greater amount of luck than he had when alive, or perhaps he was just now noticing his own natural luck. Sure there was always a little bit of luck involved with the art of sniping. But 99.99% of those shots, were pure skill. There was just something off about always seeming to make the proper turn when needed, especially in this high stress situation. 

Like so many other thoughts The Finn had while adjusting to this second life, he had to leave it for later. The scene laid out before him was clear. 

Laurent had begun creating what could only be considered a black hole. Rider was preparing to toss a briefcase towards her child master. And Kun Wu was looking worse for wares, bloodied and tattered. 

The sniper came back to visibility, the snow ceasing to leave a trail behind. He needed to act quickly. <em>’am I really going to hold that child at gun point…’</em> 

Shame came across his eyes, as the yellow hood of his rain coat came down. Showing the half covered face of the assassin. In one hand one of the automatic pistols given to Simo, with his other he reached down and plucked the child star up. The barrel of the pistol placed against Kun’s head. 

“I’m sorry about t-“ was all he could mutter before Laurent’s roar tore through the air.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">One moment he was floating, hanging onto the dragon for dear life. The next he plopped to the floor in a writhing mess, blood spurting out of the lacerations on his arm in steady streams. The gravity around him had normalized, but now a veritable black hole had opened up where Laurent stood, sucking anything and everything into its depths. To think that Laurent was letting him and Rider off easy was laughable. It seemed that the businessman had finally gotten tired of toying with his prey, and was now aiming to end them with an ace in the hole.

Kun Wu glanced behind him. The end of the hallway was only a few paces away. To think that Laurent had given Kun Wu back his gravity so he could run even faster! If he started running now, he could very well make it out of the ship before Laurent finished feeding the black hole. Then what? Take a dive into the ocean, or speed away on the ferry - if the ferryman hadn&#39;t already gone back to the port? Both were sound options. No matter how devastating the mini nuke turned out to be, it would all be meaningless if it couldn&#39;t even hit. Laurent was practically shooting himself in the foot wasting such a costly spell on him!

...Which meant that he was most definitely aiming for someone who had zero means of escape.

&#39;<em><strong>Rider.</strong></em>&#39; Kun Wu bonked himself on the head for even thinking about skedaddling on his own. If this were a stage, then he would have already failed by bailing the show halfway through and leaving his assistant behind to deal with the crowd&#39;s ire. 

The suitcase clattered next to him, full of money and valuables that Rider had scrounged behind his back. He picked it up. &#39;A professional performer should, under no circumstances, get stage fright.&#39; He lectured himself, wrapping the tattered sleeve around his arm to stem the bleeding, then started moving <em>up</em> the hallway with the suitcase in tow.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Almost as if to confirm his suspicion, Laurent had already turned his back on the youth and was now advancing towards the captain&#39;s room with a spring in his steps. Kun Wu opened his mouth to speak, and felt the familiar drain of mana that carried with each syllable of his stories. Somehow, his dragon was still still there. The black hole had devoured it whole, but it had yet to break it down.

That made things easier.

&#39;Go on, eat it, enjoy it, and I hope my Qinglong gives you indigestion for a week. <em>Clearly</em> you have never heard of the tale of the mythical fish dragon...&#39; The youth marched towards Laurent with determination in his eyes, words flowing effortlessly amidst the chaos, rich with mana and feeding into his dragon. It didn&#39;t matter if he was burning through his own resources to power up Laurent&#39;s spell. So long as his dragon was intact, then everything would work out.

Fire was a powerful element, wielded by even the most renowned mages as a weapon of destruction. Man treated fire like a menace, but not him. From the day he had learned to control the element, he had been doing everything in his power to turn it into everything that it was not.

A warm, gentle fire, reminiscent of a summer&#39;s breeze. A beast without fangs. A spectacle to entertain, and a shield to protect. 

He was going to bulk up his dragon into the perfect damage sponge.

But of course, all good things must come to an end, either by his own folly, or another man&#39;s malice. Or, in this case, an assassin with the perfect camouflage. 

The youth felt his feet leave the floor. A hand snatched him up before the fish dragon in his story even managed to get to the first gate, then he felt the cold steel of a gun pressed to his head. He struggled to look behind him, so he looked down instead and spotted the end of Simo&#39;s yellow raincoat.

&#39;Presence Concealment is cheap,&#39; he greeted his would-be killer, bemused, &#39;If you are truly sorry, then you would have faced me like a man.&#39;

&#39;Whatever Mr. Snazzy Suits paid you, I&#39;ll pay you double,&#39; he offered, kicking at the suitcase by his legs. &#39;All I ask is that you let me cross off one last thing on my bucket list before you pull the trigger. It&#39;s a simple request, I promise. Look!&#39;  He folded up his iron fan and stashed it at his waist, &#39;I&#39;m even stowing away my weapon.&#39;

&#39;Now, I&#39;m going to let myself down, pick up this suitcase, walk up to your boss, and give his skull and good rattle. You aren&#39;t even his Servant. You can totally hide with your Presence Concealment and pretend that you got here a second too late, and only managed to put me down after I slapped him silly. See? I&#39;ve got the whole script written out for you...&#39;

His coat was barely holding itself together. Kun Wu tore through the fabric with little effort and landed back on his feet.

&#39;I&#39;m going to start walking now.&#39; He announced to Simo, grabbing the suitcase to start his trek. &#39;You have my permission to shoot me anywhere else in the meantime.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu managed to grab the suitcase in time, giving Rider some much needed relief. With the baggage secured, they could focus on escaping from the ship and retreating elsewhere.

Unless someone had planned otherwise.

Laurent&#39;s rage, envy and frustrations had spilled over and reached the brink. He was done being mocked by Kun Wu and his toxic secretary. He unleashed the epitome of his studies as a magus. The prized technique that was passed down to his family for generations. A black hole.

Kun Wu was already being sucked in, his dragon devoured whole by the fearsome hole. His bleeding was accelerating and while his familiar was putting up an excellent fight, it was slowly being decomposed piece by piece. Unless he had any other tricks up his sleeve, his dragon wouldn&#39;t last long.

To Ching Shih, who had never experienced the wonders of outer space, it felt like a typhoon or a tornado. A monster from the seas that threatened to engulf ships and devour them whole. A worrisome opponent.

A pile of metal and shrapnel was headed towards Rider. Far superior than the impact of a grenade. Speaking of, the one Laurent had thrown had now detonated as a miniature explosion was now homing towards her through the force of gravity.

...She didn&#39;t feel worried in the slightest.

&quot;Oh my.&quot; Ching titled her head, her hand stroking her chin as she observed the incoming attack with the curiosity of a cat. &quot;Looks to me that I&#39;m in some deep trouble. Not to mention milord is currently having issues of his own.&quot; She laughed, lowering her arm as it placed itself around her waist.

The impact of metal shards inched closer as Ching threatened to be devoured by it completely.

&quot;...In that case, <strong>I suppose I should reply in kind?</strong>&quot;

Kun Wu felt a surge of mana around him. He looked around and noticed that the suitcase nearby was now emanating powerful traces of magical energy.</span>

<em>slash</em>

Laurent stared from a distance, watching as a thick layer of metal and shrapnel was sliced clean in half. Like a log facing a sawblade. Ching Shih was now wielding a weapon, an exquisite looking rapier surrounded by jewelry with a particularly long tip.

She delivered more slashes, slicing up more bits of shrapnel as the magus realized that the weapon was enchanted, to the point it could be considered a Mystic Code. Magecraft had been used to enhance this weapon, causing it to have the lethality of a rapier while also possessing the properties of a whip. The blade contorted in various ways with each slash, allowing Ching to strike at objects far away from her.

The shrapnel never reached her, for she simply cut it down before it could deign to do so. Her swordsmanship was masterful too. Clearly not belonging to any school or martial art, but completely self-taught, which made it a very practical style of swordsmanship.

The only threat left was the looming explosion, which had now been released by the white neutron star.

Ching simply walked towards it, smiling while doing so. 

Kun Wu&#39;s suitcase glowed even brighter.

&quot;Do you think you&#39;re the only one who can come up with particularly vile tricks such as these? I believe I pioneered this concept several centuries ago.&quot; Ching Shih bragged as she started twirling her sword around at rapid speeds. The whip&#39;s motion caused a miniature gust of air, which had been enchanted by the weapon&#39;s magical properties. The grenade&#39;s explosion was gradually dispersed by the gusts of air, causing it to dissolve and collide with the walls instead. They blew up, of course, but left Ching and her Master unharmed, while providing a safe path towards Laurent himself.

He had run out of tricks.</span>

&quot;Though, it&#39;s not like I was fully dedicated to it, unlike you. But perhaps, that is exactly why you&#39;re losing: Your line of thought is rather bland. Care for a change in career path? I could use a masseur.&quot; Ching said with a peppy smile, taking three steps forward and immediately thrusting her rapier forward. Its tip morphed into a whip as it pierced Laurent in the chest before he could even react. Brutal efficiency at its finest.

&quot;On second thought, I have the rising suspicion that you would simply stab me in the back. No hard feelings, I assume? I&#39;m merely playing at your own game, mister,&quot;

Ching Shih scratched her head for a bit.

&quot;oh, come to think of it, I have no idea <em>who you even are.</em> Oh well. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not someone worth thinking about.&quot; That last line was definitely meant to sting, as if Ching chose her words carefully just to harm Laurent from the inside.

&quot;Certainly not someone worth dirtying the <em>Madam&#39;s Rose</em> with. I&#39;d rather taste the blood of a Servant first.&quot; She insulted him further, abruptly retreating her rapier as Laurent was now bleeding from his chest injury. But how? How could have things spiraled down to this? Even as a Servant, how could she have survived the impact of his Magecraft without even breaking a sweat? Was it really all in that suitcase?

His black hole was starting to fade due to his condition, unless he attempted to maintain its stability by sacrificing more of his mana.

Ching Shih turned around and walked away, not even caring about ending Laurent&#39;s life. It was the ultimate insult towards him and she knew it well, half-expecting an attack in retaliation. Perhaps she simply enjoyed toying with men like him, who were obsessed with their own self-image.

For now, however, she focused back to her Master just to check on his condition. Unfortunately, she had been had: Assassin had snuck up on him with Presence Concealment and was dangerously close to murdering him.</span>

&quot;...Assassin.&quot; Ching frowned as she stared at the figure in the raincoat. Weaponry and outfits that weren&#39;t from her time. Was that a rifle? It didn&#39;t seem to be using powder or cannon balls.

&quot;Were I you, I would take milord up on his offer.&quot; She lightly pointed at the emasculated Kun Wu. &quot;In terms of wealth, we are quite above the common class. Surely we would benefit you more than the jester bleeding to death behind us?&quot; She said with a smile, referring to Laurent. Her proposition was simple: Let Laurent die and partner up with Kun Wu instead. A win-win for both!

&quot;...I would rather not strike down a potential business partner, if possible.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget the Malnourished</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Gustave had never been much of a fighter in a traditional sense, he had shyed away from confrontation in his childhood, content to achieve his goals in the shadows of giant temples dedicated to the wealthy anima of business that drove the city of Delphi to ever higher and dizzying heights. The job never mattered to him as much as the passion behind it and the goal in front of it. Some of that was fueled by a complex to return his family to glory but another was to ultimately to collect his own treasures distinct from the gold and artifacts that had doomed his family to bloody oblivion so long ago. No what he desired above all else were treasures of knowledge and magic, stone and paint. Let everyone else rush towards the bright and shiny wealth of the earth and perish in their greed and envy, Gustave would tend to his own garden of treasures to be shared willingly.

While the prince of material wealth and power drowned himself in his wrath and sought to break apart the pirate queen&#39;s vessel, the child of flame and spectacle found himself battered, bruised and now held hostage by the spirit of winter shrouded in synthetic yellow, separated from the wrathful pair by a hallway of steel. All caught up in their own struggles that they hardly noticed the old man of knowledge crouch down and deploy a mirror. He then just stood there and waited for the prime moment to strike.

Fortunately for him, it would take but a moment for Kun to try to weasel his way out of Simo&#39;s cold grasp and back towards the warm, gentle depths of his partner&#39;s embrace. 

&quot;Let him go, Archer. I have finished all the preparations so I will take it from here.  Thank you for your service,&quot; Gustave said, his voice soft and body still besides the hand he slowly raised up. His lips moved as if to count the seconds silently. Everyone would only find out it was not to count up but down as they fell still when Kun Wu crossed paths with the mirror, sparing it a single glimpse as Gustave snapped.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At first Kun Wu would see a flash of light bounce off the mirror and shine right into his eyes. Naturally, he would blink and turn away from the bight beam. Little hazy spots of color danced in his vision like after images, spiraling in on themselves and repeating their own shape in on themselves until it became too small to detect. The path ahead of him was clear so forward he must go. 

Yet to everyone else, it was as if he had breached the event horizon of the black hole from earlier, his body frozen in mid-run while it slowly shifted in color, darker and darker red and less and less opaque before he completely faded from the world. The man behind the mirror&#39;s expression was unchanged, his face unreadible, solid as granite. He made a simple bow and said a few parting words before fading himself into oblivion.

&quot;Thank you all again for your part to play in this skirmish, however the time for our meeting is up. You are all dismissed except for Archer. You may fire when ready, you know where for the kid must learn one more thing before he too can leave. To the rest, adieu.&quot;

Kun would keep running, yet the more he did, the more irregularitiesseemed to make themselves present. There was an intersection he had passed initially that kept coming back, eveyrthing placed the exact same, a mirror image even. Yet the more times he passed it, the more routes appeared. First it was two, then four, then eight, then 16. There was no end to the amount of times it would repeat. Every time he passed, the more he felt something trying to roll up his throat, paired with a compulsion to spit it out and a sense of imbalance in his head.</span>

Now he came to the intersection again and there was no more walls, the path now radiated out in infinite ways. Were he to look up, the lights arranged themselves in a perfect circle with the one directly overhead overlapping itself like a bad glitch. 

&quot;Running won&#39;t do you any good, though I assume you already know that. Every step forward is only a infinitesmal fraction of a millimeter. There is little you can do besides stand and witness the lesson you are to recieve,&quot; a voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere. Though if he were to look, now he could see a reflection of himself at the bounds of the radial room. Perhaps at the corner of each, a gun barrel crept into view without sound.

Laurent was... <em>losing</em>? Was he seriously being backed into the corner by some woman who threw insults around in a desperate attempt to garner a reaction? The same woman that hid her money in a ship that could be lost at sea or plundered at any opportunity? The same woman who hid money like a common rat, instead of burying it or even stashing it in off-site accounts?

Stupid woman. 

&quot;<strong>GAH! Urk...</strong>&quot; Laurent groaned in rage as he felt the rapier slide into his body, before being quickly removed. Laurent&#39;s bulletproof vest offered some resistance, but nothing beyond stopping the rapier from stabbing in one way and out the other. That was fine. One less hole for Laurent to bleed from. He would take any advantage he was given.

<em>Calm yourself, Laurent. This woman hurts you with words because it makes her feel better. You stand above her. This is a fact. At the end of this war, you will be the one holding all the cards. She will be selling out her body at some Delphian whorehouse.</em>

&quot;Of course, my lady.&quot; Laurent sneered as blood trickled through his teeth. &quot;Yet your ego must be more massive than mine if you think it matters what some ghost from the past knows about me. Everyone in Olympia knows who I am. None of them know about you.&quot;

The MacKenzie Clan&#39;s singularity faded away as Laurent stopped pooling magical energy into it. Being stabbed was offering Laurent a reality check. Raging about would not allow him to win. He could not fall further. Let Gustave take the risk while they forgot about him. 

Laurent looked over at Arche—No, Assassin, and changed spat blood at the floor. He wiped his mouth on his hand and grimaced. 

&quot;Assassin! You claim not to trust me, and that&#39;s perfectly acceptable. We both know that given the opportunity, I would shoot your Master in the back. However, ask yourself this: <strong>who is the bigger threat to your Master</strong>?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s expression slowly changed. Was this the same person that Assassin had mistrusted? Had pain made him drop the facade? He seemed far more genuine than before. Was Laurent MacKenzie... being honest?!?

&quot;I might be a monster, but she is a monster capable of overpowering both you and Gustave when your backs are turned. I had a reason to ally with you. She. Does. Not! She&#39;s just like me, except <strong>she is a Servant</strong>! If that&#39;s the case, what did she do that allowed her to be summoned? How many people do you think she stabbed in the back to gain whatever dregs of fame she&#39;s acquired?&quot;

Laurent pulled out his gun, breathing heavily. Did he actually have Simo&#39;s and Gustave&#39;s best intentions at heart? Perhaps he simply wanted Rider to lose. He eyed a pipe rattling on the wall, as well as a fire extinguisher. 

&quot;If you do decide to ally with her... Don&#39;t let that woman near Gustave! For now... I must retreat. Things are looking bad for me. I can&#39;t afford to be around should these things go south.&quot;

Laurent loaded his revolver, and shot the pipe and fire extinguisher. The container and pipe burst, filling the area near Laurent with a thick mist. A perfect getaway attempt, but he would need to be quick.

Laurent dragged himself away, holding his gut as he did so. There was no way that Assassin would ally, but if there was a chance.... 

He would need to run.

Simo held onto the collar of Kun Wu, not yet letting it go. The light eventually dimmed The boy insulted him in a trivial way. The Finn’s eyes just rolled as he loosened his grip upon the boy. 

Holstering the pistol again, and activating the safety again with a satisfying <em>click</em>. “No use facing a child like a man. Too much wasted effort. Especially for someone who still plays with stuffed animals.” He spoke and finally released the collar of the brat. 

The child star then went on to speak about paying Simo more than Laurent could ever. But he didn’t listen. He was brought back to a memory.</span>

<strong>”Shoot the gun already, Simo. Kill the deer. We need it’s meat.”</strong> A familiar voice spoke to the Finn, but as memory is everything was blurry. Incomplete. Everything except for the voice. 

Simo’s hands could only tremble, holding the rifle unsteadily. Tears began to collect in his face, he was afraid. The boy had never killed another living animal before. 

It couldn’t be too hard… just pull the trigger, just like brother said too. <strong>Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger.</strong> Those words kept playing on repeat as he did as he was told. 

Blood covered the snow, originating from where the bullet hit its mark. Everything then went black.

When vision returned, Simo was somewhere different. His view was through that of a scope of a rifle. 

It was the first time he had to shoot another man. Animals weren’t hard to shoot anymore, and the training he was given as a sniper should have made this easier. 

But it was not easy. Again he heard his older brother’s voice. Urging him on to shoot the man. This time however, it wasn’t for survival. It was for his country, national pride. National safety. 

So he did what he had too, pull the trigger. Kill the russian soldier. The face he made upon dying was forever etched into his mind. Not too unlike the animal’s blood upon the snow.</span>

<strong>Simo Hayha would never had shot a child, let alone place a gun against their head. Simo Hayha would never fire upon a civilian. Even if they were of the  enemies nation. But he, he is not Simo Hayha. This shadow is but a Demon.</strong>

The sniper’s eyes went feral. The other voice in his head spoke in a yell. Any sense of civility he may have had seemed to be gone for the time being. 

Rider would be able to see this, her and her master’s proposition falling upon deaf ears. But something intelligent remained in this state, and upon hearing his master’s orders the rifle materialized within his hands then fired into the mirror. 

Any semblance of the jig of passing Simo off as an archer had long since passed. Laurent Mackenzie caught on, calling Simo the proper class container. Those eyes were still ravenous. Something within his brain reasoned that Laurent would be the proper target to take down. 

A haze then covered the hall, Laurent making his escape.</span>

Deftly The sniper maneuvered around Ching. Whispers heard, more specifically the chant to a Noble Phantasm. 

The pirate was not safe or forgotten about, from the steam the high powered blast went right for her. Not only with the power of the Noble phantasm but also, a Gustave Renoir bullet. A potentially fatal combination of hit in the wrong spot. 

Once the noise of a gun shot within confined corridors faded. The aggressive whispering chant was heard once more from further down within the ship. 

Laurent would hear the ring of a gun shot, but then nothing. Strangely there were snowflakes, drifting ever closer. At a dizzying speed almost. Just the faintest outline of a person was seen. 

Simo had lived up to his moniker of ‘The White Death’, or would have if he cared to give away his information to those he planned to kill. Invisible Soldier dropped once more, some part of his brain keeping his mana usage under control. 

The Rifle was leveled for Laurent’s heart, Simo taking a pose similar too Dirty Harry. The trigger was then pulled as the chant completed.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As one of the most powerful businessmen in Olympia dragged himself away with a mixture of desperation and grace, he reflected on how he had gotten here.

Had he not been cautious enough? Should he have stuck to the shadows, quietly funding and gaining notoriety like saving people at his factory? He had already secured a few contracts in Delphi, as well as many more in Olympia following the destruction of certain districts during the war. Wasn&#39;t it enough?

No, not nearly enough. He needed more. He had joined this City Grail War to fuel his ambitions to grow and expand his business, and stifle the void constantly gnawing away at his soul.

Yet here he was, bleeding out like a common drunk. No longer.

Assassin had gone feral, despite Laurent&#39;s desperate cries and warnings. He had hoped that by playing into Assassin&#39;s commitment to duty, as well as being as objective and rational as a soldier, Assassin would look favorably on him, and let him disappear to nurse his wounds.

Obviously, this was not the case. Assassin, calm, quiet, and rational Assassin had turned into a beast. At least he was finally showing his hand. However, he showed it against Laurent, and not Rider.

&quot;<strong>Gustave! Get your Servant under control!</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed down the hallway as his blood chilled like winter. Assassin had suddenly appeared in a billow of snow, and his gun was locked on Laurent. &quot;Assassin. Don—&quot; Laurent began...

<strong>BANG!</strong>

The bullet released, and Laurent MacKenzie died. 

Except that wasn&#39;t the case. The bullet began to blur around Laurent&#39;s body as the man breathed heavily. He eyed the bullet&#39;s outline as it became a blur due to orbiting the businessman at such high speeds. He shook his head. &quot;You missed. You&#39;re supposed to be aiming...&quot; Laurent eyed Rider.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Businessman began to plea for his life, but it was too late. Attempting for Gustave to even reign in the demon. However the rifle was aimed, the trigger pulled, and the chant complete. 

Laurent Mackenzie was now a dead man. A body was going to hit the floor, or what ever remained of it. 

But nothing happened. The Rat was more similar to a cockroach, had Simo paid more attention to Laurent’s form of magecraft he could have seen this coming. If he had more of his rational mind acting, he could have seen this coming. 

A whirring noise was coming from Laurent, as he then sent the bullet back down the hallway. Right for Ching. And without missing a step, followed up with a quick tap on Simo’s shoulder. 

The assassin lost his footing, and entered free fall. Attempting one final stab with his bayonet towards Laurent. But it was too little too late, The CEO was well out of his reach. 

The other target was now back within his line of sight. The Pirate Queen. 

It had only been a few moments since assassin was within her sights, and now another bullet was flying towards her. As well as the servant himself, bayonet at the ready to stab her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While it was satisfying to crush a weak ant, Ching Shih had completely lost sight of her true objective: Escaping with the riches at hand, along with her Master. She did a good job at the former, but just when she was planning to assuage Assassin and turn them over to her side, their Master appeared.

And then Kun Wu was gone.

&quot;.....&quot; She remained silent for a second, not even deigning Assassin a response. During that silence, Laurent made sure to make himself at home, calling Ching all sorts of vulgar and mean spirited comments while Simo seemed lost in thought as well.

&quot;Where the-&quot; She stammered out. The riches were gathered. The pesky bugs were crushed. All that was left was a grand escapade with the brat and she would call it a job well done. But now that her Master was gone she was-

<em>Had she just been put in check?</em>

&quot;You...&quot; Ching Shih glared at Simo with eyes that were worse than that of a phoenix. &quot;Assassin! Where the hell is your Master? <em>Who</em> the hell is your Master?! Answer me right n-&quot;

Simo had already been long gone. All that was left now was his legend. The White Death itself. Something that could not be reasoned with.

All you could do was either survive it...or fail.

&quot;...!&quot; She didn&#39;t even have the time to react as Simo slinked away and fired two bullets. She was lucky that Laurent was the first target.

Even more surprising, perhaps, was the fact that he had caught it despite his injuries. Either his Magecraft was superior, or Simo was just not himself anymore. His shots were aimed to kill, but they lacked the human element. A Heroic Spirit was more than a weapon. They were more than a gun. His bullets rang hollow.

Something that Ching didn&#39;t share.

&quot;Assassin, you thorn on my side.&quot; Ching snarled, raising her sword arm as she embraced the bullets with open arms.

The sea started quivering.

&quot;Do you see me as prey to hunt? Well, let this be a lesson to you: <strong>A cornered tiger is far more threatening than a lion!</strong>&quot;</span>

A gigantic anchor rose from the waves, hovering above Laurent and Simo, but clearly headed towards the latter.

<strong>&quot;Drown in the abyss of bottomless despair. Curse of Shui Gui: Dropped Anchor!&quot;</strong>

It crashed right on top of Ching, which meant that it also collided with Simo, who had forsaken the ranged advantage in favor of close quarters combat. He felt his frame crack a bit, which was akin to getting your spine broken. Gustave would need to feed him plenty of mana batteries after this.

...If he even got the chance. Something he realized quickly enough was that he could barely move. His movements felt restrained and his limbs were feeble. Even the rifle started to feel like a burden on his arms.

Then he saw them. Hands. Grabbing at his clothes. Grabbing at his rifle. He saw their faces and recognized most of them. They were clearly apparitions, but they reminded him a lot of his previous targets. The ones he had assassinated in life.

A curse started melting his body, causing him to feel even more feeble as he struggled to break out of the anchor&#39;s chains. This Noble Phantasm was a curse. A curse designed to entrap and weaken Servants. He would be killed slowly, unlike the efficiency of a bullet.

But thankfully, he was a good shot.

&quot;Urk.&quot; Ching puked blood as the two bullets aimed at her cleaved right through her stomach and reached the other side. She held her stomach, preventing blood and mana from spilling out as she was almost forced to kneel after receiving a direct attack. A disdainful gaze followed suit.

&quot;You&#39;re beaten. Talk, or I&#39;ll make sure your Spirit Origin is fed to the fishes. Where is your Master?&quot;

The chains got tighter as the apparitions started clawing into Simo. They followed her will. Just like Simo, Ching&#39;s noble appearance had vanished. All that was left was the beastly lady that had tortured her own men in order to gain their obedience. The fearsome pirate queen who controlled her fleets through fear.

&quot;...Call them out. Now.&quot;</span>

His humanity was gone in this moment. The sole purpose of this body was to kill. A weapon which wouldn’t cease until its duty fulfilled. And now Ching was his next target. A cold lifeless stare was all she was given, no words, no facial expressions, just a stare of icy death. 

The part of him who was still Simo, sat and watched as an idle observer within his own body. Only having minor control over mana usage, and keeping the spiritual core from tearing itself apart. 

This part of the sniper knew that going in for a strike up close and personal against the pirate, was going to be futile.  But he held little control, and could only watch as his body fell into her trap. An anchor and its chain wrapped itself around his body. Pain was felt as well, shooting up his spine and through his head. 

Completely ceasing his descent, the chains tightened. A perfect Anti-Servant trap. A curse designed to sap away their mana, he could only watch as the rifle was too heavy to even move. 

Then visions began to fill the last portion of his rational mind… Many faces were there, all reaching, all those he had killed. The first man he had killed gripped the rifle tightly, and tore it from his hands.</span>

<strong>No more of this… For now I’ll be back in control. I am Simo Hayha.</strong> 

“A death, by a thousand cuts…” Simo’s eyes came back to their senses, showing his intellect once again. His rifle had long since been dissipated. The Assassin was trying to conserve as much of his mana as possible. 

He could only smile however, Ching had been shot by another one of his bullets. Both the Soldier and the Queen were facing down time. 

She was now becoming a cornered animal. Impatient for an answer from the Finn. Who would concede first, the man within the clutches of a spider’s web. Or the woman heavily bleeding out from multiple wounds. 

“I never quite… expected torture to feel this way… haunted by those I’ve killed. <strong>But Madame, this isn’t too dissimilar to my dreams.</strong> Perhaps a little more deadly…” the words struggled to exit his mouth. 

“Well… I’m not exactly afraid of being sent to the bottom… of the sea… I’d prefer to be left in a tundra… but beggars can’t be choosers…The Artist and the boy are here… but aren’t. It’s p…peculiar to talk about his…. Mage craft. I don’t think he’d hear… me anyways” The melting sensation continued to flow through his body, if it weren’t for being double summoned as an archer and assassin, he most certainly would not be able to last this long. Independent Action granting some better control over his mana storage. 

“But I’ll gladly…. Say his… name…. Gustave… Renoir…” each word was spoken with pain, the binds growing ever tighter. The wiggle room for his hands was tight, just barely able to grip the pistol within his pocket. With what little strength he could muster, Simo aimed from the hip. Unleashing the entire clip towards Ching, if he was going to die again, he’d do so without putting up a fight</span>

Not a chance. She would keep her mouth shut out of spite, for she knew how valuable words were.

Assassin gave her the same response. Unsurprising, but it was worth a shot. Soon after that followed some talk about him caring not for death. The trademark sign of a proper Heroic Spirit.

She would make him fear death.

&quot;I see.&quot; Ching replied, eyes not moving one millimeter away from Simo&#39;s body as she noticed his fidgety arm that promptly pointed a pistol at her. She reacted quickly, raising her Madam&#39;s Rose and directing a slash.

She chopped his hand <em>clean off</em>. The bullets still fired, but missed their mark completely as the dead hand remained stuck on the trigger finger.

&quot;Did you really think your dull movements would work at such a range? My Noble Phantasm reduces not only your strength, but your speed too. I might as well be playing with a ball of yarn.&quot; She commented, watching as Simo&#39;s disembodied hand turned back into Spiritron particles. So this is how Servants died.</span>

She would get a proper demonstration soon enough.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Ching said upon hearing Gustave&#39;s name. She then proceeded to stab Simo straight into the mouth, her sword emerging out of his cheeks as his jaw was now mutilated. It dangled from his head, not fully detached but not attached either. A common torture technique from her days of piracy.

&quot;Since this no longer has any use to me,&quot; She tapped his mouth. &quot;I suppose this is goodbye. Your Master might be long gone, but that doesn&#39;t bode well for you. I&#39;m a selfish woman, you see. Someone takes something from me, I take something from them right back.&quot;

Since Kun Wu was long gone, she could have easily killed Assassin and escaped with the suitcase. However, she felt compelled to stay. Perhaps it was due to his words before boarding the ship...

&quot;Besides, if that boy makes it out alive, and I know he will,&quot; She cringed as she reminded herself of his odd persistence.

&quot;<em>then how am I supposed to face him if I haven&#39;t defeated a single Servant?</em>&quot;

&quot;So, farewell, Assassin. You shall die for my own pride as a pirate.&quot; Ching declared before promptly attempting to stab his throat. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span></span>

He had wanted to scream. But held his tongue, Simo didn’t want to give her the pleasure of hearing it. 

It seemed as if The pirate queen would make the sniper fear death. Making her Noble phantasm more torturous with the assistance of her sword. 

Simo watched his hand, as it slowly curled up, then became spiritron particles. Not a single bullet struck the woman. Each shot went loose into the bowels of the ship not a single one finding a proper target. The pistol now left lying on the ground, alone. 

“You… know that… is… quit-“ The Pirate suddenly and quickly stabbed through his mouth. Cutting The Finn’s lecture on gun safety short. His jaw now hanging barely on by a thread. Showing Ching what was hidden beneath the facial covering. 

A demonic visage, the face of a terrible beast. Now brought to it’s knees. He could only manage small sounds, guttural sounds, originating from the throat. 

The next stab was aimed for his throat, and that would be it for Simo’s second life. All he could do was give her a look of contempt. The sounds of bullets ricocheting in the background, until they were heard no more.</span>

The noises became more like a growl, slowly rising in octaves. 

Mana surged, the Jaw knitting itself back together. It’s form expanding further and further, transforming the face of the man. 

Two beaming red eyes, hazy as if they were witnessed through snow. And a gaping maw, lined with pointed teeth. Was this the same assassin she was facing not moments ago? 

The mouth then shut down, clamping onto the sword and ripping it from her hands. Spitting it down the hall with a loud clatter. With her now close, too close for her own comfort, The White Death bit down onto the shoulder. Holding her tight, and close. Teeth grinding ever deeper, going to break bones, rip apart muscle and ligaments. 

She would notice his other hand fidgeting again. Reaching for something within his coat. His movements were still slowed but they were determined. 

A pin was pulled, one of Laurent’s favorite tools. And a hand was felt gracing her breasts, was he secretly a pervert?!? Then something hard and cold placed between them. Then that same hand pushed with all of its might, sending Ching away from him. 

The maw released, Simo’s face returning to how it was. Partially reconstructed but still heavily damaged, and falling apart. It would only curl up into a grin. 

The grenade began its slow ticking. Counting down the moments until it exploded. Each tick felt like a life time. Ching could only stare down in horror, two of her most prized possessions gently stored a grenade. As if they were the pillow holding Crown Jewels. 

Then it happened. 

<strong>BOOOM</strong>

A point blank explosion nuzzled into the center of her chest. Attempting to turn her mountains into craters.

Kun Wu blinked when the hallway flashed white once more. Was the light playing tricks on his eyes? Or did Simo rescind his offer and shoot? His head felt surprisingly intact, and so were his guts and limbs, barring the one that had been torn up by Laurent&#39;s ring of shrapnel. The youth shook his head and kept walking.

...and he kept walking for a long, long time. 

Eventually he had to stop himself. His head was dizzy, his throat felt tight, and the sense of nausea was steadily rising from the pit of his stomach. The hallway in front of him had forked into dozens of crisscrossing paths, and the ceiling, the walls, the <em>world</em> around him shattering into a kaleidoscope of self-repeating panels. 

Somewhere along the path, he had fallen down the rabbit hole.

When did it happen? How did it start? What did he miss? Was Assassin&#39;s gun capable of sending him into alternate dimensions? Kun Wu took another step, watching the mirror-like boundary of the world fracture and push in on itself into everlasting patterns. It was beautiful. Breathtaking. And looking at it made his head hurt like hell.

This was not the work of a killer, but an art form polished to kill.

The senile voice of a man boomed from every direction, with a chiding tone that sounded eerily similar to the old monks at the temples. The visage of an old man followed, peeking at him from every mirror-like pane. It was impossible to discern which one was real. Maybe they all were. Maybe none of them were. Kun Wu stopped walking.

He closed his eyes, and the world lit up.

...Not around him, but <em>within</em> him. The mirrored world around him rendered in the juddering, jangly tangles of silver threads, thousands and thousands and thousands of them, like a giant dome covered in tiny candles.</span>

&#39;<em>It&#39;s like the night sky</em>,&#39; he thought as he lowered himself onto the floor, folding his legs behind him in a kneeling position, fingers crossed in his lap. A monk&#39;s praying pose, except that he was not here to pray.

He was here to bargain.

&#39;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#39; He spoke to nowhere in particular. It was pointless to pinpoint the old magus&#39; real location, anyway. &#39;Though if it&#39;s a lesson you want, then I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to disappoint. I can be awfully obtuse, you see. All my old masters said so. Even Rider called me an idiot.&#39; Contrary to his words, he was grinning like a man who had just won the lottery. 

&#39;Instead of wasting your precious breath on me, why not go after someone more worthwhile? You don&#39;t seem too keen on protecting that boss of yours. So, how about it? I&#39;ll lay my hands off him, and you can thwack him in my stead. Maybe you&#39;ll even shake some more gold coins out of his pockets in the process. I won&#39;t even ask for a share!&#39;</span>

An unexpected move for sure. Gustave would have supposed a cornered man would have lashed out, begged for mercy or try to crack the foundation of his magnum opus yet Kun just sat and attempted to bargain with the old man. He couldn&#39;t help but recall how his own students had surprised him in the past with unorthodox actions and it brought a flash of humor to his stony face.

&quot;You are a bold one, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Gustave&#39;s body flashed in one of the mirrors, his face still holding that amusement. &quot;If it were not for this Grail War we find ourselves in, you would make for a worthy student, Mr. Wu. Heh, In some ways you remind me of one of my last students, a real fireball she was, always finding ways to defy convention. And she <em>always</em> had a plan up her sleeve which I assume you&#39;re trying to buy time for right now, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid you have little room to maneuver as you will soon s-&quot; He paused as he found himself submerged in Simo&#39;s memories, a lesson in the cruelty of the world. The truth of life, the necessity to take from others to survive. Yet behind the bleak messages that Gustave had coincidentally also wanted to impart on Kun, there was a subtle tug behind the soul and mind as Simo slipped within himself and unshrouded the White Devil persona that lurked underneath. He could feel a sharper yank on his body and circuits as a bullet skipped over within the bounded field and sought entry into the chamber in which the boy sat.</span>

The number of total bullets flying towards him could not be counted from his position but given that they were coming from all angles, all sides, they must have been in the hundreds. To claim the sound as disorienting would be a disservice to the synchronized cacophony that erupted without warning. 

Simo&#39;s frost-bourne tools of murder bore down on the young martial artist and threatened to whittle him down into nothing but a misshapen pile of mangled flesh and cracked bone. Each bullet carried no magical energy within but each did bear the wrathful fractal flaw etched by Gustave. To take one would sting, to take five would to let one&#39;s own blood run free and to take 25 or more would turn one into a pool of regrets. This was the test the teacher had erroneously called a lesson, one in unfairness, the sudden turn of fortune, the crucible that turned people into heroes and villains of popular myth. How would Kun handle such a brutal exam?</span>

I&#39;m only a small time performer, what do I know about magecraft? At times like this, I think it&#39;s better if I can prostrate myself before you, and ask you to reconsider.&#39; He laughed, fanning himself with his hand. 

Just listening to the old man&#39;s voice was a challenge. Kun Wu briefly wondered whether Gustave’s magic dome could be used to enhance his shows somehow. It would be the ultimate surround sound system to end all speakers!

...<em>But the accompanying nausea would probably drive away his fans</em>, he thought glumly.

He listened to Gustave reminisce about the past, talking about his prized student as if he were counting treasures. The old man probably believed that he&#39;d had Kun Wu cornered - and he would be absolutely correct. There was nothing Kun Wu could do to his capturer from within this kaleidoscopic maze. First, he would need to get out, but Gustave was too smart to take his bait. 

&#39;...Yeah, yeah. You got me. The jig is up. I&#39;m trying to buy a lot of time. Care to give me a discount?&#39; He replied cheekily, unsheathing his iron fan as he said so and placing it at his side. He then started to <em>undress</em>, taking off his outer robe and his boots until he was left in his inner garments. He started stuffing his clothes into his boots.

&#39;Your boss is going to get what&#39;s coming to him. So long as you&#39;ve only got eyes for me, that leaves one fewer problem for Rider to deal with. In the meantime, shall I entertain you with a fan favorite story of mine?&#39;

No response came. Kun Wu opened one eye to peek at the mirrored walls, only to find a million reflected Gustaves lost in his own little world. Something on the other side had stunned him. Kun Wu had no clue, but he wasn&#39;t about to look the gift horse in the mouth. If Gustave had no intention to let him out, then he would just have to do it himself.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The thousand upon thousands of silver threads teased him in his mind&#39;s vision. They were nowhere near as robust as when he had inspected Delphi&#39;s leylines, but the sheer abundance of them indicated that this magical dome had been fashioned completely out of mana. Kun Wu had never even learned the theoretic behind constructing a bounded field, let alone dismantling one. But he <em>was</em> very good at opening doors.

All he needed was to actually make one.

&#39;<em>If this were a Bagua formation, I wonder which way points to the Heart of Fire?</em>&#39; The youth pulled off his gloves, placed his bare hands on the floor, and set it ablaze.

Fire spread from his fingertips into the floor, moving at an incredible pace as it raced across each mirrored porthole, climbing up the wall, then the ceiling. It chased after everything imbued with mana, lapping it up and turning it into more fuel. In his mind&#39;s vision, the silver threads covering the walls and ceiling exploded even more brightly than Laurent&#39;s white star, then gradually dissipated as they were siphoned away by the flame.

The once pristine mirror world had weakened, giving way to the hellscape of an <strong>inferno</strong>.

Gunshot rang out next to Gustave as Assassin let loose a bullet into the magic mirror. Inside the bounded field, Kun Wu heard what was the equivalent of hundreds of bunches of firecrackers going off all at once, signaling the worst that was yet to come. If the mirrors on the wall could perfectly replicate sound, then who was to say that it couldn&#39;t replicate something a bit more tangible, and a bit more deadly?

Kun Wu snatched up his iron fan and snapped it open. Then he began to perform.

&#39;<strong>Once upon a time, there were no rivers and lakes on earth, but only the Eastern Sea, in which lived a great big dragon...</strong>&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bullets started to rain upon him. Kun Wu was pretty confident when it came to deflecting a single bullet, even more so if it came from a pathetic shot like Laurent. But five? A dozen? Two hundred? <em>Thousands</em>?

A ring of fire surrounded him, violent flames swirling up to take the shape of an oriental dragon. The youth twisted, turned, cavorted, and kicked through the first barrage of bullets. Dodging few, deflecting many, and getting pierced by even more. Blood spurted out of his wounds, joining the lacerations on his arm and dyeing his white inner garments a vivid crimson.

But that was only the beginning. The second barrage of bullets would soon arrive from the fractals further away.

...And that was when the dragon finally reared its head.

&#39;<strong>Having heard the people&#39;s pleas, the great dragon flew to the sea, scooped up water in his mouth, and flew back to the sky. If the heavenly Jade Emperor would not let it rain, then he will just take it upon himself to make it happen!</strong>&#39;

Kun Wu forced himself through the choreographs, shouting his way through his stories to help himself manage the painful blood blossoms tearing up his skin and flesh. He was retelling the story to an audience of none; he could scream as loud as he wanted, and no one would be there to judge him. 

Thanks to the seemingly endless supply of mana all around him, most of which had already been set ablaze, Kun Wu was able to skip the charging and jump straight to the shaping. The dragon coiled itself around the youth, cocooning him in a nest of hardening scales. As the creature gathered more flames, its body solidified like hardened gel. The bullets stopped cutting through its flesh and instead stayed lodged halfway through.

Meanwhile, the fire kept spreading.

How he had been granted such access despite the lack of physical contact or extensive bonding was a mystery, an unknown variable that had not been a part of his calculations and with it came trepidation. His servant&#39;s true nature hid behind a gentle but aloof facade, a monster shaped by conflict, tribulation and immense injury now unbound by convention, free to kill as it pleased. 

And that realization shook Gustave’s soul. He had suffered just as much as his servant once and become twisted by the world he lived in and the nation he served. Being within the testament to said incident only amplified the feeling and sent him spiraling within the whirlpool of emotions that once had threatened to drown him. 

As Kun performed his show for no one in the middle of a point that was nowhere, the reflections cast by the mirrored room shifted from that of Gustave lost in his own world to that of another, much larger room crowded by all manner of mundane and fantastical machines. Two men were standing by identical consoles a few meters apart.

“Gustave, before we start the final experiment, may I say a few words, to commemorate the occasion?” The taller man said, his nose hooked like an eagle’s bill, his skin youthful and stature imposing. 

“Naturally, Nathaniel. You played just as much a role in this project as I did, you deserve the moment.”</span>

To plunge into the depths of the last great mysteries of the world and ripple the fabric of reality with our own hands has been an amazing experience that I will never forget,” the assistant raised a non-existant glass towards his mentor as if giving a toast. “Thank you, Gustave. Really, you have given not only science a tremendous gift but the people of the world and those in your lab as well. Please do not try to humble yourself too much.”

“That’s too kind, Nathan. Now shall we prove the fruit of our labor together? On my mark. 3...2...1… start!” In unison, the two men pulled down on identical levers and started up some great machine and the room was set  alight with a bright blue glow and a deep mechanical hum.

“<em>But all good things must come to an end. I am sorry, professor, but if I am to make my own mark on the world, you must first fall to the wayside</em>” Nathaniel murmured as his act of betrayal became apparent with the blue glow replaced by a disconcerting strobing red one and an accelerating whine.

“Nathan, what’s going on? Do you know? Its in your subsystems!” He turned to face his student, worried and wide-eyed while his hands danced away on the console, seeking to remedy what was quickly becoming a lost cause.

“Yes but who is to say it is an accident? Like I said, thank you for all you’ve done but it is now my time to shine and I can’t have someone overshadow me. We both know this is Lemuria’s way, whether you care to admit it or not.” 

“You - you Judas!” Gustave yelled, running to try and strangle his student before the whole stage was erased in a blinding white light.</span>

Yet the mirrors kept trying to reform themselves despite all this. Seemed the old man was clinging onto the lethal piece of art around him.

Finally his eyes opened again and he saw his creation engulfed in flame and his opponent swadled by the mass of an eastern dragon. The gnaw of the bounded field was getting more noticable by the moment as Kun&#39;s technique fed on every inch of the lattice that formed the creation. He estimated that he could only sustain the bounded field for a minute at most before his reserves were depleted. Time to make the most of it.

&quot;So another familiar, eh? This time with stimulated flesh, fascinating. You have done well so far and proven yourself as a capable mage in your own right. Trying to use my mana against me is clever too but what if I told you this test of mine was always rigged?&quot; 

&quot;You see, this may seem like a prison but it is ultimately a reflection of one&#39;s own skills and experiences and for me, it is the lesson that nothing lasts forever, even our most precious treasures and creations. I learned this in the worst possible way once years ago and now I shall confer it to you.&quot;

&quot;I warn you, every bit of magecraft you invest into this sphere to break it down, the greater the collapse will be. If you don&#39;t believe me, look for yourself. You do have expertise in the visualization of mana, don&#39;t you?&quot; His reflection pointed up towards the ceiling where Kun could see the silvery threads converge on a single point and all of them were slowly beginning to rotate around it and he could tell the speed was only going to pick up from there. Little distortions in shape could be seen dancing in and out of reality near the focus.</span>

The nausea from before struck Kun again but with twice the severity from before. Now it felt like his entire digestive track was trying to invert itself and crawl up out of his throat.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Gustave&#39;s voice sounded a lot more distorted, and a lot more distant. An indicator that the bounded field was weakening. As if to corroborate his theory, the bullets stopped coming as well. It seemed that the act of duplicating them took considerable effort, something the old man could not spare at the moment.

<em>Just a little more</em>, he thought. Just a little more, and the magic dome would break down.

He chose to stay his ground, nestled within the safe cocoon of his dragon, not moving a single muscle aside from occasionally pulling his fan to gather more flames. The old man turned out to be more of a talker than he&#39;d given him credit for. This was good. This was exactly what he&#39;d wanted. The more attention he spared on Kun Wu, the less he could on the outside world. He was buying precious time. Precious time for Rider to smack Mr. Snazzy Suits in the face in his stead.

&#39;Mister,&#39; he began, &#39;I think you&#39;ve misunderstood. This fire of mine, you see...&#39; He gave his fan another flick, rousing another burst of flames from a nearby mirror and feeding it into his dragon. The mirror started mending itself instantly, but as soon as it did, a new fire kindled on its surface. 

&#39;<strong>...Once I start it, there&#39;s no way to put it out.</strong>&#39;

Kun Wu shrugged at his captor, then pointed to his bare feet.

&#39;As long as I have a physical connection to your little world, there&#39;s nothing I can do to douse the fire. Besides, I <em>really</em> don&#39;t feel like putting on some shoes right now, you know? My feet hurt like hell.&#39; He wriggled his toes, though it&#39;d be a miracle if the old man could even see it. 

&#39;So I guess I&#39;ll be staying where I am and watch the whole world burn.&#39; He said with glee. &#39;I told you, I&#39;ve always been an obtuse student.&#39;

He stopped to catch his breath. Then the world started to spin.</span>

They would immediately draw the martial artist&#39;s attention as they gave off the opposite signature as the silvery threads of mana. Where the threads were ordered clusters of energy, the blobs were inherently chaotic, always shifting their boundaries and budding off recursively into smaller droplets of entropic waste. All the while the spinning of the polar cores of the field above and below Kun now manifested across the entire area, drawing the walls closer together while the ceiling and floor seemed to race away from each other while he would be suspended in mid-air. 

To look up or down would be a serious mistake for it would only yield a glimpse into a maddening miasmic swirl of color as the scenery blended itself into meaningless patterns and the recreation fo the ship hallway crumpled in on itself. And then a voice could be heard once more over the din.

&quot;So you are then, it matters not to me. You have contributed to the collapse of my bounded field but had you ever stopped to consider if perhaps the field was meant collapse in the first place. You actually have only increased the potency of the results to come, like pushing a boulder further up a mountain only for it to come crashing down on you faster and harder. Maybe you will learn this way or perhaps not...&quot; Gustave could only shrug in indifference as his reflection danced around Kun in the broken shards of glass. 

&quot;This here is the ultimate expression of my craft for while there is much joy to be had in the creation and accumulation of ideas and items, there is nothing we can do to ultimately prevent their return to nothingness in the end. There is a twisted beauty to the art of destruction and the entropy that writes itself all over.”</span>

After that it will discard itself in spectacular fashion and bring this whole fight to a close. This is the end, Mr. Wu and I must thank you for the role you played.&quot;

The mana consuming fires only contributed further to the madness and would become inlaid into the ever-shifting cascades of ephemeral color and fractal patterns. The more the fires burned, the more the cylinder became congested with those blobs and the quicker they continued their drunken walk towards the foci.

The world around Kun was without definition, without order, without any of the laws that governed the universe. In that instant, the two masters were deep within a moment in time that was simultanously before the beginning and  the end of time where the shapeless stirred.

By attempting to break down the cage door that bound him, Kun had discovred that he had consigned himself into an even worse state. The purpose of the door was to obfuscate the true nature of the prison, a pit of raw entropy and potential, the primordial and decaying states of reality. And at the end of it all, a single white light shone like a beacon, and all would find themselves drawn into instantaneously and glacially for any sense of time or distance had been obliterated in the fires that tore down the walls. Now there was only the destination at the end to focus on.</span>

The means would matter little compared to the ends that manifested themselves. 

First the mirror began to heat up rapidly before a single crack appeared in its center before radiating outwards in a near-perfect spiral pattern with smaller swirls budding off it, small jets of flame erupting from the tiny canyons formed. Then it began to churn like a whirlpool of silica and fire. It pulled itself tight against the wall, letting out a terrible metallic screech while little motes of rust began to radiate from its contact in the metal and oddly shaped divots carved themselves into existence.

This maddening spiral then began to twist the metal frame of the hallway until it too began to spin around that center point of the mirror where a small white light began to glow and then flicker between its brilliance and that of absolute darkness, increasing in frequency until it became hard to distinguish the two states. 

Then the two fused and were no more, replaced by a deafening crack like the peal of close thunder, the protesting whine of the dilapidated ship&#39;s superstructure and a flash of impossible colors so intense,  one could see it behind closed eyelids.</span>

Gustave was likewise tossed out of his own creation and collided with the rear half of Simo impinged by Ching&#39;s anchor. 

They were followed by fast-racing cracks in the hall around them, radiating out from the center of the blast, trailed by patterns of rust and ash that twisted and turned at maddening angles and with great precision. Embers and smoke of varying color tailed last and hung in the air around all four figures, only further contributing to the bizarre atmosphere of the event. 

The only thing normal would be the consistent rainfall outside that slowly filtered its way in through the reality-shaped gap in the wall and began to disperse the alien display.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It felt as if the world had just turned topsy turvy. His stomach constricting, blood congealing, nausea and discomfort spreading through every pore on his body. The infinite realm of mirrors had weakened, and reality was now wrestling for control. Two forces that Kun Wu had no control over clashed against each other, and he felt like a leaf in the storm, about to be torn up at any second.

But he wasn&#39;t. He was still whole, and neither fantasy nor reality understood his body better than himself. Kun Wu curled up into a ball, shutting his eyes once more...

He was back in the city of Hua. 

Blindfolded, ears plugged, running through the streets in the middle of the day. Crashing into pedestrians. Crashing into lampposts. Crashing into food stalls and spilling blistering oil over his arms. Climbing up cliffsides while blindfolded. Crawling across icy lakes while blindfolded. Riding the most extreme arcade rides while blindfolded and trying his best not to puke on the passengers in his immediate vicinity.

Day after day after day after day he had trained, sweating blood and tears and suffering humiliation ten times as much as anyone at the temples. He was more diligent, more daring, and more disciplined than any other disciple. All for the grand illusion of a single, unobtainable wish...

Compared to back then, the torment he was being subjected to was <em>nothing</em>.

&#39;This is fine. I am fine.&#39; He repeated, hypnotizing himself. &#39;This is just like old times.&#39;

Except that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> like the old times. Back then, he had willing tormented himself for am empty promise; now, he was doing it for himself. And someone else.

&#39;<strong>I have a new wish now.</strong>&#39;

...

The world split open in a vortex of darkness. A thunderous crack filled the void, then out of the rift crated by the broken mirror shot out Gustave and a giant, springy tube of red and orange. Kun Wu had been ejected from the bounded field, package-wrapped nicely within his dragon and hurtling towards the wall...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">...Only to bounce harmlessly off of it. The congealed flames of the dragon was truly exquisite, being able to mimic the spongy textures of flesh. Kun Wu rolled out of the coiled dragon like a watermelon, until he was lying splat in the old hallway. Feeling solid ground beneath him, he opened his eyes to a cloud of smoke.

&#39;Hey Mr. Snazzy Suits,&#39; he coughed. &#39;I&#39;ve come to collect my dues.&#39;

He sat up, pulling the smoke with his fan and clearing it in a few broad strokes. The smoking silhouettes of two individuals revealed themselves, one standing, one kneeling and bound in chains. Kun Wu dragged his feet towards the bound man, then saw his trademark yellow raincoat.

&#39;Assassin.&#39; He acknowledge the man, then turned to the other. Rider&#39;s burnt frame entered his visage, smelling eerily similar to human flesh. But she was standing, and holding her head up high. She was doing okay.

Kun Wu turned to the last person in the hallway, and saw the old man from the mirror world.

Wrong. Wrong. <em>Wrong</em>! He must&#39;ve been hallucinating, must&#39;ve been all that blood he&#39;d lost! Kun Wu chuckled darkly to himself, and counted heads again.

<em>One, two, three...</em> His finger moved to point at himself. <em>And four.</em>

...

<em>No.</em> He shook his head. &#39;Nope.&#39; He rejected the sight in front of him. He paced around the hallway in a trance, searching for the trace of the man who had mocked and belittled his Servant. He peeked inside the captain&#39;s chamber, finding it littered in shrapnel. He stuck his head back out, looking at the cracked walls, the broken pipes, then at the floor, and spotted blood.

A trail of blood leading into the next corridor.

Kun Wu smiled. &#39;There you are.&#39; He staggered towards the blood trail, raised his fan, then started reeling his dragon back in.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thanks to the hole Gustave had tore into the ceiling, the dragon was able to escape the confines of the hallway, extending much of its body outside and avoid crushing everyone within. But now that the street performer had started guiding it back down, it became apparent just how huge the creature was. 

The hallway was barely able to contain its girth.

But Kun Wu didn&#39;t care. In fact, he had wished the dragon could&#39;ve fattened up even more. With a series of fluid motions he positioned the dragon&#39;s head at the start of the blood trail, aimed it carefully at the hallway beyond, and started to <strong>dance</strong> once more.

And what a sight it was. The once silky white cloth of his inner robes had now been reduced to stripes, exposing copious amounts of skin, upon which fractal patterns had been tattooed in dried blood. The youth looked as if he had just come out of a tub of red paint. The blood-soaked cloth spun with his every motion, melding seamlessly into his choreograph and creating the visage of a red spider lily.

Next to him, the fiery dragon poured into the hallway with a mighty roar. It rushed past Laurent&#39;s blood trail, filling the space between it and the opposite wall in an instant, then simply kept going, flowing into adjacent hallways, seeping under doors, injecting itself into every cavity within the confines of the ship. A <em>behemoth</em> born out of the combined efforts of two Masters&#39; exceptional mana stores, now grown far beyond the limitations of the ship thanks to Gustave&#39;s infinitely expanding bounded field. 

Laurent was nimble and the ship was big, but there was nowhere he could hide. Like pressurized water through pipes, torrents of fire closed in on his location from numerous passageways, racing against one another to deliver Mr. Snazzy Suits the ultimate sucker punch!

Laurent should be glad that the fire did not burn as well.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Blood splattered every hall of the ship that Laurent walked through, and even some that he had not. There was no way that the walls could be coated so red from a single person&#39;s body. It would be impossible to stalk him through the bowels of the ship.

Laurent stuck his hand into his wound with a wince of pain. As blood left his body, it fell onto the walls, the floor, and down other hallways, creating several false trails. It was a simple trick. He was spreading the liquid gold of his body thin enough to create a false sense of security for his pursuers. Doing this, even that feral Assassin would be incapable of tracking him. It&#39;d be too busy racing in circles in an attempt to track his blood.

Probably.

It was a clever trick, and one of that would buy time. The real question was one of time. Did Laurent have time to get off this ship? Using the hand not stained with blood, Laurent pulled out his phone, mashed in a number, and put it to his ear?

<span class="pre pre--inline">Yes?</span> A voice replied from the other end: Laurent&#39;s personal ferryman, somebody who was involved in the loading and unloading of materials used by MacKenzie Industries. An entirely different individual from the one used by Gustave and Kun Wu. Laurent MacKenzie did not settle for public transport.

&quot;Pick me up. Be discrete. Call me when you approach. If I don&#39;t pick up, that&#39;s fine. The notification will be enough. If the risk is heightened, you will be paid extra. Dismissed.&quot; Laurent said breathlessly as he wiped the port windows with red. He saw his warped reflection, eyes shiny and glasses cracked. 


<span class="pre pre--inline">Very well.</span> The person on the other side hung up, leaving Laurent to his thoughts.

<em>That&#39;s enough.</em> Laurent thought, stopping his bloody art. He had traversed enough of the ship and stained enough of it to leave behind a maze. He checked behind him, checking to make sure there were no footprints that could give him away. Satisfied, he ascended the stairs, heading towards the deck.</span>

Several minutes before he had met with Gustave, Laurent hit the deck of the ship with a mission. He needed to have a way out. Something, anything that would allow him to leave the ship should anything go wrong.

That was not, however, the intended purpose. That was a byproduct of Laurent&#39;s desire to get rid of his ally. Everything had to be perfect. He could not be blamed. His suit billowed in the wind. A fashionable choice, but one that also made him seem foolish and idiotic. Who wore a suit to a rainstorm? Only a rich man who cared more about appearances when compared to practicality.

Reaching the engine room, Laurent opened his duffel bag, revealing the elusive Dust Devil.

<strong>Demolition equipment.</strong> Laurent would sink the ship with Gustave and their opponents on it. They would not be capable of escaping, especially Gustave. He was old, and Assassin would be incapable of carrying him all the way back to shore.

Assuming, of course, he was injured. 

MacKenzie Industries was known for its construction equipment, and was a major power in Olympian construction and infrastructure. It had also secured a few deals with Delphi. However, its original occupation was the production of weapons and explosives. The natural combination of these two industries was <strong>demolition</strong>.

The Dust Devil could punch through concrete and steel with ease, and rumors had it that they were used to breach bank vaults.

Five high level explosives, each capable of punching through concrete and steel with ease. There were rumors that they were also used by robbers attempting to break into bank vaults. When a button was pressed, all five would beep, and then five seconds later, a massive explosion would send a building crashing into rubble.

Laurent primed them, and left the room.

Several minutes later...

&quot;I must admit. You made it here fast, despite the cane...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>His alliance with Gustave Renoir had been a lie from the beginning</strong>. This was Laurent&#39;s confession. He did not care what happened to the old man. His value would be temporary, and he was shrewd. If the two survived this City Grail War, Gustave would demand his reward: Laurent&#39;s company. Laurent had laughed, and offered 100% of it in exchange for tutoring his daughter.

The old man would not live to see morning.

Laurent stood on the deck of the Brobdingnagian, feeling the shuddering rumble of combat between Assassin and Rider. He fingered the demolition button absentmindedly. There was no reason to destroy the ship yet. Patience. 

His phone rang. Showtime. Laurent pressed the button.

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

A loud noise reverberated throughout the ship, and explosives met the reinforced might of the Brobdingnagian. The ship shuddered slightly, and then went silent.

It wasn&#39;t sinking. Laurent snorted. That woman was becoming more and more infuriating by the second. Now he looked foolish.

Suddenly, he heard a rumble, and the <em>fwoosh</em> of a large fire coming to life, like the sound of a thousand flags flapping in the wind. &quot;That kid... is he close? No... Unlikely. Even if he stopped fighting Assassin and Gustave, they would need to come to an agreement to deal with Laurent. Gustave was slow, but he was decisive. Such an alliance would take time. It had taken an entire meeting with Laurent to convince him, and even that was tentative.

Out of the nearest stairwell, a massive dragon erupted, bloated enough to fit several men within comfortably, standing side by side. Laurent swore. The brat was throwing a temper tantrum. They couldn&#39;t find the businessman, so they were going to burn the whole ship down!

Laurent&#39;s Magic Crest sparked as mana flowed through it. Laurent prepared to use his singularity. A black orb appeared in his palm, hissing and spinning. This had not worked for Kun Wu the first time, and it would not work again.</span>

All your preparations...! <strong>Mean nothing!</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed in defiance as Kun Wu&#39;s fire dragon was sucked away lint in a vacuum. The dragon began to disappear.

However, something sparked in Laurent&#39;s artificial circuits. His back turned numb. His singularity began to misfire, turning white and black as Laurent&#39;s magic circuits failed to keep up with the strenuous demands.

The businessman screamed as his nerves were burned and his magic circuits fried from overuse. His body failed to respond, twitching violently.

Was he going to die?

The singularity reversed, having become too unstable to absorb the remaining dragon. The remains of Kun Wu&#39;s dragon struck Laurent&#39;s mishmash of absorbed Magecraft and material, temporarily canceling out the beast. 

Laurent&#39;s lower body failed to respond to its nerves. His spine, the bound point of his artificial circuit, failed to stabilize. If he didn&#39;t get out of here now, he would most certainly die. Movement returned as the Magecraft ended. Partially paralyzed and without Magecraft, Laurent crawled towards the edge of the ship. Towards his way home.

This had been a mistake.</span>

This Noble Phantasm was none other than a crystallization of the opponents Ching Shih had defeated during her grand adventures, after all. Simo fit half of that bar, so he should have definitely felt the effects of the curse rotting away at his body.

Perhaps it was willpower, or maybe it was even bloodlust. An incredible urge to kill and maim. Something Ching was all too familiar with. Something she had desperately attempted to distance herself from.

Yet here she was, torturing a Servant with a glint of madness in her eyes. She was beyond excited to see his guts spill on the floor, just like the civilians she slaughtered at Macau, or her own fleet deserters who had grown too fearful of their queen.

A thirst for blood was always part of Ching Shih. It was engraved in her Spirit Origin. No matter how hard she tried to hide it, it would always remain.

So for Simo to match that thirst was something else. He bit her sword and spat it out, blood dripping from his teeth as he lunged forward with his elongated jaw. He bit on her shoulder. Hard.

Ching groaned in pain, her hands clenching at Simo&#39;s face as her nails attempted to claw his eyes out. Two beasts were at each other, a cornered wolf against a wounded tiger. Simo took advantage of the struggle to slide his hand between Ching&#39;s breasts, but the woman paid it no mind: The thirst for blood had completely erased any sign of fleshly pleasures in her mind.</span>

He gave away his advantage and returned to his prison of chains. For what purpose?

Rider stared down at her chest and realized why. A bomb was lodged between them. Her assailant formed a crude smile. It was too late to even toss it away.

Ching&#39;s tension rose as she pondered on what to do. She stared at the suitcase in the distance before the trigger erupted.

<em>BOOM</em>

A strong mana signature emerged from the blast and the suitcase. Smoke filled the ship, paired with the fires from Kun Wu&#39;s dragon. A lonely shadow accosted Assassin as he realized he wasn&#39;t the only beast in Delphi.

Ching Shih had survived, her body slouching like a ravenous animal. Her clothes were tattered and half burnt. Her chest and face were covered in scabs, burns and scars. Her back showed signs of second and third degree burns. She was alive, but looked to be a dead woman walking as the aroma of cooked flesh filled the air.</span>

This was the terror of the high seas.

Without warning, she rushed towards the suitcase and grabbed it, before running towards Simo and speeding faster than a bullet.

Animalistic growls were all that could be heard from her as she started beating Simo to death with the suitcase itself. Blood dirtied the box&#39;s immaculate edges as various assortments of jewelry and gems started to slip out of it from the damage and harsh motions.

A hit to the jaw. Another to the skull. Several concussions enough to send various Heroic Spirits to the scrapyard. All this while Simo was still chained down.

After the 69th hit, one of the chains broke. Then the rest followed. With no further restraints, the last hit sent Simo flying. Right towards his Master, who had landed next to him.

&quot;......&quot; Ching stayed silent, almost as if befuddled at why her anchor broke. She didn&#39;t utter a word as she raised her arm and waved it around. A sign she wanted to cast it again.

No luck.

She seemed dumbfounded, tilting her head a bit before her knees started shaking. She immediately knelt in response. Stumbled, even, as she started panting like she had been running laps around the ship for hours. Her body felt weak, like shapeless putty.

She wondered why. Even after taking several bombs to the face, along with bullets from a Servant, she should currently be at her peak. On a large boat that was roaming the sea? Practically her ideal territory.</span>

But to her, it felt like she had endured several battles and was now on the verge of breaking down. Her stamina was long gone.

She <em>knew</em> why this was happening. It was because she hadn&#39;t ■■■■■■ with <em>him.</em>

Her face contorted in frustration, as she realized that she couldn&#39;t even get rid of a single Servant. All because of that stupid limitation engraved on her Spirit Origin. The Throne had turned her into a laughing stock of a Servant.

Even worse, <em>he</em> was watching. 

She realized that soon enough as she turned around and saw Kun Wu standing right a few steps away from her. He had been controlling a gigantic dragon, but seemed to be no worse for wear. He had a few additional injuries, but he was standing far more proudly than her.

Judging by the way he emerged, along with how Gustave followed soon after him, it was apparent that a scuffle had occurred in whatever pocket dimension her Master had been sent to. Not only that, but the fact that Kun Wu was alive and well, along with having summoned a dragon gigantic enough to rival the Brob, showed that he had surmounted the encounter despite his childish demeanor.

The realization dawned upon her that her Master succeeded in where she had failed. He had defeated his opponent and by extension, covered her back throughout the entirety of this scuffle.

Not to mention, the entire scuffle started only because of her hiding valuables on a ship.

She felt like drowning herself.

Ching Shih, pirate queen, reduced to a burnt mess as she shuffled towards her Master. She was completely drained of mana and could not fight any longer. Thankfully, she had delivered enough damage to Simo to put him out of commission for a few days. Likewise, Gustave should probably avoid Kun Wu at all costs, lest he want to see a brat escape his chromatic prison again.</span>

It was better for the Assassin pair to retreat, and try again another day. Besides, something else caught Gustave&#39;s ears. Despite Ching not sensing it, the wise teacher had heard the ominuous sounds of explosions nearby. In a way, Rider&#39;s abilities had saved his life, since the Brob had become durable enough to resist Laurent&#39;s sabotage.

Considering that Kun Wu&#39;s dragon hadn&#39;t released any bombs, he had a few theories on who could have possibly planned to destroy the ship. Perhaps, his target was not Rider, but someone else all along...

Speaking of Rider, she finally reached her Master. Bloodied, bruised and burnt, yet bearing anger rivalling that of a thousand suns. The killing intent from her body had yet to dissipate, almost as if he was looking for something else to maul. What was it going to be? A pinch? A slap on the cheek? A shrill scolding?

No. She simply stared at him and opened her mouth, but no words came out. She was that drained. Kun Wu, however, was able to decipher her message by reading her lips. It was a familiar word, so even easier to recognize, albeit one that he had been trying to teach her not to use for ages now.

Her eyes looked tired. Her body looked like delicate glass. It felt like she was awaiting a reply. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span></span>

Claw marks stretched down the sniper’s face, from where Ching had given an attempt to free herself of it’s grip. But the beast did not let go, not until the grenade was set. A beautiful cooperation between the two halves of this cursed second life.  

If Simo could have witnessed the explosion, he would have found it wonderful. A fitting conclusion to their bout. But his eyes were covered by blood, and one of them potentially taken by the soiled nails of Ching. A guttural laugh was heard, emerging from the Finn’s throat. 

No it wasn’t laughter. This noise was a growl, a growl of victory. Even from the chains of the curse, both Simo and The White Death agreed on one thing. They were victorious, if she even survived the blast. This woman of poise, was brought down to the level of a caged tiger. Matching the animalistic ferocity that Simo succumbed too. 

The growl only grew as Ching’s heels clacked their way toward his bound body. The scent of burnt flesh filled his nostrils.</span>

<strong>This would be the end. A glorious one, for certain. The shadow will be brought low, sent to the depths of the sea. And crushed by its pressure. Are you still him, Simo Hayha? Or are you just the monster wearing his skin. A beast fit for this sort of slaughter.</strong> 

<em>’Not. Yet. Not like this. I die again when I…. No. When we say so.’</em> within himself Simo responded to the voices, holding onto his spirit core for dear life. The White Death assisting in their combined effort to keep a hold upon this new body. 

Then the woman bore down onto The Finn. Each strike hurting worse than the last. The Tiger finally having bested the Wolf. 

For certain now, both eyes were long gone. Turned into a fine jelly by the briefcase.His skull fractured, teeth freed from their sockets and spat towards her between blows, even ribs cracked and crunched. Noises that were all music to someone as sadistic as Ching. But like he had been earlier, The Pirate was deep within her own thoughts. Venting her rage at the Throne of Heroes to him.</span>

Gustave then landed next to his servant, the yellow raincoat now drenched with blood, and his face barely recognizable from what it once was.  That same victorious growl, now devolved into true laughter. 

But he could tell there was still a smile upon it. A broken, and toothless smile, but still a smile nonetheless. A weakened arm, the one with a hand missing, set itself upon Gustave’s shoulder. Trying to use it to stand. Then carry his master, only to slip back and fall down next to him once again. 

The dedicated soldier was done for, he would need days to recover from these injuries. Gustave just had to hope that it wasn’t his shooting hand that had been taken…</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu continued herding his dragon through dance-like motions until he couldn&#39;t detect its presence any longer. The familiar was now well beyond his control. The only thing it could do was to charge through the hallways blindly until it exhausted every last drop of mana within its body. Kun Wu had no idea how long the process would take. He could only hope that the dragon would burn itself out before it rounded back on him from the other side of the ship. 

Kun Wu snapped his iron fan closed and pushed it against his waist, meaning to stow it, but the fan only slashed through air. He looked down, and remembered that he had stripped himself down to his inner garments. He had stuffed his outer robes and waist sash into his boots while inside Gustave&#39;s bounded field. They should be lying somewhere around...

He turned to look, and came face to face with Rider...Or, more precisely, what was left of her.

The smell of burnt flesh entered his nostrils, as did the maimed and torched flesh, completely exposed outside of her tattered clothes. The elegant Rider was gone, replaced with a feral <em>beast</em> on the verge of death, with nothing but bloodlust fueling her core. 

Rider regarded Kun Wu with wild eyes. She opened her mouth to speak, though it looked more like a snarl in her current state. Was this Rider&#39;s true self? Had she been hiding under a mask all this time? All the teasing, bickering, cheek pinching, had they all been a front, carefully crafted to hide the bloodthirst underneath?

Just what kind of Servant did he summon?

...

<em>bonk</em>

Kun Wu knocked his fan against Rider&#39;s burnt chest. 

&#39;My boots,&#39; he said with a tired voice, &#39;should be somewhere back there. Bring them over.&#39; He motioned behind her with a jerk of his head, as if he were asking her to pass the table salt at the dinner table.

When Rider didn&#39;t respond, he bonked her a second time.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Finally reaching the edge of the boat, Laurent stopped for breath, lungs rattling with the occasional jolt of electricity shocking his body. It hurt to draw breath. It hurt to blink. It hurt to live. The businessman groaned as his singularity&#39;s counterattack stalled Kun Wu&#39;s beast.

He looked over the edge. A long way down. A very hard fall. His ferryman&#39;s boat bobbed in the water, not willing to get any closer than a few feet from the Brobdingnagian.

Swallowing, Laurent began his haphazard climb down the service ladder. The ship rocked, and each rung was slippery and wet, made worse by the constant downpour of the rain.

&quot;This was a mistake. I should&#39;ve killed that old man as soon as his back was turned.&quot; Laurent grumbled as a particularly violent wave caused the ship to bob slightly. That was enough to send Laurent tumbling into the sea below. It was lucky that he had gotten halfway down the ladder before getting knocked off—a full fall would&#39;ve knocked him unconscious. 

As it was, his body froze and became unresponsive, and Laurent began to drown. His arms barely flailing to keep the man above water. He was a businessman, and not a fisherman. In these conditions, he would not die in a few minutes, if the cold did not get him.

Seconds passed like hours, and Laurent&#39;s consciousness began to fade. Everything became dark. Despite that, all he felt was...

<strong>Disappointment</strong>.

Was this it? He died like this? Body bloated, washing up on a beach? Sinking to the depths, never to be seen again? Rage at the insulting way that he was going out gave him one last twitch of the limb, one that let his fingers breach the surface for but a few seconds.

Someone grabbed hold, and pulled the man into a boat.</span>

Sir?&quot; Laurent&#39;s eyes fluttered unresponsively his ferryman waved his hands over him. When Laurent didn&#39;t react, the man began performing typical manuevers for drown victims. He did it with the desparation of a man with his life on the line. In a way, that was correct. Laurent did pay his salary.

Eventually, Laurent spat out a bit of seawater.

&quot;Go.&quot; He croaked.

&quot;But sir, you should see a doctor! If you di—&quot;

&quot;<strong>GO! WHAT DO I PAY YOU FOR?</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed as he rolled over. After a few seconds, Laurent&#39;s voice became calmer, but still ragged. &quot;We should be long gone by the time the others get above deck. I am in no condition to remain here. Thank you for your concern, but we must depart.&quot;

The man turned to the outboard motor, and gunned it. Laurent MacKenzie was formally disengaging from the fight. Gustave and Assassin were on their own.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider felt the fan poke at her chest, scraping at her burns and scars while she stared at her Master. She was dumbfounded, enough to widen her eyes despite her tiredness. Kun Wu had just been kidnapped to a pocket dimension, delivered bullet wounds and now he was witnessing a side to his Servant that he had always suspected, yet never seen for himself.

And he was treating her so casually, no different than how she looked before.

No man had ever endured the sight of the beast. Not even her husband could endure her grotesque appearance when consumed by bloodlust. Her own children couldn&#39;t recognize her in that state.

To Kun Wu, she was still just Rider.

&quot;....&quot; Ching remained silent for a bit, looking down as she walked away and picked up Kun Wu&#39;s boots without warning. Her sudden obedience would have surprised him, were he not already exhausted. He just wanted to get home. Perhaps even have a relaxing bubble bath.

Rider returned, handing over his boots before wordlessly delivering a pinch to his cheek. He could barely feel it, since he felt like falling asleep on the ship. He could, however, sense a faint warmth from it.

Without any further words, the two departed from the Brob, taking a ferry and returning to the docks. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Hawaii117#8992">@Hawaii</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span></span>
