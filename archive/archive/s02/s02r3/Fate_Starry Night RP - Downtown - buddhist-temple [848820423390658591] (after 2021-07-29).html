This structure sees only one visitor due to the long and winding path to travel on. Jampo makes it his mission to travel to this temple each day after his work to pray and cleanse his soul, and to bite back the rising tide of Ashura that the work day brings out. Due to the secluded nature, Jampo has decided that this might serve as the best possible candidate for a Master&#39;s Workshop, and has decided to remain here for the rest of the coming War between Delphi and Olympia.</div>

The glow of candles is all that illuminates Jampo&#39;s figure, the interior of his Temple having long fallen to darkness. He was almost afraid of how comfortable he was becoming within its confines, adapting to the morphing of his home away from home. 

&quot;It seems as if our battle with Lancer has gone unnoticed. Your worries of being hunted should be appeased for now, Saber.&quot; 

He didn&#39;t expect a response from Brandin. On the contrary, he expected that Brandin didn&#39;t acknowledge a word Jampo has said in the days following their clash with Guan Yu and his Master. There was an unmistakable rift between them, each having bent the confines of the others&#39; threshold. Jampo found it difficult to come to terms with how easy death came for someone like Brandin; then again, Lancer&#39;s Master reminded him of how easy death was a certainty in his own presence. 

&quot;It appears we might not be bothered too heavily through this War after all. From what I&#39;ve heard, Olympia&#39;s Lancer has drawn the ire of the Church. I can only imagine that takes eyes off of your...our endeavors.&quot;</span>

He was used to solitude...comfort with oneself was a fraction of the sacred tenants to stave off desire, but even so, this was different. It wasn&#39;t solitude...more like exile. He was a stranger in a sacred place...it was something that no longer belonged to him. It was Saber&#39;s. Lord Brandin&#39;s domain. 

<em>...Is this to be our fate, Brandin? Or perhaps this is what you wanted. Am I a partner, or a means to an end? I feel I know the answer all too clearly...but as long as I hold my path clear, your darkness can&#39;t overtake me. My Servant...your mere title precedes how this will end. My path will linger while yours will end. The most I can do is be sure to keep your darkness welled here, within these walls and within this heart of mine. I vow, Saber...you will not kill a soul.</em> 

This has been his mantra for the last few days. His holy vows to keep him binded to his mission. To steel his heart. He would not become one of these Knights. Most Masters must have it easy...they were only fighting one battle. Jampo was fighting two.</span>

The confrontation with Lancer had been far less than ideal. A terrible opponent to be matched up with first along with the nativity of his Master had left a bad taste in Saber’s mouth.

The one upside being that the Master of Lancer, Laura, had called a ceasefire. Saber was certain that at the end of the war, it would be Lancer who would be on the back foot.

Jampo had secluded himself from Saber, his suspicion of his servant much more prevalent then when they first met. Not that those feelings would matter in the end, as long as Dolorous Gard was completed. That was all that mattered.

The first gate was already starting to come along. A massive wood, stone, and steel frame taking shape in the entranceway to the Well. Hopefully, there wouldn’t be any more curious investigators any time soon. The Copper Knights had only recently replenished their numbers.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Just outside the steps of the Buddhist temple stood a curious philosopher. Nietzsche had his “Delphi Integrity Bureau” notepad in his hands quickly jotting down his thoughts on the temples appearance 

Nietzsche had found the temple when rummaging through Rinne’s papers. He remembered Rinne informing him that the church had spread its grip across the entirety of the world. To see a Buddhist temple in Olympia, the same place they would inevitably visit, was rather exciting to say the least. Nietzsche wanted to take any chance he could to learn about eastern culture first hand. Unfortunately for Rinne, Nietzsche had failed to mention that he was going to check out enemy territory, even if it was for educational purposes it was a situation bound to worry the detective. 

Nietzsche cleared his throat preparing himself to walk to the door and hopefully engage in intellectual conversation. Caster did sense a servant nearby however, this did not worry him. Nietzsche was not overly confident in his combat abilities, instead he just wanted to educate himself by any means necessary. He knew not every servant would be as open to discussion as him, but the thought that they might be was too tempting for the philosopher.

He then walked up to the front door and knocked on it rather loudly. He didn&#39;t want to enter the temple unannounced, after all he didn&#39;t know if it would be disrespectful for a non Buddhist person to do so. 

“Hello, is anyone here!? I&#39;ve come here to study your practices” Nietzsche called out as his fist banged on the door rather loudly.

Jampo&#39;s head rises. The call from outside echoes through their halls, beckoning the monk to answer. A new visitor...

&quot;...&quot;

The man looks down to his palms, noting the thin white line across the tips from catching the blade of Guan Yu. Such a war was dangerous, but what might be more so was that he was slowly enjoying that fight...he put his all into his attack on Lancer. How long before he would be forced to go further...

&quot;...<strong>Begone!</strong>&quot; 

Jampo&#39;s voice carries, quaking his chest and even shaking a few of the stained glass panes. There was a kindness in that voice, and it was precisely what Jampo hoped to avoid...a soul that was far too pure for what lied inside this temple. 

&quot;<strong>Come any closer...take one step inside...and you&#39;ll be killed! Do you hear me?!

Rinne&#39;s servant was nowhere to be found. She&#39;d scoured every place that came to the top of her head. The office, the mall. She&#39;d found no trace of Nietzche. A sinking feeling had built up in her stomach during her search. What could be have gotten himself into? 

Now, the investigator sat in her office, pondering her next move. Finding people was a large part of her job description, so this couldn&#39;t be too hard... Right? Rinne mentally checked through everything they&#39;d talked about, writing down anything of note as she went. By the end of it, she didn&#39;t like the picture that was forming on the paper. 

Nietzche was easily excited by the prospect of talking to new people, especially the other masters involved in the war. He wanted to explore this new society. Another point he seemed heavily invested in was the presence of religion. Caster had expressed quite a large interest in the Church. That was about all she&#39;d come up with.

Delphi didn&#39;t have very much religious presence. Olympia, however...

With a few clicks on her computer, Rinne brought up a map of Olympia and all of its religious sites. None of them particularly jumped out at her. With a sigh, Rinne closed the map and held her head in her hands. Did she really have to go searching all these places for her Servant? He could just be out for lunch...

Rinne&#39;s detective instincts told her that wasn&#39;t the case. Before she knew it, she found herself in Olympia. She visited several religious establishments. A church, a shrine. Nothing. While her ventures proved unproductive, they were fun. She fund herself wasting time at each location, observing the people within. She was in no rush.

It&#39;d be a while before she arrived at the right place... Hopefully Nietzche didn&#39;t get himself in <em>that much</em> trouble before she found him.

Caster shook his head in confusion and disappointment. He had expected open arms, he thought the Buddhist people were rather accepting and kind. However, the voice yelling at him carried a small scent of fear. Perhaps Nietzsche needed to make it known that he had only good intentions.

“Please I mean no harm!” The philosopher yelled back trying to make his voice heard through the large wooden doors. “I was under the impression that you are a peaceful people. I am a philosopher who has long been studying human culture. My wish is only to have a conversation and learn about your faith. Entertain my one request and I shall leave”

How long had it been since humanity had use for philosophers? 

&quot;You have picked up a dangerous hobby, then.&quot; Jampo says, indulging, albeit slightly, in the man&#39;s request for some sort of communication. 

&quot;Surely you must know what is happening in this City, philosopher. Now might be the worst time to indulge in such curiosities...I tell you not out of hostility. I speak to you as a monk: Leave this temple. I do not wish to see you killed over something as foolish as your curiosity!&quot; 

It was better this way. Jampo wipes the sweat from his brow, his breath hoarse and strained while clutching at the robes draped across his chest. Cold dread pumps and inflates it, the man hoping to keep others from trapping themselves on his path. This was his march alone...to drag others in would be unbridled selfishness...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“On the contrary dear monk, times of struggle are when wisdom and knowledge are in full blossom, war is a test of morals and intellect.” Nietzsche leaned his face closer to the door as he spoke, trying to make himself more audible without yelling.

“If you are not hostile, then you are afraid, yes? What reason do you, a peaceful man, have to turn away a curious ear.” The philosopher pulled at his mustache wondering what could have a monk so afraid of human interaction. Perhaps this person was not a monk at all. An imposter maybe? A participant in the war… possibly… why else would they be so cautious of the war in their own haven. 

“May I suggest a middle ground then. I will not enter, but please come out and speak with me. Then I can accomplish my goal without impeding your property.” Nietzsche’s curiosity was stroked by Jampo’s urgency. If anything the monk&#39;s words had made Caster want to stick around even more.

The philosopher only pressed the issue further, egging Jampo for just the slightest of conversation, pressing further and further on the monk&#39;s nerves. It made the man forget the very reason he was staving off the advances, his lips curling into a snarl. 

This was a VERY annoying man...

&quot;Ehhh...you really don&#39;t know how to take a hint. I&#39;ve said twice you would die, and yet you&#39;re still asking for a conversation? You seem very brash, determined...or stupid. Death awaits you and you simply bow your head demanding to speak with it, that&#39;s very odd, you know.&quot; 

He rubs his temples, looking back to the entrance. His face sags as he thinks of what might happen should he inch the door inward, what sort of hell might befall the victim...

&quot;...<strong>sigh</strong> Very well. But, outside! I&#39;m a monk but that doesn&#39;t mean my time isn&#39;t valuable, so this is a brief talk. Brief! You know what that means, don&#39;t you?! Or do I have to spell that out in minute detail as well??&quot;</span>

Jampo clasps a hand across his mouth, gritting his teeth at his lack of resolve as he inches through the temple door, shutting it quickly behind him as he regards...

&quot;...I seem to have mistaken you for a normal person,&quot; Jampo says, looking quite confused by his guest&#39;s chosen attire and...rather luxuriant facial hair. 

Jampo absently pats at his own bald head, a forlorn look before he shakes against such thoughts. Now was not the time to remember the locks of his youth. 

&quot;I am here, speak and I&#39;ll answer, philosopher.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche couldn’t help but show a large grin under his mustache as Jampo shared his frustrations. It seemed like Nietzsche had done well to get on the monk’s nerves, enough to make him act rash. If anything, the monk didn’t seem very monk-like at all.

Caster watched with a keen eye as the temple door cracked open. His eyes grew wide as he saw Jampo step out into the light. Not only did he sound angry for a monk he also didn’t look the part. Aside from the orange robes, Jampo looked like he could take on almost anyone in a boxing ring. Was solitude and resolve a means to train one’s body?

“And I seem to have mistaken you for an ordinary monk,” The philosopher retorted with a small laugh. “You do seem rather eager for me to leave. I came here with only a few questions in mind. However, since then, I have only grown more curious.”

It seemed that this day was not going Jampo’s way. His attempts to scare Nietzsche away with threats of death had only further piqued his curiosity. “Well, I wish to know why you are so afraid. Is the purpose of faith not to calm those weary of death? I stand here with a thirst for knowledge. I do not fear my demise, it is inevitable, and I shall welcome it with open arms…. So why is a monk like yourself so afraid at this very moment.”

Nietzsche wasted no time before trying to dissect Jampo’s character. If his hunch about Jampo were correct, he would need to investigate further before asking about the monk’s values.

&quot;Ah...you mean the colors. Well, forgive me, but I don&#39;t see you as an authority on fashion either, my guest. Orange just happens to be my favorite color.&quot; 

Jampo huffs indignantly before setting himself down on the ground. He gestures to the space before him, motioning for him to follow suit. If he was going to be so persistent regarding his questions, he might as well take this time to properly associate himself with the values Jampo holds. 

&quot;Ahhh, so you <em>can</em> pick up on cues. There may be hope for you yet.&quot; Jampo crosses his arms, bowing his head as he considers how to respond. What sort of response would satisfy him? He seemed precisely like the kind of man that would buckle down and simply ask &#39;why?&#39; It sounded familiar...</span>

Caster followed alongside Jampo finding a spot on the ground just beside him. He shifted around finding a comfortable position. Sitting on the floor wasn&#39;t very natural to the older man.

&quot;You are afraid of me losing my life, but you are not afraid of losing your own? If this war is so awful you must be at risk too.&quot; Nietzsche let off a deep breath as he tried to poke holes in the monk&#39;s words. Jampo seemed overly concerned about collateral damage. 

&quot;You call this war &#39;business&#39; dear monk. You do not fear your death but rather mine. Almost as if my death would plague your conscience. Tell me are you a part of this supposed war?&quot;

What kind of philosophy of intrigue of ideals was this man searching for. It wasn&#39;t his faith this man was interested in; it was clearly just himself. 

&quot;I&#39;ve already told you, philosopher, I cannot tell you to protect my own interests. You have a habit of prying into dangerous information!&quot; He takes a deep breath, once more flooding his frenzied mind by his mantra. Calm...calm...

&quot;Any death I would consider a grave sin. And I already have a soul stained by sin, philosopher. Too much. I fear for yours just as I fear for everyone&#39;s, for while a noble goal is a coveted one, if it&#39;s stained with blood...&quot; 

He trails off, his mind wandering and reflecting on the amount of &quot;Sin&quot; that&#39;s traveled in his wake. The aftermath, when he awakens from the slumber, is a scene that cant even be envisioned by human nightmare. And it was all his own creation.
 
&quot;Philosopher, I find it curious I&#39;ve been the only one to answer anything. Tell me...you seem more inquisitive than cautious or aware of your surroundings...you wouldn&#39;t happen to be a participant, would you?&quot;</span>

&quot;Caster?! Caster! What are you doing?&quot;

Rinne finally appeared, having greatly enjoyed her time exploring Olympia. Now she was rapidly approaching her Servant, a stormy look on her usually calm face. &quot;You- You can&#39;t just go wandering off trying to talk to random people. Nevermind Olympia of all places. You know we&#39;re supposed to be in a war, right?&quot; 

The investigator let it all slip right in front of Jampo, having hardly noticed the monk in her haste to give Nietzche a thorough chewing out. Eventually, she noticed the old man.

&quot;Ah, sorry, sir. I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt.&quot; She apologized and gave a deep bow. Unlike many her age, she had great respect for her elders. &quot;I hope my friend and I haven&#39;t caused you too much trouble.&quot; 

The purple-haired woman proceeded to kneel, setting herself to the same height as the other two. As she awaited a response, she took a moment to study Jampo. He was clearly a monk at this temple. Despite his obvious age, he held great strength within his body. She could see that much.</span>

They were lingering near the entrance, but Saber was unsure of their intentions. Saber felt his Master near the entrance as well and a heavy lump grew in the pit of his stomach. The memory of the encounter with Lancer still fresh in his mind.

Saber turned away from his work for the moment.

Had he not suspected Jampo of being a participant he would&#39;ve treated the monk the same. Nietzsche was a curious soul who would go to great lengths to quench his thirst for knowledge.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell you thi-&quot; before Nietzsche could finish his reply he was interrupted by a woman screaming &#39;caster&#39; over and over again. It seemed his master had tracked him down. With her arrival not only did Rinne reveal Nietzsche&#39;s class but the fact that they were from Delphi as well. 

The philosopher let out a deep sigh and stood up from his kneeled position looking down at Jampo. &quot;Well I suppose the jig is up. To be honest I have no intentions of fighting. Should my hunch be right.&quot; With a second sigh Caster closed his notebook and put back in his coat pocket 

&quot;Well master I&#39;m afraid you may have just revealed us to the enemy…&quot; Nietzsche then turned to Jampo staring straight into his eyes. &quot;Well are you our enemy?&quot;

Even with the revelation that this was another Servant, Jampo&#39;s goal was never to spring an attack, it was merely to scare them away. 

&quot;...If you don&#39;t give me a reason to be, Caster.&quot; 

The words hang between all three, the tranquil sounds of nature surrounding them and acting as an orchestra to the methodical, ritualistic movement of the monk&#39;s hands. They flow before his chest, the vast expanse of muscle acting as a canvas, presenting the Mudra while maintaining a rhythmic breathing. In...out...in...out...

Dust swirls around the monk as he brings his palms together before it billows forth, catching both Servant and Master in a haze. Should they brave themselves to look through it, a shallow glow peeks through as the dust dissipates, bathing both in the light.</span>

&quot;Our talk has been one of philosophy, but you&#39;ve failed to heed the truth I hold dearest, Caster. So, now that your master is here, I will say it once more...&quot; 

Jampo&#39;s silhouette paints a level of power that might be confused for that of a Servant, a thin, pale blue glow surrounding his chiseled body. All the while, Jampo merely meditates, hanging his head low and keeping his palms together in a form of prayer. 

&quot;<strong>Leave, or you will be killed. For the sake of my own goal, I will not hesitate if you stand in my way. I care for your lives, but if you continue on this path, you will find yourselves with no way back. Master of Caster, pull your Servant back. Now.</strong>&quot; 

The message was clear. This was definitely not an ordinary monk. What kind of monsters were participating in this war?</span>

Despite being old and sworn to solitude, Jampo’s physical prowess was rather impressive. Nietzsche couldn’t help but wonder how a mortal man could reach such physical capabilities. 

Caster turned to his master to see what she was thinking. Jampo physically outclassed her, and they had yet to see his servant. Furthermore, Nietzsche didn’t care for combat; to him, the best-case scenario seemed to accept defeat and run away.

“I don’t feel like making enemies today… hopefully, we can converse once more, monk.” Nietzsche spoke with a loud sigh, his chest lowering in disappointment. The servant then began to walk down the temple steps looking back to his master. “Well, Master, we should be off.”
