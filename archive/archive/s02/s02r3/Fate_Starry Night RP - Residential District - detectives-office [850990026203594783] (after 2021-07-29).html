            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A detective office repurposed into the workspace of a certain intelligence magnate. The dim lighting procured by the ancient incandescent bulbs coupled with the damp and dusty air serves to give an oldish feel to the office. The floor is in disarray: Various folders, binders and files are scattered everywhere and crumbled sheets of paper serve to punctuate every corner. Various shelves and drawers are placed across the walls, each so full of portfolios and papers that they threaten to collapse if touched the wrong way. A cork board stands on top of an expensive-looking desk, littered with photographs of famous faces and various places that are interconnected with red thread that looped on thumbtacks. Looking at the chaos and lack of organisation, one would have thought that this place has been stolen or ransacked by burglars.</div>

<em>DING-DING</em>

Or not. The office computer buzzed with a notification, of an e-mail that had just arrived. An e-mail that would make this Lazy Sunday significantly less lazy.

<strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Suspicious happenings in Delphi
<strong>FROM:</strong> Anonymous User &quot;J. Y.&quot;
<em>At exactly 8pm tonight, a delivery containing illegal objects will be made at the Kingsmade Hotel. That is, of course, being done to bolster Mr. Kingsmade&#39;s chances of winning in the Holy Grail War. If I were you, I&#39;d certainly strike then, so as to claim a decisive advantage over them. If you climb up the fire escape, you might even be able to steal valuable intel from them!</em>

Such an odd email, but one that held promising information in it. After all, having this information practically guaranteed an ambush. But that was the catch, wasn&#39;t it? This information was so absolutely perfect. <em>Too perfect</em>. Was this a lie? A trap? A power play? What, exactly, would they do with it?

The king dodged to the side, out of harm&#39;s way.

&quot;This is getting tricky...&quot; Muttered the young girl with uncertainty as she made her move.

The game of chess was nearing its end, both players having been left with few pieces to play with. Although she had an advantage in terms of pieces, her enemy had far better placement of his. He attacked her king relentlessly with each of his moves, always finding a way to stay out of trouble while applying pressure. They were like precision strikes, aiming to control the enemy king&#39;s movements. Every of his offensives was deliberate, made with the intent of cornering his target and restrain its movements to the fullest.

They played countless times ever since they had been acquainted, each game ending with her victory. Where she took her wins as a means to flaunt her intellect, the man in front of her took his losses as  learning opportunities. He would observe the final board for lengths of time, looking for the one move that had sealed his fate, taking care not to repeat the same mistake twice.

He got consistently better with each game. A trick that was effective against him would be rendered completely useless the second time it was used. He was slowly but surely sealing all her means to victory, finding counters to her previous strategies. It felt like a snake creeping on her with agonising slowness, gently flexing his muscles to deprive her of oxygen.

And now, he had never been closer to victory. The outcome was unpredictable, either one of them could win at this point. And if this didn&#39;t please Guan Yu, the concerned expression on his Master&#39;s face was sure to bring him joy. She was running out of options quickly, even started to panic when as she felt her perfect record starting to crumble. 

All he needed was a few turns and he would undoubtedly—

The Master&#39;s phone rang once, indicating that she had received a message. She got up from the floor and fetched her phone, opening the notification it had received.

An e-mail from an anonymous source. Something to do with a shady deal in an hotel from the mercantile district.

&quot;D&#233;j&#224; vu...&quot; Mumbled Laura, narrowing her eyes to better read the e-mail&#39;s contents.

Speaking from experience, shady messages like these lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations. She walked across her office, sitting next to her Servant to show him the contents of her phone. It was probably wiser to leave it be and continue their game of chess, but it could at least serve as a distraction to stop his momentum and hopefully lead him to make an error.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Asked Laura to her Servant, shifting his focus from the game to the message. &quot;Seems <em>awfully familiar</em>, doesn&#39;t it.&quot;</span>

Should one become predictable with their movements or strategies, then they leave themselves open for an counterattack. The more predictable, the greater the blow that will be struck. 

His Master picked up on that rather quickly it seemed. It was rather impressive just how many tricks she had in that mind of hers, but it was clear that it won&#39;t last forever. Even now she is making her moves with uncertainty while Guan Yu returned in kind with absolute confidence. For each step she took towards victory, Guan Yu was right there to halt her advances. Each match had him closing the gap more and more. One slip up. One blunder was all that was needed for him to gain the momentum needed to seize victory!

The tension was broken by the sounds of Laura&#39;s phone going off. It certainly wasn&#39;t as common of a occurrence to simply push aside. 

His attention was drifted towards the screen, and away from the match, to read the message she received. 

It was intel about an opposing enemy Master. A Mr. Kingsmade. Though, something felt off to him about the email itself.

He appeared tranquil. Like a lifelike statue. &quot;You would reveal information about your opponent to another in hopes of getting them to take advantage of it. This is done in hopes of them taking care of each other. All without your intervention nor spent resources. After all, why do the work when you know another could do it for you?&quot; 

His mind seemed to wander as he reread the message over and over again before the telltale sound of a chess piece clacking on the board broke the silence. &quot;There are multiple things to take from this one message, Miss Hess. One, the person who sent this knew of your involvement in this Grail War. Otherwise, they would have sent it to someone else. Two, they knew of what kind of servant you had as well seeing how they contacted you out of the rest. This &#39;J.Y&#39; person who sent this is a dangerous opponent. One with the brains and intel that could match yours. We should attempt to keep tabs on them if possible.&quot;

&quot;Lastly, and this is the worst part of all, if what they are saying is true and if we do decide not to go for safety&#39;s sake then we will be allowing a competitor of ours to gain an advantage over us uncontested. &#39;J.Y&#39; placed us in <em>check</em>.&quot; Guan Yu said with a smirk on his face as he turned his gaze towards his Master. Just what will this Master of his do in a situation like this? &quot;What&#39;s our plan of action, Miss Hess?&quot;

Rationally, there would be no way for their anonymous sender to know that she was a Master. They had been careful with each encounter thus far, making sure not to leak any incriminating details to the outside world about their nature as participants in the City Grail War. To an outsider, it would look as if Laura had employed a Servant bodyguard for protection, which wasn&#39;t uncommon ever since the news of the CGW went public. 

But if the e-mail wasn&#39;t a simple bluff and this anonymous person knew about her involvement, he may well be acquainted with Delphi&#39;s main office. This was the only plausible way for him to know. She was ashamed to admit it, but this &#39;J. Y&#39; guy had a good information network. Good enough that he had tabs on <em>her</em> of all persons, despite the fact that she was careful not to let anything escape about her identity as a Master.

It was irritating, to say the least.

&quot;This guy does smell like trouble.&quot; Agreed Laura, her gaze fixed on the contents of the e-mail. Despite her bangs covering half of her face, you could tell at a glance that she was <em>annoyed</em>. &quot;Suffice to tell that he&#39;s baiting us into going there. Mentioning nonchalantly that he knows about our participation in the war, offering to help us by giving intel on this Kingsmade guy which is supposedly also participating—he&#39;s showing off his great knowledge to us. And if he truly knows about me, I&#39;d argue that he&#39;s doing that on purpose to irritate me.&quot;

The Master got up from the floor, gently flexing her hands. The twitching had stopped, the pain was almost unperceivable. The pain in her head had also dulled, making it possible to ignore completely. It seemed that as soon as her body had recovered, she was going to throw it into another perilous situation. Self-preservation be damned, she thought. There was no way that she could turn a blind eye to such a cocky declaration.

&quot;We&#39;ll bite,&quot; Laura answered, clenching her hands with resolve. &quot;If he <em>dares</em> put us in check, we&#39;ll retaliate. Manyfold.&quot;

Both her and Lancer would sink their teeth into the lure, crushing it to pieces with brutal and unpredictable force. Looking at the clock on the wall, it showed showed 3:40pm. The e-mail wanted them to act at eight? <em>They&#39;d be there at five.</em></span>

The enemy&#39;s intelligence network was far greater than he initially thought. Though, he didn&#39;t expect that they could stay hidden for the entirety of this Grail war. Sooner or later, someone is bound to act and strike first against them. 

If that happens, then they better hope to be prepared for the two of them to charge right back at them with full force! 

The proud declaration of action from his Master earned a grin from Guan Yu as he stood up with her. Their little game can wait. For they have business to attend to for the time being. 

&quot;Well said, Miss Hess! We will show them that should think twice before provoking us like this! You would make a fine Warlord yet at this rate!&quot; Guan Yu ended with a laugh and a heavy pat on Laura&#39;s shoulders. Perhaps a bit <em>too</em> heavy. Can&#39;t blame the guy though. It was quite exciting to dive headfirst into action once more! 

However, the main event will have to wait. Now, it&#39;s time for some reconnaissance. To go in blindly would be foolish of them, after all.
