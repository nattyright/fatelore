The Kingsmade Hotel was not hard to find. It was a towering building, one of the tallest in the city. It was elegant, a smooth marble exterior decorated by crests of golds, large windows providing one-of-a-kind views across the rest of Delphi. Even the entrance was extravagant, a giant courtyard full of rare flora and carved statues leading up to the door to the building proper.

This courtyard is where the pair would find themselves. This was the important part - how best for them to tackle this situation? How best to leverage the element of surprise they had on their side?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Big and extravagant. Those were the two words that came to mind when gazing upon the Kingsmade Hotel, cornerstone of the Kingsmade business and symbol of their power and immense wealth.

Businesses in Delphi targeted efficiency and performance first and foremost, calibrating every detail of their trade to better satisfy the needs of their customer. This often translated in gloomy and unremarkable, yet sturdy buildings punctuating the mercantile district. After all, spending wealth on appearances was nothing short of foolish. Why waste money on useless decorations when said money could be used to make <em>even more money</em>? 

But here was the <em>Kingsmade Hotel</em>, a building that took this fundamental law of entrepreneurship and bent it over. Standing at an obnoxiously tall height, sporting golden motives on every square inch of its walls, shining brightly amongst the gloomy structures like a firefly in a swarm of mosquitoes—It was the very definition of <em>vanity</em>. Attempting to guess the amount of money that went into it was enough to give a headache to any business owner. 

Nevertheless, this is where their &#39;battle&#39; would take place.

The young girl tug the strap of her messenger bag, taking in a vast breath. It seemed like even the air smelled expensive, touched with the faint smell of cologne and freshly watered soil. A complete 180 from Delphi&#39;s usually foul and stuffy air. Little details like these served to deepen the impression that this place was completely separated from its environment.

&quot;Well. This is where we split,&quot; Said Laura, patting her Servant&#39;s back. A few ants emerged from the spot where her hand touched, climbing rapidly through his clothes to arrive at his shoulders. &quot;We should still have a few hours before the transaction, but this is not a reason to let your guard down. This J. Y. guy might&#39;ve lied about the exact hour. But even so, everything should go smoothly as long as we stick to our plan.&quot;

&quot;Have fun.&quot; Said the young Master, waving her hand goodbye as she turned to leave the courtyard.</span>

He wasn&#39;t sure how one would even compete with it. It might not even be possible to do so. The mere existence of it was a bold declaration to try though. 

The Kingsmade Hotel spared no expense when it came to anything about it. Whatever was the most lavish and opulent choice, it was chosen in the design of the place. And this was just examining it from the outside. No doubt it was taken to another degree on the inside. The sheer magnificence of it made it a perfect location for a Workshop. Who else in their right mind would choose such a place after all?

&quot;It really does look like it was made by Kings for Kings. Mr. Kingsmade sure does live up to their name, huh?&quot; Guan Yu spoke while they looked up at the immense showing of wealth before them. 

In direct contrast to his Master&#39;s outfit, Guan Yu came to this place wearing a deep emerald green two-piece suit with subtle gold accents decorating it to make it pop out. His hair was cleanly swept back. To complete the look, he had dark shades on. He looked like he meant business and fitted in with the rest of the elite around them. Though he still stood out since not many has the body of a warrior on them.

All of this was in accordance to the plan of having him blend in so Laura could perform reconnaissance with the knowledge that her servant was nearby in case things turned south. His Master&#39;s account took a blow for this plan. All the more reason they have for them to succeed though!

He knew that his Master was a cunning person and escaped from the jaws of death once already, but he still showed concern for her. 

&quot;You needn&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t drop my guard so idly.&quot; And with that, he took a deep breath to compose himself before he walked forward into the Kingsmade Hotel. It would&#39;ve be suspicious if he just simply stood outside. He needed to make a move.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And so, the two went their separate ways. Laura Hess retreating to oversee the operation from a safe distance, Guan Yu forging on as he spearheaded this undercover infiltration, joined by a gang of hardy insects. Not the worst plan they could have come up with, all things considered. Now all they had to do was pull it off.

Actually getting into the building was easy. There was little in the way of security features protecting the outside, save for a pair of golems. However, they posed little threat to Lancer. They were more akin to bouncers of a club than true warriors, designed to keep away the rabble, not take down true threat. Not that they would be a problem, seeing as they made no move to stop him. They merely stood there, still as stone, watching him with vigilant eyes as he stepped through the rotating door inside.

The inside of the Kingsmade hotel matched the outside, the interior equally as lavish at the exterior. Red velvet carpets covered the floor of the lobby, contrasted sharply by the pure white walls, completely devoid of the slightest discolouration. No sooner than he stepped inside was Guan Yu greeted by a bowing bellhop, who stepped aside the moment he recognised this esteemed customer had no bags to carry. 

It did appear slightly smaller than one might expect, but that was all part of the facade. After all, this was just the lobby. There was a hurdle they&#39;d have to overcome to reach the hotel proper.

After a brief walk to the front desk, the Servant would be met by a well-dressed gentleman, beaming from ear to ear. Why, it looked like if his smile were to falter for even a second, his entire skull would fall apart! It was welcoming and eerie all at once, and those feelings would only intensify when he began to speak.

<strong>&quot;Why, hello there! Allow me to extend you a formal welcome to the Kingsmade Hotel! Tell me, esteemed guest, do you have a reservation, or are you looking to book a stay with us for tonight?&quot;</strong></span>

Though, this is a hotel rather than a castle so that&#39;s to be expected.&quot;</em> Guan Yu thought to himself as he glanced over at the golems as he made his way inside. 

This was exciting! To be undercover while his Master gathered information was quite a new and pleasant experience! Maybe he could try and bargain with the Throne to make him into an Assassin next time... 

The inside was just as stunning and amazing as the outside was. Despite having the attire to fit in, he still felt completely out of place. To think that out of all things he encountered this has ended up making him feel uneasy. Getting his ass kicked by the Black Knight made him feel more comfortable than this place did.

<em>&quot;Just stay calm and follow the plan. Miss Hess is watching after all.&quot;</em> He cleared his throat and straightened his tie before he made it to the front desk. He kept observing the area around him, almost as if he were checking to see if everything was up to standards or not.

The gentleman at the front office gave him an unpleasant feeling with how much emotion he showed on his face. It didn&#39;t feel natural and yet it was. Must be a real pleasure to work here...

&quot;I&#39;m here on command of my Master. They wished for me to find a suitable place to stay to enjoy this City Grail War in comfort. You can imagine their mood once we heard that more than a week of the event has already passed. Tell me. What services does this Hotel offer? I assume it doesn&#39;t just come with a bed, correct?&quot; Guan Yu spoke with as professional of a voice as he could muster. He drew from the memories of formal meetings and occasions that required him to present himself in a regal way. 

Who would have thought that practicing for those ceremonies ended up paying off in more ways than one!

<em>&quot;I&#39;m here on command of my Master. They wished for me to find a suitable place to stay to enjoy this City Grail War in comfort...&quot;</em>

Perfect. There was no need to hide the fact that he was a Servant, since they were pretty common. Because of that, it wasn&#39;t unthinkable for a Servant to rent a room for his Master. Presenting the objective as spectating the CGW was also a good choice, seeing how the pompous clientele that frequented this high-class establishment would be akin to enjoying such spectacle from their luxurious rooms.

The infiltration was going well. It was time for her to do her part.

Sitting on a bench not far from the hotel, Laura relaxed her body. She could feel the flow of Od that ran across her veins, a steady stream of magical energy that came out of her circuits. She forcefully changed the flow of energy, redirecting to where it came from and giving it <em>meaning</em>.

Her magical energy evaporated in the air, coming into contact with the bugs around her. The lice running through the people&#39;s hair, the mosquitoes sneakily sucking their blood. The maggots clinging onto the overflowing garbage bags, the gnats that fed on the foods fallen to the ground. From the spiders that nested in the dark alleyways to the worms shifting in the soil deep beneath her feet, her will inserted itself into their simple arthropod brains. The individuals numbered in the tens—<em>hundreds</em> of thousands and augmented more and more as her range extended, their consciousness dissolving into a single entity that obeyed her and her only.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sound of the crowd grew faint as her consciousness slipped. The further she reached for control, the deeper her mind sank. She was becoming linked to the hive-mind—no. She was <em>becoming</em> the hive-mind itself. Her thoughts and the bugs&#39; were becoming one. Individuality didn&#39;t have a place when her consciousness was stretched so thin and across so many individuals. The line between controller and puppets blurred. They were slowly becoming like her, or she was becoming like them. Her limbs were getting replaced by the arachnids, tilting her head made the swarm collectively tilt their heads in unison instead. She was falling, deeper and deeper into the abyss. If this was to go on, she would no longer—

<em>An anchor.</em>

The remnants of her mind sprung into action, forming one cohesive thought that overruled every other—<em>The need for an anchor.</em> A hook that would remind her of her true goal. Something to prevent her consciousness from leaving, a way to keep her individuality from disappearing into the swarm.

She scanned through the vision of her solders, desperately reaching for the light that would deliver her from the darkness.

A sight stood out from the others. 

One of a man clad in an emerald green suit that was a bit too small for him, wearing unfashionable sunglasses that somehow complemented his style. His confident smile radiated as he talked with the person in front of him, oozing unrestrained confidence and sincerity. 

<em>That&#39;s right</em>, Laura thought. <em>This man is my Servant. I am a Master.</em>

<em>I am Laura Hess. I am a Master participating in this City Grail War. My Servant is Lancer, Guan Yu. I am Laura Hess. I am a Master. I am Laura Hess. I am Laura Hess. I—</em>

She gasped for air as her consciousness returned, as if waking up from a nightmare that saw her drowning. 

That was close. <em>Way too close.</em>

She hadn&#39;t made such an idiotic mistake ever since her infant days. What could have caused such a big oversight? Had she not recovered completely from their battle with Saber?

Whatever the reason was, now was not the time to contemplate. She shrank her range, limiting it to the hotel and its direct surroundings. A wave of relief washed upon her as she felt her senses coming back. The window that peered on Guan Yu stood at the center of her mind&#39;s eye, a vital reminder to stay alert and not to sink in her own power.

She pushed, focusing on the hotel first and foremost. As it turned out, not even gold plated hotels could escape the arthropod occupation. Fruit flies hanging around the trashcans outside, ticks brought by the pets of the guests, cockroaches hiding out of sight in the kitchens—no matter how clean and sterile the environment is, insects always found a way to lodge themselves in it. 

More insects came from the outside to reinforce their ranks, sneakily flying and crawling through the gaps in the construction and the open windows. It would take time to get them inside without raising suspicion, but time wasn&#39;t an issue at this point. 

Using her small soldiers, she scanned the building and started drawing a mental plan of its interior while the flying bugs glided through the halls as they searched for their target—the man known as <em>Alexander Kingsmade.</em></span>

There was a pause as the man reached down underneath the counter, pulling out a binder. The sleek black exterior was opened, revealing pages upon pages of information. The types of rooms, the amenities offered, the services available, all that and more. It was like an encyclopedia dedicated wholly to a single building!

Her mind spread across the pests and vermin that inhabited her surroundings, influence waxing and waning until it found the middle ground. The widest sphere of control, while retaining her sense of self. 

A dangerous middle ground, but a necessary one.

The veritable army of insects began their search for Alexander Kingsmade. It was evident early on, however, that if they sought Alexander, they would find him on the utmost floor - his penthouse. That fact proved a blessing and a curse - they knew where to reach him, but how to reach him? That was another matter entirely.

While security appeared lax, that was only to the naked eye. However, Laura soon found that more and more Bounded Fields awaited her at every turn, invisible barriers that blocked the bug&#39;s path at every corner. An immensely effective form of defence, but one that was not intrusive or threatening. Practically invisible, felt, but not seen.

It was evident that whoever Alexander was, he was no slacker. It would take some getting creative to circumvent these protections.</span>

If he didn&#39;t already before, now he is beginning to wonder if these employees would lose their positions at a moment&#39;s notice should they even be a step out of line. Should it be true, then it would be a sad existence. Guan Yu closed his eyes and silently offers his condolences to the employee in front of him.

His attention was brought back when he heard the binder be pulled out. It was quite the impressive book of information. The list of amenities, rooms, and even various activities one could do during their stay was awe-inspiring! The look of genuine amazement was easy to notice even with his shades. A good sign towards acquiring a new guest!

Guan Yu flipped through the book to give both him and his Master enough time to read through the pages, though he only hoped that this information could help her out in some way, shape, or form. 

&quot;How about security? How safe would my Master feel inside of these walls? I seen the golems out in front, but what about the rest? Would I need to stay on my guard? I assume security measures are taken to a greater level given the current event.&quot; Guan Yu spoke softly while he flipped through the pages. As he did, he kept an eye out for anything that could be of use for his Master. Perhaps there was something from the binder or answers for his questions that could be helpful.

Above that, however, there&#39;s our bounded fields! Magecraft barriers that prevent any kind of entry to where individuals aren&#39;t welcome. There&#39;s not a single entryway in the building that isn&#39;t guarded by a bounded field! Save the entrance, of course, haha!&quot;</strong>

Guan Yu got the sense from the man&#39;s tone that there was, in fact, a Bounded Field upon the entrance. One that fortunately, was not currently active.

<strong>&quot;And, of course, we have a security team consisting of the sharpest minds in all of Delphi. Great fighters, even a few servants, if you&#39;d believe it! Not to mention Mr Kingsmade and his Archer, who will surely step up if the need arises.&quot;</strong>

As Guan Yu flipped through the booklet, he would take note of a particularly odd feature of the building - a &quot;spa&quot;. Far from the traditional beauty care experience, however, it appeared more akin to a biological laboratory, rejuvenating and regrowing skin, hair, the whole nine yards! Peculiar, for certain, though for their particular operation, perhaps it might be useful...

My, how embarassing! For the highly prestigious Kingsmade hotel, rumored to be the best amongst the best, to contain such insightly insects inside its premise. Outrageous!

But where someone would see an insect randomly walking on the papery surface, Guan Yu would see something else. The ant <em>purposefully</em> circled the floors closest to the penthouse, <em>closest to Alexander Kingsmade&#39;s quarters.</em> No doubt a message from his Master.</span>

It was impressive to say the least. Mr. Kingsmade even managed to summon an Archer Class Servant. One that was known to be able to operate away from their Master. They could very well spend the entirety of the Grail War in comfort without ever needing to leave.

It was genius. Guan Yu couldn&#39;t help but feel admiration towards their opponent. They had built themselves for the long run. If they are receiving objects that could cement a deeper hold for them then they cannot fail, lest they become too dug in to be dealt with.

They have to succeed.

&quot;What could you tell me about this &#39;spa&#39; you have here? That does catch my eye and I woul-?&quot; Guan Yu stopped mid-sentence once he saw the ant circling around the floors closest to the penthouse. She&#39;s onto something. 

He backed off from the binder once he noticed the ant as if to avoid touching now that it has bugs. &quot;I hope the other rooms aren&#39;t crawling around with bugs so openly like this. My Master has a thing about bugs after all.&quot; Said Guan Yu as he fixed his tie. The grip on securing the guest is loosening!

That plastic smile that the employee wore suddenly shattered, their face becoming the picture of confusion as they looked down at the ant. There was a flash across their eyes, a glimmer of overwhelming panic underneath it all. However, they soon regained composure, grabbing an empty coffee mug that was sitting on the counter, and using it to scoop up the lone ant.

<strong>&quot;A-allow me to offer my most sincere apologies!

He would definitely have to commend his Master for such quick thinking later on!

&quot;Hmm...I suppose they could be persuaded if a discount were to be given for one of the rooms near the highest floor.&quot; Guan Yu thought about it for some time before he gave his answer. He held up his finger to signify that wasn&#39;t the only condition that must be met. &quot;But! Before any of that can happen, I would like to see this spa you speak of. I will hold you to your word that the room would be spotless, but I must inspect this area personally. Could you accompany me and lead the way, please?&quot; 

It seemed that fate has smiled on the poor receptionist! All they would need to do is give a tour and they scored a guest out of a tricky situation. An admirable feat indeed!

As anticipated, Mr Kingsmade was a careful man. Him setting numerous layers of security in his hotel was to be expected from the very start. After all, one of the biggest concerns of a hotel in the events of a CGW was the safety of its guests. Furthermore, if he chose to stay in his hotel while participating in the war, it meant that he was confident in its safety. On top of his ivory tower, protected by countless Boundary Fields, numerous fighters and even Servants—an unconventional Master that didn&#39;t flinch in the face of adversity, that didn&#39;t bother to conceal his presence from his enemies, that almost <em>dared</em> his fellow Masters to go after him thanks to his imposing and extravagant base of operations.

All things considered, he was quite the overwhelming fella. Definitely one of the Masters she had hoped not to go against—and yet here she was, helplessly watching as her Servant walked deeper and deeper into enemy territory. Just the anticipation of a direct fight was enough to make her stomach sting.

It seemed like the insects that tried getting in had been blocked by numerous Boundary Fields, leaving them unable to join their comrades that were inside the hotel to begin with. That was proving to be a <em>huge problem</em>, seeing how most of Laura&#39;s tactics relied on her bugs. Not to mention that if a fight broke out, Guan Yu would effectively be alone in enemy territory, completely stripped of his Master&#39;s support...

She focused on her swarm, bringing the bugs closer to the exterior windows and entreeways, <em>eagerly waiting for the opportunity to arise</em>. 

At the same moment, she separated a few groups from the bulk of her army. Termites, cockroaches and all sorts of ants deviated from the main ranks and crawled towards a <em>specific location</em> further from the Kingsmade hotel. That place proved to be quite a stretch from her position, but then again—time was not an issue. 

Their task, if properly carried out, could prove to be a huge asset for them.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While their first plan had quickly fell apart, a second one had swiftly formed to replace it. Such was the nature of their operation, one where they needed to have their wits about them if they were to succeed. Luckily, one could scarcely find a pair of sharper wits in the Grail War than Laura and Guan Yu. The bugs were evidently planning something, something big. However, that would take time to do. Time that more recon could be performed, that they could prepare themselves for what came next.

<strong>&quot;Oh, yes, yes! Our top rooms are very exclusive, very expensive, but I can absolutely pull a few strings on your behalf, my friend!&quot;</strong> The receptionist nodded furiously, stepping out from behind their desk. <strong>&quot;And you wanted to inspect our spa? Of course! I&#39;m sure once you have thoroughly inspected it, you will find that it meets, nay, SURPASSES whatever expectations you may have!&quot;</strong>

With that, the employee led Lancer up the stairs behind the reception, that ascended up to the main hall of the hotel. A grand room, full of couches and tables and chairs and the like, where many of the guests were enjoying themselves, taking it easy, conversing with one another and enjoying an early dinner. They wouldn&#39;t linger there long, however, as Guan Yu was immediately taken aside, through a set of double doors that led up a spiralling staircase.

Fourteen floors of stairs later, the peppy enthusiasm of the well-dressed worker was notably dulled, his grin smothered by his gasps for breath. But a little thing like exhaustion would not stop him! So, he staggered along, into the hallway, down to the far end of the corridor, and to a set of double doors, labelled with a golden plaque that read &quot;Rejuvenation Centre&quot;.

<strong>&quot;H... H... H-here it is! It&#39;s... a truly.... MARVELLOUS suite... I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll meet your... WEW... one moment, if you would... ha...&quot;</strong>

Not only did they secure a potential deal towards a room, Guan Yu managed to gain access to the hotel. It was restricted to one section of the hotel, but they got inside. The intel they could gather from this might end up being vital to their little operation. 

Guan Yu followed behind the receptionist. The more he saw of the hotel, the more he had to remind himself of why he was even there for to begin with. One could easily lose oneself here if they weren&#39;t careful.

The stairs were a non-issue to a servant like him! Or so he thought. Fourteen floors they climbed together. He was out of breath by the end of it. It was hard for him to ignore the sweat forming on his body, especially in this stuffy suit! At least he was more well-off than the receptionist which he had great concern for at this point. Even with his words of reassurance, he thought that he would collapse at any moment if they took another step.

&quot;Take your time. I&#39;m sure those stairs would set ablaze the calves of anybody that dared to brave them!&quot; Said Guan Yu as he caught his own breath. The difference between man and servant was definitely clear here. He gave the receptionist a pat on the back to show that, to him at least, he was doing a great job so far. 

 &quot;I am positive I could handle the opening of a few doors. Take your rest. I won&#39;t speak a word of it to anyone.&quot; With a quick touch-up of his suit, Guan Yu made his way towards the door to open them and see what lays beyond them.

Once he was gone from sight, the receptionist would slump against the wall, head in hands, gasping for breath. Maybe he would take his break early today...

As Lancer stepped inside the &quot;spa&quot;, he was immediately struck by how sickly-sweet the air was. It was dense with perfumes, an artificial deluge of tropical scents absolutely smothering all other smells. That sense of artificially extended to the rest of the room, every surface of polished metal, with little in the way of colour to provide texture or interest to the room. Very clean and very sterile.

As he stepped through the door, he would hear a woman clearing her throat. Turning slightly to the right, he would see the culprit, a disinterested-looking girl lounging at a counter near the side.

<strong>&quot;Oh, a customer. Let me guess, you&#39;re here to get your body flushed, right?&quot;</strong>

The room wasn&#39;t what he expected to see when he entered. It was too plain in comparison to the rest of what he saw. Was he even in the same building at this point? 

A single sound was made that snapped him out of his stunned state. It was someone clearing their throat. A quick scan around him showed that it was another employee attempting to catch his attention. Though the question had him stunned just as quickly.

&quot;Flushed? I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t understand.&quot; Guan Yu said with a puzzled look on his face. What could she mean by flushed? The only thought that came to his mind was the image of him being flushed away. Did they even make toilets that huge? What purpose did that serve? Why would someone want that? 

A million questions swarmed his mind, threatening to lead him further into utter confusion. Luckily, he managed to get out the reason why he was here for before he forgot. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m just here to inspect this spa for my Master!&quot;

Upon closer inspection, they appeared to be much younger than the man at the front desk. Eighteen, maybe nineteen, but not much older than that. Was the hotel being generous, hiring people that young to such a prestigious position? Or were they desperate for workers? Who could say.

<strong>&quot;Flushed, like FLUSHED. You know your insides? FLUSHED. Inside becomes out. It all goes out the back end in one go. I know, it&#39;s crazy.&quot;</strong> The woman explain, her voice completely dull and disinterested. She looked up at Lancer expectantly, tapping her foot against the floor as she waited for a spot. Unfortunately, she wasn&#39;t a big fan of the response she received.

<strong>&quot;SIGH. Well, if you want to book an appointment, hurry up. The boss- I mean, Mr Kingsmade, has the whole complex booked out at 6.30PM for an hour.&quot;</strong>

Even if he stayed here for the rest of the Grail War, he would never have came to that conclusion. Just when he thought he had this era figured out, something like this is threw his way. Is he truly doomed to never get used to this time and its many weird ways of life? 

This just made him curious as to how the other servants in this Grail War are faring themselves.

At least he was given another chance to secure some information for his Master&#39;s listening ears. Given her attitude and general disinterest, she didn&#39;t seem like the type to be so tight-lipped about certain bits of information. Though that carried a risk with it as well. She could have been told nothing of value given her position, but it was worth an attempt regardless.

&quot;I will make an appointment then, sure.&quot; When he finished, he went up to the counter in case he needed to sign something. His interest piqued when she mentioned Mr. Kingsmade though. &quot;The whole complex? Is there a group event going on? Could it be related to the event going on between the two cities?&quot; Guan Yu continued his string of questions, at the dismay of the employee, of course. Out of the customers she could get, she got landed with a quite talkative one indeed!

They were deathly silent, unspeaking, merely watching, observing. Specifically, they were looking towards Guan Yu. Their visage was like iron, unmoving, giving nothing away.

It seemed that his presence was finally noticed. That didn&#39;t take long. At least he acquired quite the amount of information for his Master. Hopefully it would be enough.

Guan Yu turned to face this new arrival. One step was all he took as he sized up the servant. He felt this feeling before. It was the same feeling he felt back with Black Knight, but this was no automaton this time. 

The girl was seemingly ignored as she gazed upon the two giants before her. The tension in the air would threaten to shake a lesser structure from its very foundations. One slight twitch and a fight could erupt before her.

This <strong>thing</strong> stared at him with deathly silent intent. So, it was only fair that he returned the gesture. Guan Yu removed his shades so he could stare back directly. The blazing fire within them was no longer hidden. No words were exchanged between the two of them, but both of them understood one thing from their standoff. One thing that was as clear as day.

<em>Neither will pull their punches.</em>

An understanding between two fighters. Between <em>Warriors</em>. 

Not that he would prefer it any other way, of course. 

&quot;No. That will be all. Thank you for your excellent service, Miss.&quot; Guan Yu spoke his last words towards the employee at the counter without even looking her way. With that, he made his way towards the exit to leave. His time here was over. For the time being at least.

From the out-of-breath smiling creep of an employee that escorted Guan Yu through the hotel to the disinterested blas&#233; girl that &#39;welcomed&#39; him to the spa with much enthusiasm.

The Servant that suddenly came in didn&#39;t escape their vision, either. If Guan Yu was a mountain of a man, that guy was like two mountains stacked on top of one another. An amalgam of flesh and bones that gave off an immense pressure, unnerving in his stance and unsettling to look at. But perhaps the most frightening thing about him was the inability to <em>understand him</em> due to his unchanging facial features, akin to a mask that concealed everything while letting his hostility gush out.

People had known about the involvement of Alexander Kingsmade in the war. They had known about his Servant, too. But hearing about a Servant and experiencing him were two different things. Just like for Ching Shih, <em>Archer of Kurukshetra</em>&#39;s ServantPedia™️ page was a stub. But contrary to Ching Shih, Archer didn&#39;t have anything listed on his page. No indications of his abilities, nothing concerning his backstory nor his character. His page was as blank as a new born baby&#39;s butt. Even with all the knowledge she had access to, she couldn&#39;t discern whom—what legend sparked his existence. Kurukshetra used to be a region from a country known as <em>India</em>, but the mythos that transpired from this land didn&#39;t exactly fit with his... otherworldly appearance. Absolutely nothing came to mind upon seeing him. Hell, the guy didn&#39;t even look like an <em>Archer</em> to begin with!</span>

And this is why, more than fear, Laura felt irritation. Not knowing, not understanding that which they would fight sparked a wee bit of anger. She even came to suspect that Alexander Kingsmade had specially tinkered with the CityNet archives to keep the identity of his Archer secret. The guy did have the funds to make that sort of thing happen—easily, even. Not only that, but he might&#39;ve done the same for the other Servants that he commissioned to protect his hotel. As if having the advantage in fire-power wasn&#39;t enough, he had to go double on the intel war as well.

&quot;Fuck rich people,&quot; Laura muttered behind her breath. &quot;And fuck their obnoxiously mysterious Servants.&quot;

The stealthy bugs that were waiting outside the hotel couldn&#39;t enter, courtesy of the countless Boundary Fields that protected it. She&#39;d have to rely on the few bugs that had been inside the hotel before their arrival, for the time being. There wasn&#39;t much to work with, seeing how the hotel staff was particularly strict on hygiene, but it was <em>something</em>. The various gnats, ticks and fleas spread out on their respective flours, completing her mental map of the inside slowly but surely.

One hundred floors extending towards the surface, each with about twelve guest rooms. One underground level, most likely a storage facility of some sort. Approximately four hundred-ish people, according to the lice and the various face mites that nested on the guests&#39; bodies. Barely a quarter of the hotel was booked. Her guess was that, as secure as the hotel established itself to be, some people were still reluctant about sleeping in what was basically the base of operations of a CGW Master. Getting caught up in a battle between Servants would be pretty bad, after all.

<em>Oh, how right they were.</em>

Hundreds of thousands—almost half a million individuals hid in the twilight that was slowly creeping up the city. Most of their eyes focused on her surroundings and on the surroundings of the hotel, aiming to catch glimpse of the delivery that was scheduled in a couple hours. 

As Guan Yu climbed the numerous floors that separated him from the booked room, Laura composed her thoughts and captured his attention through the bugs that he housed within his suit. To be safe from any hidden cameras or microphones within the walls, they exchanged thoughts in the bathroom of his chamber. A long discussion ensued, and a way to tackle their fight was established.

Now, it had been almost an hour since they came to the hotel. Both had done reconnaissance work, examined the soon-to-be battlefield and discussed tactics—planting the seeds that would eventually blossom into a path to victory. All they had left was to brace themselves, sharpen their fangs and bid their time until the clock showed 8pm.</span>

As the day grew older, there was a notable uptick in people in the hotel. Visitors who were out during the day returned, be it to enjoy the bar and restaurant, or to get an early night of rest. Though, among these various guests, one stood out.

A short bald man, dressed in a pure black suit, holding a hefty-looking briefcase by their side. They constantly glanced over their shoulder, as though they were expecting to be followed. No doubt, this was the second participant in the meeting with Alexander Kingsmade, and that briefcase held the weapon that would turn the war in their favour.

After assuaging his concerns, the courier marched inside the hotel. Elsewhere in the building, bugs would sense the elevator rising up to the penthouse, before falling down once more. Inside it, no doubt, was Alexander Kingsmade and his Archer.

The meeting was about to commence.

Delphi being somewhat lacking in the entertainment department, people found no meaning in staying outside as the day grew dark. This translated in the flow of new guests arriving at the hotel thinning out as time went on, eventually stopping all together at around seven.

This, along with the shady briefcase and the suspicious attitude, made the bald suited man stand out even more as he entered the hotel. Gnats and flies immediately went to his side, hiding between the layers of his suit and his dress shirt. The briefcase he carried was completely sealed from the outside, leaving no room for even the tiniest of her available bugs to crawl through. It seemed like she wouldn&#39;t get a peek at its contents until it was opened.

The insects outside, their black figures completely merged with the darkness of the night, started to grow restless as the bald man entered the scene. The shapeless stream of bodies moved—<em>pulsed</em> ever so slightly with each passing second, waiting for an order from their commander with impatience. The other group of bugs—the one she had sent on a mission a couple hours earlier—were also getting fidgety. 

Meanwhile, the mood inside the hotel was festive. The guests were fully enjoying the entertainment provided by the various facilities provided to them, noisily talking amongst each other and having a grand ol&#39; time.

Little did they know that the tension outside those walls was rapidly climbing, threatening to collapse on them at any moment.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There were no lies in what the receptionist told him regarding the quality of these rooms. They were spotless and no expense was spared in what the room had in terms of comfort. Guan Yu felt more out of place after living with his Master for the past weeks. The difference was more drastic than night and day here. Though, he wasn&#39;t afforded the comfort in comparing the two places at all. For his mind was focused on other things.

His eyes were closed. His mind was focused on his previous fight with Saber. The servants summoned for this City Grail War still fought as if they could acquire a wish of theirs in the end despite that not being the truth. Or perhaps they still didn&#39;t know. 

That was an interesting line of thought that ran through his head. Just how many servants in this War knew about the lack of a wish at the end? How many are fighting for something that they cannot achieve even if they are victorious?

&quot;Interesting...&quot; A single word came from the man as he sat on the bed. 

His pondering stance was interrupted once he heard his Master speak to him. They were on the move. It was time.

&quot;Understood. I will be ready, Miss Hess. Just say the command when the time is right and I will ride out once more.&quot; Guan Yu finished that sentence by standing up and fixing his tie. And with that, he walked out of his room to prepare for the coming fight.

They planned this attack out and with his skill, <strong>Military Tactics D</strong>, their timing would be more than precise. They would need every advantage they could get in the coming battle if they are to come out on top, after all.

They scratched and fidgeting with their suits, shaking loose a few of the insects, though not all of them. In most instances, they would be discreet, but for such a paranoid man, their effectiveness was somewhat dampened. Not wholly, mind, but mostly.

<strong>&quot;God damn it...&quot;</strong> He muttered under his breath. Reaching into his inner pocket, he fished a roll of mints out, popping one into his mouth as he leaned back. His eyes rested expectantly on the elevator, watching as it moved from the top floor down to the bottom.

<em><strong>DING!</strong></em>

Sure enough, the elevator would announce itself as it reached its destinations. The doors briskly slid open, to reveal their passenger.

Alexander Kingsmade.</span>

He was here for business, no time for distractions. Guests would wave at him, shout for him to join them, but all he had time to spare was a glance, a sly smile and a slight shake of his head. Notably, he appeared to be alone, a most odd thing. His Servant wasn&#39;t there?

Upon coming side by side to the table with the courier, Alexander would pause, pulling out his phone. After a moment of fidgeting upon the homescreen, he put it to his ear. Pretending to take a phone call. Covering his tracks.

<strong>&quot;Thank you. I&#39;ll be taking that weapon now.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;With all due respect, Mr Kingsmade, you&#39;ll be receiving nothing until I get my payment. That was the deal.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;The deal was 50% before, 50% after. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&quot;</strong>

With a scowl, the courier raised the briefcase up, resting it upon the table and unlocking it. Then, with a careful motion, he would open it up, allowing him and Alexander to see the contents, and no one else. No one, save the insects.

And what they saw was... a USB drive?</span>

A small black building surrounded by signs depicting hazardous and dangerous yellow and black motives, with an enormous chunk of iron barely resembling a door as its only gateway. It&#39;s small size was deceptive—The biggest part of the facility extended below ground, taking full advantage of Delphi&#39;s incredible depth to hide most of its contents underground. The facility was filled to the brim with person-sized blocks stacked on top of one another—the source of the Residential District&#39;s electrical energy—with innumerable cables of varying thicknesses extending from them to pylons that stretched in every direction. 

The swarm of insects surged through the steel door inside the facility, falling and stumbling as they crawled through the depths of the building, their form comparable to that of a never-ending water leak that spread in every direction. 

Laura gave a singular order, branding their arthropodic brains with a singular purpose that overruled any other. 
 
<em><strong>TEAR THE CABLES DOWN.</strong></em>

The insects scrambled with a yet unseen ferocity, crawling towards the thick cables and spreading through every block of the facility. The insects mercilessly tore through their rubber-insulated coatings, rendering it completely useless in front of their sharpened mandibles. As soon as they reached the metallic components, the insects started dying <em>en masse</em>, each insect leaving but a dent in it before collapsing from the electrical charge. Their calcined and fried bodies quickly piled in small heaps in front of the cables—

A cycle of death and retaliation, with a row of insects dying only to attract twice their numbers upon their deaths. Some of the insects even started devouring their pairs, their brains completely overwhelmed by the fragrance and the aroma of the ones that succumbed.

Barely a minute had passed since their arrival <em>and the cables had all been rendered useless.</em></span>

And thus there Guan Yu stood in one of the hallways, facing a window. The height allowed him to overlook the city and all of its glory. It was impressive to see the city from this viewpoint, especially during the night. Truly Humanity has continued to grow despite their setbacks.

He held his arm out to his side. A brilliant light shone from his hand as his guandao materialized. As the weapon entered his grasp, his outfit began to take form from his arm outwards. The suit he wore evaporated as the robes took their place. 

There was no time wasted once he was equipped for battle that he took his first swing. The target? The window in front of him! 

The window gave way easily to a servant&#39;s fabled weapon and shattered into pieces. The shards blasted outwards.

The next part? Why it was simple of course! Jump! Guan Yu leapt out of the window right after he broke it. 

A suicidal move by most, if not all, but one only needed to look up to see why he made such a move. 

Thundering down the side of the building came Red Hare at full gallop. Fully armoured with the wind flowing freely through their hairs, Red Hare rode besides Guan Yu. This gave him enough time to grab hold and mount Red Hare in one swift motion. Now, in what seemed like a blink of an eye, the two of them were together racing down the way of the building. Any other option would have been too slow to fit until the plan!

But those same lights suddenly started to <em>vanish</em>.

It started with a few buildings blinking out of existence on the outskirts of the district, then it spread like wildfire across the entire Residential area. In mere seconds, the whole district had been plunged into utter <em>darkness</em>.

And so, the warm and welcoming hotel had now turned into a nerve-wrecking place. The expensive light bulbs and golden chandeliers, the jukeboxes and the TVs—they all ceased to function, bringing an oppressive veil of shadow into the rooms of the hotel.

The guests that were previously enjoying their nights had all been cut into their tracks, voicing a collective &quot;What?&quot; mere seconds after the lights blinked out.</span>

No time needed to be wasted at this critical point in the plan. So, on a dime, Guan Yu had Red Hare turn around and charge into another glass window. The speed combined with another wide swing from Guan Yu made short work of the obstacle before them.

In the darkness of the lobby came a crashing sound as one of the windows to the lobby was broken into. The sounds of horseshoes against the floor came at frightening speeds  towards Alexander Kingsmade. The goal wasn&#39;t to attack in the dark.Why,  that would be against the rules! Nothing said there was anything against a little thievery though!

The lights went dark, and the hotel fell into a sudden state of unrest. Some screamed, others shouted, some fumbling in the dark, some remaining where they would. The courier slammed his briefcase shut, eyes flicking about the room, driven by pure anxiety. Alexander, meanwhile, seemed unfazed by the whole affair, his only reaction the narrowing of his eyes.

He knew better than anyone that this was no common power outage. The timing was far too suspect to be coincidence. This deal had been hijacked into an ambush!

Sure enough, Guan Yu came rushing into action, carried upon the back of his brilliant steed. Driven by intense speed, the distance between him and his prize was cleared in a matter of seconds. Darting between furniture, through bystanders, getting into grasping range of the briefcase, reaching out-

When had Archer arrived at the conflict? One moment he was there, and the next, he was not. How? It was a worrying question, but not one that the servant had time to ponder. Nevertheless, his foe was standing in front of Guan Yu, excess mana billowing off his body in the form of clouds of darkness, his fist buried deep within the chest of the horse.

<em><strong>&quot;NGH! ASSAULT OUR BASE? STEAL OUR WEAPONS? DISHONOURABLE! DISHONOURABLE DISHONOURABLE DISHONOURABLE!&quot;</strong></em> Archer howled, yellow eyes glowing with burning rage. With his intentions made clear, he followed through with his full might, launching both mount and rider backwards. Lancer was mostly unharmed, though the same could not be said for Red Hare, who had been forced to bear the brunt of the blow. Needless to say, the broken bones would diminish their effectiveness.

Although, now that he stood in front of this monster, the general would come to recognise its origins. Not quite Yaoguai, but similar, a kind of entity that shared a similar origin and had a similar purpose, from a neighbouring nation, that being India. There was only one kind of being that matched those descriptors.

Rakshasa.</span>

Within the palm of his hand formed a ball of pure, radiant light, eradicating the pitch black that had fallen upon the hall. His face was the picture of smug, a demonic grin spread across his face. <strong>&quot;Vandalising my hotel, are you? How very disappointing, Guan Yu.&quot;</strong>

His tongue clicked several times in succession as he shook his head. Taking a few steps forward, he snatched the briefcase out of the hands of the deliveryman, before looking over to the War God once more.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ll offer you one chance to scurry away with your tail between your legs and accept a loss. You are in over your head. This is my one warning.&quot;</strong></span>

Guan Yu&#39;s tactical might could only extend so far. The unknown variables that littered the battlefield was the weak point in his skill. It was moments like that showed that he was truly meant to be a warrior instead of a tactician. But they did great with what they have done. This made a smile form on his face. 

Their plan seemed to have fell apart completely, but this man is smiling? This man, who was launched by a surprise attack after getting so close, was happy about all of this!

It was clear that this man felt right at home on the battlefield!</span>

Guan Yu had been stopped dead in his tracks by his Servant, which seemed to appear literally out of nowhere to deliver an abnormally strong punch to his mount. And how was this guy a fucking <em>Archer</em>, again? 

Either way, Alexander&#39;s demeanour regarding the lights going off and their surprise strike was that of utter <em>calm</em>. Like he hadn&#39;t felt danger from their arrival. And of course, being a Magus that specialised in light-type Magecraft, the blackout wouldn&#39;t have done much beyond the initial surprise. Laura had hoped that, being a <em>human being</em>, that the sudden darkness would catch Alexander off-guard, even for as little as a split second. She would&#39;ve considered it a win as long as they could steal the suitcase.

Unfortunately for them, it didn&#39;t happen like that. Guan Yu had already started to smile as their scheme fell to pieces, forcing a desperate sigh out of his Master. 

But surprisingly, she found herself eventually smiling too.</span>

Red Hare was a Phantasm Beast. Any normal horse would have crumbled before the blow from Archer, but once the light revealed and the dust settled, Red Hare was resting where they landed. The armour helped to lessen the amount of force. The blood from Red Hare&#39;s nose and muzzle showed that it still did a considerable amount of damage. &quot;Rest, My friend. I will handle this fight.&quot; Guan Yu said to his trusted friend as they rested. They have already suffered more damage than he wanted them to, so he made the decision to fight on foot. Last fight showed his prowess as a Rider. This fight would be the test of his Lancer capabilities! 

&quot;While my friend grants me the title of Rider, I am proud to declare that <strong>I</strong>, myself, am a Lancer!&quot; A few strikes was done to demonstrate his might before he entered a stance with one of his hands gripping the mid section and the other holding the bottom of the shaft as the weapon was held out towards Archer. 

A grin was briefly shown before he let out a loud shout. &quot;<strong>NOW!</strong>&quot;</span>

The faint light that Alexander emitted barely managed to reveal the source of that noise.

Bugs. One, two, four, ten. Hundreds, thousands... No. <em>Much more.</em> Some had clung to the side of the concrete that separated the windows, barely sticking out from their sneaky positions. Others had been hovering a few meters away from the windows, charging through the opening that Guan Yu had created to infiltrate the hotel. Flies, mosquitoes, gnats, bees—even a few butterflies, all were swarming to enter the room, so tightly packed together and with such coordinated movements that they almost looked like one big organism.

Indeed, they were a perfectly synchronised bunch. Countless little entities that melted into one.

&quot;Guan Yu <em>and co</em>,&quot; A voice. Not from Guan Yu, nor one of the guests. No, it came from the <em>bugs</em>.

A couple of guests screamed in terror in front of this grotesque spectacle. The sheer number of insects that had entered was hard to grasp as a result of the darkness and their compactness, but it was easy to guess that they were numerous. <em>Extremely numerous.</em>

&quot;And let&#39;s make this clear right from the get-go, rich boy,&quot; The swarm spoke once again. &quot;We won&#39;t settle for anything else than-&quot;</span>

Once the distance was closed, Guan Yu performed a thrust then a swipe at Archer&#39;s central mass to test his defences.

One of the few windows within the whole complex he did not cover with Bounded Field, as he had never considered it a viable point of exit or entry. It appeared he had been wrong.

<strong>&quot;Insects, hm? A novel trick, but an insubstantial one. Try not to sully any more of my property, will you? The cleaning staff tell me that washing out insect blood is quite difficult for them.</strong>

The way he addressed the pair so confidently, even when they were fighting on what appeared to be even ground... there was something wrong. This wasn&#39;t overconfidence or arrogance, no. He still had an ace up his sleeve, a power play left to perform. But to say it was <em>his</em> was disingenuous. No, it was that of <em>his servant</em>.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m afraid the time I have to spare is five minutes.&quot;</strong> The magus closed his hand, snuffing out the sphere of luminosity that rested in his palm. <strong>&quot;Fortunately, by causing this little blackout, you&#39;ve signed your death warrant.&quot;</strong>

With the last light snuffed out, darkness fell once more. Then, fell chaos.</span>

It became impossible to be see much farther than a few metres in front of oneself. Even the sharpest eyes would struggle to make out details within the murk!

Guan Yu&#39;s strike would land true, but he would not hear the tearing of flesh. No, instead, it appeared to bounce off, as though he had tried to slash through a ton of metal. That posed a significant problem, however, for he had indeed struck Archer of Kurukshetra. Though his sight was limited, his hearing continued to work fine, and he did not catch so much as a single sound of motion.</span>

From this vague silhouette, he was an exaggerated version of the rakshasa that was bathed in light. One even larger, even broader, even bulkier. Every claw, fang, and horn appeared to have been sharpened and elongated, every muscle bulged as though it threatened to tear through the ivory skin. No doubt, this was the result of a True Name Release, which could only mean one thing:

Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm was the full extent of his true power!

<strong>&quot;NGH! DIE, PERISH, MEET THY END!&quot;</strong> Came the roar, guttural and hellish, as though dragged out from the throat of death itself. Raising both arms up high, it slammed them down directly in front of him, aiming to smash Guan Yu into a mess of scrap metal upon the ground!</span>

After all, there was still a chance to snatch their utter victory from the jaws of encroaching defeat. All they needed to do was defeat the Master, Alexander Kingsmade, and claim his weapon before he could misuse it!

Easier said than done, as he had already taken advantage of his servant&#39;s accelerated evolution to slip away. Even now, he was already running towards the elevator, seeking to make a quick exit. With Lancer occupied with Archer, and Red Hare otherwise indisposed, it was up to The Swarm to stop him!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Archer was within striking distance! His duo of strikes landed true. But immediately he felt something was off. His weapon was capable of cutting through most servants, especially with such a clean hit! But, his weapon simply bounced off Archer&#39;s body. This was the Black Knight situation all over again. This time he was without Red Hare, nor his full sight aiding him...

While he cannot make full use of it without Red Hare&#39;s speed, there was a single trick he could use to offer himself a small solace within the inky darkness that now surrounds him. &quot;Come, Green Dragon. Guide me with your light in this hour of darkness!&quot; Guan Yu&#39;s Mana focused directly into the blade of his guandao as it shined brightly with a green hue. While it couldn&#39;t pierce this kind of darkness completely, it gave him a small area to work with. 

And it couldn&#39;t have came at a better time. 

Archer transformed into something else entirety. No doubt this was the work of his Noble Phantasm. The strong sense of Mana in the air was more than telling. The arms of a demon lifted up and threatened to strike him down with a single blow. With the power that emitted from Archer, he had no reason to doubt that they couldn&#39;t.

If Archer&#39;s body was no different than steel against his attacks, then perhaps he could use this to his advantage...

This way he could use all his strength, Archer&#39;s momentum, and the mastery with his weapon to flip himself over Archer before the strike landed. 

He survived one attack, but how many more could he avoid before one eventually finds their mark?

That isn&#39;t something a warrior allows to cloud their mind however! They push through until the light of victory graces their sight once more! 

&quot;<strong>Archer!</strong>&quot; A loud warcry came from above as Guan Yu came back down. This time he had both of his hands near the pommel while he sent a full overhead swing towards Archer&#39;s skull. No doubt the blade would fail to cut. He knew this. There was no way he could beat this <em>thing</em>. The best he could do is simply keep Archer&#39;s attention fixed on him until his Master finishes the job. Every precious second gained is worth its weight in gold. Could he continue to pay the ever increasing price for each second though?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">On the ground, the carpets were squirming. Each step the guests took produced disgusting squishing sounds. More than a few guests froze in place as they felt the ground shift beneath their feet, completely overwhelmed by the things that crawled beside it. Ants, cockroaches, earthworms, centipedes, maggots and much more. A flurry of dark-brown colours, with subtle taints of red and green here and there. The slow ever-shifting mess was slowly spreading across the floor, utterly unstoppable.

And while the stream of flying bugs entering through the windows didn&#39;t weaken in the least, Alexander was already making his swift escape through the... elevator?

&quot;There&#39;s no use to run, Alex.&quot; Called out the swarm to him, chasing a few steps behind him. &quot;Even if you somehow got to that elevator, there&#39;s not an <em>ounce</em> of power in this building. And even so, assuming that the elevator <em>did work</em>...&quot;

As the sole &#39;light&#39; that stood against the terrifying darkness of the floor started to flee, the terrified people all stuck to Alexander like bees on a sunflower, using Guan Yu&#39;s faint light to direct themselves towards him. He was their only hope, their ticket to salvation, the sole man with enough courage and composure to stand against the hordes of bugs that infested the room. It was only natural that they would desperately cling to him.

They would surely make any attempt to act harder for Alexander, being both in the way of fighting and in the way of escaping. Not to mention that, even if the elevator was to function correctly, the people in the remaining ninety-nine flours would surely call upon it to escape the terrifyingly dark hotel. A big crashing sound, unrestrained buzzing from the insects outside, glass shards noisily falling on the ground—it was like every action was made in an effort to make the people <em>panic</em>, greatly hindering his chances to flee.

Had the enemy planned for this to happen? A question that Alexander would wonder as he saw the mass of people hurrying towards him, tripping and pushing against each other to reach their salvation.

It was up to the Swarm to stop him. But as it stood right now, the people could do a much more <em>efficient</em> job.

&quot;Now, being a Delphi business-person just like you, I know how hard clients can be to handle. Which is why I&#39;d like to make you a little proposal—&quot;*

The Swarm spoke loud and clear, giving the opportunity for everyone present to hear its words.

&quot;—The Kingsmade hotel gets to ensure the safety and trust of its guests—and by extension, gets to keep the trust and respect of the people that you worked so hard to earn—in exchange for the little briefcase that you so dearly wrapped your fingers around. I can guarantee that the insects will be taking their leave as soon as you surrender that weapon, Alexander.&quot;

In response to the Swarm&#39;s words, more than a few heads turned towards Alexander&#39;s briefcase. Their eyes quickly drifted from it to the man. It was hard to tell in the darkness, but their expressions were probably a mix of anxiety and plead.

&quot;So, what will you chose?&quot; The swarm spoke again. &quot;The people, or your selfish ambitions?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Faced by these sudden yet overwhelming odds, Alexander&#39;s smirk fell into a frown, before plunging further into a scowl. Laura had successfully used his own territory against him, turning the customers of his hotel into noose with which to hang himself. Indeed, it seemed that he was between a rock and a hard place. Keep his prize, or the respect of the population?

Suddenly, the glum expression upon his face vanished, giving way to a wide smirk. A true Delphi businessman never lost control. Especially of the narrative.

<strong>&quot;Intending to use these innocent civilians against me? Hah! Just what I&#39;d expected from a lowly terrorist like you!&quot;</strong> Alexander shouted, turning to face the main body of the storm. <strong>&quot;So be it! If you want to harm these people, then I&#39;ll just protect them and defeat you all at once!&quot;</strong>

With a fluid motion, he flung the briefcase high into the air, soaring high. But it was not any old aimless throw - he hang flung it towards the broken window. He was taking advantage of their own entrance to buy time!

Meanwhile, the golems stationed at the entrance had begun to pull their weight, stomping up the stairs. Artificial voices rang out, catching the attention of the stragglers caught in the crossfire.

<strong>ATTENTION, VALUED LIFEFORMS: YOU ARE BEING EVACUATED. PLEASE EXIT THE HOTEL IN A CALM AND ORDERLY FASHION.</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thanks to his sharp wit and quick thinking, Lancer had narrowly evaded a potentially devastating attack. But what of the next one? Or the one after that? And after that? He wouldn&#39;t win a prolonged battle against this foe. He could only hope to last long enough for his Master to secure victory.

Channelling the power of the Green Dragon with his guandao, he leapt forth, aiming to cleave into the face of the demon in front of him. His shining blade swept a clean arc downwards, and against all odds, managed to break through the unbreakable defense!

<strong>GRAGH!&quot;</strong>

It would take a split second for both to realise what had occurred. The glow from the guandao had cut through the darkness, and in doing so, stripped the demon of his enhancements. Light would make the monster vulnerable! With that revelation, perhaps he stood a chance at true victory!

Or perhaps not. Though he had been wounded, Archer was the tenacious sort. One hand wrapped itself around the haft of the spear, keeping it firmly trapped in place. The other?

<strong>CRACK!</strong> Buried itself directly into the chest of Guan Yu, stealing the air from his lungs. He was planning to trade blows directly! Now trapped in an unfortunate crossroads, the monster launched a flurry of repeated punched towards the general, aiming to overpower him through sheer might.</span>

It seemed that light was the creature&#39;s bane. The glow from his guandao kept him from harnessing that monstrous strength of his. Who&#39;d have thought that the glimmer of victory would come from none other than his own weapon!

However, before he could follow up with another attack to press the advantage he acquired, Archer trapped his weapon in place with his hand then followed up with his own attack.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A solid blow directly to his chest was landed. He was fortunate that his Endurance was high enough to endure such a blow, but that didn&#39;t stop the air from escaping his lungs. The strength behind it was no joke either. He felt his frame within tremble from the impact.

Everything inside of his body was screaming for him to let go of his weapon and recover from the blow. If he did that though, the guandao would lose its glow and leave him in complete darkness once again. No. He had to endure this. Besides, Archer is locked in place as long as Guan Yu kept his grip. 

<strong>&quot;If you wish to trade blows, Archer, then let us exchange until one falls!&quot;</strong> He mustered all the air he could get and shouted directly into Archer&#39;s face in an act of defiance. His opponent will learn this day that the intense fury of a War God&#39;s wrath could not be easily snuffed out.

Both of them had one of their arms locked around the weapon as the other arm struck towards their opponent. Guan Yu had to use his free arm to block most of Archer&#39;s strikes. If he didn&#39;t, he would crumble before his opponent too soon. 

Each strike from Guan Yu aimed directly at Archer&#39;s wound. His palm was straight to ensure that he dug deeper in. His punches were useless against Archer&#39;s body so he had to take advantage of the one gap in their defences. Whenever Guan Yu struck back however, another blow landed against his chest, rattling his frame further, but this was the price he needed to pay to keep on the offensive.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Upon hearing Guan Yu&#39;s declaration of intent, Archer&#39;s iron expression finally shift. Their face warped, eyes widening with glee, many-fanged mouth opening into a massive grin. From the back of their throat, a slow and rumbling cackle poured forth into the world, like sandpaper upon the ears of all who listened.

<strong>&quot;KUHUHUHUHUHUHU! YES! YES YES YES! ONE ON ONE, NO INTERRUPTION, NO FOOLISHNESS, NO CHEATING! PURE, CLEAN WAR! TRUE DHARMAYUDDHA!&quot;</strong> The demon barked, their voice swimming in joy. What an odd and paradoxical character; a demon who wished to follow the rules? Tricksters known for abusing every advantage, yet this one sought only fair combat? Mayhaps it was that noble spirit that allowed himself to escape the binding madness of the Berserker class, and to assume the dignity of a Knight class.

<strong>&quot;HAH! ENOUGH CHATTER! HAVE AT YOU!&quot;</strong>

With that, their contest began, a brutal melee of fists slamming into chests and striking skulls. It was here that Lancer would gain the true measure of his opponent as one who possessed utmost durability. The injury cleaved upon his skull would be enough to fell a lesser warrior, but this one was barely fazed, fighting on as though it were nothing. No doubt they possessed the highest level of Endurance, perhaps even additional durability beyond that!

However, despite that, they remained even in their exchange of blows. Both were being worn down at an equal rate, each denied their Noble Phantasms and forced to fight barehanded. Both were being worn down at an expedited rate, burning great amounts of mana in a matter of seconds. 

However, the scales would not remain in balance for long.</span>

Sure enough, he would turn it around to the point faced downward, and thrust it down, aiming to puncture the shoulder of Guan Yu. Specifically, that which was holding the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. He was seeking to break this stalemate in his favour with a single well-placed blow!

The darkness concealed the fight. Only the brutal cacophony of broken flesh and S.E.R.V.A.N.T frames were heard. One can only imagine what was going on.

To the combatants, this mattered none. They didn&#39;t need their acts of glory to be seen. The only ones that needed to know were themselves. A glorious duel between two warriors.

<em>&quot;This is what I sought from my fight with Saber! Neither servant backing down! Yes! Show me more of that iron resolve, Archer, and I will show you mine!&quot;</em> These thoughts raced throughout his mind as his body held together by sheer willpower.

Guan Yu&#39;s hand, along with his arm, was broken. His fingers were displaced and useless, yet he pushed on. Even with his only weapon broken, he would not give a single inch to Archer. 

The pain that radiated was immense. He felt his Mana stores draining as he continued to endure the brutal punishment from his opponent. But would he even be worthy of his War God title if he bent his knee now? Nay! As long as he had but a smidge of Mana left to pour into one final attack, he continued to give his all!

<strong>&quot;If it is an arm you seek to rend from my body, then have it!&quot;</strong> Swiftly, Guan Yu stepped closer to Archer and shifted his body so the path of the arrow would collide with his broken arm rather than his shoulder. The arrow pierced into his arm with ease. The angle of it caused the arrow to penetrate straight through his arm then back into the forearm before finally escaping through his palm. His limb was skewered.

He is sure to be scolded on his recklessness by his Master by the end of this.

With whatever grip still possessed his hand, he held onto the arrow to provide a point of leverage for him. If Archer wanted his &#39;spear&#39; back, he would have to tear his arm clean off!

Guan Yu then placed his feet on Archer&#39;s thighs before pulling back with his remaining strength and weight. His plan? To wrest his weapon free from his opponent&#39;s grasp! He felt his body tearing at the seams. Something was about to give. He just had to hope it wasn&#39;t going to be him...

Killer blows had been exchanged between Guan Yu and Archer ever since their arrival, each one aiming to knock down the other by the power of will and big punches. It was as gruesome as it got, with how bestial the two warriors gad gotten. It was no longer a fight meant to secure victory, but one to stimulate their itching fists. It was the first occasion that Guan Yu had to indulge himself in a fight, but even then. This was <em>hard to look at</em>. 

She didn&#39;t have the luxury to pay attention to their fight, though. Her opponent, Alexander, had calmed the crowd to he best of his abilities. The way he spoke, casually casting aside her remarks while keeping the situation under control. Cementing his position as the good guy while painting them as &#39;terrorists&#39;. Quite a low blow, considering that none of the guests had been targeted by the Swarm so far, but hey. She would gladly don the mantle of a villain as long as she could achieve her motives.

All things considered, Alexander Kingsmade wasn&#39;t just some rich kid that had inherited his wealth from papa, but an A-class crook that knew his way around words and manipulation. 

He was from <em>Delphi</em>, alright.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Between the people and his weapon, he had chosen the people, throwing the suitcase out the broken window. The insects that had yet to enter the room all <em>swarmed</em> towards the suitcase, greedily chasing after it like a snake after its prey. 

As for the swarm inside the room, they all <em>converged</em> towards Alexander, flying and crawling insects alike, fully taking advantage of the darkness that dwelt in the room to strip him of any chance to react. 

For a couple of seconds, perhaps the toughest seconds he&#39;s had to live through in his entire life, he was quite literally <em>drowning</em> in insects. 

They buzzed loudly in his ears, walked upon every square inch of his skin with their many claws. Some even got in the way of his nostrils, in his mouth and even in his ears. 

But surprisingly, he found that none of the insects had bitten him thus far. They rummaged through his clothes, the many pockets that his extravagant clothes housed filling with insects and arachnids.

But, as fast as it had &#39;attacked&#39; him, the swarm folded. A couple insects had been trapped in the seams of his clothes, but the majority had let go of him.

The swarm of flying insects and the mass of crawlies quickly turned towards the broken window, passing through Guan Yu in their way.

His arm.

No, there was no time to take care of this. 

&quot;We&#39;re getting out of here!&quot; Screamed the Swarm, passing through the two fighters to get to the outside. &quot;Don&#39;t keep me waiting for too long, big man!&quot;</span>

However, he did not sign up to this competition expecting to win without wounds. No, he knew what he had signed up for perfectly well.

So, he stood perfectly still, fearless, trapped within his prison of arthropods. He had no chance to move, so why struggle? This battle was not his to win. That privilege of attaining victory would have to fall to his servant.

Both their &quot;spears&quot; were firmly trapped in the flesh of their opponents, unable to free them without significant effort. In his effort to halt the stalemate, they had only managed to reinforce it.

Now, it was Guan Yu&#39;s turn to turn the tables.

Jumping up, the general would use his opponent&#39;s massive size against them, boots gripping against his legs. With this newfound leverage, he would find himself beginning to gain the advantage. His guandao began to slip free from the demon&#39;s grip and his skull alike, slowly coming free.

Then, the counter to this counter. Lancer would feel one of his feet slip off his opponent&#39;s thigh. Then, an instant later, a mighty kick slammed into his chest with a hefty <em>THUD</em>.

Guan Yu would be thrown back, tumbling in a heap next to the still-wounded Red Hare. In one hand he held his guandao, retrieved from the skull of his opponent, and the other? Well, the other was mangled beyond recognition, though free from the arrow that pieces it.

Now would be an excellent time to follow his master&#39;s orders and retreat.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At the apex of their combined struggle, Guan Yu let out a loud scream. It was unclear whether or not it was one of defiance, another warcry, or one of pain. Regardless of which one it was, it was cut short from the heavy thud that came from Archer&#39;s kick to his chest.

That hit was felt throughout his frame. If he still had organs with this body, he is damn sure one of them must have burst from the impact. It was the only answer to the amount of pain he felt from the attack.

After he recovered, he saw the fruits of his labour. He managed to free his weapon from Archer&#39;s skull. One look at his other arm revealed the price he had to pay though. 

His arm was torn in half. It was impossible to tell that it was an arm with what remained of it. It was enough to make a lesser stomach empty its contents. He was fortunate that the darkness hid it from sight. No civilian needed to see such gruesome sights after all.

So his Master succeeded. And just in the nick of time as well! He wasn&#39;t sure just how much longer he could last against that demon.

Both Red Hare and Guan Yu got up together. Archer dealt a fair amount of damage to both of them. Though, Guan Yu felt no resentment towards his opponent. If anything, he felt respect towards them. This Grail War sure possessed quite the interesting set of opponents to face off against! He felt quite lucky indeed to have been summoned to fight.

Guan Yu mounted his steed then they bounded off towards the same entrance they came in from. Red Hare&#39;s speed was dampened, but it was still enough to make a hasty retreat. 

<strong>&quot;If we crosses paths again, Archer, I hope you&#39;ll be ready and healed for round two! AHAHA-ARGH!&quot;</strong> Guan Yu yelled out to Archer one last time before leaving, though he tried to finish off with another bellowing laugh, but the pain in his chest followed by a splash of blood from his mouth stopped him from enjoying it. Yep. He definitely broke more than he thought he did during that brawl.

From there, he rode off into the night to the rendezvous point so he could pick up Laura. The sight that greeted her was a painful one to endure, but they didn&#39;t have the luxury to worry about it until they got back to <span class="mention">#detectives-office</span>. At least they acquired the briefcase and kept the contents away from Mr. Kingsmade. The contents of the USB were still a mystery though. Just what did this thing hold for it to be considered so dangerous?</span>
