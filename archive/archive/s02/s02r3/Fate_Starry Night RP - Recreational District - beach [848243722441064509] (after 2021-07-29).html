This sort of attraction has been valued highly by the elite, since Olympia very much lacks any natural habitats due to its huge amount of factories. The beach allows for several activities, ranging from sand castle making, seashell collecting to even swimming and surfing.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A flip-flopped foot sunk into the relatively cold sand as Lark stepped forward to examine the surroundings. Normally, this was one of the most popular spots in Olympia simply because of what it was: a beach! The rich could flaunt that perfect skin cultivated since birth and get in some much unneeded relaxation time. He had never been because of this, but with the weather dome in the condition that it was…

Rain sprinkled down as an extreme lack of people made itself very apparent. One again, he donned a big sun hat, replaced after the last one was lost in that encounter around a week ago. Violin in tow, and chair in hand. A deep sniff revealed an incredibly salty air that threatened to dehydrate anyone in the vicinity, his mouth the first victim as the taste coated his cheeks. The waves crashed against the shore, a slap against the sand that rushed ever forward. 

“What a magnificent sight…” he muttered. Where to go? What spot to choose? Was there an etiquette for this sort of thing, or was every spot fair game? Many thoughts and more rushed through his head before he received a sign from God himself…

Geeves took the chair from his hand and unfolded the cheap plastic. He set it down and pushed, digging the legs into the sand. A gloved hand dusted off the chair before the butler presented the seat as if Lark was royalty. “This spot shall do perfectly, methinks. How about you?”

Lark sighed, “What would I do without you, my esteemed partner?” He stomped himself into the chair. It felt… nice, in a way. The plastic ‘threads’ allowed for some leeway of comfort, but not enough to actually make the experience enjoyable. 

“Say, Lance,” he craned his head around to his Servant, “did you ever see the sea in your time? Or the ocean?”</span>

There were far more important matters they could be focusing on instead of lounging in the sun. Yet as long as Lark was providing a steady stream of mana to him, there was a limit to how much he could complain. Besides, no matter what the king said Lark would merely make a snarky remark before ignoring him. He felt they had grown a little more in synch as of late, especially with their late night lessons. Despite that, there was a small part of Uther that worried for the young man and how lax he treated the situations he entered. Even so, Uther promised to give his master a fraction more reign in how he conducts himself. He wasn’t always the most honorable knight, but he always fought to ensure he kept his word.

After being addressed Lancer briefly glanced at Lark before peering off to the sea. “I have been there once or twice in my travels between kingdoms. It is truly wondrous sight, one of God’s many creations.” Despite this being under the pretense of being a ‘break’ Uther kept a watchful eye and ear around them. He did not want to risk them being targeted again by another servant. Hopefully, no one who will randomly fire munitions into a crowd of people again. At least Geeves was not being as hostile anymore, although Uther wandered what was truly going on behind the scenes there. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The man in question had taken his own seat on the sand itself, body propped up by arms. Geeves peered off deep into the landscape with Lark, a sight which seemed to go on for miles and then some. Maybe there was an end to it, but the illusion was wonderful in its own right. To imagine a far away land… there was no better place in the entire city than here. 

Lark, meanwhile, chuckled to himself. “You’d find that about a fifth of the city would agree with you word for word. I’m sure you’ve already noticed and received some cursory information prior, but Olympia is jam packed with every religion under the sun. And even a few you’ve never heard of. Mayhaps one of these days we can go find you a Church and pay tribute to your god. What say you, Geeves?”

He murmured his approval, and poked at the leather case at his Master’s side. “Say, perhaps you could play me a song.”

“A song? I can, but may I ask the occasion?”

Geeves stayed silent for a few moments to ponder. “If I must say,” he said, “it helps me think during turbulent times.”

Lark raised an eyebrow as he grabbed at the case, “I’m not sure what ‘turbulent times’ you may be referring to, but I shan’t deny a request from you. Based on your mood, I think you’d prefer something calm and unintrusive. Correct?”

He nodded. 

“What say you, Lance? Up for a seaside serenade?”</span>

While doing so he began to pick up on something that occurring between Geeves and his master. It was rather subtle, passing glances, lingering touches to the shoulder. At once it clicked for the king, and he suddenly understood why Geeves was so upset with him earlier. The man was no only Lark’s Butler. Uther felt slightly foolish for not seeing it sooner, although he had our most of his concern towards ensuring the safety of his master. A small grin appeared on Lancer’s fave as he realized there might actually be more to his master than what is seen on the surface. Maintaining his overwatch of the beach, Lancer nodded “Certainly master, play something calming and rhyming that accentuates the rolling waves of the sea. I believe Sir Geeves, needs something to soothe his nerves. Perhaps something that will reassure him that everything will be alright in these turbulent times, for all of us. That nothing precious to us shall be lost.” Uther was being subtle himself, but perhaps Geeves would likely pick up on what the king was saying and see that he has a new perspective of importance to these affairs before them. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Geeves stayed silent, and Lark did too. But not without concern or question, as seen by his quizzical stare to the Servant. Perhaps he had absolutely no clue as to what Lancer even referred to, as to say he picked up an ulterior motive to the speech but not as to the topic. Just that one existed. 

However, that was all he revealed. With a casual shrug, Lark played a few test notes before the actual song began. 

It was, well, calm. Not a single note went on shorter than a second, as each one came in and receded with the waves. Deep, careful notes flowed into each other with a methodic yet unpredictable manner. The melody did not overpower the waves, and in fact complimented them. One with the world, the music and natural sounds worked together to create the song instead of try to battle for supremacy. 

And best of all, it was relatively quiet. Even if there had been people here, they would struggle to hear it if they were only a few yards away. Thoughts came easy, yet they could leave at any moment with the tide. 

Unfortunately, Lark found no inspiration in the tune. He had heard, practiced, and performed such music often in his past line of work, so much so that he called this ‘Elevator Music’ for its generic nature and tone.

But this was not for him. So, he played. And the audience listened. One that stared deep into the depths of the blue, stormy waves. The other tried to find a silver lining in the grey clouds.</span>

Uther could tell his master was severely bored, they had become close enough in their training sessions for him to be able to pick up on subtle details of his facial expressions. Even so, the fact that he continued to play, despite likely feeling like it was akin to watching grass grow, showed that he did have a semblances of self care. It was a wonderful day at the beach, until the first droplet came down. Then without warning a volley of rain began to pour down upon their heads.

Orecchiette and Pappardelle strode through the city streets, kicking up puddles - or rather, Orecchiette did the striding, whereas Pappardelle did her best to follow along. 

Soon, the tarmac gave way to brown sand, thoroughly wetted and firm with footprints from the visitors that had finally given up on their beach trip and packed up for home. Orecchiette lifted his hood and scanned the coastline.

&#39;Four...five groups.&#39; He counted the silhouettes in the distance, distorted by the rain. &#39;Let us start from the leftmost one.&#39;

But I&#39;m fine with that.&quot; She replied, stating her own preference as she followed Orecchiette to the leftmost group.

Nothing much, just a pair of tanned women in bikins with distraught and disappointed faces. It seemed like they were intent on getting a tan in the blistering heat, but were caught off guard by the sudden influx of rain.

&quot;How foolish.&quot; Pappardelle chided once the woman had left. &quot;Their tan is already perfect, yet they insist on scorching their bodies more? There is such a rule as too much of a good thing, wouldn&#39;t you agree, Orecchiette?&quot; She said while lightly tapping his arm with her elbow. Was this her attempt at small talk to pass the time? Maybe she had already accepted that her hunch could possibly be wrong.

Unbeknownst to the two, however, their target was lurking dangerously close... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When the rain came down, Larks inspiration soared. In Olympia, rain was a forgotten dream and the sun was the cruel reminder. Clouds might let one escape the reality for a few moments, but there was never a reprieve. 

Save for today. Whatever the cause, rain poured down from heaven itself. Lancer might’ve thought it unfortunate, but the man in the chair was in the midst of a new reality.

Geeves got up to avoid getting his trousers wet <em>and</em> too sandy. “You can stop—“

Notes were cut short. The entire song changed. No longer was it a background noise, but front and center. Calm and reserved chords changed to hurried ones, for each drop of rain that came. Not frantic, but definitely fast. 

The ‘chorus’ repeated in on itself as Lark stood from his chair. With closed eyes, he played with a measured intensity only seen in performances. Instead of the two person audience, he was now playing for the entire sky and ocean. A concert of grand proportions.

Which was well and good and all, but how did that tie in with the pasta pair? 

They would notice as one of the groups of people, specifically the closest, would have one member stand up from a chair, violin in hand and a song to play. Not only that, but a golden haired fellow built like a truck accompanied them. They had no clue to their presence. Talk about ‘painting a target on your back’, they shone a spotlight on their position! What to do now…</span>

He noticed the two strangers approaching and by the manner of their dress and the way they held themselves, it was clear they were not here to enjoy the water. Subtly signaling to his master and the butler, Uther spoke just loud enough for only them to hear. “Lark, Geeves, wisen up. We have company. Remember what I taught you, keep you and him safe if it comes to it.” Turning to face the approaching group, but not yet approaching them Lancer called out. “Seems the beachfront has been plagued with sudden showers, I hope this ruined your day out together. We ourselves were about to pack up and move along, I might suggest you do the same before you run into too much trouble being out here.” Uther was ready to react at a moment’s notice, though he was willingly to be relatively diplomatic unless otherwise provoked. Something about these two seemed off, for one neither of them felt like a servant and yet Lancer could sense a dangerous aura emanating from them. Hopefully his master will perform far more dutifully this time around. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span>

It hinders my performance and turns changing in and out of my uniform a challenge.&#39; He looked at Pappardelle, motioning for her to move along the beach. 

&#39;You are knowledgeable on the matter, are there such things called perfect tans?&#39; He commented as they approached the next group of soggy tourists, which turned out to be two guys who had buried themselves in the sand and struggling to get out. 

&#39;They don&#39;t look to be Master and Servant material to me,&#39; He said, frowning as one of them started swearing something fierce about wet sand in their pants. He walked over, knelt down, and started preaching.

&#39;Language.&#39; He warned him, raising a finger to his own lips. &#39;You are disturbing-&#39;

Energetic violin notes rolled along the beach, easily empowering the pit-pattering of rain and entering his ears.

&#39;-the music.&#39; He concluded, turning towards the source of the sound.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle gave her pupil a side glance, taken aback by his blunt statement. Did the subject of tans really interest him that much? 

&quot;Well, technically speaking, no, but-&quot; Before she could finish, she was interrupted by two rowdy tourists whining about sand and its various complications.

&quot;Hmph. I swear, how do people even get stuck like that?&quot; She asked her student, before being attracted to the noise of the melody nearby. Orecchiette had followed suit, turning his head around as the two stared in the distance like alert deers.

Their line of sight would then be cut off by the appearance of a man. Blond and tall, with an imposing aura. The type that wouldn&#39;t be out of place in the Olympian aristocracy. 

He had called them out and taken their attention. Yet, it was apparent from their armour that they were more than met the eye.

A Servant.

They addressed the two Church officials and warned them about the incoming rain. A fair bit of advice, yet not one that Pappardelle particularly cared for.

&quot;That is already quite apparent, Servant. I can tell from my soggy clothes.&quot; She replied in a blunt tone, walking forward as she attempted to approach Uther on her own. &quot;But since we&#39;ve already broken the ice, I suppose I might as well ask a few questions: Class and True Name?&quot;

It was a sudden request, and something that would most likely not please Uther at all. This stranger was asking him about his most important details? Perhaps his hunch was right...

&quot;We are acting under the Church&#39;s authority. Class and True Name, please.&quot; Pappardelle repeated, trying to act assertive, albeit it only walked halfway due to her short stature.</span>

Orecchiette strode up to Pappardelle and gripped her shoulder, pulling her back gently but firmly. He did not appreciate his supervisor being within arm&#39;s reach of a Republic-issued Servant, especially one who seemed to be on full alert. 

&#39;My day is hardly ruined, but your concern is appreciated, knight class Servant.&#39; He addressed the man in the suit of armor. &#39;And the violist.&#39; He pointed out the obvious. &#39;You two fit the witnesses&#39; description of Olympia&#39;s Lancer and their Master nicely.&#39;

He cocked his head to the side next and studied their last company, a sharply dressed man with an overabundance of sand stuck to his posterior. Witnesses hadn&#39;t mentioned anything about him, and he seemed way too relaxed to be a hostage.

&#39;Who are you?&#39; He greeted Geeves normally. &#39;Your presence was uncalled for.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Geeves stiffened as soon as Lancer made him aware of the two individuals that approached them. Dressed in Holy Church attire, a serious look on their faces... 

They were here on official business, and make no mistake about what it could be. Lark might’ve glossed over the rules before he entered, but the butler was more wise about the affair. A few nights spent hunched over the kitchen table revealed all the intricacies and guidelines of this Holy Grail War, what to do and what not to do.

And on the fateful day he decided to hang back, Lark went and broke a rather serious one: potential harm to civilians. 

The way they greeted them further hinted at what was to come. When the word ‘witness’ dropped, it was all but officially confirmed that the Holy Church was here to reprimand the dastardly duo. 

<em>’Who are you? Your presence was uncalled for.’</em>

Geeves did his best to act prim and proper, now straight as a stick and a fixed tie. “I am the hired help of my liege, right here,” he motioned to Lark, who had not stopped playing since their arrival, “and my presence was requested by the previously mentioned. Which makes it called for, even if not by you.”

He went even further, as he stepped forward to put himself between Lancer and the man who stepped forward. “And I would like to request that you state your name and business before coming any closer. Not that I am as ignorant as to pretend to not even have a crumb of an idea as to why you are gracing us with your presence.”

If Lark was aware of the happenings right behind, he showed no signs of acknowledgement. Too absorbed in his own mind as he played on without a care in the world. There was something about this rain that enamored him, to ignore the world around as he matched the rhythm of the steady fall of rain upon the land. Even worse, his music reached new volumes which started to threaten to drown out the conversation. How obnoxious!</span>

Lancer remained unfazed by the one church representative’s harsh tone with him. This was not the first time someone who felt they had authority challenged the kingdom. With that in mind, Uther had to be cautious enough for the two men under his protection. One was merely a butler the other was so lost in his own headspace that he likely didn’t realize people had even approached. How much easier would this be if Lancer didn’t have to be the proverbial baby sitter. Regardless, he held his stance and spoke to them in a relatively even and regal tone. “Although I will give you marks on your positions within the church, I must agree with my associate here. I would feel far more comfortable holding a conversation with you both if you revealed your names and intentions first. After all, you approached us first. It is common practice for the initiator of a deeper interpersonal conversation to introduce themselves to mitigate the sensation of hostility. However, as a showing of good faith I shall that my container is that of the Lancer class.” 

His eyes peered back and forth between the two individuals in front of him and Geeves. Uther looked for any sign of aggression or potential of an attack. If there was a way for this situation to be solved diplomatically, he wished to at least try. Although</span>

Desperately he tried to reach out to him, even through a feeling of will that he tried to radiate out through the ether. Any sort of hope that could get Lark’s attention. Thats when it hit the king. “Are you certain you two don’t want to go inside somewhere, it’s a mighty downpour with several flashes of lighting. Simply being out here is quite dangerous. I’d hate for anything to happen that might potentially lead to us getting severely harmed.”</span>

Effort for trying does not beget punishment, as far as I&#39;m aware. Though if you insist-&#39; 

And insist Geeves did, stepping up to slot himself perfectly between his group and the church as Lark&#39;s melody took a sharp turn. For a man too absorbed in his own world to mind his surroundings, his musical awareness was surprisingly on point.

Orecchiette, on the other hand, sported a look of puzzlement on his face.

&#39;Is this your idea of humor?&#39; He questioned Geeves. &#39;We <em>were</em> at the perfect distance for conversations and executing orders. Any closer, and I would need to reevaluate my own intentions. You are not giving me that option.&#39; He chided him, then looked towards the only other person with an ear to lend.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle had remained silent so far, content with observing how Orecchiette handled things. The three men at the beach would be surprised to see the nun start jotting down notes even in the rain. Even more interesting was the fact that the speed of her pen was directly proportional to the time they spent talking. Was she writing down the entire conversation?

&quot;Lancer class and a violist.&quot; Eventually, she stopped, closing her notebook and staring at Uther with vigilant eyes. &quot;Curiously, the description of the Servant that was involved in an off-limits fight just a few days ago also matches that of a Lancer.&quot;

She pointed out, making it undoubtably clear that she was doubling down on Orecchiette&#39;s assessment. She then turned to Geeves.

&quot;Unless you are a high rank official of the Church, I suggest you avoid inserting yourself in the conversation, civilian.&quot; Pappardelle stated. &quot;We are currently on the lookout for a Lancer Servant and their Master who have broken the laws regarding the City Grail War. Said Master is a musician known for playing the violin. You two match this description perfectly.&quot;

She then turned to Orecchiette, a glance that he would notice. Her expectant eyes gave him the signal that he should be ready for any possible trouble ahead of him.

&quot;So, by the decree of the Church, I demand you two to follow us to a police station and testify about where you were on that day. If you are proven innocent, you shall simply be released. If you are proven guilty, however, you shall be expelled from the Grail War. Unless you have other plans in mind?&quot; She asked, almost as if provoking them to disagree.</span>

It was spontaneous, intuitive, a privilege every supervisor would strive for. Pappardelle was no different. Before imparting her loaded judgement to the trio, she shot the executor a meaningful look that lasted a smidge too long to be coincidental. Orecchiette had proven to be observant on multiple occasions; she did not even doubt for a second that he would miss her message.

Unfortunately, they were not quite at that stage of trust yet.

&#39;The police station?&#39; The executor chimed in before the severity of her words had completely set in. &#39;There was no mention of us reporting directly to them in the handbook. Is this a new protocol I wasn&#39;t aware of?&#39;</span>

That was what Pappardelle had learned at her workplace filled with spam e-mails that were as fraudulent as they came. She wasn&#39;t below using such an underhanded strategy if it would help her achieve her goals. All she needed to do was wait for the Lancer&#39;s reaction and see how they approached the threat.

Of course, this was the plan until Pappardelle&#39;s logic completely flew over her pupil&#39;s head. Orecchiette stared at her superior in disbelief, believing her to have made a mistake. He so graciously corrected her, which in turn made the nun&#39;s plan a bust.

Pappardelle gawked at him, as if wishing he would just shut up for once. &quot;Ahem! You&#39;ll have to apologize my pupil. He is rather inexperienced when it comes to correct Church procedure.&quot; She harrumphed, ignoring Orecchiette and doing her best to maintain eye contact with Lancer and their Master.</span>

If Lark had heard that, he’d be downright upset! Downtrodden! Outright depressed! He’d be inconsolable for days, weeks even. 

Fortunately, he was lost inside his own head, song heading towards a final climax. It was easy to tell, as each note got louder but more drawn out. There would be an explosive finish and no mistake.

Geeves made no attempt to stop the musician. Instead, he doubled down foolishly, “I am not affiliated with The Church, but the way you are making things up leads me to believe you aren’t either. I, Geeves, Hired Help of the de Allegro family, have no intentions of what you refer to. Perhaps you have a photo of the so called ‘criminals’? Or written proof as to the perpetrators identities? Do you even have papers identifying your reach over civilians? If not, then I can confidently say that you may move along and, personally, do try to keep your shoes dry.”

If either of them had any idea on how to tell if someone was lying, it’d be as clear as… clouds, that Geeves was absolutely up to his eyes with mistruths and detours.  He had absolute confidence though, which was surely a surprise. In their eyes, a bystander was going out of their way to defend two clearly identified culprits with stubbornness only seen in donkeys and Olympia’s iron-grip heat. The tension-filled music signaled only one possible end to this encounter unless the pasta pair desired a different future.</span>

Although clearly out of his depth, the man was fighting his hardest to stand up for the two of them. A small part of the king wished that he might have been the one to summon him. Geeves had the tenacity, intelligence, and heart of someone worthy to be his master. A sentiment that slowly was setting in more and more as the music continued to play behind them. This is the second time in so many days that Lark has been willfully oblivious to the danger presented around him. How he has managed to wipe his own ass without getting a paper cut was anyone’s guess. If this was to be the final stop on their journey through the grail war, Uther was more than confident it would be due in no small part to Lark’s negligence. Even still, despite what his growing personal feeling may be, Uther has a contract with this man and a knight always follows through with his word. It is for that reason that Lancer intended to do all he could to keep these two men safe, not for Lark but in spite of him.

All the feigned threats towards the group seemed to carry no physical reaction upon Uther’s face. In fact, he merely nodded his head listening to all that the accusers said. Based on the way the one individual was writing everything down gave the impression that they were hanging on every word and action that took place. It was not a stretch to surmise that they were building a case against them. He did not want this to end in a fight, but it vary well may be inevitable. 

Once they concluded their demands, Uther patted Geeves shoulder once more before responding “Sir Geeves is rather protective of me and the man over there. I believe we ages to verify that you are who you say</span>

If they were going to rumble, Uther was not going to throw the first punch.</span>

The strategy was sound. From the looks of it, only one of the two seemed to be proficient in psychological warfare. The other...well, let&#39;s just say that he still required some training in the art of subtlety.

Pappardelle would no doubt be frustrated. Not only had Orecchiette undermined her interrogation, it had also encouraged both the Servant and the bystander-slash-manservant to double down on their denial of any allegations towards the oblivious Master. And now they were asking for proof. Throwing around excuses. Denying the Church&#39;s authority by feigning ignorance. All standard procedures in negotiation, but a skill that Orecchiette sorely lacked from his skewed curriculum. He was no lawyer. How could he possibly make a comeback under Geeves&#39; and Uther&#39;s combined cross examination?

The executor looked at the man and Servant and smiled.

&#39;You aren&#39;t affiliated with the Church, but I am. Therefore, my authority to act overrides that of a civilian and a Servant.&#39; He stated plainly and effectively, sounding every bit as confident as his words. The idea that he needed to prove himself with flimsy papers was simply unheard of, laughable, <em>insane</em>. It was so ridiculous that he did not even bother with an explanation. After all, could there be any better proof than his and Pappardelle&#39;s very existence?

He turned to the Servant and nodded. &#39;Your loyalty is acknowledged and appreciated. Rest assured that we are not here to command you in his place. According to the rules agreed upon by both Olympia and Delphi, the punishment for endangering civilians is as simple as decommissioning the responsible Servant unit...&#39;

He had witnessed the motion all too many times on the battlefield; with or without the cloak, he could picture it with absolute clarity.

Orecchiette had drawn his sword.

Or, to be more precise, the polished blade of a silver rapier, straight and narrow and plain to the naked eye. No intricate patterns wrought into the blade and no gemstones twinkling on its leaf-like hilt. An artifact that looked like a store-bought Christmas gift, without an ounce of magical energy. Yet alarms raised in Uther&#39;s head, warning him not to near its point.

&#39;Permission to decommission the Servant.&#39; Orecchiette asked - no, <em>requested,</em> but only after he had withdrawn the rest of the sword from its sheath. Despite never having summoned a Servant before, <em>something</em> was telling Pappardelle that this was decidedly <em>not</em> the correct way to dispose of the Servant. Something like...the instruction manual that came with every S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, complete with the Servant deactivation hotline.

Her supervisee had clearly overstepped.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle raised an eyebrow at Geeves&#39; attempts of keeping them away. It was clear that he was intending on defending the violin player, most likely because they were a servant of the Allegro family. She could not help but feel pity for the man, using words of logic and reason to defend people who had clearly broken the tournament&#39;s rules.

If only logic alone were enough to solve problems. Unfortunately, both Geeves and Lark would find out, soon enough, that being logical was not enough of a deterrent against modern problems.

&quot;I see. I am glad that you have an able talker in your midst. <strong>It will help the interrogation go over smoothly.</strong>&quot; Pappardelle threatened, an icy aura surrounding her words as she seemed unfazed by Geeves&#39; own.

&quot;I&#39;ll be able to personally attest to my Church credentials at the police station, so feel free to follow us. This is an order.&quot; She said, before Uther interrupted the conversation and had his own say on the current state of events.

Pappardelle was ready to reply to the Servant, until Orecchiette took initiative and replied first. His attitude shocked her, as he instinctively brought out his sword and asked for permission to engage in battle. She couldn&#39;t believe it: Did he not know about the proper way to decommission S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames? A kill switch was the most reliable method.</span>

...But she relented from saying anything. Yes, this worked quite nicely. Orecchiette was always a weird fellow to her, but he was no fool and his confidence was infectious. Despite his odd behaviour, he had successfully taken down the entirety of Persepolis in one fell swoop.

Pappardelle&#39;s hand twitched. All it wanted to do was observe Orecchiette in battle and meticulously describe his prowess through text on a notepad. It was a selfish desire, yet one that she quickly warped to a logical one: Letting Orecchiette challenge Lancer would prove their authority as members of the Church, while simultaneously giving her more information on Orecchiette&#39;s habits and combat style. Two birds with one stone.

&quot;...Permission granted. Avoid harming civilians and prioritize the Master if possible. If this Servant is above third-rate, then they will attempt to defend their Master anyway.&quot; Pappardelle said, eyeing Lark and Uther.

&quot;These are your <strong>Holy Orders</strong>, Orecchiette. Execute them to the greatest of your ability. I am your sword, and your shield, so use me as your see fit!&quot; She shouted, declaring battle with a single cry. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At least the idea was there. It was only natural for representatives of The Holy Church to utilize the fact that since they were, they had no other need to show proof. What better way to show verification of this fact than to say so? Even further, the one most forward, declared the course of action and shuffled under their cloak. Geeves had no clue as to what that entailed until the rapier was revealed.

No fanfare, no knick knacks. Not even a display of skill with any fancy movements. The toothpick was drawn, and a request to decommission the servant was put out. The butler took a step backward and dodged the Servant, even if only by a hair. Perhaps he had messed with the wrong person…

Meanwhile, Lark was in his own battle: one of attention. His mind had already proven to be impenetrable by word alone. It would take a physical response or the end of his impromptu piece to bring him back to the real world. What would even cause such a lack of awareness in the first place, anyway?

In his head, Lark stood atop the ocean itself. A glass pane blocked him from the churning depths, invisibly strong. Rain continued to pour down, a million times stronger than what was actually allowed to leave the sky. It passed through the glass with no effort. The salty air stung his lungs, the waves that crashed into each other enveloped his mind and deafened everything but the line of notes that streamed through his neurons. Not even the smell of danger was enough to arouse him outside this trance.

And above all else was this… feeling, for lack of a better term. The forces of nature were allowed out of their cage from whatever outside source, and it churned the inner depths of the musician&#39;s mind unlike anything ever had. Something more powerful than him displayed just a fraction of its raw power, and his brain ran away with the rest. Goosebumps coated his skin as the chills ran through every single muscle fiber, a clear path from head to core to legs to toes.</span>

He reached out, to grasp for the line of thought. He had felt this before, he swore! Just outside of reach, it taunted him. An answer to this problem, this nagging feeling… if he could just extend his arm the littlest bit further--

He would not get the chance. In the real world, Pappardelle gave the approval. The Executor would have free reign to relinquish the dangerous Servant from the mortal realm. It would take a miracle to escaped unharmed.

And Geeves aimed to deliver. One more step back as the command was given, and he was in range of the previously forgotten chair. Without warning, his foot came up and sent the chair flying right into Lark. It launched into his back, but there was no time to make sure his aim was true. One foot up, the other bent. He launched himself forward with the grace and agility of a lethargic snail. The target? Orechiette, of course! If no harm could come from civilians, and they saw him as nothing more, then he was the perfect shield.

And Lark would awaken from his inner mind, only to turn around and see his hired help in a dive bomb for a man with a rapier. What had gone on?</span>

The one drawing his blade showed that he was ready for a fight. Although it did not appear to be magical, the mere fact that either one of them was confident enough to face down a servant showed that there was likely more to them than meets the eye. It would not be a wise decision to underestimate them, some semblance of caution and strategy must be utilized here. However, if this was to be similar to the last bout, Uther may have to make it up as he goes along. 

Despite the lack of skill he possessed, Geeves still was willing to do what he could to help out. Lancer wished he wasn’t so ready to jump into a spike filled pit like his master, but perhaps the butler realized the same as he did. If they cared about keeping civilians uninvolved then perhaps they won’t be so willing to harm one. However, that could be a bluff and injuring a civilian could be nothing more than paperwork to them. Regardless, he was willing to fight and contribute and that goes a long way in the king’s mind. 

As the threat was thrown and the battle begun Lancer’s skill activated heightening his speed, strength, and endurance. Additionally both Geeves and Lark’s own endurance increased as well. The fight was under way and the high king was once again being called upon to be hisMaster’s sword and shield. Hopefully, he would stand sturdy once more. Based on the language used between the two opponents, they likely work in tandem to accent one another. If one has a</span>

Armor instantly appearing upon himself, his boot barely impacted into the sand before the king disappeared from sight. Dashing at his max speed he aimed directly for the one making all the notes, intending to clothesline them across their chest. Simultaneously, Lancer’s invisible air manifested upon Lark’s body once again, soon his master’s visual image and the items he carried upon his person faded from sight becoming virtually invisible. This was in theory a means to protect Lark for a brief period. He was aware that his master would most likely get involved, and he carried no real issue with that yet. This was meant to potentially give him the means to get to a more advantageous position to do his thing whether it be his musical magic or something else entirely.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The manservant had retaliated. Orecchiette observed his movements, sluggish and chock full of holes, too many to be a premeditated action. An experienced fighter wouldn&#39;t make such rookie mistakes. Their feints always had a purpose, and the openings they left for their opponents were always prone to exploitation simply by virtue of being too perfect. Orecchiette himself was an experienced fighter. He had suffered his fair share of defeats under his instructors by succumbing to this common pitfall.

He could tell that Geeves was no warrior. 

However, as old as he was, a full grown man&#39;s body weight was nothing to scoff at, especially when it was propelling towards him at a... Orecchiette matched the butler&#39;s pace with a rough estimate, then readjusted his assessment: the old man was only to be a slight inconvenience. 

Had the chair been aimed at him, perhaps things would have turned out differently. After all, what good did waking the artist do, when he still had one foot planted in la-la land and could do nothing but gawk? Besides, it wasn&#39;t as if Orecchiette was going after the Master.

Lancer responded in kind, armor manifesting over his body as he kicked off against the sand, leaving naught but a trail in his wake as he closed in on the Pastas with inhuman speed. His movement was too swift for the eye to follow, and certainly too fast for the body to respond.

If only it were unpredictable as well.

Unlike Geeves, Lancer was a warrior through and through. Cruel, efficient and cutthroat, even if those words did not befit him, he was no stranger to the language of the battlefield. Strike the enemy at their weakest. The simplest strategy was oftentimes the most effective. <em>Pappardelle was the glaring hole in the Church&#39;s defense. He would strike her down first.</em>

...And so Orecchiette theorized.

It would be foolish of him to think that Pappardelle, a white-collar typist with a gift for the pen, would be capable of fending against a knight class Servant. No doubt the Servant would aim for either her head or her heart. A shield strong enough to parry him - even a single blow would suffice.

Rapier in one hand, the Executor&#39;s other arm shot out towards Pappardelle&#39;s chest, where the cross-shaped tattoo in the center glowed in response to his proximity. <em>A shield,</em> he visualized the weapon he needed, calling it forth as his hand clamped down on the emerging hilt of-

<em><strong>Squish.</strong></em>

Soft. Round. Supple. As far removed from his visualization as it was sensible to fight on a rainy beach. Orecchiette&#39;s mind went blank as his body reacted on its own, his fingers hooking onto the belt on Pappardelle&#39;s chest and dragging the nun out of the predicted trajectory of Lancer&#39;s strike.

Then he threw her forward, into the suddenly more agile body of the senile butler.

&#39;...Your breast is in the way. Please do something about it.&#39; He protested loud enough for all to hear, then, without missing a beat, thrust his rapier towards the King&#39;s outstretched arm.

Unease gnawed at Uther. Despite the rapier&#39;s seemingly unassuming appearance, he couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that all was not as it should be. An unbranded toothpick, against his magical armor and increased endurance? 

Would he dare risk it?</span>

Of course, Pappardelle definitely didn&#39;t expect Geeves to throw himself in the fray, for he was the most vulnerable one of them all.

&quot;Hey, stop! Why throw your life away so recklessly?!&quot; She shouted, chastizing him from afar despite being on opposite sides. This momentary distraction was the perfect opportunity for Uther to lunge at a superhuman speed, catching Pappardelle completely offguard.

&quot;I-&quot; She muttered, reading herself for a blow that never came. She closed her eyes and prepared to endure it...only to feel something, no, <em>someone</em> rubbing her bosom. Near her tattoo, to be exact.

A gasp was all she could muster before Orecchiette tossed her towards Geeves, like discarded trash.

It took her several seconds to process what had just happened, enough for Orecchiette to humiliate her in front of her own opponents.

&quot;My breasts are perfectly fine, thank you! Do I need to schedule an eye appointment for you, oh so talented Orecchiette?&quot; She shouted back, incredulous and seething. That was <em>definitely</em> ending up on the report, much to Orecchiette&#39;s dismay.

The fact that she was able to shout that out before Geeves even collided with her was a testament to the man&#39;s physical prowess. He was like a fish in a large ocean, getting involved in a battle that was beyond him. Something that Pappardelle didn&#39;t quite respect.

The moment he collided with the woman, he felt a zap course through his entire body. It felt like his magical circuits had been turned into a circuitry board, with his nerves zapping and stinging. It was painful, but it ended the moment Pappardelle shoved him off and left the distance between the two around a few feet.</span>

Well…

The idea of the plan worked! Geeves managed to collide with one of the two, and they both went backward a few feet. Pappardelle might’ve been chastised for her bust, but the help was electrocuted for the contact. To put it lightly, it was certainly painful. Some would even describe it with a larger portion of colorful language, but that was against his code of ethics. So, he gritted his teeth and put up with it until he was forcefully shoved away.

He managed to <em>not</em> fall flat on his bum, which was a win in his book. Perhaps not the best physically, or even mentally-slash-emotionally at this point. The ‘nun’ spoke words of truth. He stood absolutely no chance against any sort of Church officials. But…

“I <strong>refuse!</strong>” he declared. “You are NOT the one who decides the actions I take! That is for my liege and me alone to decide. Not. <em>yoUUUUUUUUU</em>,” he cried out as he took another charge at the lady in front of him. There was surely some war god that wasn’t exactly thrilled with his engagement, but he made up for it with conviction and will. He was dead set on his ideals, and thus, he made himself an enemy of The Holy Church.</span>

Lark, on the other hand, was still not exactly sure what was going on. The male made some comment about his partners… Well, that wasn’t important! What <em>was</em> important was that Lancer had engaged the enemy with deadly intent! Or maybe the guy dressed in church attire had engaged them with deadly intent. 

But there was combat! Lark wasted no time in pressing the assault, as his music picked up once again with a continuation of his previous song. A battle was occurring, and there was no need to encourage the participants. Instead, they were granted the perfect battle song. The kinds you’d find over those epic fight scenes on TV where the action is intense and the song matches each person&#39;s strikes perfectly. He didn’t remember the medium, but Rose had shown it to him a couple times and it was what he tried to mimic.

As for the actual important stuff, his violin sang, and he listened. That all too familiar light poured out of the sigils, yet it wasn’t as grand and noticeable as previous times. The dark skies and ominous lighting harmed the effects more than helped. 

And then, he ran right at the pair just a dozen or so feet away. Faster than he had any right to move, come to think of it. Better yet, he was almost invisible to the naked eye. Perfect for his makeshift idea of engagement! Once he was close enough (which wasn’t long, scarily), he crescendo&#39;ed like crazy. The quiet note ramped up into the loudest sound possible, in tempo with the rain. She would find herself blasted on all sides by sudden and pretty extreme gust of air. 

Now it came down to her stance. If ready for anything, it would be nothing more than described. On the other hand, if she wasn’t prepared at all… it’d be as if a whirlwind threatened to whip her around! Not only that, but she’d be in no position to dodge the slower man approaching slowly...</span>

After their training, Uther expected Lark to put up a fight but he may potentially be out of his league, it was likely best to not let this be a long fight. These two needed to be dealt with quickly and efficiently. 

The excitable one seemed to be rather skilled for a human, he truly was the epitome of his people. His quick thinking and fast hands saved his ally from certain doom. However, he merely substituted himself in his partner’s place. Seemingly his intention was to skewer the King’s arm, and although there was no indicators upon the weapon. The fact that this man seemed to believe that it would have an effect on him was what most alerted Uther that something was not right. He knew all too well due to his time with Merlin that the most powerful of things are the ones that seem unassuming. Under normal circumstances he might have pressed forward with the attack, but this time Lancer aired on the side of caution instead employing the traditional fighting technique of parrying. 

Slowing down just enough in order to not finish with his clothesline, Uther quickly sidestepped and grasped onto Orecchiette’s striking arm, being mindful to not let the blade touch</span>

As the two of them crossed by each  other, Lancer let go of the arm, spun behind Orecchiette, and with a mighty clenched fist struck Orecchiette right between the shoulder blades to enact damage upon the neck and spine. Uther had no intention of pulling his punches, the aim was to either cripple or put an end to his opponent. They threatened them on a day where they were merely enjoying the beach, and accused them of a crime that they did not start. There was not much thought about what would occur afterwards, just that he needed to defend both himself and his master in this moment. This man was a top athlete, that much was certain, now it was time to determine how durable he was.</span>

Pappardelle&#39;s harrumph was a concession. A concession that Geeves had no idea on what he was getting himself into. That sort of naivety was foolish, if not downright harmful. Pappardelle wasn&#39;t heartless, but what if Geeves had accosted Orecchiette instead? She couldn&#39;t imagine what would have happened then...

She wanted the old man to <strong>stay down.</strong>

...The rain felt heavier.

&quot;It is true. You most certainly have free will at your disposal.&quot; Pappardelle remarked, accepting Geeves answer. &quot;However, that simply means that I, too, have the completely autonomy to shove you away. And I shall do just that.&quot;

Pappardelle raised a hand, as if preparing something. Of course, that&#39;s when Lark intervened, playing a deceptively sweet tune as the nun gave him her attention, but not enough of it to avoid the effect of his music.

&quot;What the-&quot; Her body lamented itself, feeling like it was trapped in a turbulent vortex. She was unable to move and Geeves was currently charging at her. Such a simple, basic attack, yet one that could possibly succeed. Even worse was the fact that she could not <em>see</em> Lark. She knew for a fact that the music was his, but the musician had all but vanished in the span of a few seconds. They weren&#39;t near Lancer either.

But that wasn&#39;t cause for concern.

&quot;...You&#39;re too late.&quot; Pappardelle struggled to say in her condition, but her hand remained poised. It was then that Geeves realized that the rain was definitely growing stronger. Way stronger than he had anticipated.

...Why was a cloud suddenly hovering next to him?</span>

No, it was no mere cloud. The surface was soft and white, but the insides were filled with sparks and circuitry. It resembled a motherboard or a chip with the amount of intricacy put into its details.

&quot;Behold. The state of the art Mystic Code, developed by the Church&#39;s scientific knowledge: The <strong>LED-Y-BUG!</strong>&quot; The nun gloated, clearly the type to show off her own achievements.

&quot;Prostrate yourself towards it, if you have to. Allow me to assist with that.&quot; She said with a confident smirk. While Lark had prevented her from moving, there was nothing stopping her own Mystic Code from acting.

<em>rumble rumble</em>

The cloud emanated a brief humming sound before a storm of electricity filled the area around Pappardelle. Bolts collided with Lark and Geeves simultaneously. It was a shocking experience, to say the least, as the two felt like they had been dropped into a bathtub filled with toasters. However, this pain lasted but a second before their body reminded them that they were still alive.

Was that all? Rather underwhelm-

Oh no.

Lark was the first one to notice. Geeves was still running, but for some reason he had strayed so far off his mark that...he was currently running towards him.

Even worse, Lark was now running towards Geeves. His superspeed was turning into a liability as Geeves had no idea that he was currently en route to collide with his friend. Despite his attempts to stop and remain still, some mysterious force kept dragging him towards his ally like a...

...like a magnet.</span>

No matter how talented of an executor Orecchiette was, he was still far behind a Servant. Pappardelle knew that well.

Her role was to tip the scales in their favour.

&quot;Orecchiette, proceeding to engage!&quot; Pappardelle shouted, loud for her pupil to hear.

Orecchiette wasn&#39;t naive enough to think his opponent would let him off easy. Knighthood was synonymous with homicide. Now that he had been blindsided, his back was fully exposed and his life, ripe for the picking.

The Executor steeled himself and activated the Church&#39;s Mark. 

The cross-shaped tattoo on his chest glowed, a giant summoning array manifesting over its elaborate design. Meanwhile, Uther&#39;s fist smashed into Orecchiette&#39;s neck, bringing the man down to his knees with a grunt - but that was as far as he could push. Orecchiette&#39;s bones rattled dangerously against the force of the impact, but in the end, his body managed to hold on.

Was there some type of fortification magecraft at work? Perhaps a defensive Mystic Code, or a combination of both? It seemed that Uther needed to push further if he were to unravel the secret behind this man&#39;s physique. 

Regardless, the Executor was clearly trained for this. Not just to fight, but also to endure. Though he was stunned, he was prepared for the blow: he brought his free arm up to pin the Knight&#39;s fist over his neck, then swung his sword arm around and shoved its fine tip into Uther&#39;s arm.

The rapier met no resistance upon meeting Uther&#39;s magical armor, penetrating it as if it were made of water and proceeding to impale its wearer&#39;s forearm. 

Pain blossomed where the rapier met flesh and bone, yet Uther still couldn&#39;t detect a single ounce of magical energy from the weapon. There was no other mechanisms at work, and no hidden curse to paralyze the King&#39;s body. It almost felt as if the act of skewering was the only thing the metal toothpick was capable of.

Could it really be that simple?

He turned around to face the Servant, holding him by the &#39;leash&#39; that was his rapier. The summoning array over his chest had fully expanded. He placed his hand over it and withdrew from its depths a single pistol engraved in runic patterns. Massive amounts of mana coalesced within its chambers, ready to let loose at a moment&#39;s notice. 

Unlike the rapier, Uther could tell at a glance that the pistol was a weapon crafted to hurt.

Blessed by their proximity, it took Orecchiette no time to line up the shot. &#39;M104 Prototype Bateleur Mk-I. Test run against single Lancer class Servant at point blank range.&#39; He announced calmly, then pulled the trigger. 

A single bullet was let loose, crackling with a greenish electric current as it raced towards Lancer&#39;s torso. Not to kill, but to incapacitate Lancer by interfering with the underlying, corporeal S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame that served as the modern day Servant&#39;s vessel. If Republic had spent the past century researching how to build the perfect Servant frame, then the Holy Empire had worked just as hard on the technology to disable them when the need arises. 

A necessary preventative measure, so to speak.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle was held in place! That left Geeves able to tackle her and--

Why was he getting closer?

It took a bit longer than he would’ve admitted in order to process the chain required for this to occur. If he had to guess, that lightning shock (which hurt like no other, mind you!) had increased their magnetism towards each other. That’s how it worked, right? He only remembered the basics of the concept. 

Regardless, they were only a few seconds away from impact. It would surely put the two in a bind if they collided head on. Geeves would, with no harm meant, be dead weight in this battle if the person he was attached to was on <em>his</em> side. But if he stopped his spell to slow down the impact, he might not have time to get over to Lancer and stop him from being deactivated. Not to mention how is Violin would withstand an impact, with no time to move it out of the way. 

...But what if they didn’t collide <em>immediately</em>? It would have to be timed almost perfectly, and it still might not help, yet the other options weren’t ideal either. This would have to work, or else they were toast in more ways than one!

The pair were a moment away from impact by now. Lark at mach one, Geeves at a less relative but still fast pace. Lark waited. Closer… closer…

Now!

He mustered up all the muscle accumulated over the last week from his nightly training sessions with Lancer and <em>sidestepped</em> his butler at the last second, to avoid an impromptu hug. It worked, even if barely. Geeves would feel his inertia swing like crazy, from directly behind himself to just in front. However, that was just fine.

Lark took a few tentative steps forward as the pair finally collided to soften the blow. Now they were connected by the back instead of the front, and with none of the necessary rearrangement. 

“Lark?!” Geeves called out as he whipped his head to try and see what the blazes hit him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“No time to explain, move!” Lark responded as he moved himself forward. Geeves had no choice but to follow along, albeit at a painfully slow pace. Lark had to slow himself down in order to make sure the manservant didn’t fall and take out his own legs. 

So, they could only watch as the lady zoomed forward to help her own partner in crime, now looking to… shoot Lancer?! They’d never get there to help in time before the nun arrived and shut him down for good. 

Both men had a solution for this issue, and they complimented each other well.

“Watch out Lancer!” Lark called. The music stopped for a brief moment as his hand went to his belt. Out came a wicked knife, with doodles drawn all over the blade’s side. No one else could see them, and it was better that was. He had taken the liberty of drawing a whole bunch of not nice things that Lancer surely did not approve of.

“Lark, you must bond with Lancer!” Geeves gasped. His own position was a lot more strained. To keep up with Lark, even at a pace more manageable, was difficult to keep up while going backwards. His brain, on the other hand, combed through his magical knowledge. Bonding with a Servant was usually not worth it, as the requirements from the Servant, as well as irreparable damage if it went wrong meant it was more risk than reward. However, in a Holy Grail War where risk was both necessary and expected from the participants…

Lark processed this information after he had already done his side of the plan. With a flick of the wrist, the knife flew upwards. It spun beautifully, catching the rain and minimal light for a vague disco effect on the area. The musician had no time to admire it, for he had to ready up another air blast. On himself. The tricked worked okay enough, with the blade sent to it’s receiver at the other side of the fight. Aim could’ve been better, as it was either going to hit Orecchiette or Lancer himself. 

“...Bond?” he asked.</span>

The blade pierce through the king’s arms, and as suspected it bypassed his defenses. The weapon was likely made in a way to counteract the makeup of a servant. So be it, this executor seemed eager and excited to fight the man. Based on his movements and fighting style, it seemed he wished to treat Lancer like a rag doll. Surely he didn’t expect such an endeavor to be so easily done. The executor may be the top among his peers and hold some useful weaponry, however, an opponent is not simply going to roll over and die when attacked, especially not a knight and a king. 

The assumption was that Orecchiette had him by a leash based on skewering Uther’s arm, tis but a flesh wound in the grand scheme of combat. In truth, it payed little mind to Uther. The needle could only skewer, not slash or cut, meaning that if Orecchiette wished to puppet Lancer he’d have to exceed the King’s strength. Besides, Uther had three other limbs that were not occupied. As the gun began to raise, Uther did recognize the magical nature of it and as he did with the needle he was not</span>

Lancer grabbed the executor by the wrist and forced his arm up in the air as the trigger was pulled. He really shouldn’t announce attacks before enacting them, especially when one knows how fast their opponent is. With his other arm Uther exerted his strength once more and reached forward grabbing tightly upon the throat of Orecchiette squeezing with his servant strength. However, that would not satisfy the king for he saw the nun dashing forward to aid their ally and knew this was a fight where he’d have to end both of them. Luckily, also in the corner of his eye he saw a flying dagger emerging from the ether in their direction. What was to happen next needed to be precise in order to get the most out of this combined teamwork of Uther and Lark. 

With his grip still tight on the wrist holding the gun, Lancer angled it in a way so that the dagger blade would strike the back of Orecchiette’s palm, hopefully in some way affecting his</span>

Knowing it’ll be of little use to him at this moment Uther mentally stole away the invisible air from Lark and moved the wind manipulation right between Papperdelle and her cloud, creating a defensive wall of whipping razor sharp air that cut her and her mystic code off from each other. 

As she expected to run upon the two fighting men, Uther decided to bring the fight to her. Kicking his feet in the dirt once again, Lancer dashed forward with Orecchiette in tow directly at Papperdelle. Speed equal to how it was before Uther attempted to smash the man in his vise grip against his charging ally using Orecchiette as a riot shield against her. However, that was not the end of it as Lancer intended to drive them both through the air wall that had just been created. The wind ripping and tearing into both opponents as it danced harmlessly against Uther himself. This was not likely to kill them per say, but it would definitely hurt. 

Due to the proximity of the three of them being together, especially with Uther physically having a hold on Orecchiette, to use the lightning mystic code would like lead to two if not all three of them being electrocuted together. It was an unorthodox way of fighting, but if it did damage and put him and his master in a better position, Uther was willing to try anything to keep Lark safe. He put trust in his king and tried to defend him, the least Lancer could do was offer the same in return. They had to come together and bond, if they were going to win the day.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Orecchiette had exceptional strength for a human, but in the face of a Knight class Servant, he was still severely outmatched. The bullet veered off course, and now the Servant grabbed his wrist in a vice grip, preventing him from lining up a second shot. 

But that wasn&#39;t all.

The next thing he knew, he was raised into the air and marched across the sand, with Uther holding him by the neck. Veins popped in his neck, at his cheeks, and he began to choke as the hand constricted his neck, shutting off his breath. He could only guess where the Servant was taking him. Judging by the cacophony of music, zapping and yelling alike, he was starting to get a clearer picture of the dumpster fire behind him. 

Now, why would Lancer march him <em>towards</em> his Master and the manservant, knowing full well that he had no intention of dealing with either of them?

The answer stared at him in the face. It wasn&#39;t Lark or Geeves that Lancer had wanted. It was his supervisor, the pen pusher who didn&#39;t even have the strength to lift his suitcase. Lancer was planning to take them both out in one go!

Orecchiette discarded his gun. The dagger embedded itself into his palm, but that did not matter in the grand scheme of things. If Uther was kind enough to chaperone him towards his supervisor, then who was he to say no to such a generous offer?

The Executor extended his free arm backwards and beckoned to Pappardelle. If she knew any better, she would know exactly where to be.

After all, he <em>did</em> just teach her the proper conduct of being an Executor&#39;s armory.

This time, Orecchiette&#39;s hand did not miss the mark, thanks to the combined effort between him and the nun, who was most likely still conscious about Orecchiette&#39;s scathing, but completely candid remarks. She must&#39;ve been determined to not let her assets become a problem the second time round, and Orecchiette...well, he simply did not have the luxury to think, did he?

The Executor was upon Pappardelle in an instant. His arm penetrated her chest effortlessly, <em>sinking</em> into the summoning array instead of staying outside. The sensation of connection intensified, leaving Pappardelle with the horrifying visage of being impaled by her own colleague. Was this legal? Had this been <em>tested</em>? Did Orecchiette impale her <em>knowing</em> that the summoning array wouldn&#39;t bar his entry, or was he completely relying on luck?

While Pappardelle&#39;s mind was frazzled with unnecessary thoughts, Orecchiette swung his arm around himself, violently dragging the nun out of his path and flinging her in the opposite direction. Pappardelle&#39;s summoning array crackled with violet sparks; as she was flung away, so did Orecchiette&#39;s arm leave her cleavage, now grasping the hilt of a mechanical broadsword. Thanks to the awkward position from which he withdrew the sword, he was now gripping it like a giant dagger rather than wielding it like a sword.

But that did not matter. Orecchiette had not brought the sword out for a proper duel. He continued with the swing, smashing the flat side of the blade into Uther&#39;s arm.

The runic patterns along the blade glowed an eerie green. Sparks flew upon contact. Green electric currents danced on Uther&#39;s armor until they found the rapier lodged deep within his arm. A numbing sensation spread from his wound as electricity coursed through his arm, past his shoulder, and continued to expand into his torso.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was Pappardelle&#39;s duty to assist her executor, no matter their set of grievances or flaws. A supervisor&#39;s role was to whip executors into shape, and while Orecchiette seemed to be the type that was completely flawless by the Church&#39;s code of conduct, she still wanted to support him as much as she could.

Especially when he was currently losing.

<em>&quot;...Did I have too much confidence in him?&quot;</em> She thought to herself, seeing at how Uther dodged Orecchiette&#39;s secret pistol and instead choking him by the neck. He lost his weapon too after a vicious stab to the palm. From her point of view, her pupil was in extreme danger.

She got even closer, noticing that Lark and his gramps had given up on tailing her and were instead focusing down on Orecchiette as well. The pressure was on and she thought about attacking them to gain Lancer&#39;s attention.

Unfortunately, she had already obtained it. Contact with LED-Y-BUG was soon lost as she felt unable to even access her cloud&#39;s records due to the presence of Invisible Air. In fact, the spinning tornado of pure wind was close to her location. They would make contact in-

<em>Her breasts were fondled yet again.</em>

Though this time, Orecchiette did a better job at actually hitting her tattoo. The summoning array served as a guidance as he dragged out one of his various weapons.

Her eyes met his for a split second, before he promptly tossed her away. For her own good, of course.

<em>&quot;Could you make the landing any better?&quot;</em> Frustrated thoughts filled her head, along with those of second-hand embarrassment as she landed safely away from the two fighters. Maybe she had worried after nothing. At least, she thought so, until Orecchiette collided with the wind wall.

That had to hurt. She wondered if the Lancer was the type to spare his enemies or kill them.

But neither of those options would occur, since she would make sure to protect her pupil.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Orecchiette, to the left.&quot; She shouted back, much to Orecchiette&#39;s surprise. Her fingers made subtle motions as she raised her arm. Orecchiette could barely see while being hit by the wind, but he could definitely hear. An order from a supervisor was absolute, so he lightly turned his body to the left.

That was enough for Pappardelle to take aim.

<em>&quot;I&#39;m part of your fight too.&quot;</em>

She then closed her fist as both Uther and Orecchiette sensed a powerful surge of mana permeating the air around them. It was a far cry from the spells cast moments ago. Lark&#39;s musical Magecraft. Pappardelle&#39;s magnetic Magecraft. No, this was something far more primal. Something coming from the depths of nature itself. A pure type of Magecraft that could rival Uther&#39;s own wind.

There had been a suspicion filling Orecchiette&#39;s mind in the last few weeks. Most people wouldn&#39;t notice it, but his executor classes had trained him in noticing the subtleties in human body languages and movements. One thing he always saw but never pointed out was the odd discrepancy between Pappardelle&#39;s arms: One of them was used far less often. Both in note taking and in other daily tasks. It could simply be a case of it not being her dominant hand, but...

To him, it just looked like someone not wanting to exert themselves. And for good reason.

Part of her Church attire ripped off as Pappardelle revealed a bandaged arm hiding underneath her uniform. No wonder she always insisted on covering herself even in the scorching heat.

Sparks of lightning and magical energy irradiated the field, coming from Pappardelle&#39;s arm as the rain surrounding the beach started to turn into a thunderstorm. This type of spell was undoubtably powerful. Why would a pencil pusher know of such a technique?

Even better, <strong>did she know of the cost that came with casting it?</strong></span>

&quot;Servant, Lancer. You have shown a great display of chivalry today.&quot; Pappardelle gave words of praise as she raised her illuminiscent arm. 

&quot;So I would be honored to add an even bigger accomplishment to your resume. I encourage you to take the full brunt of my attack.&quot; Pappardelle said as she now pointed her arm at him, ready to fire a concentrated bolt of pure lightning. Nobody knew if it was enough to stop a Servant dead in its tracks, but it certainly had a lot of mana behind it.

It erupted from her arm like a raging volcano. It perforated his back, not strong enough to kill or damage his Spirit Core, but it still felt painful and tingly. Shocks coursed throughout the entirety of his back, enhancing the paralyzing effect contained in Orecchiette&#39;s sword. He felt like a marble statue, unable to move at all.

&quot;Whatever it is you wanted to do. Do it now!&quot; Pappardelle shouted, message clearly intended to Orecchiette.</span>

The defensive runes inscribed inside his shirt activated in reponse, but with a series of resounding <em><strong>cracks</strong></em>, a few of them already broke, unable to withstand the prolonged exposure to the air grinder.

Orecchiette counted the defective runes in silence. How much longer did he have until every single one of them broke down? How much longer until Pappardelle&#39;s magecraft set in? He hadn&#39;t counted on the nun to pitch in. The fact that she could perform magecraft - and not just any magecraft, but a spell that could rival the effect of the Church&#39;s tech - had also genuinely shocked her. 

However, fact stands that Pappardelle had effectively halved the time it&#39;d take for paralysis to set into a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. Orecchiette felt Lancer&#39;s grip slacken. He pulled the rapier out of Uther&#39;s arm, then pried his hand away from his neck. His back was still ravaged by the wind wall, but without Lancer actively grinding his back into the bladed, he didn&#39;t need to put himself on a timer again. 

The Executor regarded both swords in his hand with a certain fondness. Then he hesitated, and tossed the broadsword away like a kid discarding an old toy. He looked at Pappardelle.

The fight had come to a quick end. Of course, it was always bound to turn out this way. The moment he had managed to interefere directly with Lancer&#39;s underlying S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, there was no turning back. 

He raised the rapier and aimed it at Uther&#39;s Spirit Core, his intent clear as day. Though Uther&#39;s body hadn&#39;t been completely frozen, lethargy had slowed him down enough that even an ordinary human like Orecchiette could well perceive his movements. Continuing the fight, while feasible, did not seem to bode well in the long run. Especially considering he still had some extra baggage in the form of a Master and a butler.

&#39;Permission to disable Servant Lancer?&#39; This time, Orecchiette was courteous enough to ask before the strike.</span>

“It rings a bell! Something about connecting via Circuits?”

He nodded, “Get closer to him, I’ll explain on the way!”

Lark trudged on, forced into a crawl when compared to his Servant and two opponents. It was painful to feel, and even more painful to watch his Servant battle on their own. He pushed harder, trying to get Geeves to go even a little faster.

“Bonding is when a Servant connects to a Master’s Artificial Circuits. Without those, it is not possible. With a connection to the Processor Core of the Servant, the Kill Switch of said Servant is taken out of the hands and placed into the Masters. Of course, they can still be deactivated the hard way…”

“Which is what they appear to be doing!” Lark said. Now Lancer and Pappardelle were next to each other, with Orecchiette hands deep in her… that thought didn’t need to be finished. 

“Hop on,” Lark bent down. Geeves almost toppled over him, but was able to stop himself in the nick of time. He said nothing as he turned around and wrapped his arms and legs around Lark’s midsection. The musician stood up slowly. This was certainly… doable, even if for no more than a minute.

One step forward. Then another. His pace was barely faster, but that’s all he needed. “What do I need to do?”

“That’s a good question! It depends on the Servant. Some would do it with enough trust, others require feats of strength, or agility, or courage.” 

<em>Great. Time to go ask the Servant who thinks me of nothing more than a suicidal maniac to place their entire life in my hands,</em> Lark thought. It wasn’t fair to think such a thing. Probably. They had been getting along better since their first discussion after the fight in the park, and the nightly training sessions further reinforced that idea. But…</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What did that prove? His enthusiasm about such things were dim at best, his aloof nature still kept Lancer at the end of his wits on okay days, and to top it all off, this fight with the Church was more than likely his fault. They don’t sent officials to kill Servants willy nilly, after all. 

And the worst part? He held no feelings of regret. No desire to better himself, to prevent other such scenarios from arising in the first place. A man who would seldom change. The way he acted now could very well be the way he stayed for the rest of his days, however many they were. And all he did was passively accept that fact and push it to the recesses of his mind. A problem ignored was a problem solved.

“... Perhaps I will continue running,” he muttered. Resolve faltered, his knees grew weak. Maybe it would be best if--

<strong>No.</strong>

Lark buckled, but used that speed to close the distance between himself and Lancer. If there were a time to doubt everything, it was those years ago when his bed was his home and his room was his world. When sleep was the escape and his only family walked in the mud alongside him. For now, there was only truths: bond, or die.

<em>Mayhaps a tad too serious.</em>

“Lancer!” Lark yelled. He stroked his violin, a grim note sung out his inner mind. Once more he ramped into a spell, a scream to the ears of all around. No air rushed to knock anyone down, but instead to close the ears. His walk was almost finished. His target, the Executor. His attack? To simply <em>walk</em> into him. The violinist had severely underestimated his newfound strength, as a few nights spent active did not make a strongman. 

But right before that, as Orecchiette waited for his confirmation of execution, Lancer watched Lark struggle to carry his burden into the foe. And he would say but one phrase:

“Cheers, the Cavalry&#39;s here!”</span>

Orecchiette with his broadsword that made Uther’s arm go number Papperdelle that send a bolt of electricity coursing through his body. Magic like that was hard to come by in this day from Lancer understood. Neither attack truly knocked him out of the fight, but they certainly did ring his bell. The equipment they carried seemed to allow them to jump hurdles that most servants wouldn’t be able to do against Lancer.

He was in a dire way with the point of a blade placed against his chest. Due to that spell it would take a moment for him to shake the partial paralysis off, a moment he did not have. The king felt like a fool being unable to deal with tricksters such as these. To be bested in a way that was not based on skill, but trinkets felt almost shameful to his ego. Yet, this almost felt deserved due to how he often won his fights. Perhaps this was a karma for the lost king, maybe these are the crops that he sowed. 

Just as he was about to resign himself to his fate, a fulfillment of music filled the area around them that would disorient both enemies, especially Orecchiette. This was subsequently followed up with the executor being rammed by who else but his master stating in confidence about how he was there for his rescue. The feelings that surfaced within Lancer could hardly be described. This idiot, refused to give in mo matter how much is criticized.

He couldn’t quit, not now. The king was not meant to be outshined by his knights. If Lark could push forward through, so could Uther. Taking the opportunity granted by his master, Uther mustered what little motion he had in his good arm and revered it back as far as he could. The invisible air began to violently swirl around the limb creating what appeared to be a localized tornado on his arm. Utilizing this magical prowess to assist his mobility he created a small jet burst past his elbow shooting an open palmed strike at full speed directly at the tattooed center of Orecchiette’s chest, intending to pierce right through. Then with what remaining strength he had in his legs, Uther booted the Executor back several feet. 

It was a wonder that Uther could still stand after all that they did to him, likely his Battle Continuation in combination with his endurance played a part in it. Despite that, the one, two hit they gave him jarred the King and it’ll likely take a bit for him to recalibrate. Regardless, Lancer moved just behind Lark and Geeves, the tornado still spiraling around his arm. There was a smile on his face as he gleaned down at Lark. “I’m proud of you, you stepped up. I believe I’m starting to understand your unique style of bravery. Although it’s not always rational, you make it work. Never forget this feeling.” Glaring back at his opponents Ither dropped into a defensive once more, with only one true good arm at the ready. “I may have a few more tricks up my sleeve, but I won’t be able to do take on this challenge by myself. I’m putting my trust and faith in you master, I will defend you and Geeves to my last if you ask me to. In this moment I fully relinquish command to you.” Uther then waited for orders while staring down the enemy.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What Lancer thought was a shove was more akin to a firm push. Even that could be argued to be a stretch, moreso an attempt to throw Orecchiette his rhythm by the creation of a small dilemma: take any sort of concentration off his death blow stance to see and avoid Lark’s attempt at an assault, or keep all attention on the mark and let Lark do whatever he wanted.

Regardless of what happened, Lark was now here to save the day! Maybe. He rolled his shoulders backward, a signal to Geeves that the hug would have to end. The butler complied, even if reluctantly. His legs and arms pulled off the damp clothes, now back on the ground or at his side. With a little shimmy the pair were now back to back again. 

Lark wished he could’ve heard Lancer, but his note was still going on. He only remembered this and dropped the pitch just as his Servant finished his praise of the Master. It looked and sounded good, though! That was a step in the right direction. Seems as if he wasn’t deemed a ‘lost cause’ yet. 

And now, they faced down their opponent together. Lancer, high and mighty, ready to deliver an attack equivalent to a feral animal cornered. Lark, ready to support his Servant with whatever tricks and maneuvers he could muster. Geeves… was there too!

<em>Click</em>

Lark felt it. That familiar burn, deep within his stomach. His Artificial Circuits felt… changed. A new pathway for his magic emerged, siphoning crumbs of energy away from the conduits of Magecraft away and into a vast reservoir far greater than he could ever hope to obtain. A well as deep as the ocean, and just as wide. A new strain filled his midsection, but not uncomfortable enough to cause dismay or regret.</span>

His bow sat at the ready while he evaluated the battlefield. Weakened Servant. His own body was at the first phases of fatigue. An extra weight of an entire human being clung to his backside, constantly in search of a more comfortable spot to lean on. 

His first command?

His violin lit up once more, no longer the sickly green of Greed, but with a mix of warm sunshine dashed in as well. 

“Well… you two! Uh… <em>oh gosh, I didn’t think this far ahead--</em> excuse me, I don’t wish to sick my newly bonded Servant on you! Could you explain why we’re fighting again? I, er, missed out on that part earlier!”

The pasta pair would hear Geeves slap his hand hard against his face, with no attempt to even try and hide his pressed lips and shameful demeanor.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle felt completely spent after casting her spell. Her arm fizzled like steak on a barbecue grill. Thankfully, she had done her duty as Orecchiette now shadowed the fallen king, ready to end their life in an instant.

&quot;...Permission gr-&quot; Before she could reply, Lark had finally reached his ally. This sudden arrival gave enough time for the musician to distract Orecchiette, which in turn allowed Uther to gain the upper hand again as he struck the executor directly in the chest, almost piercing his tat as the man was launched backwards several feet.

He landed next to Pappardelle.

&quot;Orecchiette!&quot; She shouted with a worried tone. While she wished she had time to monitor his injuries, she was too busy observing Uther and Lark for any additional movements, especially after seeing Uther&#39;s combat style. His brutal efficiency was comparable to Orecchiette, and with the current turn of events it was very unlikely for the two Church members to regain their lost momentum.

But thankfully, Lark&#39;s airheadedness had come to their aid. He asked about the purpose of their fight, while also revealing that he had bonded with his Servant.

He had inadvertently solved the issue.

&quot;You...bonded with your Servant?&quot; Pappardelle asked in disbelief, as if this was an uncommon occurrence. Perhaps bonding was not too popular among the Church? Who could say.

&quot;Well, that resolves this issue.&quot; She dropped her alert stance, much to Orecchiette&#39;s surprise. 

&quot;Lark de Allegro. Hopefully, that is your name. By the decree of the Church, I now transfer the responsibility of handling Lancer over to you. It is your duty to monitor him and to prevent further abuse, along with avoiding incidents similar to the ones that occurred at <span class="mention">#memorial-park</span>.&quot; She stated, then warned. Lark was completely caught off guard. Why hadn&#39;t he just bonded with his Servant earlier?!</span>

&quot;As for the cause of this fight, well,&quot; Pappardelle looked away. &quot;we were under the impression that you were abusing your Servant in non-combat areas. As a result, we were ready to deactivate them. However, now that you have bonded with them, a deactivation would result in a loss of your artificial circuit organs. That is not the Church&#39;s goal, since we would rather witness the City Grail War in its full glory.&quot;

It seemed like Lark had been spared not out of mercy, but because he had set a ticking timebomb on himself. Were Uther to perish or break their bond, Lark would be the one to suffer the most.

&quot;If we see further abuse from your Servant, we shall simply break your bond and arrest you, since the responsibility over Lancer&#39;s actions has now been fully transferred over to you. I hope that clarifies things.&quot; The nun stated, sounding more and more like an instruction booklet by the second.

&quot;Any questions?&quot; She asked, before turning back to Orecchiette. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“...Wait, what?” Lark looked puzzled, his instrument dropped down to his side. He looked at the pasta pair, then back to his Servant, and then to Geeves, and then back to the Church officials.

“That’s why… oh my goodness gracious,” he then sunk down to the ground, knees buried in the sand to become a makeshift support for his aged butler. “I don’t think I <em>abused</em> the possession of a Servant in <span class="mention">#memorial-park</span> . That was uh… a different problem. All my fault, obviously. No reason to take it out on ol’ Lancer here.”

Well, the issue fixed itself! It also caused many other issues. For example, that part about how if the bond broke his Artificial Circuit Organs would be toast. Burnt toast. He rubbed his stomach absentmindedly, a picture in his mind of himself unable to eat anything. That’d be absolutely awful to deal with! 

“Is it weird that I’d rather this went on? You know, battle of epic proportions, <em>pew pew pew</em>, <strong>WAPOW!*, *</strong>BOOOOOOO<em>**--”

Geeves now showed is shame by a quick few smacks to Lark’s own face. He flinched back, using his hands to not make hand gestures of guns and bombs but to drive off the butler’s assault. 

“Please ignore my liege here, he isn’t fully attuned to *normal conversational procedures,</em>” he hissed, which Lark took as a hint to settle down. “I and Lark have no further questions. And apologies for any troubles caused earlier. You understand, right? Personal duties, responsibilities, all that? … Well, I promise whatever problems my own Master has caused won’t happen again. Butler’s Honor,” he held out his hands, one flat in the air in front of him and the other mimicked but stuck straight up. At least ONE of the pair wasn&#39;t a social nightmare to deal with.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Uther’s muscles partially relaxed as the conflict slowly settled down. Invisible air dissipated across his arm and with a fading limp Lancers moved towards the executors. Although still lethargic, the servant still looked willing to go a few more rounds, although his body may tell a different story. Regardless, he stood tall before them. Right when it looked like he might take another strike with his good arm, Uther’s fist struck right above his heart before lightly bowing. “Although I found this whole situation moronic, I shall pay my respect to your fight capabilities. You gave me far more of a challenge than my last bout with a servant and their master. You should be proud of your skill as warriors.” He then raised up with far more serious expression. “On that matter, I hope the church is well aware that the encounter you refer to in the park was not solely us, nor were we the most reckless. There was a painter and his servant assassin that danced through the snow and used firearms. I shall not instruct you on how to conduct your authority, but I certainly hope they receive equal judgment to the one we received today.” 

Straightening once more Uther smiled at the two and extended out his hand to either of them for them to take. “Although wounds were shared amongst us, I hope in the future we can meet again under more amicable terms. I was not lying when I say my goal is to uplift Olympia and make it to be one of the greatest societies around. If you say that is your goal as well, then I hope that we can be mutually beneficial to each other in reaching what we seek.” Despite taking and giving out a beating, Ither was still a respectable king who was not willing to give credit where credit is due, our to plant seeds of acquaintances if he can. He did not expect the church to openly agree to his proposition, but he felt it should at least be said that they indeed intend to walk the same road. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The woes of following Church protocol. A moment of hesitation was all it took for Lark to <em>walk</em> into the Executor, alerting him to his presence and shift his aim ever so slightly off course. Uther, of course, would not let his Master&#39;s efforts go to waste. With what remained of his strength he summoned forth Invisible Air, wrapping it around his arm and turning it into a mini tornado. 

Wind helped calibrate his aim. As Pappardelle gave Orecchiette an order of confirmation, so did Uther unleash the tornado upon his would-be executor. A torrent of pressurized air drilled towards the summoning array on Orecchiette&#39;s chest, about to put on a gruesome reenactment of his very own act-

The skin under Orecchiette&#39;s left arm lit up. The Executor brought his arms together in a defensive gesture, then met Uther&#39;s strike head on.

<em><strong>BOOM!!!</strong></em>

A tremendous blast of wind erupted between the two contenders, accompanied by a deafening crash as Invisible Air struck Orecchiette&#39;s arms. A powerful surge of mana rippled from the point of impact, far more condensed than any spell Uther had witnessed so far. Uther&#39;s arm felt heavier than ever...

Traces of magecraft lingered in the air, defensive in nature, but Uther&#39;s Invisible Air had <em>dispersed</em>, almost as if it had been hit by a powerful strike from a Servant. It would take some time, and plenty of mana to build it back up again.

Meanwhile, Orecchiette was sent flying, landing in front of Pappardelle with no more grace than when the nun herself had been flung. He picked himself up at her behest, then started shaking sand out of his hair and uniform as Pappardelle started engaging the trio in a diplomatic approach.

The crisis seemed to have resolved itself. Apparently, Lark had bonded with Lancer, which effectively overrode Republic&#39;s influence over this particular S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. A satisficing solution, but a solution nonetheless.

Lark, still enraptured by the prospect of a brawl, started goading the two parties with animated nonsense. Geeves quickly came to the rescue, while Uther decided to outright <em>ignore</em> his Master&#39;s childish behavior and opted to act as his spokesperson. No wonder it took the <em>three</em> of them together to function as a team...

Orecchiette, on the other hand, hesitated to take Uther&#39;s hand.

&#39;The future of Olympia is no concern of mine,&#39; he replied rigidly. &#39;Neither are your actions outside of the City Grail War, unless I have been instructed otherwise. As such, I have no obligation to take your hand...&#39;

&#39;Though I wouldn&#39;t subject to another bout, courtesy of your Master&#39;s words.&#39; He added after some careful consideration. &#39;We may commence after the City Grail War has come to an end, if you are still operational.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was a relief that Lancer&#39;s Masters were so understanding. While Lark&#39;s actions didn&#39;t express much confidence to her, the fact that Geeves was watching him would hopefully prevent the pair from running into further trouble. They knew that they had received Pappardelle&#39;s acknowledgment oncr they felt the last remnants of magnetic energy disappear completely, allowing Geeves to slap Lark around for his poorly thought out words.

Uther was more elegant than the two of them combined, since he immediately attempted to make amends with the Church after seeing them as potential allies. While Pappardelle had always been instructed to ignore the will of Servants due to her own teachings, she had no qualms with appearing polite on the surface, especially if it resolved the matter peacefully.

&quot;The pleasure is all mi-&quot; Pappardelle extended her non-strained hand, before Orecchiette interjected with a blunt statement regarding Uther&#39;s role and how it differed from his.

She stared at him in disbelief, before sighing and covertly stepping on his foot. The impact felt far more painful than any form of Invisible Air he had received on that day.

&quot;Forgive my pupil. The fight must have caused blood to rush to his head. He is so excited by your presence that he cannot form coherent sentences.&quot; Pappardelle covered for him, grabbing his arm and forcibly extending it towards Uther. A crude handshake had been formed.

&quot;And with that, our duty is done.&quot; Pappardelle removed the hand as soon as it came. She then dragged Orecchiette away by the ear, muttering something about how he would be forced to attend &#39;additional training&#39; involving &#39;code of conduct, respectfulness, politeness&#39; and much, much more. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>
