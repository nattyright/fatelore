                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Orecchiette spent the better part of the last few days being grilled over proper office etiquettes by non other than his supervisor, Pappardelle. He couldn&#39;t say that he was all that thrilled, but he also admitted that he was sorely lacking in knowledge on the intricacies of office politics. Of course, like the model student he was, he did his best to contribute to the tutorial sessions by asking question after question that made the nun&#39;s eyes roll and her lips quiver. Though whether she had done them out of anger, embarrassment, guilt or pride was a mystery for another day.

In the end, their lessons had to be postponed due to urgent news from the Church affiliates monitoring the city. Apparently they had located Lancer and their Master&#39;s hideout - though to call it a hideout was a gross overstatement...

Orecchiette placed his hand on the front door of the One After Another Bar and pushed. He met no resistance other than the weight of the door itself, suggesting that the Master residing in this place hadn&#39;t even bothered setting up the most basic security measures! Would <em>any</em> Master participating in the War be so care<s>free</s>less? 

Or perhaps, they&#39;ve got the wrong intel and this was in fact, just an ordinary, posh little bar that had earned the favors of the locals?

Orecchiette disappeared behind the door, then came back out before the minute was over. 

&#39;The staff were quite cooperative once I told them I am with the Church.&#39; He explained. &#39;The Master of Lancer is currently out for a stroll. Where to, I do not know. It seems to be a habit of his to make himself scarce during rush hours.&#39; He reported back to Pappardelle, then started recalling what they had learned from the few witnesses. &#39;The park is both within walking distance of the bar and one of the few successful tourist attractions in the area. Should we prioritize other similarly popular locations first?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Contrary to Orecchiette&#39;s mindset, Pappardelle found Lancer&#39;s hideout to be quite reasonable. What better way to hide yourself than in a place surrounded by other civilians? It was perfect to keep a low profile, especially for one such as her who had done her best to avoid being involved in company politics while working in office roles.

Granted, all that knowledge served no purpose if Lancer <em>wasn&#39;t even there.</em> A fact that Orecchiette proved soon enough. The executor of the Church would be surprised as his supervisor started immediately writing down a report on an A4 notebook the moment he opened his mouth. Seemed like that simply standard procedure, at least in Pappardelle&#39;s line of work.

&quot;Oh, do not stop. Keep going.&quot; She waved her hand as Orecchiette kept speaking. Once she was done, she put her pen down and stroked her chin.

&quot;This type of behaviour reminds me of someone on the run. However, our intelligence team that regularly monitors Olympia has not reported any signs of Lancer leaving the city. Their last confirmed sighting was at this bar, so they couldn&#39;t have gone far.&quot; She summarized quickly.

&quot;Your assumption is fairly accurate.&quot; Pappardelle replied, albeit with some degree of reluctance. Seeing Orecchiette mention words such as &#39;tourist attractions&#39; elicted a sense of dread. Did Orecchiette even understand the appeal of tourism and attractions? During their training sessions in the past few days, she was barely able to get any information on his hobbies or interests. Snooping into his credentials and personal profile returned nothing either. It was like interacting with a blank slate.</span>

Could she really supervise someone like that? She felt no bonds, besides that of professionalism.

Today would be the best, no, the <em>only</em> opportunity to test that.

&quot;I doubt they would stray too far away from this bar. Orecchiette, do you perhaps know of any local attractions that you would visit in their shoes, if given only 20 minutes of time to do so?&quot; Pappardelle quizzed him. It was a double-edged question: One, to figure out Lancer&#39;s possible location and two, to see which locations Orecchiette preferred, be it in terms of aesthetics or joy. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Swiftly disposing of all Masters on the opposing side...yes, if I were in his shoes, I would make that my top priority. The notion that I would still be operating in Olympia is, in itself, ridiculous. Not to mention that had I taken the fights to Delphi, chances are high that the Church would overlook minor transgressions such as disturbing public peace. Even though we are to oversee the City Grail War, our influences still diminish greatly outside of the confines of Olympia...&#39;

He trailed off, realizing that he may have missed the point of Pappardelle&#39;s question. What use was there to divulge his own opinions on the War? She wasn&#39;t exactly asking for what <em>he</em> would do, but rather what he thought <em>the missing Master</em> would do. Going into a tirade on the efficacy of the Church&#39;s influence outside of Olympia wouldn&#39;t get them any closer to figuring out where Lancer&#39;s Master would be.

&#39;Apologies. I have been rambling.&#39; He noticed that Pappardelle&#39;s hand hadn&#39;t stopped scribbling in her notebook even now. He felt oddly scrutinized, despite having lived most of his life under surveillance. Perhaps it had something to do with Pappardelle&#39;s archaic methods? It was certainly a lot harder to overlook compared to the lifeless lenses of a surveillance camera. 

&#39;I was merely conjecturing. Is it necessary that you transcribe every word that comes out of me? There are much more worthwhile things to document.&#39;

Not only had he missed the point of her question by a mile, but he had taken a completely unrelated detour and was now navigating several roundabouts away from the answer that she had expected. Despite that, her hand did not falter as she kept transcribing everything from Orecchiette&#39;s mouth. Unrelated or not, it was still his truthful response. Perhaps this sort of testimony would serve some use in the future.

&quot;There are no things that <em>aren&#39;t</em> worth documenting.&quot; Pappardelle replied without even deigning a glance as she wrote on. &quot;Everything you say and everything I say is important. Same for all the witnesses you have talked to right now. Our memories are hazy at best, but words? When well preserved, they might as well be eternal.&quot;

Such a philosophical and vague answer was unexpected from his own supervisor, but unlike him, she had the sensible mindset to get back to work whenever things were straying further away.

&quot;Plus, I&#39;ll need to write it down for our future training sessions. It&#39;s clear you need some further tutoring.&quot; She harrumphed, much to Orecchiette&#39;s discontent. It felt like he was being chewed out for his response. &quot;But I do not blame you. The mindset of an executor is probably far beyond that of a participant in a Grail War. You fight selflessly for the Church, while this Master fights selfishly for their own wishes. You could say that you are better than them in a sense.&quot;</span>

A bit of praise did lighten the blow. Perhaps Pappardelle was truly a considerate person deep down.

&quot;Anyway, back to business. I doubt that this Master is stupid enough to go back to the park, since that was the site of the first incident.&quot; Pappardelle started proposing her theory. &quot;And the only other entertainment venue in this district is currently in rush hour as well. It would take you an hour to simply go shopping there, never mind a return trip.&quot; She said fairly accurately, as if having experienced it herself.

&quot;So, if I had only half an hour to relax, I would most likely head over to the <span class="mention">#beach</span> to compose my thoughts. Do you have any issues with this theory?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Once again, Pappardelle&#39;s response baffled the executor. Her enthusiasm towards documentation rivaled that of a librarian from Alexandria, yet she had been consistently stingy with her tool of choice, opting for a pen and a stack of paper when much more robust alternatives existed. 

Cameras, tape recorders, even Mystic Codes crafted specifically for archival, any remotely modern solutions could outperform the speed of handwriting, while offering more secure storage options. Orecchiette hadn&#39;t forgotten about the soggy documents that Pappardelle had so conveniently swept under the rugs...

Yet, it seemed that the nun was, for a lack of better words, in her element whenever she was in possession of a pen. Her attitude didn&#39;t invite questions or comments, but it was one that he was more familiar with.

&#39;If that&#39;s what you wish.&#39; Orecchiette relented. The method of documentation hardly mattered compared to the gravity of the situation at hand. They had found a lead, but the lead was as good as finding a needle in a haystack...

But Pappardelle had some ideas of her own.

&#39;The beach?&#39; He asked, looking up at the sky. &#39;In the rain.&#39; He restated, his face impassive. Olympia was currently going through an unprecedented crisis of rain. It wouldn&#39;t be all that strange for its citizens to display all sorts of irrational behavior but...beach trips in the rain?

Even though he&#39;d never gone on one, the idea simply sounded absurd.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Ah yes, the rain.&quot; Pappardelle narrowed her eyes. The weather report had said clear, sunny days. An Olympia trademark. Yet the weather dome was now dispensing artificial rain? A huge oversight, not to mention it conflicted greatly with Olympia&#39;s natural weather. Who even decided this?

Her notebooks were safe, since she had taken precautions years ago and made sure that all of her books were outfitted with protective waterproof coating. All she needed to do was keep them closed and use her own hood to shield her pages while writing.

&quot;I...don&#39;t think they were aware that it would rain today.&quot; Pappardelle replied, almost as if basing her assumption on her own experiences. &quot;In fact, I doubt any Olympians were made aware of the fact that their weather dome was broken. Perhaps they had already made plans for a beach journey and decided to go through with it even in this terrible weather?&quot;

&quot;Regardless, we aren&#39;t really losing anything by going there, are we? It is the only other area close to the this bar that I can see them visiting. If they aren&#39;t there, they have probably left this district long ago.&quot; She said. &quot;Do you have any other suggestions, Orecchiette?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

We would likewise have accomplished very little had we opted to wait for their return at the bar, or gone back to headquarters to contact more informants. At least we can start ruling out local attractions by visiting them in person. Let us make haste, then.&#39;

The beach was, like Pappardelle had suggested, well within walking distance from the bar. Locating it was as simple as surveying the horizon for where the buildings started to diminish. Such was one of the perks of living in a nomadic city: one can sooner find their way to the nearest coastline than they could determine true north. 

Orecchiette started down the street, then paused, as if he&#39;d recalled something.

&#39;Were you aware that it would rain today?&#39; He asked out of the blue. Though it was evident that Pappardelle&#39;s notebook had been waterproofed to some degree, the same could not be said for her outfit.

That was something worth noting down, but Pappardelle would be fine with a mental note for now. The duo started walking towards their destination, wondering if their 50-50 chance to be right on the money would end up being true.

Of course, Pappardelle still had to deal with Orecchiette&#39;s attempts at small talk, which almost felt like affronts against her.

&quot;...Regrettably, I was not. Or I would have called in sick.&quot; She said with a defeated sigh, with Orecchiette unable to tell whether she was joking or not. Apparently, this sudden change in weather had even escaped the Church&#39;s knowledge, as if it hadn&#39;t been planned at all. Just who was managing Olympia&#39;s weather dome? She had a few choice words for them, mostly about how they intended to make up for her now soggy outfit. She had only one other extra pair in her closet...

The situation was not funny. In fact, he had found it decidedly unfunny. Yet he couldn&#39;t stop drawing parallels, and the absurdity made him laugh.

He would need to commission a few extra sets of uniforms at the rate Olympia broke its weather dome. (To <span class="mention">#beach</span>) <span class="mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span></span>
