                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It had been a few days since the confrontation at the <span class="mention">#beach</span> . Word travelled quickly, which meant that now his own bar was a more pronounced place to be. Business was doing well, if not a little busier than usual. Singles and couples came in steadily from the outside, as they hoped to get a glance at the man of the hour. After all, it’s not everyday that someone manages to fight The Holy Church and come out without a few scars. 

So, where was Lark in the midst of this? Well, he was in the front lines with everyone else that worked there, of course! The Piano Man, a fellow musician by the name of Vincent, played his soft tunes as the few Bartenders rushed to fulfill all the drink orders. It wasn’t hard to make one or two complicated cocktails, but when they added up in rapid succession and required a few dozen ingredients always in different places…

But everyone was content. Guests were happy to see and chat with the legend himself, the drinks were wonderful, and many secret business happenings occurred without so much as a squeak from a rat that tried to overhear. After all, if one didn’t come to a place like this without something in mind, why come at all?

It was now late in the night, with a few more hours to go. A few of the staff had been sent home with pockets jingling with plentiful coins and bills, and now it was only Lark behind the bar. Each bottle was picked out from the shelf and polished to a shine, only to kill the time. A few guests mulled around, still intent on going strong with the drinks and merry times.</span>

Geeves shrugged, “I’m sure he’s either in the back or upstairs. Wish for me to fetch him?”

Lark nodded, “Maybe he can talk to a few of the guests and their servants. I see a couple floating around, they can talk about their… Servant-y lives? Whatever the proper term is.”

The butler bowed and left to do just that. How long it would take is another matter entirely. Secretly though, he just didn’t like the idea of Lancer hanging out all by his lonesome. It’s not like he had anything to fear. Man was a powerhouse. Built incredibly well. If anyone dared threaten them, it wouldn&#39;t take much time at all for said problem to make itself scarce.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The bar&#39;s gentle atmosphere was both welcoming and heart-soothing. It was, without a doubt, one of the most welcoming places for factory workers taking their night off. The place oozed class, and people felt classier just by being there. 

It was a place that Laurent, an individual of class and prestige, both despised and appreciated as he took a step through the door, wearing a baseball cap and no glasses. A generic look, one that Laurent could wear into public without being recognized.

The One After Another&#39;s atmosphere was gentle enough to soften Laurent&#39;s heart and mood, a calming influence to distract him from his legs. The manner of how the bar calmed Laurent made him slightly looser with his words. It made him, for a moment, genuinely <em>likeable</em>. Not his facade, but him.

He was strong enough to stand without collapsing for a few minutes, but any longer, and he would fall to the ground like an old man without a walker. So naturally, he had taken a seat at the bar. This too, was a good move, as the Master of Lancer, Lark, was manning the bar.

&quot;It was...&quot; Laurent began, tasting the words. &quot;No, it&#39;s too bad that I wasn&#39;t able to see you perform today. I&#39;ve heard your performances are good. Legendary, actually!&quot;

<em>Idiot. Buy something before you ask the bartender.</em> He hadn&#39;t done something like this since before he summoned Assassin. &quot;But where are my manners? Cider. Non-alcoholic, please.&quot; Laurent pulled out a thick wallet and placed a few bills on the table.

<em>Don&#39;t recognize me, don&#39;t recognize me, don&#39;t recognize me.</em> Laurent quietly pleaded. No glasses, casual clothing, and a baseball cap were all well and good, but sunglasses would&#39;ve tied the outfit together. 

If only they weren&#39;t indoors...

His body had fully recovered from the fight upon the <span class="mention">#beach</span>. The executors were strong, in truth they barely made it out of it. If it had gone on any longer, Uther may have been forced to take more drastic measures. Something he didn’t want to face to think about unless it was truly necessary. He was not the most just Ruler, but Uther did not want to hurt civilians unnecessarily. To be accused of such an act, or to imply that Lark would order him to do so felt outrageous. His master may be a fool, but he only ever intentionally put his own life in danger not others. The war was getting complicated, the church was becoming heavily involved and seemed to have vested interest on which side wins. Lark may be happy celebrate the current victory, if he wished to call it that. However, like a wartime general, Uther was only thinking of the next fight. 

Placing his palms to his knees, Lance began to chant to himself. A prayer he had made up in his time to help keep his mind and body balanced so that he’d be prepared for whatever he faced next. “I am the pillar that holds up the world. I am the light that shines through all darkness. Through me innocence is given refuge. By my Lance all evil is vanquished.” He would repeat that quietly to himself for a few minutes before he’d hear a knock at the door. “It is open, however if you are an enemy I must seriously advise you to keep it closed. I would hate to have to dirty a room that was so expertly cleaned.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

And with the message delivered,  he stepped out snd closed the door behind himself. What a pain! Didn’t even explain the <em>why</em> of it, that selfish bastard.

“Welcome, welcome!” Lark greeted Laurent, unaware to his true identity. He muttered thanks for the compliment, tossed a coaster up on the bar, and turned to fish out the cider from the cooler from behind. The top came off with a satisfying <strong>POP</strong>, and a glass was sent and poured for the gentleman.

“Wonderful selection, by the way. You’d think that anything this nice wouldn’t find it’s way to  a place like Olympia in a million years, or cost an couple arms and legs to import it. You have Delphi to thank for that!”

Lark returned the bottle to the fridge and walked to the other end of the bar, for the few drink orders that had come through. Laurent could watch as he combined various combinations of spirits and fruits together in rhythm with the piano, a gentle melody that was powerful enough to keep everyone’s voice to a minimum. 

“What brings you around these parts,” Lark asked in the midst of mixing a cocktail, “if you don’t mind me asking? A visitor from Delphi, perhaps? Or venturing outside your comfort zone?” The ice reverberated inside the mixer, a loud clash to the quiet tone of the room.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sound of cork popping from a bottle was a wonderful sound. So satisfying, and so riveting! A loud pop meant quality. Laurent found his mouth flickering upwards into a smile.

&quot;That&#39;s correct. You&#39;re sharp when it comes to supply and demand! Olympia tends to get a shipment of high quality beverages, but they&#39;re often bought up by wealthier families and establishments.&quot; Laurent said casually, taking a sip. He knew from experience; he owned a few kegs himself.

Delicious. Crisp, yet mellow. It felt like drinking springtime. With all the hot rain, that sounded fairly offputting, but this? This was <em>good</em>. Lark wasn&#39;t lying. He had opened an <em>excellent</em> bottle.

When Lark&#39;s back was turned to deal with a few other orders, Laurent fished a spying bug from out of his pocket, and slipped it under the bar. He didn&#39;t want to risk using Magecraft. Not now. 

&quot;You, actually.&quot; Laurent said, raising an eyebrow. &quot;I wanted to meet the man of the hour. Kicking the Church around on the beach? I wish I had gotten to see it! Never liked them all that much.&quot;

Was that so? Not too many casual workers hated the Church. They were tolerant and made for excellent peace negotiators.

But I’m sure there’s a video of the scuffle all over the City Wide Web or some detailed recollection of events. I’d do some research before throwing out phrases like that!”

Laurent might feel the glares of a few of the closer patrons that mulled in the background, pinpricks upon the skin. His opinion might not be the most popular around, crazy enough. Tough crowd?

Lark all but confirmed that when he swept his own gaze around the bar, eyes narrowed at periodic intervals. That facial expression said enough: Let it be. 

“I’ll take the compliment though, much appreciated. It was a little dicey, but I think we did alright.”

Lark dropped the last drink in the well to be ran, and walked back over to Laurent. He got close, personal close. I have something to tell you close. Did he notice the bug, perhaps?

“Now be honest with me: which royal family do you come from? You don’t have to give a specific one, but a hint would be nice. Because my guess is either that or you’re <em>really</em> desperate for an auto-graph to hang on your wall. In which case, I will politely decline but will thank you for being such a big fan.”

Well, he didn’t notice the bug! Or at least didn’t say he did. But the disguise didn’t work much at all, which was another conundrum all on its own.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The man simply smiled as he held his glass, casually swishing it to and fro as he considered Lark&#39;s question. How was the best way to approach this? Were the common masses getting more clever? Perhaps they had always been clever, and Laurent was just a fool. Nonetheless, he couldn&#39;t dance around the question.

&quot;A hint...? If you listed the twenty most famous families nowadays, you&#39;ll probably get the name. I <em>don&#39;t</em> dabble in perishable goods. I do, however, dabble in the perishing of a certain type of good, as tragic as it is; it&#39;s a fact.&quot;

Looking up, Laurent&#39;s glasses glinted in the light of the bar. He locked eyes with Lark. An autograph? Please. There was no value to be obtained by the collecting of autographs. They would make back money, but nothing that Laurent couldn&#39;t make in a few days. The time was not worth the investment.

&quot;It&#39;s not often that I get to mingle with the masses. This City Grail War has made that difficult. I&#39;m simply here to strike up conversation, a bit of friendship, and sample fine drinks. &quot; Laurent asked casually, finishing his cider.

&quot;A refill, please. Take a seat! Join me. Where is your Lancer?&quot; Laurent said casually, striking up a smile.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark reached over to the fridge, the bottle of Cider brought out once more. As he refilled the glass, he decided to respond.

“The hint is nice, but in my eyes that cuts out maybe two? Three? Of the twenty. Ah, but forgive me! I did not ask in order to vent my own frustrations at the way the Aristocracy runs their businesses. No, that is an entirely different conversation.”

If Lark had figured out who Laurent actually was, he showed no indication. Instead, he re-corked the bottle once the glass had been filled to the brim. The bright liquid was in danger of being tipped over and down the sides of the clear material if handled poorly. Maybe this was his way to take out frustrations with the upper class of Olympia? Seriously inconvenient methods that might ruin the next few minutes of their lives with a sticky beverage that stuck to their fingers.

“And I would absolutely <em>love</em> to take a seat with you. If we weren’t at my own bar. And I wasn’t working at my own bar. And if I enjoyed liquor. I know, a darn shame!” Lark excused himself, a big bright smile plastered on his face as the bottle once again returned to the chilly compartment. 

“As for where that certain fellow is,” he physically hopped, skipped, AND jumped back over to the other end of the bar to grab a few more drink orders, “He should hopefully join us any minute now! Don’t give him too much attention, though. I don’t think he particularly enjoys the spotlight, if that makes sense. Not shy, just… particular?”</span>

Although he didn’t want to hurt his master’s ego, most people that have been approaching Lark to talk to him about anything other than getting a drink often wasn’t about something good for the two of them. Examples being the painter in the park and the executors, not to mention that Uther caught the tail end of the conversation where this patron mentioned wanting to meet him. This immediately set off red flags in his mind, not to mention something about him seemed familiar as if he’d come across that face recently. Although he couldn’t quite place it due to still being relatively new to the area. “May I ask your name sir, and what business you have that concerns me?” 

The king was dressed in normal casual clothes at this point, a long sleeve pull over shirt with some expertly crafted jeans and a few chains of jewelry around his wrists and neck. Despite this, his mere presence appeared authoritative and menacing. As he glared into the eyes of Laurent he also called over to the man that retrieved him. “Sir Geeves, would you be so kind as to fetch some wine glasses and a bottle of red for us please.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The contrast between Lancer and Laurent was extremely disconcerting.

Both individuals oozed some sort of authority, yet Lancer&#39;s was far more physical than Laurent&#39;s. He was like a great mountain. Proud, tall, and completely insurmountable. One couldn&#39;t help but bow towards Lancer, he simply radiated the idea that &quot;this is a king&quot;.

Laurent, on the other hand, reeked of a squirrely type of power. He was not large, nor was he drop-dead gorgeous. In his current outfit as a casual commoner, he appeared to be an Average Joe. Yet he held himself with confidence, and spoke with that confidence. He spent that charisma like currency, with the intent that it would be repaid with loyalty and results. 

While Lancer was a man who encouraged confidence in armies, Laurent was a man who &quot;would accomplish great things&quot;, and when he did, it was best that you were on his side.

It was hard to get a feel on the businesman, anyways. He was ever-changing and slippery, and his personality and mood changed to suit who he spoke to. Lancer commanded armies, Laurent commanded interactions.

&quot;Wow, you&#39;re just as incredible as I imagined. Come on, sit. Sit! I want to chat with the type of person who defies the Church and is so protecting of his Master. You too, barkeep. Oh, and...&quot; Laurent lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a few more hints on who I am. After all...&quot; Laurent&#39;s eyes glinted.

&quot;<strong>I was once a Master in this war too.</strong>&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark flinched as Lancer asked for a fine red from the back. Those were expensive to get his hands on, and one of his few guilty pleasures every so often as he stared at the lights outside. However, he did not stop Geeves, who bowed and went to fetch the supplies. 

However, that particular thought went away as the man revealed a little more about himself…

They were a former Master? On the side of Olympia, no less. If he wasn’t mistaken, only a few contenders for the Olympia side had been taken out thus far. Which ones were from the most famous aristocracy, it was hard to guess. That’s not a sort of thing you’d want to announce to the world if you could help it, in fear of hitmen or unfortunate accidents in the dead of night.

No matter what, this complicated things. This man was more than likely merciless. A danger to society that ran rampant with little to no checks, thanks to the structure of the society they found themselves in. It was hard to keep up the cheery facade required for his job with more information gathered. 

As Geeves returned and started to pour glasses of red wine for the two men, Lark leaned back from the bar. “Once again, I’m not sure it was in ‘defiance’. I may not align with any of the major or minor religions, but that doesn’t mean I have qualms with The Holy Church. If anything, I applaud their openness to so many different religious ideas not their own.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent spoke in a confident tone to the both of them, oozing with charisma. He was a man who was used to getting his way by simply showing up, flashing a smile, talking up himself, and on occasion brandishing his station. Under normal circumstances the two men might have been putty in his hands, however, Uther was more than familiar dealing with Kings and Rulers that believed they were what made the sun rise. In addition to that, Lancer had been a part of many visitation of enemies and nearby village members that sought asylum from great danger to themselves. This was not too dissimilar to those situations. 

Taking his wine glass Uther took a small sip, before clearing his throat. “If you wish to earn my appeal or good graces, I would recommend you use that mouth to do more than merely kiss my ass. I asked you two separate, one of which you are dancing around, the other you completely ignored.” It was clear that Laurent’s usual tact of buttering up to his target and manipulating them would be slightly more troublesome in regards to Uther, due to him not truly trusting anyone save for Lark. “I assume you are here for a reason, stating that you are a former master means that you no longer possess a servant. If that’s the case I’d imagine you are here for some form of protection or perhaps bartering something from us, from me to keep your safety and interests taken care of. Well I hate to inform you, but I do not take kindly to being jerked around. If you want something from us, I’d prefer you came out and spoke your piece, instead of all the translucent flattery. With that in mind I’ll ask once more, who are you and what is your business here?” Uther remained cautious, however he was not ready to dismiss the man yet. Right now he simply wanted to see what Laurent intended by coming to the bar and seeking them out. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This was getting them nowhere. He could dance around Lancer&#39;s questions all he desired, but the Servant would stubbornly insist until he caved. Guiding this conversation required nuance and subtlety, and the only way Lancer would dance to his tune is if he was honest.

&quot;Don&#39;t be absurd. Let&#39;s not over-complicate this. I&#39;m here to mingle with the populace and enjoy a night on the town, and make a few friendly acquaintances. I do not intend to make a fool out of you, Lancer.&quot; Laurent&#39;s eyes danced as he eyed his drink. Poisoned? Unlikely. In order to not offend Lancer, it would be best for him to just take a sip.

He did so. An excellent vintage, fit for a king of Britain.

&quot;The Holy Church...&quot; Laurent snorted casually, swirling his wine as he gathered his thoughts. &quot;You presumably don&#39;t trust me, as you shouldn&#39;t. Business makes you shrewd and cruel, and yet here I am, happily chatting you up. So, I ask...&quot;

&quot;<strong>Why should the Church be any different?</strong> They are too perfect. Too open. People only do things for selfish reasons. Even the most openly selfless person does helpful things because it satisfies them to be a help to others. I may have recently become quite popular with the working class, but everyone knows I am not completely perfect. Shouldn&#39;t the Church have at least a few stains? Their track record is too clean, and as such, I do not trust them. It takes two-faced person to know a know another.&quot;

Was this it? Was this the only reason he didn&#39;t trust the Church? He was simply paranoid? Or perhaps he was projecting his own insecurities onto shadows...

Nodding respectfully to Lancer, Laurent put his glass down, and nodded to Lark. &quot;I will answer your questions, Lancer, but first, I have a question for you both: <strong>what will you wish for, should you win this war?</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark watched the man finally cave into Lancer’s demands for the man to reveal himself, the wine glass sipped with ease. It was such a sad sight to see, a wonderful red going down the pipe of such a despicable person. 

A person who spoke the sort of thing he’d love to discuss in any other situation! Holy smokes, this week so far was a weird one. One second he was fighting for his life on the beach, and the next he was being heckled by a former Master in the Holy Grail War and his own Servant. Lark prayed to whatever god was listening that this would be the peak.

“I think to assume the worst of others, even massive Organizations that are not considered ‘people’, is a dangerous mindset. There <em>could</em> be things The Holy Church has done, however I do not think that to actively project ideas onto them will help prove anything that has actually happened. Only with proof and hard evidence will things change. Not <em>deflection</em>,” Lark emphasized. 

This person was either the best liar he had ever met, or they were truly one of the most prominent of the Aristocracy in Olympia. Maybe both. The musician was very much aware of the hypocrisy in his subtle accusations, but let he who is without sin cast the first stone. It would certainly not be himself.

And his wish? That was yet another curve ball. He leaned back on the bar and stared at the ceiling tiles, ideas for a future swirled in the material. Multiple realities revealed themselves, but none sounded too appealing. To be quite honest, this hadn’t been a serious thought thus far.

“Maybe the largest sum of money they could conjure up from those bottomless coffers they have lying around?  Or maybe I try my own hand at ruling. See if a Polaris is willing to let me lead for a fortune to last numerous life times. Perhaps I pawn it off to a runner up, see what they want,” Lark said.

He pushed off the countertop, “After all, what more could I ever possibly desire?”

Geeves cleared his throat, “Some better manners, I say.”</span>

The mere fact that he’s trying to lead the conversation in his favor and gain what he wants instead of appeasing theirs was the factor that casted the shroud of doubt over him. He is in their establishment asking probing questions about himself and his master, but has provided little of himself. This man was not making a good first impression on the king. He mentioned and how he doesn’t trust them, because he doesn’t know all their dark secrets, the hypocrisy on display was laughable. 

Uther took his glass and downed the drink before placing the empty container back on the counter. “There is darkness in every soul, even my own, and it’s true that sometimes one is entitled to keep their secrets to a degree as long as it is not harmful to others around them. However, with that understanding in mind, organization such as the Church do have an obligation to be relatively translucent to the public.

You have every ability to earn our trust, yet you keep pushing aside my questions and asserting yours.

In the back of his mind Uther was mentally scoffing at Lark and how easily he was being played like one of his own violin. Still giving information that has not been earned. Lancer let out a sigh, he did not trust this man in the slightest, yet if his master was intending to give him a chance then Uther will give the bare minimum of his own. Taking the bottle of wine he began to pour more into Laurent’s glass to top him off. “Considering my master is willing to speak to you on certain matters, I suppose I’m obliged do the same. Perhaps as this conversation evolves, that cloud of uncertainty that hangs over you will disperse. My wish is a general one, but it’s an ideal all the same. I wish to see Olympia grow and prosper beyond what it already is. For the businesses to grow, for the people to have more opportunities for themselves, and for this nation to become a prosperous empire.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The man was quiet for a few moments, his face unreadable as he considered the implications of the desires of Lark and his Servant. He tapped the bar a few times in thought. Eventually, he slowly nodded.

&quot;Okay, then. I&#39;ll help you out.&quot; He said, surprising both Lancer and Lark. What was this guy scheming?

&quot;I want Olympia to persist in a form that benefits its workers and employers. That can only happen if the winners vote for prosperity or for something that won&#39;t disrupt the status quo. Even if you decided to rule Olympia, it would not be the end of the world if you are wise.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s eyes suddenly glinted, and with that glint revealed a resolve. A resolve filled to the bring with malice. &quot;However, if you had wished for Delphi to control Olympia, or for the complete dissolution of the Aristocracy...&quot;

&quot;We would be enemies.&quot; Laurent said casually, leaning down in his chair. &quot;His manners? They&#39;re casual and upbeat. Perfect for a bartender. Make him too stiff and you might accidentally create an aristocrat.&quot; He joked, lightening the mood. For that moment of unease, however, this man had been dangerous.

&quot;So now, I will answer your questions: My business with you, was it? I want someone who will not burn Olympia to the ground. As for who I am, well... Laurent paused dramatically...

...and then took off his baseball cap. 

Without the hat in the way, it finally clicked. Wasn&#39;t this...?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">...Was Lark supposed to know this guy? Sure, he looked familiar enough. In the way that it was easy to tell what was considered a fruit and what was a vegetable. However, beyond that he couldn’t figure out what the hat drop was supposed to do. 

Geeves, on the other hand, connected the dots soon after they revealed their full visage. What the actual hell was Laurent MacKenzie doing in an establishment like this?! This was trouble, and no mistake. You don’t essentially monopolize the weapons market without having at least a basic disregard for most basic morals and human decency. 

But this was a Holy Grail War. That sort of mentality got you to the final few hands down. Any help from this gentleman would go a long way. For them to want to help out might have its downsides, but any port in a storm. 

“We will accept your gracious gift of partnership, Sir MacKenzie,” Geeves said. He beat Lark and Lancer to the punch, their alliance sealed before either could say a word.

Lark, after Geeves addressed the person before them, was left mouth agape. “You’re… Laurent MacKenzie? The Arms Dealer?” He asked quietly. 

Geeves realized his mistake too late. He and his liege shared a look, and it wasn&#39;t pretty. Lark visibly stared daggers into the other, and he made no attempt to hide such a look from Laurent or Lancer. If anyone was good at reading looks, his <em>screamed</em> that there were a million different places that he&#39;d rather be.</span>

The butler may have just thrown them into the shark tank, but nothing to be done now. Best thing they could at this moment is seem like predators themselves instead of chum. Lancer did vaguely recognize the man from a few magazines that had strewn about the bar. There were likely many benefits to gain from working with him, but there was equally great risk. If they were going to come out on top of this, they’d have to be steady and mind how they proceed. Stealing away his current apprehension to the man, Uther grinned and nodded his head. “Well as our man hear was bold enough to propose, a partnership wouldn’t necessarily be out of the question under the right circumstances. If what you say is true, your goals actually align quite well with my own. Perhaps there truly is mutual gain to be had between our sides. Considering your apparent station, it would be reasonable to assume you have vast resources at your disposal. If we are to tie our fates together, what can we do for you as well as what can you offer us?” Uther remained cautious and optimistic, but if this interaction was going to make any progress then there would have to be give and take. That applied to Laurent as well.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If the CEO liked being recognized, he didn&#39;t show it. He simply adjusted himself in his seat, and shrugged, before scratching his head and chuckling nervously, eyeballing around the bar. Nobody batted an eye, good.

&quot;Stop, stop. I&#39;m not in the war. This City Grail War was nothing more than a potential business venture. If I won, I could dictate how the resources of Persepolis would be spent. I traded my own Servant&#39;s life to save my own employees, for goodness sake! At this point, I&#39;m just doing damage control for Olympia&#39;s future.&quot;

Laurent hastily explained himself, whispering to Lark, Lancer, and Geeves. He seemed almost... sheepish? Could a business tycoon make that face? Were they even capable of doing so?

&quot;Look. <strong>I was in this for the thrill.</strong> My schedule is so strict that I wanted an escape, okay?&quot; The rush of fighting alongside your Servant... There&#39;s nothing like it.&quot;

The explanation was filled with a mix of embarassment and shame, as if he were admitting a terrible secret to the three. Was he... <em>eyeing</em> Lark?

&quot;Now that there&#39;s a chance that some nutcase could come along and ruin Olympia, I&#39;m worried. Have you seen that fortress downtown, just a few blocks from MacKenzie Corporate? <em>It&#39;s growing larger by the day</em>!&quot;

Taking a moment to breathe, he nodded towards Lancer. &quot;Yes. I have an intelligence network that spans all of Olympia, and almost all of Delphi. I have equipment: body armor, explosives, guns. You name it.&quot;

After taking a deep breath, he had laid his cards on the table. The bait had been laid. All he needed was for Lark to take the bite. In their eyes, if this was a massive ruse, it was extremely elaborate—the man&#39;s acting was extraordinary.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark caught the eyes of Laurent, one-hundred percent aware of what he was getting at. Laurent was as conniving as he assumed, and maybe some more. The fact that <em>Geeves</em> of all people only sunk his mood further, until it was as deep as the grave he kept one foot in at all times.

“Geeves. Lance. May I see you in the back for just a few quick moments? I feel that we need to properly discuss our position of the matter at hand, without any outside influences,” he glared Laurent down.

Geeves nodded, and started heading back to the hidden part of the bar. Lark followed in hot pursuit, but not before he yoinked the wine bottle off the bar top and secured it in the crook of his elbow. That was very petty, but he felt that it was necessary to get the point across. What point? Good question!

If Lancer decided to follow suit, he would find that the other two stepped further back than anticipated, a large iron door pulled open to reveal the cooler. Inside were stacks upon stacks of booze, enough to drown an AA meeting. Once inside, the door was pulled shut and <em>latched</em> from the inside. Weird, did coolers have those?

Lark was not in the mood to go over at, because as soon as the door was secured, he flicked the forehead of his butler. The smack filled the small space and threatened to drown out the fans up above. 

And a unique expression lit up Lark’s face. Lancer had yet to see this side of the man, while Geeves seldom experienced it but was familiar enough with it: unbridled rage.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Are you <em>fucking</em> daft, Geeves?!” Lark cursed. He set the open wine bottle down on a shelf and pointed a finger, “Why in the bloody hell would you go ahead and give <em>my</em> okay for a partnership involving a man who not only resides in the point-zero-one percent, but actively supplies arms for people to off each other with?”

Geeves rubbed the point where he was hit, “Maybe you should consider that this is a <em>War</em>, Lark. People die in those. I won’t say he’s a good man, but to win this war we’ll need all the help we can--”

“Blazes to that! I’d rather lose this war than receive help from that demon-spawn. Hell, I’d rather <strong>die</strong> than have to associate with that man a second longer!”

“You bloody well might! Whether you like it or not, you aren’t going to get anywhere wasting your time tending to this pipe-shack dream of yours, thumb up your arse while everyone else tries to get the edge!”

“An edge?! They’ll get pushed off the edge by monsters like that every day of the damn week!”

“Oh, don’t get me--”

Very quickly the two devolved into a shout match, two brick walls in competition to see who had more mortal piled between the rectangles. A difference in ideals borne from different lives and views of the world. Lancer had been quickly ignored as they focused solely on the other, a spectator to their fight.

At least Lark was taking something seriously for once?</span>

It was refreshing to see Lark actually see the danger in certain actions, means that he can properly weigh the risk. Lancer waited until the argument devolved into nothing more than name calling before he interjected. “Lark is right, this man is a snake in the grass that is already coiled and ready to strike at a moment’s notice. I can not trust a single word out of his mouth for the sole reason that he is a former master that sought us out. I wouldn’t put a past him that if we refuse that he wouldn’t try to kill you and convince me to go with him as my new master. A man like that doesn’t want to just help others, he wants to win. I know that sentiment better than anyone.”

Gliding across the floor Uther peered over all the liquor and booze stacked on the shelves, gauging how many there might be. This could make a rather large fire if set ablaze. Turning back to his master Lancer let out a sigh. “There are two realities we have to face about this. One that no matter how strong I am, or how much you practice, it may not be enough to win the war. We need help and more than that we need resources. I assume you’ve seen that castle towering over the city. I vaguely recognized it from my own time, after a little bit of research in the servant database, I picked out the name Lord Brandin, and it began to click. He was lord that employed a group of warriors known as the Copper Knights, a troublesome</span>

Lancer approached Lark and put a hand on his shoulder. “He is a devil, but he’s the devil we know. My advice is for us to form a partnership with him, use him and his resources. However, the entire time we watch him and take precaution, never turn our backs to him for a second for we may find a dagger in our spine. Which reminds me, considering we’ve left him alone, once he’s gone I’d like to do a sweep over the bar area. Make sure he hasn’t done anything nefarious while we weren’t looking.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“You as well?” Lark stared in disbelief at his Servant. He pushed off the hand that sat on top of his shoulder, not in the mood for the ‘listen here pal’ talk style. “You do realize that he will create a moment where we will not be able to ‘watch our backs’, and that will be the second we get offed in a freak accident? There’s only so much precaution we can take with someone like that before something goes wrong and someone dies.”

“And that is why I am here. To step in and help in case things go wrong. Your sister as well. We are all here to help make sure things like that don’t happen, but unfortunately we <em>must</em> take risks in order to come out ahead. Besides, you promised.”

“Promised what?” Lark said.

Geeves, in turn, reached a hand into his suit. After a few seconds a piece of paper was pulled out, an official looking document neatly folded in the middle. The butler unfurled and began to read aloud:</span>

If required, they may even be able to make decisions for the affiliated party if doing otherwise would result in a worse chance of victory in The Holy Grail War. In exchange, Lark de Allegro will be permitted to participate in The Holy Grail War and summon his servant wherever he deems best. If these terms are broken, then the two supervising parties has the right to forcibly remove the person in question from The Holy Grail War at a moment&#39;s notice.

“Signed, Lark de Allegro, Geeves, and Rose de Allegro,” he finished. The paper was neatly folded back up and returned to its hidden pocket. 

“As one of the supervisors in the contract you signed, I deem it necessary to alliance with Laurent MacKenzie. If you do not want to, that is fine. However, I will have to inform the overseers of this war that you will be withdrawing in post haste.”

Lark looked defeated. He had completely forgotten all about that damn paper, too caught up in the excitements of the actual War going on. Memories of numerous arguments sprang to mind about that document, countless nights spent in the hopes that <em>this time</em> his family would okay his request to participate. 

“Fine,” Lark quietly resigned, “whatever. I see where you both stand. My hands are tied anyhow. Go let that scum out there know I’ll be out in a few minutes, and that we’ll… work together.” The last part of his sentence came out forced through gritted teeth. This would cause problems in the future, but that wasn’t something they would have to deal with for now.</span>

Under normal circumstances he’d be on Lark’s side, however, the situation was far more complicated than that. He had to encourage the best course of action he saw to ensure victory, despite that Uther bowed his head while gripping onto the freezer door. “Lark, you asked me of my thoughts and I gave them. I believe allying with Laurent, although dangerous, is the best course of action. However, with that in mind, you are still my master. If you ultimately decide that you have had enough or you wish to dissolve this partnership with Makenzie at any time. I will gladly oblige and stand by you, I have ideas in mind on how to use him, but I do not unnecessary casualties.” Uther slowly started to open the door. “Shall we go out and speak to him?” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

Geeves didn’t respond, instead he followed Lancer back to the main part of the bar.  The old man did not offer any insight to the situation or really anything at all. Perhaps this was a topic as old as time itself for the pair. That, and their squabble didn’t leave much to the imagination. 

Geeves returned the bottle of wine where it one sat. Where he had ‘hidden’ the green glass, or even the chance to nick it, there was no way to tell. But there it was, back between the two crystal clear glasses. More wine was poured into the goblets.

“Forgive our excursion, but we have all decided that an alliance would be most beneficial. Do you have any further questions or concerns regarding the matter, or are you ready to delve into plans and details?”
Geeves addressed Laurent with a professionalism only seen in the most confident or inexperienced of middlemen. How many times had that exact phrase been said by himself, verbal or otherwise? Lancer could only ponder as he stood there, eager to hear anything else they needed to iron out.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When Lancer and Geeves returned, Laurent had put his baseball cap on, and was conversing with a few factory workers down the bar.

&quot;That&#39;s when I told them &#39;<strong>I&#39;m no Alexander, even I know kings aren&#39;t made!</strong>&#39;&quot; Which resulted in a roar of laughter from both the workers and Laurent. After a few seconds, Laurent noticed Geeves and Lancer. He raised a hand to the workers. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you later!&quot;

Snake.

&quot;Great! Good to know we have a deal. I have one caveat, however.&quot;

Here it was. The grand &quot;but&quot; that would make or break this alliance. Laurent didn&#39;t seem to react much to Geeves&#39;s attempt at professionalism. Knowing him, he probably saw it daily.

&quot;You must take down that monk running amo<s>n</s>k downtown. The larger that castle grows, the more perilous the situation becomes. Lancer, you lived in a time of war and strife, did you not?&quot; 

Laurent nodded towards the king. &quot;The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to lay siege to the base. I cannot physically join you. There is no reason for me to risk my life to such a degree. I&#39;m not in the war, but I&#39;m willing to help you out.&quot;

Quietly, Laurent&#39;s form changed from casual barkeep to shrewd businessman. His posture was refined, and the glint in his eyes was extremely similar to a lawyer picking apart a legal agreement.

&quot;Lark is your biggest weakness. He&#39;s frail, squishy, and breaks easily. I&#39;ll plate him up with some armor. Maybe it&#39;ll protect him if he does one of his crazy stunts that he&#39;s known for.&quot;

Were Lark&#39;s escapades that popular? How infamous had his thrill seeking adventures gotten? Perhaps the businessman was thorough. Perhaps he was paranoid. It would make sense. He picked his alliances well, having come to Lark and Lancer.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Standing between the two men, Uther nodded. “On that front you and I agree, the monk is a dangerous threat to the city and its people. I would have requested your aid against them if you hadn’t suggested it first.” Lancer’s demanding and suspicious attitude had been put to the side for the time being, he taken on his negotiators and tactical demeanor, one befitting a general. “Lark receiving armor would indeed be ideal, as long as he can still move freely enough in it to use his Violin.” There was no point in hiding that trait of his master. If the church knew about it, odd were Laurent was aware of it as well. Besides, it’s not like Lark was trying to even remotely keep it secret. 

“Beyond my master’s protection the resource I most desperately require for this undertaking is people, men and women who are capable and willing to fight for this cause. On top of that they’ll need to be armed, so any weapons you can provide them and myself to assist in the siege would be appreciated. Perhaps even some explosives to get through their defenses, they’d need to hit hard in case there is magical fortification at play. Beyond that if you have anything else you’d be willing to lend for the effort feel free to throw it in” Although a bit was requested, Uther did not see it necessarily as a wish list and more so as requirements necessary for a campaign such as this to succeed. He could not claim to stand for the betterment of Olympia and not stand as vanguard in its defense. The owner of this castle and its masters were imposing their will on a people that did not ask for it. As the Pillar That Holds The World, Uther was not going to stand for this. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

He tapped his finger against the bar with a mechanical, precise rhythm. <em>People. People. Where could Lancer scrounge up people...?</em>

&quot;Here&#39;s the deal, Lancer. <strong>I will not arm them with guns</strong> for a whole slew of reasons, but you could try the abandoned factory district and rouse the local raffle.&quot; While Jampo and Saber had no desire to harm residents that they had captured, many people were still wary of the massive growing castle. Some people simply left their homes and ran, as conspiracies of what happened within grew.

&quot;Batons. Shields. Tasers. Demolition equipment, but only if it is distributed <em>by you and Lark</em> to people you trust, and then keep an eye on those people. I won&#39;t create a ragtag militia with the ability to become a terrorist group. As for armor, that is acceptable. It won&#39;t stop a rocket launcher or a Noble Phantasm, but it will certainly help.&quot;

Laurent finished his second glass of cider, before taking off and wiping his glasses with a cloth. &quot;Make whatever promises you need, whether it be jobs, food, or lodging. I need a few new employees, ever since one of my factories was attacked.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was clear that Lancer was not too aware that it was sort of hard to get people to group together for the greater good unless something was in it for them. Mercenaries, militia, those sort of things couldn’t be scrounged up from nowhere. To get one together at all would take nothing short of a miracle.

And without firearms, not many might be interested in such a cause at all. Afterall, what better way to protect yourself than to just shoot the problem a few dozen times until it stops?

Geeves was then taken aback when Laurent was fine with the idea, with offers of equipment and demolition charges. It was clear that this was just going to happen whether it was a good idea or not. Only time would be able to tell if it would actually work.

“I’m sure that we will be able to scrounge up some help! If not, we can handle it ourselves,” Lark responded as he quickly rejoined the group. “Sorry, I was handling a spill in the back. Clumsy me, I know.”

Any and all remains of his sour mood earlier were gone, instead replaced by the usual chipper and cheery man before them now. A white lie, as well. 

“The only thing we’re missing now is a a time frame. When would be the best time to assault this Castle causing you this large heap of distress?”</span>

However, I was hoping you’d have something more substantial in mind aside from your own employees. A man of your stature and position, should reasonably have connection to certain organizations that buy heavily from your wares and would stand to lose a great deal if for any reason you were to go under due to this growing threat. They might not do it without compensation, but as a business man I’m sure your fully aware that nothing we want in life is truly free. This is only a suggestion, but If you are wanting this problem assuredly gone, it might be something to consider.” Uther was indeed challenging Laurent, he wasn’t fully certain how far it would get him. However, based on the man’s attitude it seemed like he was trying to only give the bare minimum of what was needed of him. He had every right to refuse, but Lancer wanted to press just a little bit to see if he could sweeten the arrangement.

At last Lark came back out. He appeared to be putting on a patient face, but Uther knew him long enough to know he was likely fuming inside. “We can likely strike in a few days time as soon as we have everything prepared and ready. As long as we have the resources we need, we should be able to put up a good fight.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

He chucked and shook his head. &quot;This contract is entirely beneficial to you. Every benefit I get out of it is neither strategic nor tactical for that very reason.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s power came from his ability to move around resources and men. He was no great warrior, like Lancer. He was no great academic thinker, like Gustave. He was, a man who excelled at worming his way into beneficial contracts while taking little risk.

The weight of industry was a heavy one. While Laurent did benefit from the defeat of Saber, so did Lancer. As such, there was no real &quot;gain&quot; for the man. Everything was measured in gains versus losses, where gains were how much the other person lost.

It was quite sad.

&quot;I will, however, offer a consolation prize: information on the remaining Servants in this war. I&#39;ll have a folder delivered to you. I&#39;m offering up everything of strategic value that I&#39;ve accumulated to both you and Lark. It won&#39;t help defeat Saber, but will strengthen your position. As for a date, hmm...&quot;

Laurent held up two fingers. The sign was obvious: <em>two days from now</em>.

&quot;I will deliver the equipment tomorrow. Take good care of it, and try not to blow up the bar. With drinks this good, I might become a regular.&quot;

More terrifying words had never been spoken...

Of the not Holy Grail War variety. 

“Sure,” Lark said as the left corner of his eye twitched sporadically, “I’ll be sure to alert the landlord that I will be having a sudden shipment for the Bar and to deliver it straight up!”

His right eye joined in on the affair when Laurent suggested he might become a regular. He could picture it now, this demon wormed into his select group of delightful people that came in often. Jokes cracked, laughter was shared, and Lark would be moments away from strangling him the second he tread on a single toe. Which would never happen, as he had the art of ‘not stepping on toes’ down to an exact science.

But the smile stayed, even if it was becoming obvious that it was cheaper than water. “Maybe it would be best to keep our meetings to a minimum! You know, don’t want people to suspect anything fishy, now would we?”

‘Stay away from me you filthy insect’ was the hidden meaning behind that sentence. 

“We will accept your offer for the intel, and deeply appreciate it. With each and every pieces position known, we are one step closer to winning this war,” Geeves said. “You can expect payment in some form tomorrow, when your men come to deliver the shipment agreed upon. Perhaps an assortment of spirits that suits your tastes? I insist, since you are being too gracious with your generosity.”</span>
