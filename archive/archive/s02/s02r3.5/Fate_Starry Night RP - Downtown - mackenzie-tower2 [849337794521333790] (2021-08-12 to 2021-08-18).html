Laurent MacKenzie returned from his unregistered excursion into Delphi with a new ally at his disposal. To security and staff, he looked like an old-fashioned business partner. Caster was well-dressed enough, and for a Servant, he was deceptively normal, not wearing exotic or divine equipment. He was simply a man.

A man that moved mountains with words, no less, but a man, nonetheless. 

Laurent pulled a card out of his wallet as they reached the elevator, before scanning it, and taking them all the way up to the top floor.

&quot;Weapons.&quot; He explained. &quot;Weapons, construction materials, explosives, toys, electronics... I&#39;m cornered several of Olympia&#39;s more prominent markets. I&#39;m not licensed to extract or refine the ore Olympia produces—only Irons can do that, and it&#39;s the main reason that hack was representing Olympia in the initial bidding war with Persepolis.&quot;

Laurent seemed to dismiss Olympia&#39;s most powerful tycoon, but he also discussed him with a tone of... begrudging respect? Yearning? No, <em>desire</em>. He wanted what Irons had, and it was obvious to the philosopher, who was known for his dissection of the psyche of people.

The elevator dinged open as the two reached Laurent&#39;s penthouse.

Buildings of the sort were new to him. He was aware of their existence but being able to see how human architecture had progressed over a couple centuries fascinated him.

Caster&#39;s new Master seemed to be very well off in this modern world. He was a self proclaimed greed filled man who could boast his possessions as much as he spoke of them. Nietzsche was happy with the outside approach his old Master took, however, being under new leadership could serve for some very interesting encounters.

Nietzsche nodded along as Laurent explained where his wealth came from. He covered a wide area of fields but the philosopher was caught by the weapons. He stepped out of the elevator turning to face Laurent.

&quot;So today is a world where war can make a man rich? And who do you supply these weapon&#39;s to? The cults that run the cities?.&quot;</span>

Either he be honest, and hope that Caster appreciate his honestly, or ignore the subject, and let Caster figure it out on his own. Both were undesirable, but the former option less so.

&quot;Yes.&quot; He admitted, nodding his head. &quot;But not for your &#39;cults&#39;. For everyone. Across every city, from five-pointed cities to measly ships. There is not a man alive who cannot walk into a store, and purchase my equipment. I also make protective gear.&quot; Laurent took off his glasses and wiped them, slightly unnerved.

&quot;The world has changed, Caster. War is a business, and has been for hundreds of years. Like I said, I&#39;ve expanded outwards from just weapons since I started running this company. I make toys, Caster! I would rather it be me running the weapon industry, rather than some person who would sell explosives to terrorists for a quick buck.&quot;

Laurent shouldered his way past Caster, seemingly upset, though it was difficult to tell. Had Caster upset his Master?

&quot;I do not care if you make toys or protective gear. You could feed the poor but it would not change the fact that you sell war. Nor would it change why you do those things.&quot; 

As Nietzsche spoke he paced around Laurents penthouse trying to see if the surroundings indicate anything about his master.

&quot;I also don&#39;t care how greedy you are, how &#39;evil&#39; or how &#39;good&#39; you are. I only want to understand you. And I wish for you to understand me.&quot; Nietzsche spoke with a clear and concise tone making sure not to muddle his words.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This man was good. Laurent thought his performance was solid, but it turned out that Caster was either far more sharp or wary than Laurent had anticipated. He could not, however, drop the act.

&quot;I sell war because that is the way of the world. Servants and Mages run amok, and many are capable of snapping a man&#39;s neck like <em>that</em>,&quot; Laurent snapped his fingers. &quot;Humans are weak, and as such, we arm ourselves with tools.&quot;

Laurent looked towards Caster with disbelief as the latter paced around the penthouse. It was a clean space, without as much of a spec of dust. It was too normal, yet lavish. It was clear that the man flaunted his status—yet he did not partake in it. Did he simply want to stand above other people? Caster could use this.

&quot;I do not feed the poor because they do not have value.&quot; Laurent said simply, hand in pocket. &quot;When an individual is productive, whether towards the greater merit of society at large, or towards the creation of a material goal, they have worth. My employees have worth, and as such I pay them, cloth them, and house them.&quot;

&quot;Understanding me? That&#39;s quite simple, Caster.&quot; Laurent&#39;s eyes narrowed into slits. &quot;First, we will win this City Grail War, and I will take Persepolis&#39;s corpse under my company&#39;s mantle. Afterwards, I will use those resources to take over all of Olympia. Delphi will follow. I will be immeasurably wealthy. Enough to boggle the common man. Enough to make every Olympian live in comfort.&quot;

MacKenzie Industries was already a noteworthy name throughout the world, having shipped weapons about for a century. However, the company&#39;s power was only situated in Olympia, and was barely taking root in Delphi. It needed the jumping off point that Persepolis would provide.

&quot;Afterwards...&quot; Laurent smiled. &quot;<strong>I will rule the world.</strong>&quot;

It <em>was</em> easy to understand Laurent. He was a megalomaniac.

What Nietzsche did not understand was the man&#39;s need for excuses. Did he sell weapons because that&#39;s the way things were or because of how Laurent wanted to do things?

&quot;You have your goals set for you Master, you have a free spirit, you care only about how you see yourself. But you tell me excuses, are excuses a habit of yours?&quot; After asking his rhetorical question Caster found a nice spot to take a seat sitting on one of the lavish chairs in the penthouse. He looked back to Laurent, having more to say

&quot;And so if you are what you described… I understand you. But I still need you to understand me. Tell me master, have you read any of my literature? If not, I recommend it as a good starting point.&quot;

And what was this on excuses? Did he have to use the phrase so broadly? Helping the poor was nice and all, but his employees were fairly paid, and he was one of the better employers a worker could find in Olympia. If he controlled the city, everyone would be his worker, and as such, all would be compensated.

Was that truly so hard to understand?

&quot;Yes, Caster. I&#39;m founded on excuse after excuse. Lie after lie. Businessmen are complicated, cruel creatures, constantly out to end one another and move into their markets. I&#39;m sorry if that disappoints you.&quot;

Reflecting Caster, Laurent took a seat opposite from him, in a recliner. Even in such a cushy seat, he sat with the authority of a man befitting his position.

&quot;I have not, my apologies. My personal studies to inherit this company made me study economics, war, and psychology. I dabbled in philosophy in order to understand people, but you, I am not overly familiar with. I recognize your identity, nothing more. I suppose I should order a few of your works. I&#39;ll place an order in the morning.&quot;

I can see you are intelligent Master, that is something I care about. I am not a fighter. To win, we will need to outsmart our opponents. We will crush them with our superior intellect.” Everything Nietzsche said was true. This era was long past his own. What happened did not concern him. He warned humankind of their destructive path centuries ago. If humanity had not dropped its slave mentality by now, it seemed it never would.

Caster leaned forward, holding out his hands towards a coffee table by his chair. Like magic, a stack of books appeared on the table in front of Laurent. “Do not worry; I can manifest my works any time you would like.” 

Nietzsche’s books were as much a part of him as his heart and lungs. He was summoned not just as a man but a walking personification of his philosophy. Wherever he went, every thought that he ever inked onto paper would follow.

His first thought, however, was how he could shamelessly use Caster to mass-produce copies to be sold. He strangled the thought and shot it.

&quot;Ah, good! I shall read them at my leisure. I&#39;m not interested in just reading your thoughts on paper. You are correct, of course. However, intelligence alone cannot win battles. I hope you have a few tricks up your sleeve.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s Magecraft was excellent, but he himself was no powerhouse. He could maybe take Gustave and Lark in a fistfight, but when compared to Rider&#39;s little brat, he was, unfortunately, lacking.

I want to know about <em>you.</em> What will you do if we win this war? What is your wish?

This was important to Laurent. Caster&#39;s wish was pivotal to planning how the two would operate moving forward. A dangerous wish that would ruin his aspirations would make their partnership stable in the short term. In the long term, though? Laurent shelved the thought. The two could not survive without one another.

&quot;My wish is to keep writing. However that wish may be granted I do not care, I haven&#39;t thought about it much.&quot; Caster spoke as if his wish was a bonus to being summoned. In Fact it almost seemed like he didn&#39;t care about winning at all.

&quot;To be honest, I never had any problems with dying. Life ends for everyone, it is the only thing we can truly say is destiny. I welcome destiny with open arms, I do not fear it. Yet, here I am, given a second chance. What do I do with that chance? I&#39;m not sure. All I do know is that I want to keep writing.&quot;

The philosopher had given Laurent a long monologue after being asked a simple question. This was the burden that came with having a philosopher as a servant. &quot;Now tell me Master. How do you plan on ruling the world.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The businessman could empathize with Caster.

In a paradox, Laurent never truly feared dying, or what happened after. It was unlikely that he would have the capacity to care what happened to his company, to his family, or to the world should his existence snap out of existence.

Why would it matter if his company fell after his death? He wouldn&#39;t be able to experience it. It was with this logic that he had given Gustave free reign over his entire empire once he passed. It simply would not matter to him.

Of course, he <em>wanted</em> to survive. If given the option, he would fight tooth and nail. Yet he was perfectly content to resign himself to the reality of the situation. That was why...

<em><u>_</u></em>

&quot;I agree, Caster. I understand your logic completely.&quot; Laurent said quietly as a memory gnawed at his brain.

<em>Stop.</em>

&quot;How will I rule the world?&quot; Laurent asked blankly, seemingly caught off guard. That question was dangerous. How lead to what, which lead to why, which lead to <em>shshshshsh</em>. Laurent swallowed. 

<strong>Stop.</strong>

&quot;Olympia is a valuable city. Running the city, and its factories would be a major step towards monopolizing  several industries. Valuable industries, like steel, construction materials and equipment, and weapons would force several other competitors to buy from me. From there, it&#39;s a slippery slope.&quot;

Was he... uncomfortable? Laurent MacKenzie?

The Philosophers look was cold, he was peering deep into Laurent&#39;s soul. It was an unsettling look. One of selfish curiosity. Did Nietzsche wish to question his Master till he couldn&#39;t go anymore. 

&quot;You will do what businessmen do but that was not the question... Rather, I asked the wrong question.&quot; Nietzsche shuffled in his chair leaning forward, getting his face closer to Laurent. 

&quot;Why is it that you want so much? You are a man who has so much already. You could live the rest of your life comfortably and never have to worry about a thing. If wealth was truly your goal, have you not reached it by now?&quot; 

Nietzsche laid question after question on Laurent. He wouldn&#39;t be satisfied until he knew every detail about his Master.

—

It had been several years since the boy&#39;s grandfather left, and since his words had been unknowingly etched into the boy&#39;s heart. 

&quot;Dad, look. Profits have dropped <em>twenty percent</em> in the last quarter. Twenty! You can&#39;t keep locking yourself in that room, working on stuff that doesn&#39;t matter. There&#39;s a meeting in an hour. <em>You should be there!</em>&quot;

Silence. The boy&#39;s cries were unheard as his father returned to writing his notes. When was the last time he had looked his son in the eye? The boy had forgotten. Years, most likely. He hadn&#39;t looked up when Mom had left, either. Elias MacKenzie never looked up.

It was a madness. The madness that gnawed away at someone when they shouldered an impossible dream. When something is so transient, does it truly matter if a few people are locked out?

—

How many times had they laid off a group of employees, now? Two, three times? If this happened once or twice, there would be no corporate to head the company. They had already lost three separate factories.

Was this it? Would the family business disappear in less than a century? All because of someone&#39;s unhealthy obsession?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Elias finally looked up from his Magic Crest, which glowed brightly. &quot;I see. I&#39;ll break the news myself at the factories that all men will be let go. How many do we have, again?&quot;

&quot;One, sir.&quot; 

&quot;I see. Very well.&quot; Elias said it without much shock or regret, as if the weather would be mildly unpleasant and had not been expected. Laurent watched him.

<em>I can fix this.</em>

Laurent was pouring over an economics textbook when he received the call that changed everything. The call that told him of his father&#39;s fate. He had been shot, and was in critical condition.

An employee, one who had lost everything when he he had been fired, his house, his family, everything. Everything had been ruined by Elias MacKenzie, who stood atop his ivory tower without realizing what he had at his fingertips when compared to everyone else. He snuck in, and shot Elias in a break room, before attempting to flee. 

He was shot immediately, and Elias was rushed to Olympia Medical.</span>

This series of events is not complex. Every person strives to be loved by their family, and in turn, love in response. Such a basic need of man is unquestioned by others.

The boy vied for the attention of his father, for his love and compassion. Such compassion was returned in a mage&#39;s traditional method. Despite the man&#39;s flaws, he was still beloved by his son. He did what little he could to lessen the blow of his father&#39;s apathy.

However, the result did not change. 

The boy fed on affection, which his father could not adequately provide. All that was left in his heart was a void. The more he tried to fill it with activities, and belief, the vaster the void became.

That contradiction doomed him from the start. Should he have become a mage? It was far too late now.

The boy stood over his father within their private room within the hospital as the man was infested with a latticework of tubes and IV drips. Life support.

&quot;I love you.&quot; The boy finally said.

His father looked towards him, and gestured towards his arm with his eyes. &quot;If I do not survive, it will be your duty. Do you understand? You&#39;re strong. Only a true mage wouldn&#39;t weep at his father&#39;s passing.&quot; 

The boy was weeping, however. His father only saw an ideal mage, one that would carry on his legacy. Even if such a thing didn&#39;t exist, and that he was pointing at shadows, it comforted him.

Elias MacKenzie used his own perception to prove his son&#39;s motivation.

With that, the boy unplugged his father&#39;s life support and abandoned his family&#39;s four hundred year obsession. 

He grieved, and left the room sobbing.

&quot;If that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be, I&#39;ll do the exact opposite.&quot;

—

Laurent&#39;s eyes fluttered open.

&quot;<strong>WHAT DID YOU DO?</strong>&quot; The man bellowed as he pointed a finger at Caster, who was still lounging in his chair.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster did well to observe Laurents reflective state. It appeared that Nietzsche had asked too many questions. Nietzsche was well aware of how difficult it was to explain motivation. As a philosopher he prided himself in searching for the &#39;whys&#39; in life. 

Nietzsche jolted back slightly as Laurent acted out in aggression. Was he reliving some form of trauma? &quot;See Master, you are not so simple to understand.&quot; 

&quot;You accept what you want but do not ask why you want to do it. You are a slave to your own ambitions, Master. We all have demons in our head. Converse with yours, do not let the past defeat you. Accept your pain with open arms because it will never go away.&quot; 

Caster repositioned himself trying to get into a comfortable position. He needed his Master to be resolute and grounded in reality. Otherwise he feared the worst. He would do his best to study Laurent MacKenzie and in return he hoped his Master would do the same for him. Nietzsche believed this kind of relationship would lead to a powerful bond that would help the team in the future. 

&quot;Oh and if you have any questions for me now feel free to ask.&quot; Nietzsche chimed in one final statement. He acted as if the intensity in the room had never existed at all.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Silence! Be quiet, Caster!&quot; Laurent barked as he deftly stood to his feet, and paced over to his Servant, so comfortably lounged upon his Master&#39;s furniture.

This small, imbecilic little man had dredged up buried memories that were best left forgotten. They were locked away for a reason. Anything that made him question his resolve had to be locked away, because...

He was afraid at what conclusion he would reach.

If Laurent had done all this for nothing, then his life had no value. If his goal was incorporeal, then he himself lacked value. This was unacceptable. The veil that was cast over his psyche had to remain ironclad. The world could not have a weak ruler.

He would not end up like his father.

Laurent stormed past Caster, and into his personal chambers, leaving Nietzsche to ponder the turn of events.</span>
