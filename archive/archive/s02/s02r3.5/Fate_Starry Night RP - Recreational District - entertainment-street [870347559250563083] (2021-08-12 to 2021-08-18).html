Of course, they were still under the watchful eyes of the people at the entertainment street, especially due to their outfits, but they paid it no mind.

&quot;We aren&#39;t heading back, for your information.&quot; Pappardelle immediately replied, dragging Orecchiette even further down so that they would meet at eye level. Perhaps it was payback for the way he had picked her up last time.

&quot;This scuffle enlightened me. To various things, mind you. As such, I have several questions to ask.&quot; She declared, before finally releasing the grip on his ear. Orecchiette could finally stop shrimping, his spine readjusting to its natural position as he towered above the tiny supervisor.

&quot;But first,&quot; She paused, before tapping his chest. &quot;how are you feeling? Is your tattoo intact? Any internal injuries? Do you see visions or dim lights in your line of sight? Do you feel sick or have a headache? Any wounds that have opened or risk of reopening?&quot;</span>

The cloak was torn, so he pulled it off his shoulders. The act elicited pain from his hand, and he remembered Lark&#39;s graffitied dagger.

&#39;A healer would be ideal,&#39; he said, showing Pappardelle the stab wound in the center of his palm. The wound had not permanently damaged his nerves, but it made holding onto things more challenging than it had the right to be. For instance, Pappardelle&#39;s hand, which was conveniently prodding him in the chest.

He took her hand by the wrist and examined them. &#39;Do you know healing arts?&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Just like she had thought, Orecchiette&#39;s injuries were still there. He did a good job at hiding it with his nonchalant attitude, but it was still something worth addressing. 

&quot;...You can&#39;t say that you think you&#39;re fine and then ask for healing arts.&quot; Pappardelle sighed, wondering how people like him even survived in the battlefied. Did this mean that he had no healing arts of his own?

That line of thought would soon be followed by Orecchiette grasping at her wrist and observing her carefully, as if hoping she was a portable first aid kit. The size difference only made that stare even more unnerving.

&quot;Of course I do!&quot; She replied, swiftly retreating her hand. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have asked otherwise. I can alleviate the pain a bit, but we&#39;ll need to return to base for more severe injuries. For now, leave these matters to me.&quot;

She immediately got to work, almost as if she felt offended by Orecchiette&#39;s stare. If he wanted heals, he would get them. She conducted surgery out in the open, focusing on healing the injury in his hand. Ligaments started to heal themselves as he felt his skin being restored. His supervisor was rather keen on being versatile, albeit he couldn&#39;t tell if the spell being cast on him was a miracle or not.

&quot;...Mmm, I sense various engravings around your body.&quot; Pappardelle remarked. &quot;I assume you utilized runes in your scuffle against Lancer?&quot; She didn&#39;t need to assume. She read his profile after all. However, she wanted to hear it from the horse&#39;s mouth.</span>

He kept his arm still as Pappardelle set to work. The wound stung and tingled as flesh knitted back together under Pappardelle&#39;s administration. His brows furrowed, not from the pain, but from the way Pappardelle performed her arts. 

There were no healing runes engraved on her gloves, nor did she precede the healing ritual by chanting of litanies. Compared to how the nuns and priests did it at headquarters, Pappardelle&#39;s method was slower, yet more thorough. She had warned him to seek a certified medic afterwards, but Orecchiette doubted he would actually need one.

His frown deepened when Pappardelle inquired him about his runes. &#39;Were you not aware?&#39; He asked, genuinely surprised. &#39;Runes are a staple in our equipment. It&#39;s the only thing we can use outside of performing miracles. Without them, I wouldn&#39;t be half as durable as I am...&#39; 

He observed Pappardelle&#39;s healing arts more carefully. &#39;You are not using either.&#39; He stated. It was only an observation, yet Pappardelle felt as if she had been put under scrutiny. It seemed that her junior had caught on to her unorthodox methods of performing &#39;miracles&#39;.</span>

&quot;Flattering your supervisor is unnecessary.&quot; She harrumphed, maintaining her professional integrity despite being tempted to give thanks back. She focused on his injuries to put her mind at ease. First, the flesh, then, the skin. Deconstruct the problem into several small solutions. Just like how she had been taught.

Her mind erred once Orecchiette mentioned her lack of runes.

&quot;...This is simply a low ranking Miracle that requires no prayer. You most likely haven&#39;t seen it due to its relative uselessness compared to other spells.&quot; Pappardelle covered herself. &quot;I am a supervisor, not a talented nun. You will have to forgive my inadequacy.&quot;

Almost as if to sell the story better, the rate of Pappardelle&#39;s healing speed slowed down to a crawl. Interesting.</span>

He pushed her sleeve back, exposing her wrist. Bandages peeked out from underneath, spooled around her arm messily. The fight from earlier had loosened the bandage, and Orecchiette, curious, hooked his finger onto the end of the wrapping and pulled it out without thinking. 

Did she inscribe the runes directly in her skin?</span>

The next, she witnessed him forcibly grab her arm and reveal the falling bandages underneath. He pulled them out, revealing her skin covered in flakes of scar tissue and residual burns. The after effects of using that spell a few moments ago? No, they seemed to be older.

The executor&#39;s analysis was cut short as the nun started angrily poking at his chest in an attempt to shove him away. 

&quot;Let go of my arm. Immediately!&quot; She ordered, staring at him in shame. It seemed like the arm was a sensitive subject, so Orecchiette&#39;s blunt manners did him no favors.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pappardelle&#39;s abnormal reaction did not go unnoticed. However, that only piqued Orecchiette&#39;s curiosity even more. The bandages started unraveling, but instead of runes, he was treated to the ghastly sight of scars and burns. Orecchiette&#39;s expression hardened. 

&#39;You are injured,&#39; he said, pushing Pappardelle&#39;s sleeve up all the way to her elbow despite her violent protests. She could report him for his multitude of transgressions later, but he had to assess the damage first. After all, the whole point of him taking vanguard was to make sure his supervisor steered clear of injuries. If he couldn&#39;t even do that, then what was the point of him being there? What was the point of his protective gear?

He pulled the rest of the bandages off with ease to examine her wounds more closely. However, his concern soon turned into confusion. The Executor dragged his thumb over the coarse scars and off-color skin...

Old wounds.

Suddenly, Pappardelle&#39;s reaction made more sense. Some people wore their wounds as badges of honor, but Pappardelle clearly did not belong to that crowd. 

&#39;...&#39; Orecchiette fell silent. He had probably, very possibly just done something incredibly rude to Pappardelle, similar to how she attempted to enter his room without knocking. He was able to prevent her snooping without much trouble, but the same couldn&#39;t be said for just now. He had practically torn her door off the hinges, and there was nothing she could do.

&#39;I&#39;m- My apologies.&#39; He quickly let go of her arm, unsure of what to say or do. But soon a metaphorical lightbulb lit up over his head. He threw his torn cloak over Pappardelle&#39;s shoulders. Then, without even considering the fact that they were still in the middle of the street in broad daylight, grabbed his own shirt with both hands and lifted it up, revealing a smattering of scars underneath.

She was too weak to push him off. Too feeble to pull herself away. All she could do was be at his mercy, utterly powerless at her own pupil. It was rather humiliating, but Orecchiette caught on to his unseemly treatment towards his supervisor and promptly apologized. He patched her up, asked for forgiveness and...started showing off his battle scars in public.

Many eyes were attracted to him. Some shocked, surprised and perturbed. Others curious and enamored. Pappardelle was a witness as well, but her emotions were quite harder to judge.

Powerlessness, anger, frustration, embarrassment, shyness, shock, surprise, curiosity, arousal.

A mixture of emotions spilled over as she was incapable of deciding on how to address his pupil. What he just did now was incredibly rude, but his attempt to apologize was beyond sudden. It verged towards stupidity.

But Pappardelle needed to vent. So vent she shall.

&quot;...Orecchiette.&quot; She stared at him with discontent. &quot;I&#39;ll let you know that this doesn&#39;t solve <em>anything!</em>&quot; She shouted, before lunging her hands towards his chiseled tummy and starting to rub it all over.

The man was puzzled by this action, before he was overcome by a painful urge to laugh and giggle. Pappardelle was tickling him!

Too weak and short to slap him, she decided to vent by mildly annoying him instead. &quot;Whoever taught you to just snoop around as you pleased? Especially with your own supervisor.&quot; She cried out, venting as the intensity of her pokes ramped up. She wouldn&#39;t let go until her pupil gave up.</span>

Though one thing was obvious: the woman was somehow even more furious than before, and the reaction caught him completely off guard. 

&#39;Solve-?&#39; He had no idea what she was even referring to. He had snooped, so he let her snoop in return. What was she so mad about? &#39;Please calm down, Pappardelle. I only wish to tell you that your scars are no more shame-&#39; 

But Pappardelle was sick of his explanations. She pounced on him like a housecat and unleashed her deadliest attack on his exposed tum...

She started to <em>tickle</em> him.

Orecchiette shivered. His face contorted into that of a grimace as he fought against the alien sensation rising from his stomach. Whatever Pappardelle was doing, he did not like it. It made him feel vulnerable, that he was forced to act against his better judgement. Something was bubbling up within him-

He grabbed Pappardelle by the back of her uniform and lifted her into the air. 

&#39;Vent time is over.&#39; He said sternly, wrapping Pappardelle into a burrito with his cloak and slinging her over his shoulder. He looked as if he was in great pain, though Pappardelle had an inkling that that might not be the case. 

But more importantly, did he just treat her like a sack of potatoes?

&#39;Tell me where you need to go. I will get us there promptly.&#39; Orecchiette was not keen to give her any options as he hauled her down the street.</span>

<em>&quot;Not so tough and cold now, are we?&quot;</em> Pappardelle thought in her head, watching the man&#39;s face contort in expressive ways. He had shown more emotion in the last minute than in the past few weeks spent together with her.

<em>&quot;This is for your attitude! For being dense! For groping me earlier! For touching my arm!&quot;</em> She let it all out, her feelings buried beneath professionalism. It was hard to get the nun to open up, but Orecchiette had succeeded, albeit in the worst possible way.

<em>&quot;...For treating me like a midget!&quot;</em> She poked his belly button, a critical weak point. This angered the beast, who finally retaliated and grabbed her by the scruff of her neck like a kitten.

She could barely compute being wrapped like a burrito and being carried away. Her movements were restricted and she was unable to escape.

The lack of movement cooled her head, enough for her to realize the embarrassing action she had just committed. Tickling her own pupil in broad daylight?! Utterly reprehensible!

She was blushing, hiding herself behind Orecchiette&#39;s cloak and wishing to crawl into a hole and disappear. 

&quot;...Five hundred steps forward, then to the right until you see the MacMillan&#39;s estate. After that, turn left and you will see the <span class="mention">#consulting-firm</span> in the distance.&quot; She gave Orecchiette efficient directions, but then tapped at his back.

&quot;Orecchiette? Don&#39;t mention this incident to <em>anyone</em> from our organisation. This is an order.&quot; She tried to sound assertive, but it sounded more like a whimper. From angry to sad, this woman was truly a handful.</span>

She felt Orecchiette turn slightly to the right, possibly to look at the street sign near an intersection. He then walked a few paces down the street and stopped in front of a pub.

&#39;So we <em>are</em> heading back. I thought you were going somewhere else.&#39; Instead of acknowledging her orders like always, Orecchiette acutely reminded her of her ancient excuse. He then carried her <em>into</em> the pub, marching down clusters of tables and chairs and bewildered customers as he headed towards the backdoor.</span>

Orecchiette wasn&#39;t helping either, with his impressive memory skills that were unfortunately wasted on remembering irrelevant details instead of social cues.

&quot;Then is then, and now is now.&quot; Pappardelle explained with much frustration. &quot;The atmosphere changed, so I am adapting accordingly. Something you ought to learn too, Orec-&quot;

The aroma of spilled coffee and warm milk filled the air as Pappardelle realized that her pupil was marching inside of a pub. He had taken orders to the letter.

&quot;You took 20 less steps than you should have! The path is <em>beyond</em> the pub!&quot; She scolded, but at this point it was just more efficient to go through the current route.</span>

Instead of turning around, he picked up the pace and was out of the pub in a few blinks of the eye. He then headed towards yet another restaurant on the other side of the street. Instead of sticking to the main roads, it almost felt as if he were trying to make a literal beeline towards their base.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While shortcuts were appreciated, the ruckus and panicked stares of civilians who were enjoying their afternoon meals did a great job at warning Pappardelle that Orecchiette&#39;s methods were anything <em>but</em> efficient. Expedient, perhaps, but there was more to pragmatism than that.

&quot;Halt! Halt!!!&quot; She pinched his back, but it was fruitless since his training regimen had caused his muscles to feel like the hardest steel. Instead, she resorted to strong and fearsome pokes, akin to knocking on a door.

&quot;I did not give you permission to disobey my orders. You <em>will</em> take 500 steps. No more, no less. Understood?!&quot; She shouted, trying to rein him in before he eventually met his match as he entered a sushi bar. While being distracted by Pappardelle&#39;s mewing, he stumbled on one of the many conveyor belts that were displaying sushi for anyone to pick up and eat. How cumbersome to place these in the middle of the restaurant.

Due to Orecchiette&#39;s weight and fit frame, the slightest nudge he caused was like an earthquake to the average human. The sushi plates went flying as delicious seafood wormed itself into his mouth. Maybe Pappardelle would appreciate some as well.</span>

It seemed that he would meet his greatest match yet at the conveyor belt, which for some reason took up nearly all of the restaurant.

He tried to slip past, but the conveyor belt put up more than a fight. With one bump the plates of sushi were sent flying, and most of them were aiming for his face!

&#39;...&#39; In a split second decision, Orecchiette grabbed a handful of chopsticks from the table. Wielding a pair each between his fingers, he then proceeded to stab the flying sushi out of the air with more precision than Pappardelle&#39;s step counting. 

He flipped the Pappardelle burrito around and pressed the sushi kebabs into her busy hands. &#39;Rations for the road,&#39; he said, then slapped down some money and pushed his way out of the sushi restaurant.

&#39;500 steps, is it?&#39; He eyed the <span class="mention">#consulting-firm</span> in the distance, then started taking huge strides towards it. Forget 500 steps. He was going to make it there in half!</span>

While it seemed like his actions had no rhyme nor reason to them, he always committed them with utmost efficiency. The split second decision of having a snack came rather easily to him, to the point he even paid the tab and offered delectable sushi rolls to his supervisor as a sign of goodwill.

&quot;What the-&quot; Pappardelle was completely caught off guard, finding a tuna and salmon roll in her hands while Orecchiette kept rushing through his trial of 500 steps.

Her stomach rumbled at the sight of them and she groaned, knowing that none of her drilling was getting into her pupil. She resigned herself to her fate, and chose tuna.

&quot;...These are good.&quot; She pointed out immediately. &quot;Make a note of the location, Orecchiette. My hands are currently tied.&quot; She remarked. Indeed, were she not holding more sushi rolls, she would have already written down the name of the resturant.

&quot;And slow down! How am I supposed to eat these at your current pace...?&quot; She lamented, as they had now reached the <span class="mention">#consulting-firm</span> in around 321 steps. At least this meant that Orecchiette would stop.</span>
