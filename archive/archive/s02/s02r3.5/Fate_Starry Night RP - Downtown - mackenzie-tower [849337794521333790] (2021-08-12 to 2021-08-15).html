                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The air was clean, if only for a brief moment. The rain that had resulted from Olympia&#39;s damaged weather dome had resulted in Olympia&#39;s air quality going from a whimpering one to a resounding ten. It was incredible what a little water could do.

It was unfortunate, then, that Laurent had little time to experience it. 

Following his escape from the Brobdingnagian, Laurent had been rushed to Olympia Medical Hospital&#39;s ER, and had been operated on instantly. If someone as important as a MacKenzie had died on the hospital&#39;s watch, their reputation wound be damaged, perhaps forever.

Medical professionals and Servants alike were brought in. None were on the same level as a famed clinic in Delphi, but combined, they were enough to stabilize a man suffering from overloaded magic circuits. If his singularity had tried to absorb any more of Kun Wu&#39;s Magecraft, Laurent would&#39;ve lost his legs, and more than likely, his life.

He had been lucky.

MacKenzie Industries, on the other hand, quietly chugged along. Laurent did not show up to any shareholder meetings, nor was he available for those to discuss contracts with both Olympia and Delphi. However, these were the same people who had steered the company through the disastrous ring-around that Laurent&#39;s father had brought on, and they were more than capable of taking over for a few days.

After a few days, Laurent was quietly allowed to leave OLH, and was to be watched for a short while by trained staff, though they were quickly replaced by Laurent&#39;s own men.

It hurt to walk.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That was the first thought that Laurent had as he staggered out of a meeting with his shareholders. Well, &quot;stagger&quot; was a strong word. He limped with style, as one befitting his position. He was strong, yet just weak enough for others to sympathize with his struggle. 

When he reached the elevator leading to his private quarters, Laurent fell to the ground, breathing heavily. <em>Would I ever fully recover?</em> Was the only thought that rushed through his head. That, and lamentation that he was so frail. That brat and his concubine. They had done this to him. How he wanted to get revenge, but he couldn&#39;t.

He was too weak.

Clumsily getting to his feet, he staggered down the hall to his personal quarters. When he got there, he grabbed a flower pot stand by the door for dear life. He eyed the next nearest source of support: a leather recliner. He lunged for it.

<strong>Thud.</strong>

He hit the ground in a grunt of pain. This was going to be difficult. He wasn&#39;t supposed to use Magecraft for a few days, lest his circuits fry again. Laurent groaned, and resigned himself to crawling across the floor like a worm.

Upon reaching his study, he clawed his way up onto his seat, and put his head in his hands. He had to think. Think of some way to come out of this City Grail War with something. Apparently, a Delphian businessman who worked with hotels had been attacked, and his hotel had been damaged. Perhaps he could get a contract with the Kingsmades, along with offering to buffer up their security team&#39;s equipment.

However, he had bigger issues. Issues closer to home. Something like the massive castle that he could see from his window. It was getting <em>larger</em>. It was an eyesore, and the fact that it was so close meant that it would one day become a battleground that could affect MacKenzie Industries&#39;s infrastructure. It had to be dealt with.</span>

Lark and his Lancer.

Meeting them now would take too long. He was weak and tired. He rung up his secretary.

<span class="pre pre--inline">Yes?</span> A serious female voice answered. 

&quot;Hey, Serenity. Clear my schedule for tomorrow. Let the senior council know, and let them take over in my stead. No decisions are final until I confirm them.&quot;

<span class="pre pre--inline">Yes, Mr. MacKenzie.</span> The phone hung up, and Laurent sighed.

Hopefully his legs functioned tomorrow.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Some time after meeting Lark and Lancer...</strong>

Lark had the potential to be a good investment. He was an enjoyable person to converse with, and someone that, given the opportunity, Laurent would rather hire than kill. This was, however, not the time to be softhearted. His Servant was strong, and a near impossible wall to vault over. While Lark was the weak link in the relationship, Uther Pendragon was no fool. Getting to stab Lark in the back would be nigh impossible without help. 

Besides, he needed Lark and Lancer to go to war with Jampo and Saber. If anyone could breach the apparently named &quot;Dolorous Gard&quot;, it was Lancer.

Dolorous Gard. What a pretty name for such an ugly fortress.

Laurent wanted it torn down as quickly as possible. 

Staring at his desk, filled with information on Masters and Servants of Delphi and Olympia, Laurent had to admit something: he was stumped.

He could only manipulate the outcome of this war to a certain extent. Getting physically involved would result in his hospitalization, Kun Wu had proven that. With all the men and guns in the world, he could not overpower a Servant. The only people capable of producing that level of equipment en masse was the Church.

He would rather die than go groveling to them. 

Which meant he had to mobile his resources in a way that could defeat a Master, but with a Servant not physically capable of defending them. Laurent looked over the list:</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo was too difficult to even get near.

Gustave would be wary of him, though he could potentially talk his way out of a fight.

Kun Wu&#39;s chaperone was too sharp, and his Magecraft too strong.

Kingsmade was too guarded.

Lark could simply strongarm his men with Lancer.

That left...

&quot;<strong>Caster</strong>.&quot; Laurent muttered to himself as he pulled up the folder for Delphi&#39;s Caster. This was recent information, pulled from Caster&#39;s excursion into downtown Olympia. Laurent&#39;s informants had followed Caster&#39;s Master to her base of operations, and had even gotten an address.

&quot;The Delphi Integrity Bureau?&quot; The businessman groaned. It was never easy. She&#39;d need to be ambushed outside and shot. He&#39;d find a mercenary to do the work. He had done it in the past, and being connected directly to the murder of a Delphian public servant was a one-stop shop to disaster. Apparently, she wasn&#39;t all that well-liked. That made for an excellent excuse.

Caster&#39;s identity was obvious: <strong>Nietzsche</strong>, and he was quite obviously not physically fit for combat. His scouts had proven it. He could not protect his Master, especially from a quick attack.  A quick glance at ServantPedia™️ left little to work with, however. Did he strike and hope the philosopher was as physically weak as he was alive? It seemed risky, but worth the shot.

Laurent picked up the phone, and gave the order.</span>
