It was a turbulent day packed with rain and explosives, but Team Rider had managed to retreat to Delphi. They had done so on auto-pilot, saying not even a single word to each other as they were too tired to even speak. Despite their condition, one of them was still rather lucid: Kun Wu approached a hospital, asking for treatment for his injuries. He paid top dollar for fast, efficient treatment and received it rather easily. Bandages, ointment and Magecraft went a long way, albeit he got warned to keep his wounds clean for the next few days...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It hadn&#39;t even been a full 24 hours since Kun Wu and Rider had arrived at the hospital. Memories of explosives, gunshots and psychedelia were still fresh in his mind. His wounds had already started to heal thanks to Magecraft and fast-acting drugs, but then the itch set in. Like hundreds of tiny ants crawling across his body. Tickling. Nibbling. The sensation was driving him nuts. 

He wished he could scratch - and <em>boy</em> did he try to, but unfortunately the medical staff were old hands at dealing with problematic patients. All that scratching had earned the local celebrity were a pair of <strong>anti-scratch mittens</strong>, fastened securely over his hands and making him unable to even tap-tap on his phone and complain about it on his social media. 

Kun Wu had never cringed so much when the doc stickied his prescription on his shirt with duct tape. What was he, a toddler? He waved his gloved blob-for-hand menacingly, but the doc sent him off with a smile, reminding him to keep applying the ointments and keep his wounds clean for a few days...

<em>As if.</em>

Kun Wu scoffed. Keeping his wounds clean meant keeping it out of water. Keeping himself out of water meant no baths. The medical staff at the hospital did a superb job <em>disinfecting</em> him, but seemed to have thrown personal comfort out the window.

Kun Wu shivered and twitched as he made his way out of the medical room. <em>He was going to go mad if he didn&#39;t take care of the itch soon,</em> he thought, teeth clenched and jaw hardened as he struggled down the hallway to meet Rider. 

He was surprised to find her asleep, and even more surprised to find her snoring. It seemed that the battle at the Brob had revealed more than just her skin; she was showing a side of her that Kun Wu had never seen until now...

Kun Wu rubbed the soft fabric of his anti-scratch mittens all over Rider&#39;s face. After waking her up in the most unromantic way possible, he promptly dragged her away to somewhere more comfortable to sleep in.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Delphi Bathhouse was one of the city&#39;s most famous leisure centres. It advertised itself as a hot spring, sauna, pool and bathing area all in one, being a place for its citizens to find an oasis of relaxation in the middle of their busy, business centric lifestyles. Such popularity did not escape Kun Wu, who immediately brought his Servant there and raised two fingers.

Tickets for two.

In the next few minutes, they were already inside one of the many hot springs that filled the building. Medium sized rooms outfitted with pools designed to mimic a traditional hot spring as described in logs from a century ago. Runes were inscribed at the bottom of the pool to warm the water and give it artificial healing properties. The result was a soothing experience to mind and body as the two felt their worries melt away...

...For now. Kun Wu was having the time of his life, covered from the neck down in steamy water as his pain and tiredness washed over, replaced by a bumbling sleepiness. However, he could not help but notice Rider&#39;s attitude. The woman&#39;s figure was beautiful, especially in her bare form, but she was sitting at the other edge of the pool. A distance of around a dozen feet separated them, yet to Kun Wu it felt like miles. She was purposefully staying away.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu stretched his legs and felt himself sink further into the hot bath. The healing waters did wonders to quell his itch. It also smelled way better than the ointments he had been prescribed. 

He raised his arm out of the water to examine it. Faint fractal patterns still crawled along his skin where the wounds had not completely healed, but he could already see new skin growing around them. 

&#39;Two, three days ought to do it.&#39; Kun Wu mumbled, wondering whether he could ditch his prescriptions and get by with staying at the hot springs 24/7. Would Rider approve? While she had spent the majority of her past life on the waters, cold, bottomless salt water was quite different from the steamy, luxurious baths of the modern day. Not to mention, a bath the size of a pool, just for the two of them!

She would be living like a queen here.

Kun Wu paddled around the pool, looking for Rider. His face felt warm, but the hot water was only half of the reason. Thinking back on it now, Rider hadn&#39;t objected at all when he requested for a mixed bath. 

<em>Not that he had done it for nefarious purposes!</em> The youth slapped his own cheeks. He simply didn&#39;t think. Or rather, was too grumpy and too itchy and too tired to think. Though in hindsight, perhaps the god of fortune was smiling upon him when he had made the request...?

Kun Wu shook his head in an attempt to reset his thoughts. He could see Rider&#39;s silhouette now, seated at the other end of the pool, feet in the water. She hadn&#39;t taken a dip yet.

Did she not know how?

Kun Wu changed directions and paddled towards her. &#39;I know this goes against a pirate&#39;s instincts, but you&#39;re supposed to submerge your whole body in the water. It&#39;s just like taking a bath in a regular bathtub! Just a hundred times bigger.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Since her rude awakening, Ching had been dragged across Delphi&#39;s streets by her enthusiastic Master. Of course, she was far too dazed by the fight at the Brob to think clearly about where they were going. By the time she had regained consciousness and realized that she was still present in reality, she was sitting by a pool inside of a closed room with steamy water. Kun Wu was loitering in the sea with a relaxed expression while she stared at the bathroom walls, blank eyed.

She didn&#39;t even have the foresight to bring a towel. Nor to say no to Kun Wu&#39;s request of a mixed bath. Ching was a proud woman, one who would have objected to revealing herself to a Master as childish as him, yet right now it felt like it didn&#39;t matter. Nothing mattered, after what she had witnessed moments ago.

....

No! She couldn&#39;t give up right now! Just because the fight with Assassin reminded her of her own limitations didn&#39;t mean-

...It definitely proved something. She knew that this talk was coming. That she would have to break it to her Master eventually.

If only someone else could have summoned her. Or perhaps, she didn&#39;t deserve to be summoned at all.

Speaking of her Master, Kun Wu had decided to approach her after realizing that his Servant was not taking full advantage of the pool. This would not stand: What was the point in purchasing two tickets if only one of them ended up using it? He would make Rider enjoy the hot springs, no matter what!

Though, his resolve faltered a bit once he actually reached the woman. Seeing her up close with her bare body for him to see...

A curvaceous figure that gave him indecent ideas. Voluptuous traits that turned his cheeks rosy red. She just had everything and more when it came to catching his eyes.</span>

But the power of Kun Wu&#39;s resolve and his ulterior motives (read: getting famous) was enough to keep him from straying away from his path. Truly, he was even more humble and pure than the almighty Buddha. Instead, he kindly attempted to assist Ching Shih in enjoying the hot springs with him.

The moment he spoke, Ching snapped out of her trance, escaping from her confused thoughts as she returned to reality and realized that her Master was right next to her. She also remembered that she was naked.

Her body felt hot and bothered for some reason, as if she wanted to avoid Kun Wu&#39;s gaze. Was she embarrassed, or was this something else? She started feeling weird ever since Assassin got away.

&quot;I&#39;m not a child, milord.&quot; She instinctively placed her foot on Kun Wu&#39;s face, serving the dual purpose of putting him down while hiding his gaze. 

&quot;And you&#39;ve soured my mood. This entire day has been nothing but trouble. Can you not tell that I would rather be left alone?&quot; She broke her vow of silence, using it to vent and complain instead. It wasn&#39;t productive, but she needed to get it out.

&quot;I feel like I&#39;ve been toyed with. Toyed by that arrogant yuppie who tried to blow up my cargo ship. Toyed by that Assassin who escaped before I could finish them off. Toyed by <em>you</em>, who are casually relaxing in a pool and acting as if nothing happened.&quot;

She nudged herself forward, as if planning to take Kun Wu&#39;s advice and drop into the pool.

&quot;What is my purpose here? I&#39;ve completely failed to show up any of our opponents. Assassin was a small fry compared to a heavenly general, yet I was not even able to rid myself of that stain.&quot; She snarled. The boy the understood: She wasn&#39;t mad at him. She was mad at <strong>herself.</strong>

&quot;I&#39;m a Rider, <strong>yet I don&#39;t even ride!</strong>&quot; She shouted, before staring at Kun Wu. &quot;Can&#39;t you see how ridiculous that is? Well, I think it&#39;s time <em>we</em> change that.&quot;</span>

She jumped at him, just like he had asked. Except that instead of landing inside of the water, she landed right on top of his shoulders. Her legs wrapped around his neck as her crotch was now deep into his face.

&quot;If I&#39;m denied the purpose of my Class, then I suppose I&#39;ll just have to ride <em>you</em>, milord. No objections here, I assume? Good!&quot; She exclaimed with anger as Kun Wu was barely able to stand straight with Rider&#39;s weight combined with the floaty feeling of the hot spring. God, he didn&#39;t even say anything. Whatever was eating away at Rider was enough to make her lash out at even her most trusted companions. Such was the way of the pirate queen.

Granted, he did not mind this outcome. Getting a view of Rider&#39;s features so deliberately was quite...something. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider was a bundle of emotions, a raging storm that struck without warning. She lashed out towards Kun Wu, her words sounding every bit the cruel mistress that she was...

Or was she?

If Kun Wu hadn&#39;t known any better, it almost sounded as if his dear Servant, pirate queen of the high seas, was throwing a temper tantrum. He wasn&#39;t given any time to confirm, however, before Rider decided that she wasn&#39;t satisfied with throwing words around any longer. Instead she threw her <em>entire weight</em> on top of him, straddling his shoulders in her barest form and riding him like a pony. She was seething like a wounded cat...

Kun Wu, on the other hand, started seeing stars.

Despite being enveloped by Rider&#39;s meaty thighs, he felt as if he&#39;d just been hit in the head with a hammer. Blood rushed to his head and then some, and the room started to spin. 

Rider had placed him in quite the precarious situation. Though he was a healthy man with healthy needs, his doctor <em>did</em> warn him against too much excitement while he was still healing...

<em>gluglugluglugluglgulg-</em>

Rider would find herself slowly sinking into the water. It seemed that her &#39;ride&#39; was on the brink of drowning...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Seething cat was a good way to put it, since there was nothing else comparable to describe Rider&#39;s folly. She was irritated, perturbed and completely lacking in confidence after her latest confrontation. Lashing out at Kun Wu was her way of forgetting her powerlessness at the hands of Guan Yu and Assassin.

She was like a thunderstorm of passion, yet like every other thunderstorm, she was <em>brief.</em> The rage kept going, until the flames turned to cinders and Ching&#39;s anger was unable to burn any longer. The haziness clouding her mind temporarily vanished as she came to grips with reality and realized what she was doing.

While she would feel embarrassed because of her compromising position, she could not help but notice that Kun Wu was sinking. Face down in the water, even.

She panicked, immediately getting off and shaking the boy, which admittedly may not have been the brightest idea. It rattled him, causing him to submerge even deeper. This forced Rider to grab him by his pits and raise him upward, allowing his head to finally breathe as she held him up like a baby lion from a particularly famous movie.

&quot;Milord. Milord!&quot; She shook him even further, shocking him in more ways than one as he witnessed his Servant go from angry to worried in a second. It made him wonder what was going on in that head of hers. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He stopped talking, coughed awkwardly, then gave Rider a few pats on the arm.

&#39;You can, you can let me down now,&#39; he said, even the back of his ears turning a deep red. &#39;I need to, er, fully submerge myself in the water to get my money&#39;s worth.&#39;

She had no issues with dropping him there, letting him splash into the water once she had determined that he was conscious enough to swim on his own.

Normally, she would return to her sulking. Hover in the hot spring and relax in some lonely corner while flicking her Master away. But after seeing how the previous confrontation went, she realized that she didn&#39;t have long if she wished to have the &#39;talk&#39; with Kun Wu. It was now or never, even if the boy would hate her for having such an important conversation in a moment of relaxation.

&quot;Milord, I think it&#39;s best if we part ways.&quot;

It felt like a bomb had been dropped on his back. Far more formidable than Ching&#39;s thighs.

&quot;After seeing my performance in the past few weeks, along with the investments I bring to the table, I have deduced that we are a terrible match. I cannot shine with you around. Instead, I merely drag you down.&quot; She glanced away from him, appearing dignified and speaking as if her words were objective fact. It was better to do that than reveal the frustration in her face. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As much as she touted her refined looks and seductive charms, Rider was not gentle at all when it really counted. From being hoisted up like a lion cub to sinking back into the pool like a rock, Kun Wu was starting to suspect that Rider may have been summoned with more pirate in her than...whatever beguiling acts she had been putting on until now. After all, it was always times like this, when she was caught off-guard, that she would start to act more like a brute.

He didn&#39;t dislike it. In fact, he found it kind of cute. Even though Rider had so adamantly insisted that she would never place her trust in him, just seeing her break out of her perfect demeanor to pinch his cheeks or flick his forehead in fits of rage was enough to bring smiles to his lips. In a way, it felt as if he was getting closer to her heart. Learning what made her tick was only the first step, but a firm step nonetheless.

But now they were taking three steps back.

&#39;...&#39; Kun Wu remained silent as Rider finally dropped the truth bomb. The bath was hot, but her words cut like ice. Rider&#39;s outburst earlier felt like the tip of the iceberg - or perhaps he had even witnessed the tip long before that. When did it first happen? At the docks? At little miss informant&#39;s hideout?

He had <em>witnessed</em> it all, yet he had chosen not to <em>see</em> it, instead slapping bandaid after bandaid onto the issue, thinking that Rider would get over it because heck, she was a <strong>Servant</strong>! 

He wanted to kick himself. So much for talking big about treating Rider as more than a Servant. In the end, he was not that much better than that girl from the government. 

But surely he could do better if he tried? Rider had finally spoken her mind. Then it was about time that he did too.

Unless the feeling is mutual, which I assure you that it isn&#39;t.&#39;

He turned around and found Rider sulking to the side, her rage all but petered out. He waded over, grabbed her chin, and turned her towards him. 

&#39;You are the reason I&#39;m still alive.&#39; He spoke seriously. &#39;How do you think I was going to make it out of that ship on my own? We were up against an Assassin and two mages with a penchant for guns and fireworks. I&#39;d be sleeping with the fishes right about now if it wasn&#39;t for you. So come on, stop putting yourself down. Master&#39;s orders.&#39; 

He pinched her cheeks. Wonder where he learned that from.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider expected some form of retaliation. Grief, complaints, verbal abuse, shock...Those were all characteristics exhibited by those she double crossed during her life as a pirate. Kicking her business partners while they were down felt incredibly satisfying to her, yet abandoning Kun Wu sparked no joy in her heart. If anything, she was expecting him to call her a fraud. A scam artist. Someone who promised him the world with her abilities, yet was chickening out at the first sign of difficulty. And here she had the gall of accusing him of wasting his talents as a performance artist.

Perhaps the two of them were more alike than she thought. Hence why the breakup would hurt a lot more. But it was necessary, or Kun Wu would keep having a ball and chain tied to him. It was for his own go-

Before Ching could rise from the bath, her Master approached her without thinking twice. Despite the difference in height, he stood on his toes and grabbed her by the chin, gently turning her around as he bore witness to her disgruntled face. The face of a woman reluctant to leave.

&quot;...I am no hero, milord.&quot; Ching replied with a blush as Kun Wu pinched her cheeks. The gesture was sincere. &quot;All I did, I did for myself. I had selfish goals at heart. I hid my plans from you. I hid my treasures from you. I called you an equal, but I still thought of you as my own child!&quot; She shouted out loud. Her heart convulsed rapidly. Kun Wu felt tears streaming from her rosy cheeks.

&quot;I&#39;m <strong>pathetic!</strong> A pathetic, sorry excuse for a woman! No matter what I do, I keep failing. Both in life...and in death.&quot; Her rage had returned, albeit in a different shape. Instead of venting on those weaker than her, she was admitting her own insecurities and failures.

Ching Shih was a strong woman. It was because she was strong that she could admit to her own failures, even if they resulted in crushing her heart and soul. Her true essence had been laid bare for her Master to see.</span>

Kun Wu grabbed Rider&#39;s hands before she could rattle his skull any longer and clasped them together in front of him. &#39;Didn&#39;t we make this clear from the start? I will exploit you in any way that suits me, and you are free to exploit me in turn. We are business partners, and business partners are allowed to keep a secret or two. It does pain me that you treat me like your child, though,&#39; he looked away for a moment, clearing his throat to fill the awkward silence that followed. &#39;I mean. I <em>am</em> turning 20 this year, in case you haven&#39;t been following my DelphiInsta™️...&#39; 

&#39;But that&#39;s beside the point, okay?!&#39; He recovered himself, sinking back into the pool until only his eyes were visible above the water. Water bubbled where he breathed out air, hiding his furious blush.

&quot;That contract is null and void! How can you even exploit someone like me, who poisons her own fleets?&quot; She cried out in disbelief, believing her Master to be naive. A statement that would be further reinforced once he revealed his age.

&quot;Twenty? You looked younger than that to me...&quot; Kun Wu felt part of his soul leave. &quot;But I digress. Stop trying to pine for me! Can&#39;t you see that you&#39;re sabotaging yourself? I shall simply find someone else to be my Master. You deserve not this burden.&quot;

Rider was terrible. Even in her moments of sincerity, she kept hiding herself in lies. She phrased her tantrum as a way of protecting Kun Wu, but the truth was that she was running away.

&#39;What do you mean-<em>cough, hack!</em>-it&#39;s a merit! A <em><strong>merit</strong></em>! Just means I take very good care of my skin!&#39; He reemerged from the water in a fit, splashing water everywhere and making a horrible case for himself. &#39;Besides, who are you to call me a child? You don&#39;t even age in your new body! I bet you&#39;re actually a h-&#39;

Kun Wu was a smart boy. He wouldn&#39;t just go around poking a lion&#39;s den for no good reason. So, smart as he was, he swallowed the rest of his words and started pulling Rider back to the edge of the pool. 

Steam swirled around them. Kun Wu dipped a finger into the water and tried to channel his mana into the water, but nothing happened.

The youth sighed.

&#39;I&#39;m kind of useless without my fan, aren&#39;t I?&#39; He laughed dully, stirring the water with his finger. &#39;You&#39;d think that creating more steam would be child&#39;s play for someone who plays with fire 24/7, yet here I am, unable to do a thing without going through the motions of...&#39; He made a grand gesture in the air, as if to shake open an invisible fan. His circuits did not make so much as a stir.

He sighed once more, shifting his attention back to Rider.

&#39;Okay, Madame Ching,&#39; he took a deep breath. &#39;Since I can&#39;t perform properly right now, how about I make it up to you with a story? It&#39;s what I do second best, after all.&#39; He boasted.

Surely this won&#39;t be the last? You know exactly where to find my channel, after all.&#39; 

Sometimes, negotiating with Kun Wu felt like hitting a sack of cotton. Rider couldn&#39;t tell whether he was dense or crafty, but no matter what cruel words she threw his way, he always bounced back like an annoying flea. Was there no end to his optimism? Perhaps she should open up his brain to take look at how it was wired...

Meanwhile, Kun Wu motioned for Rider to sit, then leaned his own arms on the edge of the pool and rested his head on them.

&#39;You&#39;ve asked me a few times already, about why I entered the City Grail War. Well, fame is one thing to do with it...&#39; He paused for a moment to collect his thoughts. Then words flowed.

&#39;Once upon a time, a little boy lived in the mountains. One night he came across a well in the ground a saw the reflection of the moon. The boy thought, &quot;<em>Hmm, I would like to catch the moon!</em>&quot;

&#39;The well was deep and the boy was alone, but he would not be deterred. The boy tried to climb down first, but the inside of the well was mossy and slippery and, being a terrible climber, he hesitated. Next he tried to make a giant ladle out of wood, but his limbs were so weak that he couldn&#39;t saw a tree to save his life. 

&#39;The boy was dejected, but he did not give up. Day after day he stubbornly persisted, learning from the monkeys to climb and learning from the village&#39;s toolsmiths to craft. Eventually, he honed his skills to near perfection. He was the fastest climber in the forest and the best craftsman in the village, yet the moon in the well still evaded both his skills and tool, disappearing from his sight whenever he had disturbed the tranquil waters in the well.

Through tear filled eyes he gazed up, and lo and behold, the moon - the <em>real</em> moon, not the poor imitation reflected in the water - was hanging high up in the night sky, forever out of his reach.

&#39;Hmm...&#39; Kun Wu paused, unsure what to say next. He scratched the back of his neck and hesitated. &#39;You know, in the original version, the boy would go on to build the tallest ladder in the world. Then he would climb it all the way to the moon and pluck it out of the sky...&#39;

&#39;But now that I think about it, the ending doesn&#39;t make much sense. Does it make sense to you?&#39; He splashed water in Rider&#39;s direction. &#39;I mean, the moon couldn&#39;t even be bothered to tell the boy that he had been chasing after a mere illusion all this time! I don&#39;t think it would <em>sit</em> there and let itself be plucked just because he had a bigger ladder.&#39;

As a child, she was a fan of fantastical stories, but outgrew them prematurely after being faced with the harsh realities of her life. You could say her heart had no love for fantastical elements or well-written tales. She saw those as tools, and thought Kun Wu felt the same. If that was the case, then what was the purpose of this tale?

She didn&#39;t get it.

&quot;The boy was an idiot for falling in love with the moon in the first place.&quot; Ching replied with much bluntness. &quot;Why fall in love with something so ethereal and distant? Why pursue it when you know your goal is impossible? Longest ladder or not, the boy still wasted his time.&quot;

&quot;If I were the moon, I&#39;d pull an act of kindness and tell the boy to stop wasting their time.&quot; She replied decisively, splashing water back at her Master out of annoyance. This was the moral she had obtained from that tale. Would Kun Wu agree? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Instead of making that impossible ladder, what if the boy instead looked up at the sky and said, &quot;<em>Screw you, moon!</em>&quot; and went on to craft the most beautiful lantern in the world? He can hang it up in his room instead of the real thing. He can even capture the moon on a canvas or in a photo. The possibilities are endless.&#39;

&#39;See, neither the moon nor the boy had done anything wrong. The boy was simply too stubborn for his own good, and that&#39;s why he suffered.&#39; 

Kun Wu turned to look at Rider.

&quot;Stop that line of thought right now.&quot; She said sternly, as if predicting Kun Wu&#39;s next line. &quot;Before you hurt yourself.&quot; She said.

Rider was making some interesting expressions; he wished things could stay that simple. He shook his head. 

&#39;No,&#39; he said, brushing Rider&#39;s warning aside. &#39;You know how it is. I always associate my stories with a message. We both agree that the boy in the story is foolish...&#39;

&#39;But what about you, Rider? Do you suffer because of Ching Shih&#39;s legend, or do you suffer because Ching Shih the <em>Servant</em> is too damn stubborn for her own good?&#39; He prodded, challenging her gaze. &#39;What is it that you think you deserve? What is it that you seek? Have you ever stopped to consider the fact that you&#39;ve only suffered because you <strong>always insist on acting alone</strong>?&#39;

That was wrong. Kun Wu was beyond being treated as such. He had matured past his age and was now dissecting the woman in a way that nobody else ever had. Not even her own husband. Not even her parents.

&quot;...Are you judging me?&quot; She shaped her hand into a fist, responding to Kun Wu&#39;s analysis with irritation. 

&quot;Calling me stubborn and a loner. What is your point? How could <em>you</em> ever hope to understand me?!&quot; She shouted, raising her voice and body as water splashed around Kun Wu like a storm.

&quot;What do you know about failure? What do you know about aiming high and plummeting down? What do <em>you</em> know about <em>me?</em>&quot; She asked with an icy glare, moving forward as she towered above Kun Wu, her face meeting his.

&quot;Is it selfish for me to wish for a perfect life, after falling so short in my previous one?! Tell me!&quot; She shrilled in his face. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He stood to face Rider. &#39;You, Rider, are the second most <strong>stubborn</strong>&#39;—he prodded her square in the stomach—&#39;<strong>selfish</strong>&#39;—he prodded her again—&#39;<strong>arrogant</strong>&#39;—prod—&#39;and <strong>conceited</strong> fool I&#39;ve ever met! I say <em>second</em> most, because you&#39;—prod—&#39;are staring at the world&#39;s biggest idiot in the face.&#39;

He huffed, his face contorted as he struggled to keep his voice under control. 

&#39;What do I know about you? I could ask you the same.&#39; He said with a rueful smile. &#39;Believe it or not, I know exactly what it&#39;s like to fail. I know how it feels to be all alone. I almost gave away my life once chasing after an improbably dream. I don&#39;t want to see <em>anyone</em> drown in that despair again.&#39;

&#39;Looking at you, I feel like I&#39;m staring into a mirror.&#39; He reached up and started kneading Rider&#39;s face. Soothing her furrowed brows. Pinching her cheeks and softening the hardened lines around her lips. 

&#39;Don&#39;t end up like the boy in the story,&#39; he chided. &#39;You are a beautiful woman. A strong and capable woman. You deserve a lot better. A lot more. But lying to yourself - or me - won&#39;t get you anywhere. You want a perfect life? Do you even know what a perfect life means?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Each prod felt like a stab as Ching witnessed Kun Wu&#39;s true self. Under that presumption of recklessness, childlike wonder and impulsive spending, lied a person who had experienced painful truths and tragic losses.

Yet despite those failures, he marched on, hiding his mask so well that even Rider fell for it. The child she saw, the person who reminded her of her foolish stepchild, was actually much wiser than she had thought.

Both had experienced loss, but Kun Wu was the only one willing to move forward. Ching couldn&#39;t. She feared progress. How could she accept her dreadful past, one so vile it had been embedded in her Spirit Origin forever? She hated that woman. The &#39;pirate queen&#39;. She wished for a life without restraints, where the past didn&#39;t tie her down and instead allowed her to look forward to a hopeful future.

Alas, that was but a dream. Just like a distant moon.

Almost as if reacting to his Servant&#39;s plight, Kun Wu extended his heads towards her face. Pinching, rubbing and caressing. All acts of love. Once again, a strange warmth overtook her feelings. It was exactly the same as when Kun Wu hugged her on the day of her summon, or when he grasped at her hands at the Olympia docks.

No one else had treated her like this. Beyond a trophy and beyond a woman. A partner.

She felt like breaking down. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she started whimpering like a wounded puppy.

&quot;Tell me.&quot; She replied softly. &quot;What is a perfect life then, to you?&quot; She asked her Master, feeling at a loss for words. Her world view had been shattered and all she wanted was comfort. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Just when Rider was about to pronounce her Master as legally deaf, he finally spoke up.

&#39;Well. I was kind of hoping that you had an answer to that.&#39; He looked away. He stopped rubbing her cheeks too. Awkward. 

&#39;No! Wait! I mean! How would I know what a perfect life looks like? I haven&#39;t obtained it yet. How do I describe something I haven&#39;t experienced? It&#39;s why I joined the City Grail War.

Until Kun Wu disappointed her yet again, sweetening up with promises of wisdom before awkwardly delivering her the blunt truth: That he had no idea on how to even answer his <em>own question.</em> He even stopped rubbing her cheeks, just when she was getting used to it!

&quot;....You little.&quot; Ching&#39;s tears stopped in an instant, replaced by a burning anger. The desire to bonk her Master on the head was getting overwhelmingly strong.

&quot;You can&#39;t just tell me things and backpedal moments later!&quot; The pirate hissed, towering above Kun Wu as he felt like his life was in danger. Rider was already frustrated at herself, and the false hope that the boy had given her must have pushed her towards her breaking point. Did she feel betrayed? He certainly hoped not!

Ching raised her hand. An all too familiar sight. The open palm, the speedy approach. A slap was incoming, either to his cheek or his forehead, and his fate was to bear it.

....

His body felt warm, as he opened his eyes and saw silky white hair gently caress his nose.

He felt two warm mounds squish on his chest, along with delicate, yet strong arms wrapped around his back tightly. The heat of the hot springs could never hope to match this sensation.

&quot;You&#39;ve made so many promises.&quot; Rider whispered in his ear, hugging him tightly and hiding a blush. &quot;Now take responsibility, <em>Master.</em>&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Kun Wu could already envision himself getting flicked all the way to the other end of the pool. But just because he could imagine it, didn&#39;t mean he was going to take it!

&#39;Stop!&#39; He failed his arms about, bracing himself for the inevitable. &#39;I&#39;m not! I&#39;m not backpedaling! I&#39;m just being h-&#39;

He shut his eyes at the last moment, but the slap - or flick, whatever he had expected - never came. He was surrounded by warm, soft flesh, while the scent of perfume lingered in the air.

&#39;-honest.&#39;

His arms felt like jello. They flopped uselessly in the water for a bit, until he finally gathered enough courage and put them around Rider&#39;s back. Emboldened by his own action, he pulled her in and hugged her tight to his chest.

&#39;I don&#39;t go back on my promises, in case you haven&#39;t noticed.&#39; He said quietly, stroking Rider&#39;s back to soothe her. &#39;Remember when I said I&#39;d squeeze every last drop of usefulness out of you to win the City Grail War? Well. That goal of mine hasn&#39;t changed. I <em>will</em> take responsibility for my words, whether you like it or not.&#39;

Kun Wu gripped Rider by the shoulder and gently pushed her back. His eyes found Rider&#39;s and locked with her gaze, challenging her not to look away.

&#39;From this moment on, I want you to drop all your pretenses and tell me exactly what it is you need. I don&#39;t care how ridiculous it sounds or how it might cast you in a negative light. I&#39;ve read all about your past. Your husbands. Your sons. Your clients. Your fleet. Did you really think I was oblivious? That I would think badly of you once I learned about your past?!&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu felt bad for lambasting Rider when she was down. But if he didn&#39;t say anything now, he was afraid he&#39;d never get the chance again. Rider&#39;s outburst had terrified him sufficiently; he didn&#39;t even want to entertain the thought of waking up the next day, only to find Rider gone from his suite. 

He pushed Rider into the pool&#39;s edge, cutting off her escape. 

&#39;I am not your child, Ching Shih. Nor am I one of your husbands. Stop seeing them through me. <strong>They all failed you because they couldn&#39;t appreciate you for who you are!</strong>&#39; He squeezed her shoulders, fingers digging into her skin. 

&#39;<strong>Listen, Rider. <em>Look at me,</em></strong>&#39; he demanded. &#39;<strong>You. Are. A gem. An unpolished diamond. A flower waiting to bloom. Even though there is dirt in your roots, you can still grow. You can still blossom.</strong>&#39; His gaze softened when he saw her expression. &#39;<strong>I am here to help.</strong>&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her body nuzzled against his, causing Kun Wu to follow suit and embrace his own Servant. The young Master gently caressed Ching Shih&#39;s silky hair. Likewise, Rider delicately slid her fingers around Kun Wu&#39;s back, feeling his robust musculature and admiring the training underneath, having nothing but respect towards him for once.

They shared a moment that was beyond that of a Master and a Servant. For an instant, it felt like the universe had faded. All that remained was them and the soothing pool, as they wrapped around each other like rosy thorns.

Of course, all good things had to end, as Kun Wu regained his composure and separated himself from Rider&#39;s warm embrace. He wasn&#39;t done, however, as he asserted dominance and pushed her towards the edge of the pool, staring down a woman that was far taller than him.

Ching Shih felt like she was looking at an entirely different man. Not her son, nor her husband. Someone different from them both, yet still someone special. Was this the bond between Servant and Master? Or was this...something else?

She blushed as Kun Wu rattled her shoulders and drilled his feelings towards her head. Tragic memories of her children and husbands came flashing back to her eyes. Had they failed her, or had she failed them? She couldn&#39;t decide which narrative to accept. It was burden too large to bear.

Hence why she wouldn&#39;t bear it <em>alone</em>. Kun Wu inched closer, revealing his hand and true motives. Someone was supporting her for once. A hopeless woman like her, finally receiving someone&#39;s aid and goodwill.

Not seen as a trophy by her husbands.

Nor seen as a tool by her children.

Someone had accepted her for who she was. Despite her muddled history. Despite the atrocities she had committed. Despite her own ineptitude as a Servant. She had already cried plenty of tears, so she was unable to deliver anymore. All that was left was a bumbling mess. The true Madame Ching: An innocent young girl from a fishing village.</span>

So instead of crying, she would <em>laugh.</em>

&quot;...Since when did you become so shrewd? Have I perhaps rubbed off on you?&quot; Ching Shih chuckled as she complimented her Master. &quot;You are right about one thing, however. You are not my husband. Nor are you my son. No, you are something far beyond them.&quot;

She stepped forward, satisfied with her decision. In the last thirty minutes, her hope towards the future had been reignited. All by a single individual.

&quot;You are, after all, <strong>milord.</strong>&quot; Ching replied with a smile, raising her hand and patting his head, gently caressing his long hair while doing so.

&quot;<em>...Though you still look incredibly young.</em>&quot; She teased in his ear. The fact that she had gone back to cracking jokes at his expense was already a good sign. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

&quot;<em>Now where did you get that idea from I wonder?</em>&quot; She replied with a shady smile before regaining her composure.

&quot;<em>Ahem</em>, well, now then. How goes our next plans of attack? I have my own ideas, of course, but I&#39;d like to hear yours as well to see if-&quot; Before she could finish, Ching suddenly stumbled and fell on top of Kun Wu, much to her surprise and embarrassment.

&quot;A-Apologies!&quot; She stammered as she tried to pick herself back up, but failed to do so. Her body quivered and her arms were shaking. She felt dizzy too, almost as if she was lacking in sleep. &quot;It seems like the last fight took quite a toll on me. Milord, I recommend purchasing some mana batteries on our way home.&quot; She suggested, albeit Kun Wu felt puzzled. It had been a few hours and he already felt plenty refreshed by the bathhouse (for various reasons). How come Ching still looked so tired, then?

&#39;You are a big klutz, you know that? Don&#39;t try to strategize in a bathhouse if you can&#39;t even take care of your own body.&#39; He reprimanded her softly. &#39;I know this is your first time here, but don&#39;t push yourself. This, too, requires training!&#39;

He was about to help her out of the pool to cool off a bit before she started mumbling about mana batteries. Frowning, Kun Wu took her pulse at her wrist, then did the same at her neck. His frown deepened at the even rhythm beating through his fingers.

Rider seemed to be in good health. Minus the apparent fatigue she was displaying, at any rate.

&#39;I suppose it <em>is</em> a mana issue then,&#39; he concluded, but not entirely convinced. &#39;I did buy a few extra batteries for you at the hospital. Did you take them?&#39; 

She had been napping back then. Did she simply forget? Did Servants even need sleep?

&quot;I hope that by training you don&#39;t mean what I think you do.&quot; She replied with a wary gaze, referring to Kun Wu&#39;s several performances planned for the next few weeks.

She then blushed as Kun Wu started feeling her up, checking for any chances of possible Servant sickness and coming up short. He then agreed with her hypothesis and reminded her of the hospital batteries.

&quot;Of course I did. They most likely weren&#39;t enough.&quot; Ching said bluntly. &quot;I <em>did</em> spend a lot of mana today, milord. Just give me a few more to make up for that.&quot;

Strange. The request sounded reasonable, yet Kun Wu had the habit of tracking his spending quite wisely (unless it was related to his Amazones.com account). According to his monthly budget, he was buying Rider at least two mana batteries a day. That was above the Servant average, according to the CityNet, but he figured Ching Shih simply loved being pampered.

Was his assumption wrong? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

While she immediately brushed off that thought, the idea of spending time with her Master in such a relaxed atmosphere filled her with glee.

&quot;How generous of you.&quot; Ching replied in a teasing tone as she comfortably laid her head on Kun Wu&#39;s shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m in such safe hands~&quot; She chuckled as she let herself go, allowing Kun Wu to bear her full weight as she let him grip her like a princess.

However, he was quick to introduce his own trademark impishness as he grabbed a towel and slapped it at Rider&#39;s face, blinding it from seeing any important bits.

&quot;M-Milord! I had no plans to pry...&quot; Ching replied, but her tone gave away the lie. &quot;...Fine. I shall await your return.&quot; She said, covering herself with the towel as she headed off to get clothed. Or, to be more accurate, resummon her clothes. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

The lounge outside the bath was modest in size, but lavishly furnished. Vending machines propped up along one wall, fully stocked with ice-cold drinks of all flavors to mimic the traditional hot springs of the olden days. 

It took no time for Kun Wu to make his way back to the lounge. Rider was only halfway through browsing the vending machines when she heard the youth&#39;s energetic footsteps reenter the room. 

&#39;Here ya go!&#39; Kun Wu waved the small packet in his hand as he ran across the room at record speed. Contrary to Rider, the bath had rejuvenated him. Now that he was clothed from the neck down, it was almost impossible to tell that he had just survived a fight to the death.

&#39;Have you made your choice yet?&#39; He asked Rider, pressing the mana battery packet into her hand, meaning for her to take it with a drink. &#39;I always pick strawberry. Banana milk is quite popular too, but they&#39;re always out of stock.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Vending machines. A modern invention that seperated mankind from beasts. The convenience of having a large assortment of food and drinks to choose from compared to manually making those items seperately was a mark of progress.

No wonder Ching Shih stared at it, awestruck. So many flavors to choose from. She wished to try them all.

Then Kun Wu returned with the mana battery, along with another revelation. 

&quot;Bananas? I thought they were rare commodities...&quot; She remarked with a shocked face.

 &quot;At least they were in my time. The world really moved heaps and bounds since I left.&quot; She looked downward, showing a side that Kun Wu rarely got to see: Ching&#39;s insatiable curiosity of the modern world. He could tell that fairly easily, since her eyes shone with interest that rivalled his own whenever he came up with a new idea for a story or performance.

&quot;Strawberries too...At this point, what <em>doesn&#39;t</em> this have?&quot; Ching pointed at the vending machine. She stared at it more, before realizing that it even held her favorite flavor. She tapped the button instinctively.

Pineapple juice.

&quot;Mmmm&quot; She sipped it while gulping down the mana battery. &quot;Feels like I&#39;m right at Macau. This invention is truly amazing, milord. Why not order this over the garbage you order from the CityNet?&quot; She stabbed Kun Wu&#39;s tastes with no mercy. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;You do realize that I can order any drink I wanted off CityNet <em>without</em> the hassle of using a vending machine, right?&#39; Kun Wu spared Rider no mercy as he reached up to bonk her on the head. &#39;Besides, vending machines are best in public places like this! Being forced to make a choice because you can&#39;t take the whole thing with you...doesn&#39;t it just make you want to come back for more? It&#39;s genius. Pure genius! Both as a marketing and a motivational ploy!&#39;

He slapped the vending machine as he praised it to death. The machine responded with an angry <strong>beep</strong>, which he ignored, instead inserting more money into it to purchase his drink of choice. A bottle of strawberry milk fell out and he picked it up with much delight, downing it in large gulps.

&#39;Ahhh, this really hits the spot!!!&#39; He exclaimed, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. &#39;Nothing better than a cold drink after a hot bath.&#39; He said, his face melting into one of pure bliss. 

It was amazing how an ordinary bottle of cold beverage was able to refresh him to the core. Kun Wu wondered whether this was comparable to how Servants felt when they ingested mana batteries. Rider seemed to like them, to the point of gorging on them. He eyed the empty packet in her hand. He had bought her a full pack; did she just eat them all?

&#39;How are you feeling?&#39; He asked unblinkingly. &#39;The batteries they sell here are a different brand than the one I&#39;m used to ordering. I hope it tastes alright.&#39; Or rather, do mana batteries taste like anything at all?

&quot;To me, it simply sounds like you are <em>enjoying</em> being scammed. You remind me of the gamblers that used to frequent some of the casinos I owned.&quot; She poked fun at him, observing as he relaxed and gulped down an entire bottle of strawberry milk. She smiled, feeling at ease as she casually kept sipping from her beverage as well. Was this perhaps the first time she had felt at ease with Kun Wu?

These thoughts were immediately cut off once the boy started asking her various questions, his curiosity piqued. &quot;Oh. Uh.&quot; Ching muttered, staring at the empty pack in her hand. She promptly threw it away in a nearby bin.

&quot;Well, if you have to ask, mana batteries don&#39;t really taste like anything. It&#39;s plainer than water.&quot; The pirate replied. &quot;At the same time, you feel refreshed. For us Servants, it gives us the same feeling as a good night&#39;s rest or a large meal, but none of the flavor. That&#39;s all I can say about them.&quot;

While Ching appreciated Kun Wu&#39;s courtesy, a part of her suspected him a bit. <em>&quot;Did he notice?&quot;</em> She thought to herself, before erasing that thought immediately in order to avoid any further suspicion.

&quot;But why do you ask? Were you perhaps interested in eating one yourself? I assure you, it would do you no good.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

&#39;But that&#39;s a long time ago and I was stupid!&#39; He hastily corrected himself. &#39;I know mana batteries are safe for human consumption, but I wouldn&#39;t try it unless I can hog the bathroom all to myself for a few hours. You Servants really have it easy.&#39; He huffed, then sized Rider up with his eyes. Even on a good day, he would feel queasy after having ingested even one single battery. But here Rider was, looking the same as she always had after downing a whole pack.

He started to circle her, checking her out from all sides.

&#39;All that mana, and you don&#39;t even feel the least bit dizzy?&#39; He asked. &#39;Servants really are something special. Where do all those excess mana go? Do you store it in a layer of fat like bears preparing for winter?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider&#39;s eyes widened. The amount of mana necessary to power a Servant&#39;s circuits would be enough to poison a dozen or so Masters. She wasn&#39;t a magus by any means, but she had no idea that mana batteries were so versatile. If she were a human, however, she would avoid them like the plague. The fact that Kun Wu still tried them out regardless was both the mark of his courage and foolishness at the same time.

&quot;At least you admit it.&quot; She replied to Kun Wu&#39;s self-criticism, before noticing her Master circle her around like a wary kitten. He was carefully observing her condition, causing her to feel somewhat annoyed. Before she could ask the motive behind that odd behaviour, Kun Wu finally gave it away.

&quot;...Are you worried?&quot; Ching asked, before realizing she had received her answer just a few minutes ago. Kun Wu had already sworn to protect her, so it was normal for him to act cautiously. Still, it was best for her to ease his worries as well.

&quot;I am completely fine, milord. Are you feeling left out? Would you rather I spend any excess mana on you?&quot; She giggled as she extended her hand and stroked his chin, tilting his head and making him stare into her eyes. While seductive, it was merely her attempt to stray him away from the conversation.

&quot;Don&#39;t ask me such boorish questions. I have no idea how a Servant&#39;s body works myself. I merely exist. Right now. Right in this moment. So why not enjoy my company?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Kun Wu responded to Rider&#39;s teasing with a hug. Since she had so graciously invited him into her personal space, he had no reason <em>not</em> to take up on her offer. His arm wrapped around the small of her back and nudged her close.

&#39;If you&#39;ve got the mana to spare, then by all means, use it for me!&#39; He grinned voraciously, his whole face lighting up. &#39;If you think I&#39;m going to start treating you like a delicate flower just because you almost fainted on me, then you&#39;d better seriously reconsider your career path, because <em>this</em> Master&#39;—he thumbed himself on the chest—&#39;still has a few grand plans in the making.&#39;

It didn&#39;t work this time. Kun Wu was quick to hug her tight and wrap his arms around her again. It elicited a blush and incredible willpower to not hug him back.

&quot;Milord, not in public...&quot; She motioned for him to stop, but he wouldn&#39;t budge, pressing at her aggressively as he revealed his true face and affections towards her. How embarrassing...for Ching.

Of course, being a talented mistress, she quickly tried to turn the tide in her favor. She placed her hand behind his head and pushed him closer. 

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better if it were just the two of us? Be patient until we get back to the bath, hmmm?&quot; She caressed his head while simultaneously goading him into waiting. Hopefully, Kun Wu would settle down, and forget about the mana issues entirely...

At least, until the lounge&#39;s TV started playing. Being a fairly profitable business, the building was outfitted with various televisions in the public areas that showed a variety of channels. The one currently playing was the local news.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Once again, Ching Shih had put forth her favorite tactics to dissuade her Master: playing coy. Unfortunately, Kun Wu&#39;s brain worked in mysterious ways. Sometimes, he was tactful. Other times, he was dense as a rock. It all came down to how well Rider matched wavelengths with him...

&#39;Are you shy?&#39; Kun Wu responded to Rider&#39;s teasing with an innocent question, catching the mistress off guard. Shy? Her? Did she suddenly change her Spirit Origin, or was Kun Wu baiting her?

But Kun Wu did not notice the machinations of her mind. &#39;This won&#39;t do. This won&#39;t do at all,&#39; he <em>tsk&#39;d</em>, wagging a finger in front of Rider&#39;s face. &#39;There is no plan if there is no audience. If you haven&#39;t noticed, the ship where we fought Assassin and their helper was completely deserted! All that work, and I didn&#39;t even gain a single fan. So much for my grand debut in Olympia.&#39; 

Rider didn&#39;t even need to turn to him to hear the pout in his voice. She looked over, and he was pouting like a puppy who had been denied his favorite snack. As much as he complained about her making fun of his youthful appearance, he certainly had no qualms playing it to his advantage!

&#39;...But no use crying over spilt milk. In fact, our exploits at the ship had given me quite a few ideas about our next performances. You can summon some pretty chains. Now that you&#39;re fully recharged-&#39;

<em><strong>...Rumors of a fight at the Kingsmade Hotel have been reported to local authorities...</strong></em>

Kun Wu fell silent as the TV started broadcasting the local news. It seemed that Delphi had had its fair share of excitements while he and Rider had been gone. The Kingsmade Hotel. Wasn&#39;t that just a few blocks away from where he lived? Who&#39;d have thought...

His eyes lit up as the announcer started gossiping about possible Servant sightings. A large man with a large beard and an even larger lance? Now where had he seen someone like that?

&#39;It&#39;s him!&#39; He blurted out. &#39;<strong>The door guardian!</strong>&#39;

Guan Yu!

&#39;Guan Yu is on the move! That&#39;s perfect! I was worried that I&#39;d need to pull some strings to bait him out into the open.’ He exclaimed happily, then pointed at the blurry image of a man in green flashing on the TV.

&#39;In case you were wondering, <em>that</em> is going to be the main course of my next performance. The fall of lord Guan Yu, by the hands of an assassin with beauty rivaling that of Diao Chan.&#39; he narrated with much gusto. &#39;<strong>It would turn history on its head!</strong>&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A shiver went down Ching&#39;s spine. Cold enough for Kun Wu to sense it. That relaxed, calm atmosphere had been ruined by that fearsome reminder. They weren&#39;t out of the Holy Grail War yet. Various, more powerful opponents than a meek Assassin would come to fight them.

Ching Shih felt like slapping herself. She had wanted to break off with Kun Wu for his own safety. Not because she didn&#39;t trust his prowess, but because she didn&#39;t trust herself. Because...<strong>her mana reserves had a limit.</strong>

A limit that wasn&#39;t enough for Assassin. Let alone <strong>Guan Yu.</strong>

But after all this, could she really abandon her Master? He had earned her trust, her admiration, her lo-

...

It was her duty to at least give him a fair warning.

&quot;Milord...&quot; Her voice sounded a bit more anxious. &quot;Can I be brutally honest with you for a second? Well, the truth is...That my current mana reserves are most likely no match for Lancer. Nor any of the Knight class Servants. In fact, I would say that I merely tied with Assassin instead of overpowering them.&quot;

She said so with shame on her face. Kun Wu could physically sense the embarrassment in her face, as if she felt ashamed at admitting her weaknesses in front of him. Even worse, she was raining on his parade. His enthusiastic eyes coupled with his unbridled praise and admiration for Rider made her want to sink in the ocean.

<em>&quot;I&#39;m not that good! Shut up!!!&quot;</em> She screamed repeatedly in her head, wishing that her Master hadn&#39;t put her on a pedestal. This was more painful than being publicly humiliated by the Chinese Fleet. She talked a big game, but when push came to shove, she was completely powerless...

But could she ever say no to Kun Wu?

She thought that in her head for a second and then looked away. <em>&quot;As long as he doesn&#39;t pull anything cute, it&#39;s fine. I won&#39;t budge.&quot;</em> She gave herself false hope. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He was surprised at the woman&#39;s self-deprecating response. After all, he thought that she had already got it out of her system!

...Apparently not. Not with the way she immediately turned herself inward, shame and regret written all over her face. She was not joking around.

But that only confused Kun Wu more. Didn&#39;t she say that she had completely recovered just now?

&#39;...Not even with the extra mana batteries?&#39; He asked quietly. &#39;I can afford as many as you need, you know.&#39;

She shook her head.

&quot;No, not even with extra mana batteries. It&#39;s more that my cup is full, and that anything else would just make me overflow.&quot; She said with a defeated look on her face.

&#39;It&#39;s not that you need more...Of course. Something like this would happen.&#39;  He muttered, eyeing the empty mana battery packet at the top of the trash can.

&#39;It&#39;s not that you need more mana. Not when the cup itself it limited in capacity. And the cup-&#39; He made a gesture of holding a cup and pouring its contents onto the floor. &#39;It drains. Quickly. Because you are a Rider, and like many Riders, you have a high mana upkeep.&#39; 

It all made sense. Rider&#39;s fatigue, her reluctance to use her Noble Phantasm. All the extra mana batteries she had been ingesting on the daily, with little to show for it. Just like how he failed to expand his own magic circuits with the intake of mana batteries, Rider likely wouldn&#39;t have been able to expand her own mana tank just because she had been feasting on mana batteries nonstop.

&#39;What you need isn&#39;t quantity,&#39; he said. &#39;It&#39;s <strong>consistency.</strong>&#39; 

A consistent supply of mana, available to her at all times, ready to use without having to go through the lengthy process of breaking down a mana battery. He looked down at his own hands, protected snuggly under a pair of leather gloves.

&#39;I can help with that.&#39; He said, pulling the gloves off his fingers. &#39;Rather than making compromises with an alternative plan, I can simply offer you a <em>solution</em>.&#39;

He took Rider&#39;s hand, interlacing his bare fingers with hers.

&#39;<strong>Let us bond.</strong>&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When Kun Wu started piecing the information together, she could not help but sense his disappointment. She wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if her Master had changed their mind and dumped her right there. It&#39;s what she would have done back in the past if one of her own crewmates started being a burden on the fleet.

Surprisingly, he didn&#39;t care. Instead, he started thinking of his own solution.

It was the same solution Rider had in mind, except that one of them wasn&#39;t willing to take it.

Kun Wu&#39;s fingers felt warm. Rider wished she could embrace them, but...

<em>slap</em>

Ching Shih immediately pushed his hands away with a light slap, much to Kun Wu&#39;s surprise.

&quot;Milord, I apologize, but,&quot; She looked down with a sad glint in her eyes. &quot;<strong>I&#39;d rather us not bond.</strong> I would hate to be a possible liability to someone like you. The main reason I wanted us to part ways was because I did not want to endanger either of us. Bonding would cause our lives to be intrinsically linked. As a Servant, someone with a very limited lifespan, I would hate for my own demise to cause you suffering.&quot;

While Kun Wu most likely felt betrayed by her rejection, he could understand where Rider was coming from. Her intent to protect was genuine, especially when looking back at his encounter at the ship. Ching prioritized protecting him, which showed that she cared. But then why? Why didn&#39;t she have any confidence in his own ability to protect his own Servant? Was there still a problem of trust?

&quot;Instead, I&#39;d rather we go with my alternative solution. You see, the reason I started hoarding treasures, is because my Spirit Origin gets <strong>stronger the more wealth we have.</strong> It can be anything, ranging from modern currency, to jewels and gold. This ability of mine reaches its fullest potential when both of us are rich.&quot; Ching Shih explained. &quot;Hence why I constantly tried to keep you from misusing your funds. It was for your own good, milord.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

The outcome surprised Kun Wu. But even more surprisingly, Rider had not done it out of disdain, but concern for his well-being.

&#39;...That was a million-credit offer you just fed to the fishes. I hope you are aware of that.&#39; Kun Wu pouted, unwillingness written all over his face. &#39;I hope you aren&#39;t doubting my abilities. Last I checked, my magic circuits are of excellent quality. I am more than fit to provide mana for the both of us.&#39;

He boasted, but Rider knew he was not bluffing. If the fight at the Brob was anything to go by, Kun Wu&#39;s magecraft, while simplistic in nature, was a mana-hogging monstrosity. If he could manage to maintain that with no issue, then surely he would be more than capable of supplying mana for her as well.

Kun Wu was aware of this fact. Which was why he was not convinced.

&#39;Theses riches of mine,&#39; he commented, skepticism written all over his face. &#39;They would strengthen you how, exactly? Make you more sturdy, power up your Noble Phantasm? Do they also funnel into your mana store, or will you still be spent after firing off a single Noble Phantasm?&#39; He prodded relentlessly, cutting Rider no slack as he dissected her plan.

&#39;Of course, I&#39;m fully onboard with your plan. I&#39;ve seen this perk of yours at work, I know how strong it is. But...why not both?&#39; He cocked his head and studied Rider&#39;s expression. &#39;With the boost from acquiring these riches <em>and</em> a reliable source of mana, you could be unstoppable.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She was hoping her Master would not pry further. Simply nod and approve as he did always, with his blind trust. Unfortunately for her, they had grown too close to keep referring to each other politely. Kun Wu had various questions and Rider had no answers. She could only make them up on the spot.

She felt cornered.

&quot;I-I&#39;m definitely not doubting your skills! You have already proven yourself to me plenty at the ship, not to mention you aren&#39;t as naive as you look.&quot; She attempted to praise him, before realizing her last compliment felt like an insult.

&quot;<em>Ahem</em>, what I&#39;m saying is that I truly do respect you, milord. Which is why I&#39;d rather not put your life on the line, even if your circuits are high quality. Riches and gold are but temporary compared to you.&quot; That was incredibly nice coming from Ching Shih. Yet Kun Wu could practically smell the deceit in the air. It was a pure kind of deception. Similar to a white lie.

&quot;Well...The riches would boost my strength tremendously while also making my Noble Phantasm reach new heights. However, I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ll be spent after a single use of it.&quot; Ching replied, folding to Kun Wu&#39;s pressure. To think that she would be cornered by someone much younger than her...

&quot;...But I only need one shot. Just one. So long as you can guarantee it, we&#39;ll be able to crush anyone. Even Guan Yu. I can promise you that.&quot; She regained her confidence, stepping forward to seal the deal as she placed her hands on Kun Wu&#39;s shoulders. She towered above him, staring deep down into his eyes as she noticed his attempt at calling her bluff.

She leaned forward, until their foreheads touched and their lips were just a few inches away from each other.

&quot;...You trust me, don&#39;t you? I wouldn&#39;t throw a fight for no good reason.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu folded his arms and listened as Rider showered him with niceties. &#39;Umu umu,&#39; he nodded, a narcissistic grin stretching across his lips. &#39;That&#39;s right. Riches are merely extrinsic, but my brilliance is eternal. You should have said so sooner. I applaud you for having such an astute observation...&#39;

&#39;<strong>IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY?!</strong>&#39; He flew into a rage and grabbed Rider by her - his hands searched fruitlessly for a collar, but in the end had to settle for her shoulders. He started rocking her back and forth. &#39;Stop using my own tactics against me! I am not twelve!&#39; 

He huffed and puffed until his anger was spent, then he let himself go and rested his chin on Rider&#39;s...bosom. He narrowed his eyes as he did so, as if challenging Rider to tell him off again when she had just embarrassed herself by trying to do so, and failing.

&#39;I don&#39;t need promises. I just want you to be happy. Happy that you got contracted with someone like me. Happy that you got to experience things you&#39;ve never been able to before. I did not ask to bond because you&#39;re weak. I wanted to do it because you don&#39;t have to bear this burden alone.&#39;

He moved his cupped hands to Rider&#39;s face. Staring into her eyes, searching for the truth.

&#39;It&#39;s not your job to sacrifice yourself for me. No matter what it is that you wish to do, I want you to be able to do it while knowing that I would always have your back.&#39;

&#39;Even if it means throwing a fight.&#39;

He rose up on his tiptoes, and pressed his lips to hers.

...

&#39;Though if you <em>could</em> win, then I will gladly take it. After all, I still have a name to uphold!&#39; He broke away and added hastily, face flushed as he realized what he had just done. &#39;I did say that I&#39;d win the City Grail War on my channel, so I would appreciate that you do not self-destruct. That&#39;s all there is to it!&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching was completely taken aback by Kun Wu&#39;s fake gloating. She had grown so accustomed to gnawing at the boy&#39;s defenses through praises that she hadn&#39;t predicted for a moment that he would grow resistant to them. She paid the price as the boy started shaking her like a ragdoll, which made her lies sound even more unconvincing.

She opened her mouth, as if trying to speak again, before Kun Wu unceremoniously rested on the only soft surface around him. She blushed as she looked at him, resting on her breasts while he glared at her gaze with unparalleled sharpness. The pirate was now even further cornered.

He got closer. And closer. And <em>closer.</em> All while whispering passionate truths, letting out all of his steam and disappointment, but also admiration. Eventually, he went even further, and touched his goddess of victory in a place most taboo.

She was utterly shocked.

&quot;...&quot; Ching remained silent for a few seconds, processing what had just happened as Kun Wu retreated as well, as if somewhat ashamed of the bold deed he had committed. He immediately adopted her same tactic, talking about unrelated matters to stray away from the main topic of the conversation. No, this wasn&#39;t about the City Grail War, nor was it about Guan Yu. It was about <em>them.</em> Their existence as Master and Servant.

Were they ready for the next step? Was Ching willing to admit that?

She couldn&#39;t think straight. All she could do was cover her lips and blush intensely, both shocked and mesmerized by the moment that had occurred.

&quot;I told you, milord. Not in public...&quot; She immediately chided him, pulling him by the ear as she wrapped her arm around his throat. This would normally feel like a threat to him, as he remembered the early days where she would pluck at his eyes like a vulture. This time around, it felt like an embrace.</span>

&quot;<strong>I truly do respect you, Kun Wu.</strong> But there&#39;s such a thing as aiming too far ahead. We shall continue this topic another time. For now, let us strategize about Lancer in a more, ahem, private location.&quot; She tried her best to sound dignified, but the embarrassment in her voice was palpable. For once, Kun Wu had utterly humiliated her. Not with lies or deceit, but with love.

She would make him pay in full with the way she knew best: Domestic abuse. With her gorilla grip, she started dragging him back to the bathtub for another private conversation. The night was long, and they had much left to discuss... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
