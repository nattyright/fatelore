                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Delphi is a city of heights.&#39;

The first thing that would come to mind upon hearing this statement would be the numerous skyscrapers that were scattered across the city, standing valiantly at every street and almost pushing the skies away from the land. 

What it truly meant was that Delphi, at its core, was a literal city of heights. Standing a whopping fifteen meters above sea level, it came with an extensive underground that housed deserted constructions, wreckage sites and all kinds of junk. It was commonly called <em>the Underbelly.</em>

The various Cynosura cities that the city had engulfed created quite a peculiar landscape. It was a patchwork of different architectures and soils, haphazardly held together to form a heterogeneous environment where things hardly fit together. One could eve see where one city ended and the next began, the scars of an incomplete work showing through the various gaps that marked the ground.

But, as much as it was home to material waste, it also housed countless <em>human waste</em>. Hobos, ruffians, junkies—anyone that was too dirty for surface-ground Delphi found home in the Underbelly. The abandoned buildings and wrecked houses made for makeshift homes, the constantly-piling detritus served to quench their need for supply. 

Fortunately, Laura and Guan Yu didn&#39;t have to worry about them, having chosen the most deserted place they could come across—a rectangular platform of dirt, no doubt the vestiges of an abandoned construction project, surrounded by a number of wrecked buildings and piles of detritus.

The long-bearded warrior stood at the center of the deserted field, surrounded by numerous people dressed in black... no, they weren&#39;t people. They were <em>insects</em>. Swarm clones, thousands upon thousands of tiny bodies compressed into humanoid figures. They all took combative stances as they carefully approached the warrior, ready to pounce on him at the slightest opening.

Taking a closer look upon the Servant, his eyes seemed to be blindfolded. He stood motionless at the center of the field, so still that you could mistake him for a statue.

<em>&quot;There are two to your left,&quot; The words rang in his head, coming across directly through his link with the young Master. &quot;approximately fourteen meters away. Three at five o&#39;clock, a couple dozen meters away, an—&quot;</em>

Laura&#39;s bugs would be able to detect if a hostile servant was approaching well before they noticed where they were. This made for ideal training sessions once both of them were healed up properly. One of which is in its last stages currently...

While Guan Yu&#39;s wounds were healed, his arm still bore the marks of his previous encounter. Light scars ran down his arm where it was tore asunder. Even the sleeve on his robes was tore to brandish them as if they were some sort of trophy for all to see. Perhaps it was a challenge towards others to do better than what Archer did? Who knows. It sure evaded Laura&#39;s mind despite her attempts.

<em>&quot;If you think I would crumble before something like this, you should hear the roars of battle! Now that would give you plenty to attempt to focus on!&quot;</em> He communicated with her through their new telepathy link they shared. A smirk was shown on his face as he remained still.

His eyes were closed. He relied solely on her instructions. They were doing this for awhile now. It was a way to train their coordination and teamwork together. The more accurate they got, the closer they were to achieving the goals they have set for each other.

<em><strong>&quot;You forgot who I am, Miss Hess!&quot;</strong></em>

The command was issued and so the Chinese God of War sprung into action! A quick flip to the right was made so he could send a swing downwards towards the would-be assaulter. The act took out one of the clones as they attempted to strike at his flank. 

The mastery with his weapon allowed him to effortlessly maintain the offensive. The length of the blade, on the other hand, gave him the reach to strike at his opponents without allowing himself to enter within their reach. 

This continued for each of the other commands to follow that Laura threw at him. Her intel combined with his martial prowess soon allowed them to prevail against these insect clones!

He approached her so he could give her a pat on the shoulder. One a bit too hard it felt like! <em>&quot;I must say, I am proud of the amount of progress you have been making so far.&quot;</em> He kept switching how he spoke to her to get used to the link they now shared. He just has to hope that he doesn&#39;t actually speak when he meant to say it in her mind instead! 

<em>&quot;How do you feel about going for a stroll? I say we trained enough for one day.&quot;</em> He gave her another pat on the shoulder before he headed out into the underbelly of Delphi. He kept his hands full by using his weapon as a walking stick and his other hand to stroke his beard. He would normally prefer strolling through a peaceful garden, but this provided a unique experience! It isn&#39;t everyday that one wanders underneath an entire city like this after all!</span>

Laura recoiled, her body stiffened from the brunt of the hit. Yup, his pats were definitely on the stronger side. Couldn&#39;t he deliver his affection a bit more delicately, similar to <em>that time?</em>

&quot;Sure... right behind you.&quot; Sighed the young girl, brandishing her backpack on her shoulders while striding towards the bearded Servant.

As expected, the big man showed great fighting prowess even without his eyesight, effortlessly destroying her swarm clones as if they were nothing more than air. It was comforting, almost flattering to think that her instructions is what allowed for such a spectacle, but she suspected that his sharply honed instincts had played a bigger part. Such incredible fighting sense could only be born from the Three Kingdoms period, where the smell of war and blood was omnipresent.

Nonetheless, she was making some progress. This new... telepathic dialogue was faster than simple words. It was almost as if they weren&#39;t words that travelled, but rather concepts and ideas that only <em>felt</em> like speech. It seemed like even <em>images</em> could be communicated, although not as reliably as words. Truth be told, her control over this new way of communication was shaky at best. First, there was no feedback when she sent her thoughts, making her constantly doubt if her messages came across to the protector. Second, the line between personal thought and intentional communication was ambiguous, making the process of thinking itself a bit awkward. She wasn&#39;t one to be riddled with inappropriate thoughts, but still...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">All things considered, she was still surprised by the sudden bonding that occurred between the two of them. The manual that came with his S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame had briefly mentioned it, but had stayed vague on purpose. It seemed like the specifics were different for each Heroic Spirit, making the act of bonding a surprise occurrence more than an intentional action. It wasn&#39;t uncommon for some Masters eager to increase their power and control to try and force a bonding process with their Servants, but these things could never stem from a desire for strength alone. 

...Thinking back to the talk that lead to it, she couldn&#39;t help but flinch. Although necessary, that whole ordeal left quite the bitter taste in her mouth. For a person such as her that had tried hard to be stoic to suddenly let her feelings escape. She looked so vulnerable, so close to breaking down, almost bursting into tears at one point. 

Feeling a red tint wash over her face, she couldn&#39;t help but crease her eyebrows in embarrassment as her gaze trailed to the back of the man responsible for that outburst.

<em>&quot;...You big oaf, shamelessly making a girl cry...&quot;</em> A telepathic roar, unintentionally slipping out for the warrior to hear...</span>

The dusty yet surprisingly pure air that smelled of grass and wet concrete. Dim lights that came from the surface, combining with the few working lampposts, preventing the place from falling into utter darkness—all those elements came together to create a unique, weirdly comforting mood.

Still, the presence of a few eyes prying on the pair as they walked the desolate streets didn&#39;t escape her vision. Hidden between the collapsed buildings, hiding through the cracks of the ruined machinery, watching from a safe distance—There were undoubtedly denizens of the Underbelly, curiously eyeing as the two foreigners strolled deeper into their homeland. More than a few of those eyes were resentful, frustrated that their homes were being used as battlegrounds.

...Better not worry too much about them. They&#39;ll go away on their own. Eventually. Hopefully.</span>

As they walked alongside each other, he figured now would be a good time to have a serious discussion!

&quot;What would you like to have tonight, Miss Hess? I know we partook in plenty of meals during our banquet, but we still must plan ahead of time! The less time we spend deciding means the more time we have to enjoy ourselves after all!&quot;

That was his serious conversation he wanted to have with her? It may seem like that was the case, but the real conversation was happening elsewhere. Far away from potential eavesdroppers...

<em>&quot;Miss Hess. I would like to discuss with you regarding Saber and their Master. Their territory has been expanding much faster and further than I previously thought it would. If we allow this to continue then all of Olympia might fall under Saber&#39;s influence.&quot;</em>

It was difficult to concentrate on two different topics at once. What made it even more difficult was the fact that he was using two completely different means of communication with her. He started to understand the amount of mental gymnastics his Master must be jumping through with her Magecraft. He would much prefer just fighting...

<em>&quot;Seeing that Delphi is also connected to Olympia for the time being, it wouldn&#39;t be too outlandish to imagine that even Delphi would be enveloped in time as well. If we don&#39;t deal with it now, then I&#39;m afraid that we won&#39;t be able to deal with them should we be the last two standing as planned with our agreement with them.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;It&#39;s too soon to make those assumptions, I&#39;m sure that the <strong>Church</strong> will step in to salvage the situation if things go too far. The Buddhist temple is in <strong>their turf</strong>, after all. And even if they don&#39;t act, there are plenty of competitors ready to strike at the slightest opportunity.&quot;</em>

A subtle glance towards the warrior, complementing her words with a pinch of gravity.

<em>&quot;My guess is that different Masters are going to rally in an effort to take them down. Servants that work around Territory Creation skills tend to stick out like sore thumbs, and something as big as Dolorous Gard is bound to paint a huge target on their back.&quot;</em>

&quot;—but if I&#39;m eating anything, I guess I&#39;ll go with something light and easy to digest. Maybe a salad?&quot;

<em>&quot;But even then, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll go down this easily. Even if a couple Masters worked together to bring them down, I&#39;m sure that they have more than enough leeway to fight back. As of right now, we&#39;re the only ones that know the true extent of their strength. We know how <strong>scary</strong> these two motherfuckers can be. Others don&#39;t.&quot;</em>

True enough, her arms hadn&#39;t truly come to recover fully from their encounter with Saber. The few occasional twitches that lingered <em>weeks after the fact</em> helped to remind her of the price she had to pay on that day.

<em>&quot;Our opportunity to strike will come in due time. I&#39;m still keeping an eye on them through my bugs, and that is an advantage that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.&quot;</em></span>

There was this one meal I wished I found out about before we had our banquet. It was called a p-iz-za! Apparently, you&#39;re able to make your own by choosing a combination of toppings to go with it! Imagine that, Miss Hess, a meal specifically catered to us! This world is truly amazing.&quot;

Even with the knowledge given to him from the summoning, it sadly didn&#39;t include how to pronounce the new words he encountered daily. It helped to create this feel-good aura around them despite the more serious conversation going on in their minds.

<em>&quot;Intel can only go so far, Miss Hess. I am no Assassin. I won&#39;t be able to pierce the enemy&#39;s defences stealthily. They will know we&#39;re coming and should their power be greater than before, <strong>we won&#39;t win.</strong>&quot;</em>

He hoped that his words would reach her. As a tactician, he knew a hopeless engagement when I saw one. They needed more firepower than what they are currently in possession of if they are to take down Saber for good. Perhaps the weapon could aid in that....

No. They didn&#39;t know what was even contained within it. They shouldn&#39;t bank on something they had no idea what it actually did. That would be foolish.

<em>&quot;We don&#39;t have an army backing us up therefore we should seek aid. The longer we wait, the more will fall to Saber, leaving us with fewer options. And who&#39;s to say that the options left would even want to team up? Our future is grim if we simply rely on intel alone to be our saving grace against Saber.&quot;</em>

Their little stroll through the underbelly led them down a wide street. It had enough room to span four lanes of traffic with crumbling multi-storied buildings on either side. It appeared to be one of Lower Delphi&#39;s main streets. One could see through the decay and ruination that occurred to notice that it was indeed a busy street. It even had a large overpass going straight down the middle of the street.

A fact that she was made painfully aware of with each encounter they went through. Everything the bearded Servant said was true. Truth be told, she wasn&#39;t fit for combat. Not to say that she wasn&#39;t powerful in her own right, but the idea of inflicting pain on others didn&#39;t fit right with her. Masters could, would provide physical support to help their Servant in battle. She couldn&#39;t.

...Well, this might&#39;ve been true a few days ago, before going against Alexander Kingsmade and his Archer. Ever since the image of a bruised Guan Yu missing one of his arms was etched into her memory, she began to change bit by bit. So subtly that even she didn&#39;t realise it yet. An unconscious vow to never let something like that happen again, to be by his side when things would get heated.

&quot;I know,&quot; Laura blurted, a pained expression on her face. Did she not like &#39;Puh Idzaza&#39;?

<em>&quot;I know we can&#39;t go on intel alone...&quot;</em> She clarified, this time in thought-speak.

<em>&quot;But we can still choose our battles. Waiting for too long before plucking them out is a bad idea, but so is fighting them while they&#39;re in tiptop shape.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;I agree on that last part, that we should find someone who&#39;s willing to team-up—but it doesn&#39;t end here. If we want a realistic chance of winning, conserving our force while waiting for Jampo and Brandin to go through a few encounters of their own, striking at the moment where they&#39;re most vulnerable would be best.&quot;</em></span>

What are the odds of them encountering another pair down here anyways? Sure they stood out like a sore thumb with the surrounding environment but to think another pair would spend their time in such a place as well! Surely the odds was in their favour. Right?

 The words that came from Laura from within were &#39;said&#39; with such weight to them. She was fully aware of the issue at all. This was good. 

<em>&quot;And what if they never get to that vulnerable state? What if they continue to expand outwards despite the attacks against them?&quot;</em> 

Guan Yu wanted to test his Master. She wasn&#39;t a true tactician since she wasn&#39;t experienced with war itself, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t at least pass on his knowledge in some shape or form. One cannot assume the enemy would simply stay idle even when they appear to be after all. 

<em>&quot;I understand that you are searching for a situation that best suits us, but rarely does one get that opportunity. More often than not, Miss Hess, one has to adapt to the hand they are dealt and make the most of it rather than hoping for an ideal position to manifest itself.&quot;</em>

An hour had passed since the events at Kun Wu&#39;s apartment. A plan of attack had been formed and Team Rider was currently investigating Delphi&#39;s intestines. A crude way of saying that they were examining wreckage.

Both Ching and her Master were no strangers to exploring Delphi&#39;s uglier aspects, since they hoarded quite the amount of wealth in places that nobody would look at. Of course, due to the madame&#39;s current getup, they could not help but attract unwanted attention, even among the scum of society.

Kun Wu heard several catcalls and whistles, all of them most likely directed towards his Servant by nameless thugs, delinquents and former businessmen and traders who had fallen to depravity.

<em>&quot;Hey there, missy? Why not have some fun with someone a bit more mature than the little twerp over th-

&quot;ARRRRGH!&quot;</em>

Thankfully, Rider was quite competent at defending herself, to the point Kun Wu had to avert his eyes and pray for the safety of his would-be assailants. God, he didn&#39;t even know limbs could bend that way...

&quot;Milord, I&#39;m done. I think we should be near cache 13 by now.&quot; Ching Shih muttered, a smile on her face as she casually wiped away blood from her fingertips. &quot;Any signs of Lancer yet? Here&#39;s hoping that they haven&#39;t stumbled across any of our bounties.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu was no stranger to Rider&#39;s brute strength, having both witnessed it and experienced it for himself on several occasions. But those moments had been short and fleeting, for Rider wasn&#39;t someone who relished her more violent side. Besides, Delphi had always been a safe city. Who was Rider going to beat up aside from the occasional CGW Master and Servant that happened to cross their paths?

Well, that impression of his was about to change. 

Since he had been strapped to his desk for the majority of his free time, today would mark the first day that Kun Wu and Ching Shih had taken a stroll together in the Underbelly. And what a stroll it was. The sound of bones snapping and flesh squelching had accompanied them every step of the way; Rider led the party with her bare fists, tearing a bloody trail in her wake as she pummeled hooligans and businessmen alike who dared look at her funny.

Kun Wu followed her footsteps, arms folded in front of his chest and a peaceful expression on his face, as if he had been engaging in an enlightening conversation with the buddha. In reality, he was both inspired and perturbed by how readily Rider flung those thugs away while looking as graceful as a swan.

He pulled his iron fan out and swatted away a bloody tooth that came flying out of nowhere. <em>Man, she looks extra fierce in her new outfit...</em>

&#39;Hmm? This is the 13th one already? That was fast.&#39; He thoroughly wiped his fan on the back of an unconscious hooligan, still wearing that peaceful expression on his face as if saying that he had achieved his inner zen. &#39;We&#39;ve already checked our biggest vaults. If Lancer wanted to raid us, then we would&#39;ve seen them a long time ago. It&#39;s not that easy to hide someone of his size.&#39;

What are they thinking, am I right?&#39; He casually slapped Rider&#39;s back with his fan and laughed dryly. &#39;I <em>could</em> give them a signal if you want though, if they ever happened to be stalking us nearby...&#39;

A small fire ignited over his palm. Kun Wu looked around and spotted a few thugs who weren&#39;t totally out of it. He started channeling more mana in his flame, all the while fanning it and reshaping it into...

A tiny rabbit.

Or, to be more precise, a tiny fiery rabbit <em>split off</em> from the flame and started hopping towards the disoriented thugs. A second one soon followed, then a third, and soon, the streets were full of tiny rabbits hopping around and attaching themselves to the thugs who had yet to get away. 

Kun Wu snapped his fingers, and the rabbits burst back into actual flames. They started &#39;consuming&#39; their clothes, eliciting panicked screams as the ne&#39;er-do&#39;wells thought they were being immolated. They started running like headless chickens to god knows where, probably to find a source of water so they could douse the fire.

Well. They could try, at the very least. But so long as they hadn&#39;t made it <em>too</em> far out, Kun Wu would simply feed the flames by injecting them with more mana. Though the flames didn&#39;t actually burn, they still looked convincing enough to fool the average crowd. If a few dozen &#39;burning&#39; people couldn&#39;t catch Lancer&#39;s attention, then he didn&#39;t know what will!

Kun Wu turned to Rider and made a victory sign with his hand.

&#39;I call this &quot;The Dragon and the Pearl&quot;. There&#39;s no dragon yet, but there&#39;s plenty of pearls to lure it out.&#39; He looked at Rider expectantly, as if waiting for her to judge his newest set piece.</span>

If there was plans to be made or arrangements to be had, she <em>would</em> talk and talk until her opinion was heeded and taken into consideration. Not out of ego, nor out of superiority—It just felt like the <em>right thing to do</em>, for her.

Yet now, she stayed silent. 

<em>&quot;...Alright.&quot;</em> She finally managed to conjure, sighing audibly as she lagged behind him. 

Faced with a warrior&#39;s experience—a <em>tactician&#39;s</em> mind, she had no choice but to yield. Not to say that she didn&#39;t want to contribute on the matter, but it was rather a matter of <em>trust</em>. Now more than ever, what she needed was a person she could rely on—a <em>pillar</em>, and butting heads with said pillar was the epitome of idiocy. Through their very special relationship, the control-freak that was Laura was finally getting her head around the concept of <em>letting other people take care of things.</em> It was still a green and unnatural idea in her mind, but still. She was getting there.
 
<em>&quot;I guess we should start looking for a few guys to team-up with, then. I&#39;ve got a few contacts that could help us out, but—&quot;</em>

Laura suddenly stopped walking, gripping the warrior&#39;s sleeve to hold him back.

<em><strong>Put it out!! Put it ooouuuut!!</strong></em>

More than a dozen people were frantically fleeing as roaring flames fed on their bodies, crying for their hidden companions to put the fire away before it fed on their flesh. 

Flaming bunnies happily hopped across the streets that they were running away from, latching on any prey they could get theirs paws on with astounding agility. Not only that, but a few corpses were scattered across the street—No, not corpses. Badly beaten-up thugs, <em>nearly corpses</em>. The damage and positions they were left in—it reminded her of a <em>certain Servant</em> that had done a similar thing to her body-guards a few weeks back.

Truly, there was no need to check if her suspicions were true, but nonetheless—the insects locked their eyes upon the pair that stood at the starting point of this mayhem.

<em>&quot;Eleven o&#39;clock, half a kilometre away from us—Kun Wu, along with his Rider, walking towards our general direction.&quot;</em> The blonde girl spoke in his mind. <em>&quot;They&#39;re beating up and putting on fire a buncha&#39; people, and they&#39;re having a jolly ol&#39; time doing it.&quot;</em>

The expression on her face was enough to tell what she was thinking.

Each and every single one of them ended the same way though. It ended with them just short of a victory by a few moves. No matter how he imagined the battle to go, he currently sees no way they could win as they are right now. 

As exciting as the idea of such a battle be may, he wouldn&#39;t be doing good on his promise if he simply rode in like last time. The shining glimpse of victory must be seen in their plan against Saber before they act. Oh, how he longed for the council of his brothers in these moments. 

He halted the moment he heard his Master&#39;s voice cut off inside of his head. Something wasn&#39;t right. She noticed something.

This also allowed him to notice her grip on his sleeve. With how engrossed he was listening to her while he planned out their next move, he was sure that he wouldn&#39;t have noticed until she said something about it. Just how far would he have dragged her without knowing? He shook the thought out of his head and instead focused on the current matter at hand.

The look on her face only made it that much more difficult to understand whether or not it was the truth. Surely it can&#39;t be.

&quot;If that&#39;s the case, Miss Hess, then a talk with them is in order. Surely there must be a reasoning behind this.&quot; This time, Guan Yu spoke directly at her instead of through their new link. The expression on his face was similar to that a father&#39;s who was about to give someone a stern speaking to.

It didn&#39;t take long for him to march towards their direction despite his Master&#39;s protests. It seemed that Guan Yu&#39;s Just heart could not simply let something like this slip idly by.

It only took a short while for Kun Wu&#39;s plan to work because soon the tall green figure came into view in the distance. His seemingly foolish plan actually worked! The &#39;Dragon&#39; was brought to them by the allure of the &#39;pearls&#39; he has set out. Such unrivaled genius from this man!

She would have enjoyed their suffering a bit longer, had Kun Wu not slapped some sense into her with his fan.

&quot;Right. I almost forgot we had a Lancer to hunt.&quot; Rider replied, Kun Wu unable to tell whether she was serious or jesting. 

&quot;I suppose it does make sense for Guan Yu to be unaware of our cache locations. Has he truly come to these slums for sightseeing?&quot; She shuddered in disgust at the thought, wondering why someone would ever visit these wretched depths. &quot;But yes, go ahead and find him, milord.&quot;

Kun Wu happily obliged, singing the thugs&#39; clothes with his fake flames as their assailants spread like literal wildfire. This was sure to catch Lancer&#39;s attention, along with literally anyone else at the Delphi depths who was brave or foolish enough to investigate the commotion.

&quot;...The dragon and the pearl?&quot; Ching Shih raised an eyebrow. &quot;Are you sure it isn&#39;t pearls before swine? I would hardly find myself pressed to call these sorry excuses for men &#39;pearls&#39;, milord.&quot; She stared at the burning thugs in disdain, while simultaneously readying herself for the appearance of their opponent. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

Despite her numerous protests, both with her voice and through their link, Guan Yu ended up dragging the young girl across the whole distance right until they appeared before them.

His expression, perhaps for the first time since she had summoned him, was tainted with irritation. Perhaps even anger? his was a bit hard to read, namely because it deviated so much from his usual behaviour, but it was clear as day that he was <em>very displeased</em>.

Truth be told, she was irritated too. What were those two doing here? What was the reason behind their peculiar actions? Why was Rider dressed so sharply for the occasion? Lots of unanswered questions popped into her mind, butting heads with each other as she tried fitting plausible answers into them. 

The first answer that came to mind for their motives was that they were looking to butt heads with the <em>Holy Church</em>. Beating and putting civilians on fire surely went against their rules, even more if it was happening outside the designated battlegrounds. Such reckless actions were bound to get their attention.

But if that was truly their motive, why not go directly to their office in Olympia? Or was their goal to <em>specifically</em> attract them in Delphi?

But then again, crossing paths with an enemy Master and his Servant was an incredibly rare occurrence. This encounter marked the first time it ever happened to them, perhaps <em>ever</em>. Masters generally liked to keep to themselves, avoiding to attract unwanted attention whenever they could. This generally meant that chance encounters were kept to a minimum, which played well into the &#39;rules&#39; of the CGW that prohibited fights in populated areas.

Was that truly coincidental?

<em>&quot;Hey,&quot;</em> She grabbed his attention through their link, her eyes locked on the distant figures of Kun Wu and Ching Shih. <em>&quot;I can only see two reasons as to why they&#39;re doing this.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Either they&#39;re looking to start shit with the Holy Church, or they&#39;re looking to start shit with <strong>us</strong>.&quot;</em>A round-about way of telling him to be mindful and not let his emotions take control.

One way or the another, this encounter smelled like trouble. Too many inconsistencies, unknowns and chance happenings for her mind to be at ease.

Better safe than sorry, she diluted her Magical energy and started gathering bugs, putting them on stand-by a few locations away. 

If they were truly looking for a <em>fight</em>, then a fight they would get.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Aww come on, it&#39;s just a metaphor!&#39; Kun Wu fiercely defended his intellectual property. &#39;What&#39;s important isn&#39;t how <em>you</em> see them, it&#39;s what you want the audience to see. Besides,&#39; he snapped his fan closed, then pointed it towards a hulking shadow in the distance. &#39;I think these &quot;pearls&quot; have done a fantastic job so far, won&#39;t you agree?&#39;

Just like how little Rider fit in with the thugs, the sudden splash of green in this drab landscape was impossible for anyone to miss. Lancer parted the sea of civilians and rabbits as he made his presence known with little effort. Meanwhile, his tiny Master stalked next to him, looking grumpy enough for the both of them. Clearly, one of them did not enjoy the welcome party so much.

Not that Kun Wu minded, though!

&#39;I had an inkling you&#39;d be here, so I decided to bring the show to you.&#39; he greeted the Master and Servant with a deep bow. &#39;It&#39;s been a while, Ms. Informant who charges way too much for lip service. How goes the CGW side of things?&#39;

His looked at Guan Yu as he said so, studying his frame - more specifically, the scar-covered arm on full display underneath a torn sleeve. Guan Yu wore his scars like badges of honor, and Kun Wu couldn&#39;t help but think that he was playing it up for the theatrics. It wasn&#39;t all that dissimilar to how he styled some of his outfits for his performances, though unlike his outfits, those scars looked to be the real deal.

 Eyebrows raised, his eyes flitted to Laura, then back to her Servant. 

&#39;Did I find you at an inopportune time?&#39; He asked.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching sighed. Kun Wu might act cute, but she felt her nerves act up whenever he tried to make up excuses for his rather obtuse stories.

&quot;....You did a good job.&quot; She admitted, much to the boy&#39;s surprise.

<em>&quot;But that doesn&#39;t change what I said.&quot;</em> She groaned, causing Kun Wu much pain as he felt his heart sink into despair. No matter how much he tried to sweet talk his Servant, she simply wouldn&#39;t budge on her opinion of his tales...

Much like her Master, however, Ching Shih was rather analytical. Both Guan Yu and Laura felt like they were under constant scrutiny, as the shape of their bodies was analyzed from every possible viewpoint by the lady&#39;s bird-like eyes.

Rider started playing &#39;spot the difference&#39; with the image of Guan Yu from now versus the image of him from their first encounter. She no longer felt that sense of looming superiority or his imposing strength. She couldn&#39;t guess why. Did Kun Wu pump her up that much?

No. It was because his mortality had been confirmed. She stared at his battle scars in awe.

&quot;To think that there is someone capable of harming even you, oh great Guan Yu.&quot; Ching spat out, staring at the man&#39;s face and observing his reaction. &quot;Slipped on a flight of stairs? Horse bit your arm? Somehow managed to find one of your old friends from the three kingdoms, perhaps?&quot; She callously asked. It was akin to flirting with death itself, especially since Lancer could most likely beat both her and Kun Wu with one arm tied behind his back.

Despite that, Rider&#39;s morale was at an all time high: If Guan Yu could be hurt, then he could be beaten.

&quot;Hey, little miss?&quot; Rider lowered herself, kneeling a bit as she tilted her head and stared at Laura. &quot;Any particular reason you are walking around with an injured Servant in here of all places? If you hadn&#39;t met us, <strong>I can assure you that you would have been devoured by someone else.&quot;</strong> She gave a light chuckle.</span>

<em>&quot;I understand, Miss Hess. Our location seem to have been leaked. It will be best to find another place to train if that&#39;s the case. For now, we have other concerns to focus on.&quot;</em>

The end of his march was marked by a tap from his weapon onto the ground. The metallic ringing caused from it served as a wordless warning for those nearby to vacate the area before something happened. Whether they heeded the warning or not, he did not check. His gaze was firmly planted upon the Rider and their Master. 

&quot;If you knew we were here, Master of Rider, then I can assume that you have something to ask of us. After all, you could have contacted my Master if you wanted some information. So allow me to ask the first question. What is your business with us?&quot; The Protector stood vigilantly as he spoke his words. Should they make a move, he would be ready. 

Rider&#39;s new outfit caught his attention when he saw it. It was a beautiful outfit that enhanced most of her good features quite nicely. It made her appear less threatening actually. Though, Guan Yu knew of her strength from the few showings he saw. A blazing fury was lying in wait behind those eyes of hers. Like a stalking predator waiting for her next prey.

It wasn&#39;t long until his scarred arm was brought into question by Rider. He chose to wear it proudly for all to see after all. The scars themselves showed the amount of damage that was dealt to him clearly. The other wounds were much more hidden thankfully.

They defended their castle well and I commend them for their excellent defense. If it wasn&#39;t for Red Hare, I wouldn&#39;t be standing here before you now.&quot; There was only one servant making the news between both cities that currently had a Castle of sorts. 

&quot;The servant who nearly claimed my arm was an Archer. Though, they fitted the appearance and strength of a Berserker rather than an Archer if I&#39;m being honest. Their endurance was something else.&quot; Guan Yu lightly tapped the position where his blade struck Archer and embedded itself during their fight. &quot;I landed a direct blow and embedded my blade deep into their skull early on into the fight. The rest of fight had me trying to pull free my weapon while enduring their furry of blows.&quot;

As he recalled the previous fight, a wide grin formed on his face, completely replacing the irritated expression he had when he arrived. The rush of battle was still fresh in his memories! Oh, how he wishes for a second round against them! Unfortunately though, he doubts that his Master would agree with him, or even allow a second round to occur.

He cleared his throat to regain his composure shortly after. &quot;I hope you had your own fair share of good battles so far, Madame Ching. A Rider as notorious as yourself must be sweeping the opposition!&quot; With that, he let out a hearty laugh that mixed with the tension in the air between them. 

The moment Rider kneeled slightly made Guan Yu tilt his blade to place it in between the two of them, but not enough to prevent them from staring at each other. &quot;I assure you that she&#39;s as tough as they come. Looks tend to deceive after all.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It seemed like the battle had already started. A few verbal jabs had been launched by the opposing pair, clearly aiming to irritate them more than they already were. Ching Shih was the first to belittle her, and unsurprisingly so. The figure of a girl clad in loose clothes, with soft features and stick-like limbs surely portrayed an image of weakness. 

She paid no mind, relaxing her shoulders as she saw the might warrior&#39;s blade stand in front of her.

<em>&quot;...Thanks.&quot;</em> The words rang in his head, so quiet that he might mistake them for the whistling of the wind.

Unlike last time they spoke, the young girl looked calm and very much unphased by her surroundings. No smirks, no shaky arms, no glaring eyes. Not an ounce of her usual cockiness was left. Was she even the <em>same girl</em>?

&quot;First off all, you <em>did</em> find us at an inopportune time,&quot; She admitted, her eyes trailing towards the Feng-Shui master. &quot;We kind of had a <em>thing</em> going, but you ruined it with your... whatever <em>this is</em>.&quot;

She pointed at one of the thugs in flames, rolling on the ground in an attempt to suffocate the fire that engulfed his clothes.

&quot;Second, <em>we</em> should be the ones asking about your run in the CGW so far.&quot;

The young girl closed her eyes, taking in a nice breath of air before continuing. &quot;Despite the nice dress and the pretty shoes, you can&#39;t divert my attention from those countless little scars and scratches that have yet to heal, Rider. You got hit by an <em>explosion</em> or something?&quot;

The girl sighed, theatrically shrugging her shoulders. Would the she-pirate understand the <em>peculiar meaning</em> behind her words?
    
&quot;Same thing goes for you and your <em>bullet wounds</em>, Kun Wu,&quot; She opened her eyes, looking at the fiery boy with a casual expression. &quot;Seems like that last fight fucked you up pretty badly, aye?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Flies were quietly gathering around the four, almost invisible in the Underbelly&#39;s dimly lit atmosphere. They circled them with intent, their eyes locked onto the figures of the she-pirate and her Master, taking in as many details as they could from their numerous windows. Every square inch of skin, every odd wrinkle in their clothes, even the peculiar way they stood on their two legs and how their arms dangled. Much like the opposing two had analysed her and Guan Yu from their curious eyes, it seemed like she was doing the exact same, albeit with a little more <em>intensity</em>. 

&quot;As for your out-of-place comments, <em>whore queen of the sea</em>,&quot; The blonde girl sighed, her expression far too neutral in contrast to her rather harsh choice of words. &quot;You can talk as much shit as you want about me, but you&#39;d better not belittle <em>him</em>. All it took was a couple scars, and you start getting all cocky and assertive.&quot;

She sighed once again, a faint smile finding its way to her lips.

&quot;Honestly, I liked you better when you crapped your pants a couple of weeks ago. You were a <em>lot</em> more humble back then.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;One tough customer, that you are.&#39; Kun Wu heaved a dramatic sigh after listening to Laura&#39;s nitpicks. &#39;Whatever thing you two had going on, surely it couldn&#39;t have been <em>that</em> important if you dropped it for our &quot;show&quot;! It pays to be a little more forthcoming, ya know. A little praise goes a long way.&#39; 

Of course, it just wasn&#39;t in Laura&#39;s nature to do something like that, especially for someone who was barely an acquaintance. She immediately started taking measured jabs at Rider and Kun Wu&#39;s numerous scars, describing them in painstaking detail, almost as if she had witnessed the fight herself...

Kun Wu shrugged off Laura&#39;s remarks with a bright smile, as if she hadn&#39;t just tried to get under his skin.

&#39;Pretty cool, don&#39;t you think? Whoever crafted those bullets must&#39;ve had an eye for beauty. I don&#39;t know how they did it, but I&#39;d love to recruit them for a collab sometimes.&#39; He rolled up his sleeves to brandish the fading, floral-patterned scars running along his arms. &#39;I even tailored a sleeveless stage outfit to showcase them before they completely faded. Think the audience will bite?&#39;

It took a special kind of mental fortitude to not only diffuse the hostile undertones in Laura&#39;s words, but genuinely praise his assailants as well while he was at it. Was putting a positive spin to things a natural habit of his, or was it more of an acquired skill? Rider may have a better idea now, but how deep did Laura&#39;s information network go? Perhaps, to cynics like her, everything Kun Wu did was simply an act to gain some clout.

As the girl&#39;s words grew more heated, Kun Wu strategically inserted himself in front of Rider, much like how Guan Yu guarded his Master with his Guandao. Unlike the cold blade of the Guandao, however, he had full access to some premium cushions thanks to Rider&#39;s lowered height. Rider would sooner have to deal with her Master&#39;s perverse intentions than Laura&#39;s scathing remarks....

If you, as a single customer, want a performance tailored to your exact tastes,&#39; he rubbed a thumb and forefinger together, &#39;You&#39;ll have to pay an appropriate commission fee! Not so different from how you run your business, is it?&#39;

&#39;As it stands, a private commission with <em>my</em> whore queen of the sea&#39; —he snaked an arm around Rider&#39;s waist, laying claim to her aggressively— &#39;is crazy expensive. It&#39;s so expensive that it might just bankrupt you! Buuuut-&#39;

He let the word drag longer than it should have and let the suspense hang just long enough for Rider to peel him off of her.

&#39;-I do have an alternative payment plan.&#39; His smile lingered, but there was now a hungry look in his eyes. He was blatantly fishing for something. Not as subtle as Laura, but more than enough to get the point across. The youth looked at Guan Yu, and extended a hand to him, as if asking him to join in for a dance.

&#39;You know how the saying goes, &quot;No discord, no concord.&quot; If your Master wishes for Rider to pay you the proper respects, I think it&#39;s better than you prove it with your own skills. Humble me and my Servant in a brawl, and we will treat you like the esteemed guests you deserve to be.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Visible veins of protruding anger were appearing on Ching&#39;s forehead once Laura opened her potty mouth. While she made a mental note on Guan Yu&#39;s description of past events, the more Laura spoke, the more irritated she became. Mocking her battle scars, while exposing dirt on Ching and her Master made her feel positively furious. She wished to wipe that confidence immediately, tempted to flick the girl away. However, Kun Wu took preemptive action, blocking her path, no, shielding her. He then hugged her tight and dragged her towards him.

&quot;...!&quot; She didn&#39;t mutter a word, being caught off guard as her Master bailed her out of trouble. It was embarrassing, to see Kun Wu handle this type of situation better than her. Then again, this was why she knew she could trust him.

Albeit he needed a bit more guidance when it came to tact.

&quot;I agree.&quot; She replied back before abruptly shoving him off with an annoyed sigh. &quot;I, of course, respect Lord Guan Yu with the highest of praise. He is a childhood hero to us from the Eastern Seas, after all.&quot; She remarked, before glaring at Laura.

&quot;But that doesn&#39;t extend to you. It takes no courage to talk up a big game, nor does it take any form of skill or ability to put down others for their failures. I merely mentioned Guan Yu&#39;s injuries because he is a seasoned warrior: It is very uncommon to find someone capable of harming him. Had I seen a similar injury on you, why <strong>I&#39;m afraid I wouldn&#39;t have given a damn.</strong>&quot;

Rider smiled, glad that she had the opportunity to stab back at Lancer&#39;s Master.

&quot;But I agree with my Master: Having the opportunity to challenge a hero of youth would be an honor. Doubly so if it makes you learn your place, little girl.&quot; Ching replied. &quot;If you want to see the extent of my battle scars, then you have no reason to refuse.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

To think he would have the guts to step forward like that. It wasn&#39;t hard to notice the strong spirit this one possessed within him. Hell, he even brandished his scars like a warrior! This earned him a smile from the tall giant.

Then came the challenge. 

Master of Rider has requested a duel between them to take place. 

This brought his hand to his beard as he pondered on the request. It would be disrespectful of him to decline their request. To spit upon their bravery after such a declaration would be unbecoming of him. After all, not once did he refuse a duel in his lifetime. He did not plan to start now.

<em>&quot;Miss Hess. Please step back. If they wish for a duel then it is in my nature to accept. This is a perfect opportunity to see the fruits of our training after all, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot;</em>

It only took mere moments before the sounds of hooves striking the ground as they rode towards them were heard. The glorious sight of a beautiful horse made for war came riding into view behind Guan Yu. The red hairs gave the impression of flames as the armoured steed ran at full speed. This wasn&#39;t the sight of any normal steed. It was the sight of a Phantasm Beast with a legend worthy of its own spot upon the Throne of Heroes! 

<strong>Red Hare</strong>

Once they arrived, Guan Yu wasted no time claiming his spot as Red Hare&#39;s Rider. The mountain of a man was made even taller while he sat on top of a horse of equal size and physique. 

A single swing was made to brandish his Guandao off to his side as the blade rang through the air around them. His eyes blazed with the determination and intensity of a True God of War shared with his steed. 

&quot;Master of Rider. Madame Ching. I accept your challenge wholeheartedly!&quot; A loud shout came from the proud warrior before them. They have stroked the flames of passion within him! 

<strong>&quot;Rider! Grant me the honour of bearing witness one of China&#39;s venerable champions chosen by the Throne! Show me your might as a warrior!&quot;</strong>

The challenge was accepted.

A slash from his guandao, two gazing eyes that oozed an unrestricted lust for battle and a thundering war cry—a verbal consent for the challenge issued by the opposing pair.

Much like that time with Alexander Kingsmade&#39;s Archer, he was smirking in the face of adversity. Flaunting his weapon and his mount while preparing for a life threatening fight... no, not preparing. He <em>barely</em> managed to hold his thirst before the two challengers that stood in front of him. 

Once again, she found herself standing in the shadow of the towering Servant, his and the imposing frame of his horse completely hiding her tiny figure from the boy-Master and his Servant.

<em>Miss Hess, please step back.</em>

The words rang in her head, underlining her nature as a thing to be protected rather than a true companion in battle. She would once again stand far away from battle, acting as mere ops while he recklessly hurled his body into battle.

As she came to that conclusion, her blood boiled in <em>anger</em>. Fists clenched, fingernails digging deep into the flesh of her hands. Jaw clenched, so hard that her gums threatened to pop.

<em><strong>&quot;I&#39;M NOT STEPPING ASIDE!&quot;</strong></em> The words roared in Guan Yu&#39;s mind, louder than any of the ones he had received until now. <em>&quot;Not gonna let you fight your heart out while I watch from a safe distance. Not today, not <strong>ever</strong>!&quot;</em>

No longer would she be someone to protect, but someone <em>that would protect</em>.

Not staring at anyone in particular, but still managing to exude untamed ferocity and resolve—she stood at his side... no, closer to the enemy pair than he did. She might&#39;ve looked small and silly in comparison to his oversized frame if not for her next move.

Without so much as a warning, the insects and arachnids that had previously concealed themselves in the shadows <em>sprung</em> into action, massively gathering at a singular point on the battlefield—on Laura&#39;s body.

Black masses walked upon her, swarmed on every inch of her porcelain white skin. Weirdly enough, they only touched skin and avoided fabric, making her image resemble that of a slimy creature wearing human clothes rather than a monstrous mass of insects. The bugs crawling under her clothes were in constant movement, making her forms ambiguous and hard to tell. She&#39;d look dirty, <em>nauseating</em> if not for the oversized sweat-shirt and cargo pants that covered most of the pretties. They even crawled all throughout her face, in and out of her hair, blurring the line between the end of her forehead and the beginning of her hairline. They acted almost like a <em>mask</em>, not even leaving room for her eyes to see. It didn&#39;t matter, she didn&#39;t need those anyway. 

&quot;I don&#39;t like hurting others,&quot; A voice rang amidst the deafening buzzing and chirping of the bugs, not quite Laura&#39;s but not dissimilar either. &quot;But if you&#39;re so intent on forcing my hand, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to retaliate.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It seemed as if the combined efforts of Kun Wu&#39;s shrewdness and Ching Shih&#39;s savagery were enough to tickle Guan Yu&#39;s code of honor. A true warrior from ancient myth would never refuse a challenge, especially if said challenge provided room for him and his Master to grow. He summoned his horse, readying himself for battle before witnessing Laura take a step further beyond. She had grown, and was now ready to prove it to him.

But they weren&#39;t the only ones who had changed.

Ching Shih&#39;s survival instincts were kicking in. Her legs were paralyzed and her nerves were screaming at her to run away. This was not an opponent she could hope to beat. Not even with the amount of riches she had gathered thus far. All thanks to the weakness given by the Throne.

That did <em>not</em> equate to giving up.

She remained tall. Proud. Her stance left no room for self doubts as she clenched her fists and readied herself for battle. This could very much be her last fight if things went awry. However...

She was no longer alone.

While Kun Wu would be mesmerized at the red horse, while simultaneously disgusted at the mass of insects, he felt something warm touch his hand. Rider was grasping at one of his hands firmly, clenching it tight.

&quot;You&#39;re not going to back down after all that talk, are you?&quot; Ching Shih glanced at him, an inquisitive gaze in her eyes. This was her test. To see if Kun Wu was truly someone who wished to support her. Even after witnessing all aspects of herself, could he still bring himself to support such a person? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s heart skipped a beat when he saw Guan Yu&#39;s majestic stead gallop onto the stage, its mane as red and fiery as his very own flames. There was no mistake about it. What Guan Yu had just summoned was none other than the fabled horse that rivaled its rider in both name and myth.

&#39;<em>Red Hare.</em>&#39; Kun Wu whispered in awe. A tremendous and terrifying pressure exuded from both warrior and beast, tantamount to that of a towering mountain. He felt it, and so did Ching Shih. She squeezed his hands, and he returned the gesture in full, reminding each other that neither of them had to weather the pressure alone. 

&#39;If there is one thing I&#39;m bad at, it&#39;s saying no to beautiful women like you.&#39; He replied cheekily, despite the mad thrumming of his heart. 

Like most kids from home, Kun Wu grew up reading the tales of many heroes like Guan Yu. Seeing him in person was like watching an unatainable dream realized right in front of his eyes. In truth, it was impossible <em>not</em> to be intimidated in the combined presence of Guan Yu and Red Hare...

But was that necessarily a <em>bad</em> thing? After all, fear and excitement were just two sides of the same coin. As the green Lancer brandished his blade, so did Kun Wu feel tingles run down his spine. 

His fingers twitched in anticipation. It was one thing to be awestruck in front of his idol, but at the same time, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it woul feel like to best his idol in an honest-to-goodness fight.

Kun Wu relaxed his shoulders. He spread his feet shoulder-width apart and took a deep, calming breath. He twirled his fan deftly, demonstrating his expertise with it as if it were an extension of his arm. A simple choreograph to show off his nimble fingers and wow the audience before a show, but underneath the glamor underlay a rigid discipline, something that Guan Yu would no doubt recognize as a fellow martial art practitioner.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The iron fan technique. A small branch of martial arts that wasn&#39;t yet well-known in his time. The flamboyant dance routines Kun Wu had always incorporated into his shows, had he always meant to use them to hone his technique?

Kun Wu snapped his fan open. His circuits flared up with the trigger, and an abundance of mana flowed into the tips of his fingers.

&#39;Today, <em>we</em> are the challengers.&#39; He proclaimed, issuing an official challenge letter to the General. &#39;This is by no means a fair fight, because Rider will not be fighting you alone. Naturally, I ask you not to reserve your strength...&#39;

He paused, his ears picking up a faint buzzing that only grew louder with time. Soon, the sky was dark with flying insects, all of them converging towards a single focal point: Laura. 

Kun Wu could stomach gore. Squashing the occasional creepy crawly was also fine and dandy. But the insect swarm that was currently crawling all over Laura&#39;s frame was on a whole other level of repulsive. His eyes started to twitch when the bugs started invading her face and hair, swallowing her up in a nightmarish armor that elicited involuntary shivers down his spine.

&#39;For someone who knows <em>so</em> much, you really ought to work on your presentation more.&#39; He said to the formless mass, all the while fighting down the urge to purchase all the bug repellents off Amazones™️. &#39;You&#39;d sound a hell lot more convincing right now if you hadn&#39;t pulled a gun on me once.&#39;

He brought his fan arm up in one huge swing. Nothing happened for a moment, then the horizon lit up with a swarm of red orange dots. The flame rabbits Kun Wu had dispersed among the thugs were now coming back, racing against one another as they rushed to reunite with their creator. A shapeless mass of flames soon replaced the rabbits, casting the area in a warm orange glow.

Of course, I have plenty of stories for the occassion...&#39;

<em>FWOOSH</em>

He cut through the air with his iron fan, directing its blade towards Laura. In response, the maelstrom of flames lurched towards the girl, aiming to engulf her with its sheer size alone. If Laura hadn&#39;t figured out the special properties to his flames, then now would be a good time to panic: even though the fire did not burn, it sure looked convincing enough to agitate some of her bugs despite them being under her control!

Meanwhile, Kun Wu retreated back to Rider.

&#39;Baby steps, okay?&#39; He beamed at Rider, trying to put her mind at ease. &#39;The first thing to do against a mounted foe is to dismount them, or cripple their stead. It pains me to say this, but we need to put the legendary Red Hare down if we want to engage Guan Yu on equal footing. Of course, I will give you all the help I can.&#39;

His eyes sparkled dangerously. A sense of foreboding gripped Rider. What was this unease she felt...

&#39;...On that note, is there anything you would like to hear today?&#39;

Oh no. Here it comes. Kun Wu&#39;s specialty: his mind-numbing bedtime stories that had put Rider to sleep more times than she could count. 

&#39;Since you are the star of the show, I can spin something up just for you, free of charge!&#39; His smile grew increasingly ominous. &#39;You said something about the silk weaver, didn&#39;t you? Or maybe you&#39;d like something more fantastical, like the winged tiger and his friends?&#39; 

Of course, Rider was fully aware that Kun Wu&#39;s magecraft needed his stories to function. She just wished he didn&#39;t have to be so verbal every single time. There was a limit to how much nonsense she could stomach in a day...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s grip was the only confirmation she needed to realize that she wasn&#39;t fighting alone. It wasn&#39;t her against Guan Yu, it was <em>them</em>. Something she could have never said in her life. Despite being the leader of a fleet. Despite being surrounded by suitors and children, Ching Shih felt alone.

That all changed today.

She observed Laura morph into an insect-like form, seeming more beast than human as she surrounded herself with tiny critters. Very fitting, since she planned on squashing her like a bug. Likewise, her fear of Guan Yu had mostly subsided. Not completely gone, but a far cry from how tense she felt during their initial encounter.

&quot;It&#39;s fine. Respect only gets us so far.&quot; Ching replied, having no intention of holding back against her childhood hero. She had already sworn her loyalty to someone else...

...Who was currently trying to give her a nervous breakdown.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot; She glared at him in disdain. &quot;You know how much I detest those ridiculous fairy tales of yours.&quot; Kun Wu felt like a billion daggers had just stabbed his heart. Oh, such cruelty.

&quot;But I appreciate the help.&quot; Her grip in his hand grew stronger, before she swiftly released it. &quot;So go with what works. You know me best, don&#39;t you? How foolish I can be. How impulsive I can be. Go ahead and tell them, the tale of this greedy woman.&quot; Ching Shih laughed, smiling as she stared at her opponent head on. Despite Guan Yu towering above her while riding his steed, it felt like she was looking down on him.

&quot;...But if you say anything ridiculous, I&#39;m leaving you for dead.&quot; Rider warned before breaking into a sprint, charging at Guan Yu head on. A suicidal maneuver that left him completely befuddled. It was ridiculous for a foot soldier to be capable of harming a warrior on horseback. Such a concept had not changed in the past 3,000 years. What was Rider hoping to achieve?</span>

She kept running, closing the distance as she was now around a dozen meters away from Guan Yu. The movements in her arms changed as her palms was now resting on her...bosom? They were covering the breast window of her exquisite qipao. Was this an attempt at seducing him? A pointless effort, for his heart lusted for battle and-

A sword erupted from her cleavage. An elegant rapier that had tasted blood in a previous life.

&quot;Madam&#39;s Rose.&quot; Ching whispered to herself, as if to pump herself up as she thrust her rapier forward. Normally, such a weapon would not be able to reach him, but there was something odd about that rapier: It twisted and turned, increasing in length as it now resembled a metal whip. It lunged towards Red Hare, aiming to stab at the beast&#39;s skull. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

The first moves were made by the challengers. Flames sought to engulf his Master. Quickly, he relayed his thoughts to her while he stared towards Rider to see what move she would make herself. 

<em>&quot;Miss Hess! Use the swarm as we discussed and deprive them of their senses! Shatter their teamwork and test their resolve!&quot;</em> Guan Yu was entrusting Laura&#39;s choice to stay and be an asset on the battlefield completely. His words as a tactician rung loud and clear in her head. No ifs or confirmations on whether or not that was really what she wanted. He already knew the answer to that.

The next move they made against them was a move similar to Master of Saber&#39;s tactic of charging a mounted warrior head-on! Has the might and fear of cavalry diminished in their time? Even if it did, it took an insane amount of guts and confidence in one&#39;s abilities to perform such a maneuver.

Such a short ranged weapon couldn&#39;t possibl- Before his eyes the blade extended and twisted to form the length needed to strike at her enemies. <em>&quot;A blade that adapts to the user&#39;s will. Impressive.&quot;</em> His thoughts ran through his head as Rider attempted to take Red Hare out of the fight early on. 

<strong>&quot;But will it be enough I wonder!&quot;</strong> A defiant shout was made as Guan Yu pulled on the reins to have Red Hare rear out of the path of the blade to prevent an early devastating blow. Unlike his last fight with Archer, he was able to see this one coming.

The distinct sound of a blade cutting through the air was heard. While he used one hand to maneuver Red Hare out of danger, the other hand was used to swing the heavy weapon. The weapon came from below as it swung upwards towards Rider. 

After the strike was made, Red Hare ran away from the reach of Rider and attempted to encircle the opposing pair. He planned to fully utilize his speed to his advantage.

If Team Rider wanted to secure victory, they needed to work together as a team to overcome this opponent who was stronger, sturdier, and <strong>faster</strong> than them. A perfect test to see how strong the bond of Rider and her Master had become and whether or not they would weather even the strongest of storms together.

The two ever-moving masses that served as legs started moving in his direction, taking slow but deliberate steps towards the boy.

Had she truly figured the properties of his flames, or did she simply not care for her well-being? No, it was something else. Unexpectedly, large chunks of the boy&#39;s flames fell from her figure as she kept advancing, similar to leaves getting blown away by the wind. The girl kept shrugging the flames until none were left, not even stopping a second to look back as she closed the distance that separated her from her opponent: Kun Wu.

If he was observant enough, he would understand the meaning behind this trick. Much like a bug shredding its own skin, the outer layer of bugs that came in contact with his flames slipped off from her figure, leaving her main body untainted by his fire.

<em>For someone who knows so much, you really ought to work on your presentation more.</em>

As resolved as she was, the boy still managed to bring forth an urge to giggle from the bug-infested girl. The reason she found his words funny wasn&#39;t exactly clear, but they reminded her of a recent memory—that of a girl that had taken on her shoulders a burden too great, that avoided the help of others like the plague and that spent much of her life building up a <em>fake image</em> for others to witness.

&quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m <em>way</em> over caring for my image.&quot; The alien voice retorted, shrugging off Kun Wu&#39;s words as easily as it had shrugged his flames.

A bug-condensed limb, previously a hand, was lifted towards the sky. With it, a number of crawling insects that surrounded Kun Wu—spiders, ants, cockroaches and the likes swarmed full-speed towards him, aiming to climb upon his body from the base of his feet.

The grotesque spectacle that stretched around him, that of an amorphous mass composed of thousands upon thousands of organisms swarming and crawling in their own individual ways, closing in on him with unexpected speed—such a spectacle would surely disturb, even <em>frighten</em> even the bravest amongst men.</span>

Their oppressive buzzing got progressively louder while its pitch also rose, easily drowning out any other sound that transpired on the battlefield. 

It was so loud, so distracting that one barely managed to hear his own thoughts—let alone speak with another.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Ahaha! The famous Madame Ching would request a story of herself? Now <em>that</em> is a first.&#39; Kun Wu laughed, his eyes full of fondness. &#39;You know how I work, don&#39;t you? Asking me not to exaggerate is like telling me to cancel my Amazones™️ membership. You&#39;ll have to beat it out of me first. Though I wonder if you can afford to spare any energy on poor old me with Red Hare on your trail!&#39;

He sent Rider off with a dance, shooting jets of flames from his fan with each broad swing. Even in the middle of a battle, Kun Wu couldn&#39;t help but want to show off. Rider was right to leave him to his own devices. Perhaps she had already known in her heart that it was impossible to stop Kun Wu once he got the itch to perform. 

But who could blame him? To Kun Wu, showmanship and swordsmanship had always been one and the same. He had long since incorporated his martial arts techniques into his dance routines. Each fight equated a performance, and he was about to put on the most extravagant show to please both his Servant and his opponents.

<strong>&#39;Once upon a time, way <em>way</em> before the Earth had been flooded, there lived a little girl in a fishing village by the sea. Every day she went to the sea to fish to make a living. Though she was very poor, she tried her best to help whenever people asked something of her....&#39;</strong>

Once again, the sky darkened as Laura dispersed more of her insect minions into the field, drowning out all other sounds with the incessant buzzing of their wings. Soon, Kun Wu was having trouble hearing even his own words, let alone Rider&#39;s complaints, assuming she would have any in the first place! 

The attack was quite befitting of an informant. By cutting off his and Rider&#39;s only form of communication, Laura was trying to cripple what little teamwork they had improved over the course of the City Grail War!

...Of course, that was assuming that there was even an ounce of teamwork between Kun Wu and Ching Shih to begin with.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu followed Rider&#39;s movements with his eyes, estimating her trajectory as she shone on the darkened battlefield with her pearl white frame. His mana was flowing out of him in earnest now; as Laura approached and as bugs started crawling up his boots, so did a brand new mana signature flare up in the distance...

-------

<strong>FWOOMP</strong>

In the distance, an enormous mana signature erupted from under Rider&#39;s feet. A huge <strong>dolphin</strong>, vivid as a Sky Lantern adorning the night sky, leaped <em>out of</em> the ground and caught Rider mid-run, carrying her high up into the sky in a beautiful arch. 

Of course, unlike Red Hare, Rider had absolutely <em>zero</em> control over the dolphin. She could only hope and cope as the giant sea mammal carried her far off course from where Guan Yu was headed. By her estimate, the dolphin was going to miss Guan Yu by dozens of meters with its plunge.

Was that it? Was this truly the epitome of Kun Wu and Rider&#39;s teamwork? Rider had requested assistance and received help in the form of a flying fish. Perhaps she should have coordinated with her Master better...

...No. Rider knew what she was getting into when she placed her trust in a <em>performer</em>. Kun Wu&#39;s shows, despite having a script, was often haphazard and filled with improvisations. She had experienced it during her summons; now that she had willingly become part of his show, she was expected to do the same. 

Kun Wu had given her a tool. It was up to her to add it to her repertoire.

-------

Kun Wu looked at his hands thoughtfully. He had just conjured a completed flame creature in record time. For a magecraft novice who had no proper training in conserving his mana, such a feat would normally strain even his gifted circuits. But now, his fingers only tingled slightly as a warmth spread from the tips up his arms.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His artificial circuits had kicked in and was now assisting his mana output, but something felt different. His body felt abnormally light. Refreshing. Almost as if he had received some form of Mana Tuning from a skilled tuner. He hadn&#39;t the slightest idea as to why, but the revelation was welcoming all the same. Especially considering that he was currently in the danger of drowning in bugs.

He looked at the shadowy form of Laura&#39;s frame. 

&#39;Has anyone ever told you that you should, I don&#39;t know, relax a bit?&#39; He called out to her over the buzz of the surrounding critters as he finally started running towards where the bug swarm was the thinnest. &#39;Image is important, even if you are a informant working from the shadows! You could build your clientele with skills alone, but I bet your business would <em>skyrocket</em> if you could shower them in some love. Take it from someone who&#39;s just reached 99k subscribers!&#39; He boasted at the risk of eating bugs, clearly quite proud of his achievement.

And, expectedly, a few critters did manage to find their way into his mouth, making him gag and cough. He lifted his fan and started conjuring huge bursts of flames with broad strokes. He picked up his storytelling, hiding his mouth behind his sleeve as he reshaped those flames, strengthening them, <em>condensing</em> them, shedding the flames of their ethereal bodies as they became something almost tangible...

He slapped his fan down, and a full-fledged <strong>tiger</strong> poured out of the ball of fire. A growl rumbled in its throat. It lowered its back, and Kun Wu hopped on without hesitation.

The advantage of mobility.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The tiger started running in earnest around the perimeter of the battle field as Kun Wu fueled it with his storytelling and herded it with his fan. First, he would thin the bug swarm by separating the crawly critters from the rest. Then, he would retaliate from the distance. Laura may have an unlimited source of expendable minions, but there was a glaring weakness in her tactics.

She lacked mobility.

And Kun Wu was taking a leaf out of Guan Yu&#39;s book. Inspired by the General, he was seeking to recreate the same conundrum Rider was having against her mounted foe, then use it against his own Master. 

He focused hard on Laura&#39;s location and pushed his circuits further. A new ball of fire manifested above Laura and started morphing almost immediately.

He was starting to work on his <strong>third</strong> familiar. 

This was absurd. It was simply unheard of. He had <em>never</em> been able to summon more than two familiars even during the peak of his performances! Had he been hiding his true strength all this time, or did this boon have something to do with <em>Rider</em>?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching Shih had no doubt that the first strike would be the least likely to succeed. If Guan Yu were the type to keel over from a single attack, he wouldn&#39;t be standing against her in this exact moment. He was a seasoned warrior. One used to storms of arrows and a rain of spears from all sides. It was inevitable for him to pull Red Hare out of danger, narrowly avoiding Ching&#39;s blade.

&quot;Tch.&quot; Ching grumbled. Would a second strike work? She pondered on that for a few seconds, before realizing that a fabled sword from Macau was still no match for the Frost Fair Blade. The difference was just too vast.

She felt it firsthand as Guan Yu directed a strike from below, aimed at her body. She raised her sword in a guard stance in an attempt to parry, but the fabled guandao struck her with such force that she was sent flying a few feet back.

&quot;Urk!&quot; She felt like coughing blood, but relented in order to avoid spoiling her fabled dress. Cleaning fees weren&#39;t cheap.

<em>&quot;My sword might as well be a toothpick to him.&quot;</em> She thought, realizing how weak she was in comparison. Despite that, she wasted no time getting back on her feet and charging at Guan Yu. Again. She was trying to keep up with a man on horseback!

<em>&quot;...But I&#39;m not <strong>alone.</strong> I can trust on <strong>him</strong> to make an entrance.&quot;</em> Ching smirked, having a plan in the back of her mind. Even when Laura had overwhelmed her senses with an annoying buzz of insects, Rider had complete faith that her Master would support her in the time of need.

And that they did, as Ching Shih was suddenly propelled upwards, to the point she was now far, far above the fabled general. She formed a beautiful arc, looking down to her feet and realizing that she was standing on top of a dolphin. It was obvious who had summoned it.

&quot;At least it wasn&#39;t a seagull.&quot; Ching Shih chuckled to herself as she observed Guan Yu from above. From that height, she felt at top of the world. Beyond the land and sea. A pirate who ruled over the skies.</span>

Of course, these delusions of grandeur would end the moment Ching realized that Kun Wu had completely fumbled the arc&#39;s trajectory. Through basic calculations, one could estimate that Ching Shih would land further away than intended from Guan Yu, which would allow Red Hare to trample her with impunity.

But was that really true?

<strong>&quot;Though this girl was extremely poor, she was quite astute.&quot;</strong> Ching started muttering out loud, much to Lancer&#39;s surprise. He could barely tell what she was saying due to the insects, but she had a smile while doing that.

<strong>&quot;After helping various people and doing several good deeds, the Buddha rewarded her for her efforts: One fateful day, during a fishing trip, she stumbled upon a great catch...&quot;</strong> A malevolent glint filled her eyes as her heels dug deeper into the dolphin, using it as a support.

Before she jumped.

Her silhouette covered the moon, as Kun Wu managed to see her past the storm of insects. His goddess of fortune about to descend from the heavens like an angelical savior.

Ching was glad that the insects drowned the sound of her voice. She would die of embarrassment if her Master could hear what she was saying right now.

&quot;I hope that you have put two and two together by now, Lord Guan Yu.&quot; Ching muttered, expecting no reply as a gigantic anchor appeared on top of her, followed by several chains.

<strong>&quot;Curse of Shui Gui: Dropped Anchor!&quot;</strong> She shouted, the anchor collapsing in front of Red Hare and blocking its path while the chains wrapped themselves around Guan Yu and his steed. The horse cried out in pain as Guan Yu felt scorching injuries around areas that exposed his skin. It felt like a powerful curse, one specifically designed to affect him and him only.</span>

&quot;My Noble Phantasm is rather strong against those known to be rich in life. Doubly so if they are also male. As a famous general, you no doubt had several riches to speak of.&quot; Ching chuckled, landing on the ground as she taunted her opponent from afar.

&quot;You probably can&#39;t even tell what I&#39;m saying, which is fine. I&#39;d rather speak through blows.&quot; Rider exclaimed, revealing the Madam&#39;s Rose once again as she attempted to slash at Red Hare&#39;s legs and disable the horse. Thanks to the blade&#39;s extended range, she knew she could strike from afar with no fear of retribution, unless Guan Yu tried something particularly risky. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With the monsters he has fought so far in this CGW, he was half-expecting Rider to walk off the full force of his strike. However, this was not the case. His blade struck true and sent Rider flying. As expected from a Rider Class, she didn&#39;t crumbled after the first blow. Good. It wouldn&#39;t have been fun if she fell with one single blow. A grin was shown on Guan Yu&#39;s face. The passion within his heart continued to blaze like a brilliant inferno! 

A single glance towards his Master and he saw her outmatched in terms of mobility. A death sentence if one didn&#39;t have a countermeasure for it. Hopefully the tutoring from his lessons would allow her to think on her toes. She was indeed crafty so he had no doubt that she would be okay. For now, he needed to focus on Kun Wu&#39;s Servant.

The cleverness of Master of Rider&#39;s genius continued to show through as Rider descended from above thanks to the use of his unique magecraft. The mana that gathered shortly after was enough evidence for him to know that she was preparing something big. 

The sounds of the bugs in the air prevented him from hearing her words, but he figured that it could only be a chant with the Mana gathering in the air. It didn&#39;t take long enough until he knew he was correct. A giant anchor and chains formed and dropped upon him and Red Hare.

Would Red Hare be subjected to more pain? No. Red Hare suffered more than he needed. The wound against his heart was still fresh seeing Red Hare after a direct blow from Archer. As his Rider, Guan Yu sought fit to prevent any more unnecessary blows, even if he had to endure the blunt of it alone.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Red Hare! Run! I&#39;m entrusting you now!&quot; With a hard pull on the reins, Guan Yu redirected Red Hare&#39;s path to escape the grasp of Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm, but he knew that wouldn&#39;t be enough. So he stood up and used Red Hare to leap towards Rider and her incoming Noble Phantasm. 

This man valued the life of his steed more than his own it seemed. Why else would someone be mad enough to leap in the path of a Noble Phantasm? Though, the selfless act was befitting of someone known as a Protector after all.

The chains entrapped Guan Yu as he was caught by Rider&#39;s trap. He strained and pulled against them fruitlessly as he gritted his teeth from the scorching pains caused by those devilish chains.

The weight was immense. Suffocating even. Rider was in the distance seemingly taunting him. If enduring the full force of her Noble Phantasm alone meant that Red Hare and his Master would be exempt from this hell then so be it. The slashes that soon followed tore into robes, armour, and flesh alike. The slashes that struck flesh soon begun to flow a smooth crimson, staining his verdant robes. If his Endurance was any lower, he would have surely crumbled before Rider! 

&quot;Well done, Rider!&quot; He said with a smile on his face as he endured the hell that was her Noble Phantasm. Though it was difficult, he still managed to smile despite the pain. The sounds of his words would surely fail to reach her, but the sight of his lips moving could. 

He was complimenting her? She was being congratulated by her opponent for entrapping him. 

---------------

Red Hare having escaped Rider&#39;s clutches, they ran at full speed towards their target. The mass of battle-hardened muscle proved to be quite the effective battering ram to anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in their path. Just who would be their unfortunate target? Why, it would be Rider of course! Red Hare&#39;s eyes were enraged for what they have done to their Rider. The fires within matched the illusions caused by their mane!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As expected from the Feng-Shui master, the control he exerted over his flame was as great as it was hypnotising. The flame tiger&#39;s every move, portrayed to her through the near-infinite windows of her bugs, conveyed a sense of wonder and amazement. Not only was it rapid and agile, but the details in its movements and the small intricacies that accompanied his every steps and hops were so stunning that you couldn&#39;t see it as a mere doll that took on the appearance of a random animal, but as a creature of beauty that mimicked life with incredible energy and realism.

The girl didn&#39;t have the luxury to stare in awe, though. Kun Wu had gained a decisive advantage over her with his increased mobility, easily outrunning her and her bugs while cornering the least agile crawlers that laid on the ground.

But while she completely lost in terms of mobility, Kun Wu lacked <em>unpredictability</em>.

Having to circle the entire battlefield across his fantastical flame tiger, his trajectory was proving to be quite easy to read. If only she could capitalise on that, the tides could perhaps be reversed!

The artificial circuits in her forearms sizzled as her Magical energy filtered through them, cementing her influence on the swarm and gaining access to a more complex array of orders for her bugs.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The spiders started weaving silk as if their lives depended on it, squeezing their glands dry by the orders of their supreme commander, reinforcing their threads to be as strong and durable as denim threads. Pairs of flying insects, faster and more agile than the arachnids, each took thread and flew off in the direction of Kun Wu. As his predictable trajectory allowed, they didn&#39;t need to actively chase after him. He would eventually come to <em>them</em>, and the distance that separated them was enough to make small adjustments to their positioning so as to make full contact with the boy in the most favourable way possible, all the while making full use of the dim light to conceal themselves in the dark and become utterly unavoidable.

Soon, Kun Wu ran into the binding threads. While he barely felt the first one and the second, the third, fifth, tenth and twentieth soon made their impacts apparent. As he ran full speed towards the near-invisible silks, the sticky threads closed on himself like binding ropes, aiming to circle his entire torso and glue his arms to his sides. The more speed he picked up, the faster the layers of silk bound him, effectively turning his newly-gained advantage into a weapon against him. Not only would his movements with the iron fan be greatly affected, but if he didn&#39;t react in time, he would surely fall off from his own familiar!

And while he was obstructed by the threads, slowly but surely cutting his freedom of movement, peculiar shapes started to appear on the battlefield.

Seeing the fight between Rider and Guan Yu enfold, she couldn&#39;t help but bite her lip. Even with their means of communication cut, the challengers still proved to be an incredibly coordinated bunch. All Kun Wu had to do was give his Servant a platform to strike, and she easily turned this opportunity into a decisive advantage over her foe.

But surely, he wasn&#39;t the only Master capable of providing support.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Up until this point, the ground had been truly blanketed in bugs. Ally and enemy alike, one couldn&#39;t hope to take a few steps without squashing an handful of bugs beneath their feet. 

From that same blanket started to rise humanoid shapes, a few dozens of them. The ground soon cleared of the crawlies as the insects amassed and consolidated into these firm, hugely condensed shapes, making it seem like a crowd had suddenly entered the battlefield. Although lighter and slower than regular humans, these human-bugs had the advantage of being near-impossible to obliterate with regular weapons or fists. They were just glorified bugs, after all! Taking a hit would surely make them crumble, but they would reform in a matter of seconds into their humanoid shapes, shrugging off most of the damage dealt to them.

A number of them stayed close to Laura, monitoring the orb of flames—the soon-to-be third familiar of Kun Wu with dutifulness, ready to pounce or get Laura out of harm&#39;s way at the slightest perturbation felt by their sensible organs.

Meanwhile, the humanoid bugs that appeared near Rider closed in on her, taking full advantage of her attention being drawn to her fight by striking from her blind spot.

But it wouldn&#39;t be enough. A Servant, infinitely stronger and faster than any regular human, would surely react to their slow strikes. Even with their hearing nullified and their attention elsewhere, Laura couldn&#39;t hope to catch Rider off-guard with mere imitations of humans, created with bugs nonetheless...

But that lighting fast reaction was exactly what she needed—getting her attention for as little as a couple of seconds was enough.

It was all the lightning-fast steed Red Hare needed to close in on his target and strike!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He didn&#39;t notice it at first. His mind was occupied with his storytelling and his hands were busy with his iron fan. Controlling two flame familiars at once required double the concentration, and now he was adding a third to the fray. 

The ball of fire above Laura&#39;s head puffed up like a giant balloon as Kun Wu fed more mana into it with each utterance of his tale. It soon grew bigger than Ching Shih&#39;s dolphin, bigger than Kun Wu&#39;s tiger. The mana signature emitting from it had easily surpassed either of the flame creatures currently on the field. Something big was coming, something <em>devastating</em>. And Laura wasn&#39;t sure whether she wanted to stay behind and find out.

Unfortunately, Kun Wu wasn&#39;t intent on giving her the option to back out. Not with so many humanoid bug swarms on the field. Laura&#39;s control over the critters was exquisite, rivaling that of his own with the fire element. If left unchecked, she could easily overwhelm his flames with their sheer number alone.

...Which was why he needed his new familiar to be something monumental. A creature so indisputably large and <em>eye-catching</em>, that would be sure to wow miss little informant <em>and</em> render her bug knights useless...

There had only ever been one such creature that fit the criteria.

<strong>&#39;The string of the fishing rod grew taut. The golden carp had taken the bait! Filled with ecstasy, the little girl started reeling the fish in as fast as she could.&#39;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu steered clear of the humanoid bugs as he started herding his tiger to circle back to Laura, but then lethargy kicked in. His arms felt increasingly heavy with each stroke he made with the iron fan, his muscles straining to even lift them above his shoulders. Kun Wu put more strength into his arm and forced it forward, but his sleeves ripped across his coat like velcro, and the sound alerted him. He looked down, and found his torso covered in bundles of silk-like threads. They stuck to his body like glue and taped his arms to his side with every increasing strength.

<em>Spider webs!</em> 

The unpleasant thought crossed his mind, and Kun Wu shivered in disgust. Laura had used his speed against him, making it almost impossible for him to wave his arm about.

Kun Wu had been placed in quite a pickle. Unlike an authentic familiar summoned by a more capable magus, his &#39;familiars&#39; were only anime-shaped mannequins that needed him to pull the strings every step of the way. But now that his arms were sealed, his flame creatures were as good as dead! 

In a few breath&#39;s time, the flame tiger slowed to a crawl. The dolphin also stopped mid jump, stuck halfway in the ground as it remained motionless without Kun Wu&#39;s input.

...Was there truly no way for him to continue his dance?

Kun Wu surveyed the ground around him. With most of the bugs having gathered into the humanoids, the ground was once again bug-free. 

His stage had returned.

&#39;You really <em>are</em> a picky customer.&#39; Kun Wu called out to Laura over the sound of the flying critters. &#39;But I don&#39;t dislike that! People like you are the reason I&#39;m able to push my shows to new heights. Keeping me on my toes, forcing me to come up with brand new routines that no one&#39;s ever seen before! I dig that!&#39;

If he had an arm to lift, he would&#39;ve given Laura a thumbs up. With his arms restricted, however, Kun Wu skipped the formalities and hopped down from his motionless tiger.

The youth flicked his wrist, threw his iron fan upwards, and <strong>caught the handle with his mouth</strong>. Then he continued his dance, compensating his immobile arms with legwork as he ran, jumped, and backflipped, dragging his fan around the perimeter with exaggerated movements. 

The tiger started moving again with renewed vigor, circling Kun Wu as it guarded him from the humanoid bugs. The dolphin started leaping in and out of the ground near the two Servants as well; its aim was crappy, but every few leaps, it would ram into a bug swarm, dispersing them and giving Rider a little more room to breathe.

Above Laura&#39;s head, the ball of fire burst open, swirling flames congealing into the body of an oriental dragon. Twice as wide as the tiger and dozens of times as long, the creature plunged to the ground and formed a giant circle around Laura and her humanoid bugs.

It didn&#39;t matter that Laura&#39;s bug knights were indestructible. Rather, their flimsy composition would be their downfall: as the dragon constricted them like an oversized python, the bugs would surely disperse, leaving Laura the only prey within its clutch.

Could Laura outrun a dragon?

Or should she try to disable the creature from the source? How much would it take to render Kun Wu completely immobile?</span>

She wished she could respond to his antics with a few witty remarks of her own, but there was no time for that.

At long last, Kun Wu&#39;s finishing move had been unleashed upon the battlefield—A magnificent oriental dragon, much bigger than the dragons he usually summoned during his performances, circling the skies with unprecedented beauty and grace. The magnificent beast stood on top of Laura and the swarm decoys that stood close to her, then proceeded to plunge towards the ground with incredible force, bringing with it violent gales of wind that threatened to topple everything in their wake.

As condensed and compact as they were, the humanoid clones stood no chance. All were blown away by its movement, scattering into the smallest building blocks that composed them in mere seconds. Not a single clone remained after the fact, a consequence testifying to the dragon&#39;s immense strength and overwhelming superiority.

Now, Laura was alone by herself with no clones to rely on—with only enough bugs to cover her frail and slender limbs. Yet soon, even those bugs fell to the dragon&#39;s antics, getting blown off bit by bit with each of his moves until there were none left.

...No, until there was <strong>absolutely nothing left</strong>.

Not a single thing remained inside the circle that the dragon formed. No trace of the bugs that used to roam in humanoid forms, and <strong>no trace of the blonde girl commanding them</strong>. The only thing left was her oversized sweat-shirt and her cargo shorts, laying where she should have been. Hell, even those were soon blown off by the dragon&#39;s wind, leaving but a gaping void in their wake.</span>

The youth would surely be surprised to find that his opponent had effectively vanished, not a single trace of her existence remaining on the battlefield.

<em>Had she gotten blown off by his dragon somehow?</em>

In the momentary confusion that followed her sudden disappearance, a noisy click was heard by the young boy.

A familiar barrel stuck out from one of the humanoid shapes that surrounded him and his white tiger, aiming for the back of his head from afar.

It&#39;s owner, a slender-looking girl, with bugs as the only thing covering her white porcelain skin, was staring at him with resolve.

&quot;Better come up with a brand new routine <em>now</em>.&quot; The girl softly spoke, her voice completely drown in the loud buzzing that permeated the battlefield.

...But while her stare was sharp, her arm shook terribly. Was it physical strain or a psychological weakness? Even she wasn&#39;t sure in the heat of the moment.

Bracing herself, the girl closed her eyes, relying purely on the bug&#39;s distorted vision to guide her pistol towards its target.

Then, with a squeeze of the index, the girl shot the gun.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Shui Gui&#39;s anchor was a terrifying Noble Phantasm. An adaptation not only of the various sea shanties Ching Shih and her crew sung during their heyday, but also a vivid reminder of what awaited her men if they ever attempted to betray her.

Guan Yu felt the chilling cold of long lost spirits clutching at his legs and waist. Spirits of the deceased. Men that he had murdered during times of war. Proud warriors reduced to these hollow husks, who were now attempting to drag him down to their level. They were clearly illusions. Phantasms with no defined origin or purpose. But the hatred behind their curses felt very much real.

But he was glad, for he had prevented Red Hare from suffering such a fate. He even took the brunt of Ching&#39;s blow, watching as blood spurted out of his body from her sword slashes. He knew what would come next, as his loyal horse started charging straight into his opponent.

&quot;Tch. You might have saved your horse, but what good will that do to you?&quot; Ching growled, albeit none of them could hear each other. &quot;You are trespassing in <em>my</em> domain. Do you have any idea of how many riches me and my Master have stockpiled here? I&#39;m practically in my element.&quot;

She boasted, ready to sidestep Red Hare once it got close enough in an effort to attack it from its side. Ching was brimming with confidence: She had brought down Guan Yu, her greatest fear. The only thing left was his horse, which was a joke in comparison. She had practically already won.

Unfortunately, overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. She realized that once she felt a light jab towards her cheek, coming from an unknown entity. She turned to her side and watched a humanoid mass of centipedes and flies dissipate into nothing.

That girl...

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em></span>

Ching spat out blood. It dripped from her mouth as she felt a crack in her spine. Red Hare collided straight in her back, dragging her forward as she was being propelled by its immense speed. A battering ram had hit her full force and she could barely perceive the world around her.

&quot;Hngh...&quot; She bit her lip. Grit her teeth. Anything to feel something and gain her grip back on reality. She couldn&#39;t afford to be incapacitated now! Not in this crucial moment!

Had Guan Yu realized that the spirits around him were starting to wane? Had Kun Wu noticed that Rider was looking more pallid than usual? Yep, her assumptions were accurate: She couldn&#39;t keep her Noble Phantasm active for longer than a few minutes, not even with the current boost from the various riches she had gathered. The core problem of mana leakage was still there. Perhaps, she should have taken Kun Wu&#39;s opportunity to bond...

Thinking about those things wouldn&#39;t save her now. She had dug her own grave, so the least she could do was claw her way out. She gasped for air, regaining consciousness as she immediately ran a dozen plans in her head. Red Hare was too fast to be stopped, too powerful to be maimed, especially now that she was in the weakest possible position to be in. Attempting to jump away would most likely just result in her being thrashed about and trampled. A dishonorable death, befitting someone like her.

But she wouldn&#39;t accept it. She could never accept this kind of fate. Not after experiencing so much. Not after finding what she had been looking for, all along...

<strong>&quot;...I&#39;m not letting you trample over me, Red Hare.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Running away was futile, so she wouldn&#39;t attempt such foolishness. Instead, she embraced Red Hare, hugging the horse so tightly that it struggled to breath. Slowly, she adapted to its speed, adjusting her limbs and placing one of her legs around the horse&#39;s neck.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you why I was summoned as a Rider.&quot; Ching smirked as blood dripped from her lips. The horse was furious! This woman couldn&#39;t possibly be trying to-?!

Her other leg wrapped itself the horse&#39;s saddle, while her arms exerted pressure on the beast by holding its neck in a tight grip. She was trying to ride it. Ching Shih, of all people, was trying to ride a horse of legend!

It was foolishness that knew no bounds. An insult to such a proud beast. Red Hare was completely blinded my rage, to the point that even its owner took notice. Guan Yu could not help but look in disarray as he witnessed his horse thrash about. It galloped with such fierceness, bouncing up and down on its hind legs in an effort to throw Ching Shih off.

It felt like being tossed inside of a washing machine, but Rider didn&#39;t stop. She started clawing at the beast, digging her nails deep inside its skin in an effort to maintain her grip. How utterly abhorrent!

Red Hare neighed in pain and anger. It bopped its head forward, causing Ching to forcibly lose her grip as her arm inadvertently extended towards the horse&#39;s head. The latter took this chance and opened its maw.

<em><strong>CRACK</strong></em>

The bone crunching sound of Red Hare chomping on Rider&#39;s arm was painful to hear, but no one would hear it thanks to Laura&#39;s bugs. The only thing that could be felt was Ching Shih&#39;s excruciating pain. She wanted to cry and scream.

But she relented, biting her lip and holding it in. Instead, she raised her other arm and clawed at the horse&#39;s nose, in a vain attempt to get it to release its jaws.

&quot;Release me this instant, you vile beast!&quot;</span>

Red Hare snorted, amused by such a pathetic display. This woman was no Heroic Spirit! No Servant would reduce themselves to such a shameless state! If she couldn&#39;t even overpower Lancer&#39;s steed, what hope did he have against the man himself?

Ching&#39;s injuries were piling up, causing her mana supply to gradually dwindle. Guan Yu felt it too, as one of the chains dissipated from his body. He felt confident that he could escape from his iron prison if he exerted his full strength. Should he end it all, in this instant?

Ching Shih kept clawing at the horse, but Red Hare had endured far worse. In fact, the beast could feel Rider&#39;s spirit waning. The horse was breaking a human, instead of the other way around. Something Red Hare had been doing for years, at least until Lu Bu appeared. This woman would be <strong>crushed.</strong>

Once again, Ching felt her grip on reality slip. Was this her inevitable fate? To die not at the hands of China&#39;s greatest hero, but their steed of all things? Such a ridiculous joke, truly befitting for an idiotic fairytale.

She wondered if Kun Wu was still narrating out loud, despite the buzzing around her. Could he see her giving up from this distance? It must have been supremely embarrassing, but she felt too broken to care. She had been defeated, fair and square.

What else would someone do when cornered like this?

Just when she was about to close her eyes forever, she saw a glint in the corner of her mind. A flash of inspiration, spurred by a waning flame. She could see <em>him</em> in the distance, restrained by numerous spiderwebs as even his body had stopped moving.

Until he smiled, laughed and simply started dancing with his legs and mouth, of all things. Hopelessness did not exist to Kun Wu. Or, to be more accurate, he knew exactly how it felt. That&#39;s why he could always keep his head high.</span>

&quot;Dancing, huh?&quot; Ching laughed in her mind, too tired to commit to it. Red Hare thrashed her like a ragdoll as she felt like she could be launched away at any time. But at the same time, there was a rhythm behind it. As if the horse was toying with her, gloating in its victory now that it had broken yet another person.

Much like a dance.

Her mind clicked. Her worries melted away. This was what she had been looking for in her life. A way to escape that dreaded sense of loneliness. The sense that the entire world had been against you since the very beginning.

The feeling that you didn&#39;t deserve to be born.

She never asked for it. She tried to make the best out of it, but couldn&#39;t escape that feeling.

So instead of escaping it, why not embrace it? Follow its rhythm. Capture its flow.

Ride it, like her name implied.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Red Hare snorted as it did one final hop. One so powerful and brusque that it threatened to spirit Rider away. The woman&#39;s body jumped, while Red Hare landed gracefully. The horse expected Rider to crash in a pool of her own blood. Any moment now...

A tingle followed, as the horse felt an excruciating pain in its lower back. It felt it coming from its...tail?!

The horse gave a quick glance, and shuddered in horror: Ching Shih was gripping at his tail&#39;s hair with her <em>mouth</em>, using her own jaw and neck strength as a way to keep herself attached to the horse. Such an act would be enough to break a human&#39;s neck. She was lucky that she was a Servant.

<strong>&quot;The girl caught the carp.&quot;</strong> Ching Shih muttered to herself, spitting away horse hair as she clawed at the horse&#39;s buttocks, digging her nails in and exerting pressure. She had regained her grip and her will to live!

Such insolence! Red Hare would not stand for this, as it attempted once again to thrash around and toss Rider away. However, the tables had already turned.

&quot;Silence, you mild-mannered scum!&quot; Ching snarled, raising her leg and delivering a kick at Red Hare&#39;s stomach. The horse groveled in pain, not expecting such a sudden blow. Ching Shih used this opportunity to further climb up, until she was resting on the horse&#39;s saddle.

<em>&quot;My tendons are like strings. My pulse is like drums.&quot;</em>

Ching wrapped her arms around Red Hare&#39;s neck, gripping it into a chokehold that threatened to take its breath away. The horse neighed in pain.

<em>&quot;My breath is like a sheng&#39;s song. There is no room for such vile rhythm in my life&quot;</em>

If Red Hare wanted to thrash about, then so could she! She followed the horse&#39;s rhythm perfectly, directing her own abuse towards it as she delivered aggressive chokes, kicks, punches and scratches to get it to bend her way.

Guan Yu was amazed. He blinked for a second and saw that familiar headpiece that resembled two long roads. The Flying General had returned, for a mere instant.</span>

&quot;<em>I</em> am your master now.&quot; Ching proudly declared, wrapping Red Hare&#39;s reins around its neck as she directed it towards Guan Yu. &quot;Now go! Charge!&quot;

The horse felt almost compelled to run, as if its rebellious nature had been temporarily overcome by fear and pain. How could a human besides Guan Yu match its own rhythm?

It refused to accept that!

Despite all odds, Red Hare remained unbroken. It neighed once more as it charged forward...before purposefully slipping. It would rather die than charge into its own master.

Rider&#39;s eyes widened in surprise, as she would be launched away as well. The realization dawned upon her that she had still failed.

But she was glad. Glad that she tried. For a moment, she had escaped that feeling of despair.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, milord.&quot; She felt like crying, as she was launched away and landed a dozen feet away from Guan Yu. The chains finally broke, as Lancer could now move freely and witness his Master&#39;s own attack. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The apparitions of his previous sins made manifest attempted to drag Guan Yu further down into the abyss. Such a sight saddened the proud giant. To see so many brave and respected warriors reduced to husks crushed his heart. If he were to ever have seen them once more, he would have preferred to see them in any other form than this. 

The horrific sight was enough to cause the man to sink further as the illusions dragged him down. It seemed being sentimental towards warriors long since passed would be his downfall in this fight.

The more pain and misery this hell placed on his shoulders made him more relieved despite the encroaching darkness attempting to engulf him. The reason being that he knew that he prevented Miss Hess and Red Hare from having to endure it themselves. That would be his victory in this fight. That&#39;d be why he could hold his head up high.

But this fight is far from over! It only took a single glance to catch Red Hare fighting as if it would be their last. A critical blow was struck at Rider&#39;s back. The power of her chains were weakening as well. Perhaps there was a timer to this technique and Rider was swiftly running out of precious time. Whatever the case, now would be a great time to attempt an escape while Red Hare has Rider occupied!

Both of his hands gripped tightly onto the chains as he strained against the hold they had on him. The muscles on his body were screaming at him to stop, but he would give them no such rest! 

<strong>THUD</strong>

A loud thud was heard as Guan Yu took his first step towards acquiring freedom. Even though they were simple steps, each one demanded an immense deal of strength from the seasoned warrior. The chains dug into his flesh as he pressed onward. 

Something stopped him as he tried to escape. Something caught his eye that he couldn&#39;t believe that he was actually witnessing it for himself. Rider was attempting to tame Red Hare! What madness has overcame her to attempt such a herculean task?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The strength of the chains further weakened, but Guan Yu was too captivated by the scene of true defiance before him to take advantage right away. 

A single tear flowed down his face once he saw, albeit ever so briefly, the sight of a familiar warrior who was as defiant and stubborn as they came. There was only one who could ever tame the illustrious Red Hare. Guan Yu himself was merely granted the honour by the steed. Their True Rider was a peerless warrior who knew no equals.

And while she did not possess Lu Bu&#39;s strength, what she did possess was a spirit that would <strong>not</strong> give up! No matter the walls presented to her! Guan Yu had the utmost respect for Rider after witnessing her refusal to surrender and simply give up. 

Then it came to an end. Red Hare purposefully took a tumble and launched Rider away at the climax. To think that there was another who could even come as close as she did. 

Rider was seemingly taken out of the fight, but she left a number on both Guan Yu and Red Hare respectively. 

&quot;Rider...&quot;

Those soft words left his lips as he brought himself up from his knees after the chains disappeared. He has a few words he could like her to hear after this battle. Ones she should hear personally.

The sight of the oriental dragon leaving nothing in its wake left Guan Yu with a sense of dread once he saw his master nowhere in sight. Luckily for him, they appeared near Master of Rider. The adrenaline coursing through his artificial body forced his tired muscles to continue moving. He needed to assist his Master! 

<em><strong>&quot;Miss Hess!&quot;</strong></em> He shouted within their telepathic link as he charged towards the pair of Masters fighting with blade in hand. An echoing warcry came from his lungs as he closed the distance. If he could assist her in any way, then the pain of his tortured muscles would be an easy price to pay!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu was a talented kid. A talented kid who was born with a curse. Blessed with magic circuits the likes his family had never seen, he was thought to be a rising star the Feng Shui clan had desperately needed to revive their dying craft.

Except that he <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the one. Placed on a golden pedestal and propelled to impossible heights by the grand illusion that he was destined for greatness, all of his dreams came crashing down when he found out, after years of fruitless training, that his magic circuits, while bountiful in nature, was utterly incompatible with the system of Feng Shui.

The gap between the piled up expectations from his clan and the harsh reality was enough to drive a man mad. Kun Wu was no saint; he succumbed to the curse. Disappointment filled him. Hysteria overtook him. For days, months, <em>years</em>, he subjected himself to training in the sense of near physical torture. Gripped by guilt that he couldn&#39;t become the rising star that everyone had wanted him to be, his body responded in the only way it knew how — fight or flight, all or nothing, do or die.

...

The mighty dragon crashed into the ground like a fiery avalanche, using its impressive girth to steamroll the humanoid bugs, scattering them into the wind. Kun Wu dragged his fan in circular motions as he watched the creature respond in kind, coiling around the remaining bug clusters like a giant glowing tube. 

The sight was hilarious. It was <em>mesmerizing</em>. Flame magecraft may be commonplace and flame familiars even more so among talented mages, but how many of them were capable of controlling them with such finesse? 

His DelphiTube™️ channel had the answer. 99k subscribers, almost a full 1/20th of Delphi&#39;s population. Despite magecraft being commonplace, despite flame magecraft being the most elementary of skills that every novice with an affinity to fire should know, Kun Wu continued to wow his ever-growing audience with such a basic spell.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sometimes, simple is best. And Kun Wu took simplicity to the extreme. A show of dance and harmless fire, what was there not to like?

Kun Wu kicked off the body of his flame tiger and propelled himself away from the dragon in a straight line. As if pulling on a string to fasten a knot, the dragon tightened its body around the single remaining bug swarm - the one that had been covering Laura&#39;s body. Kun Wu&#39;s eyes shone with excitement; he wished he still had his mouth to use, so he could shout &#39;Gotcha!&#39; right in Laura&#39;s face!

The game of cat and mouse had come to an end. The last of the bugs had dispersed under the dragon&#39;s pursuit, leaving nothing in its wake...

<em>Nothing?</em>

Kun Wu&#39;s controlled breathing hitched in surprise. Even his footwork faltered for a moment as he slowed down to inspect the dragon&#39;s coil.

It was completely empty. Laura had spirited herself away!

And suddenly, it clicked. The army of humanoid bugs weren&#39;t there to <em>attack</em> him. They had been strategically constructed to <em>misdirect</em> him, so that Laura could switch place with another swarm and slip away right under his nose. The swarm &#39;wearing&#39; her clothes was only a decoy!

So where was she?

Kun Wu didn&#39;t think for a second that the girl would escape by herself. She was cunning, but not a coward. The moment that she had stepped up to place herself between Ching Shih and Guan Yu, she had proved herself to be a proud Master befitting of competing in the City Grail War.

Knowing her and her cunning, there was only one option she would take.

<em><strong>CRASH!!!</strong></em>

A humanoid figure got sent flying by Red Hare, crashing into the ground in a small crater. Red Hare was a force of nature and Rider, for all of her stubbornness, could not tame the majestic beast like she had her fleet. She lay on the ground unmoving; her dress torn in places and her body battered and broken. 

<strong>The little girl had caught the golden carp, but the golden carp was too much for her frail arms to handle.</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider&#39;s will, unbroken. Her mana, however, was dwindling like a candleflame in the wind. One by one, the chains cast from Curse of Shui Gui disappeared. The green Lancer would soon regain his freedom and reunite with his steed.

And after that?

<em>Click</em>

Out of the corner of his eye, a humanoid bug swarm stood watch over him and his flame tiger in eerie silence. Then an arm protruded from within its depth, and Laura&#39;s face followed, revealing herself from her final hiding spot. Just as Kun Wu had suspected, Lancer&#39;s Master was no coward. Instead of running away, she had dived into the thicket of battle. Armed with the only weapon her bare form had left, she was burning with an intense desire to bring her opponent down once and for all!

Armed with overflowing intel from her bugs, Laura&#39;s aim was true. With or without proper training, she had the confidence of hitting every mark without fail.

...If they were stationary targets, that is.

Even after the dragon had scattered the last bug swarm, even as he witnessed Rider&#39;s fall, Kun Wu did not stop dancing. To stop the show just because of a few slipups was disgraceful. It was the biggest disservice he could do to his audience! He would dance until his story came to a natural end!

Laura may have been little miss know-it-all. She may have watched all of Kun Wu&#39;s shows to gather intel. She may have even memorized every single one of his dance routines. But the performance she was witnessing now was nothing like before. By binding Kun Wu&#39;s hands with spider threads, she had forced Kun Wu to break out of his routines and <em>improvise</em>. 

Every move was new, every step as unpredictable to her as it was to him. Gunshot rang out as Laura pulled the trigger, but Kun Wu simply kept dancing, twisting and turning his body as the bullet whizzed past his shoulder.

Laura would need to pull her trigger many more times if she wanted to catch the nimble street performer!

But would Kun Wu give her that chance?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sometimes, it was easy to forget that Kun Wu&#39;s performance had a purpose. His words fueled his familiars. His dance puppeteer them. So long as he could speak, so long as he could move, he could dominate the battlefield with his simple, but pain-in-the-ass magecraft.

<em><strong>ROAR!</strong></em>

All this pulling and pushing with his fan enabled the dragon to catch up with them in record time. With no more room to body switch with her bug swarms, Laura&#39;s scrawny frame was ripe for the picking. The dragon coiled itself around the girl and wrapped her in its tail. Then, with a mighty pull from Kun Wu&#39;s fan, the creature lurched <strong>upwards, and carried the girl into the sky!</strong>

Laura was flying with the oriental dragon!

Except that she wasn&#39;t really <em>riding</em> it, as opposed to being lugged like an extra weight, snug and secure in its tail. Kun Wu slowed down his dance as well, foregoing all the jumping and resorting to simply pacing around the battlefield, almost as if he was taking a leisurely walk...

Until he walked right into Guan Yu.

The giant warrior blocked his path like an indominable wall. A cold aura exuded from him, making his footwork sloppy as he fought to keep his heart from jumping out of his throat. He was having a meet-and-greet with his childhood hero! How extravagant was that?!

But Guan Yu wasn&#39;t here to sign any boards. Armed with his Guan Dao, he was here to kill.

...Could he do it?

Kun Wu blinked rapidly as he challenged Guan Yu to a staring match. He chewed on his iron fan, almost deliberately so, as if to alert Guan Yu to its significance. 

Indeed, if Guan Yu had been paying attention to his magecraft, then he would know that Kun Wu, his iron fan, and his dance routine were the only things keeping the flaming dragon - as well as Laura - in the sky. So long as his dance remained uninterrupted, nothing would come to his Master.

The only thing she absolutely needed not to mess up, the one decisive move that had the potential to end the battle. Just a couple of bullets to the legs would&#39;ve been enough to stop his incessant and unpredictable movements. 

And yet, she messed it up. A powerful feeling of frustration washed over her as the pistol dropped to the floor. Deep resentment and regret towards her powerlessness and many shortcomings—a flurry of emotions overtook the young girl, leaving her awe-struck in the face of adversity. 

Her stomach dropped as the oriental dragon made its way to her, snaking its way through the battlefield until its tail found her nude body, brushing aside her bugs to pick her up and fly graciously towards the skies.

<em><strong>Miss Hess!</strong></em>

The voice sounded in her head, accompanying the images of the green dashing warrior provided by what little remained of her bugs.

She bit her lip, almost drawing blood.

<em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</em> Her quiet voice carried through the link.</span>

An apology was made to him. She spoke as if she failed, but she did more than enough to garter praise from him. <em>&quot;You have done a fine job, Miss Hess. I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;</em> Genuine pride flowed through Guan Yu which only worked to further fuel his charge! 

Kun Wu saw as the famed general charged at him with intent of finish him off. His blade threatened to cleave the young man in two with ease. The blade was swung and aimed straight for his head. A loud ringing came from the blade as it sliced through the air towards its target. 

A quick and painless end to the Wielder of Flames. Was this the end of Rider and Kun Wu&#39;s journey? To challenge Lancer only to fall short of slaying Rider&#39;s boogeyman? It would appear so...

Guan Yu stared into Kun Wu&#39;s eyes. There was an understanding in his eyes. Guan Yu knew that, with Red Hare out of commission, he couldn&#39;t reach Laura in time to save her from her descent should he slay Master of Rider. He was the only thing keeping her alive.

A smirk slowly formed his face as the tension in their intense duel of stares faded. &quot;I do believe this is checkmate, isn&#39;t it, Master of Rider?&quot; Guan Yu eased his body and withdrew his weapon. &quot;Allow me to commend you and Rider for your splendid display of bravery. You fought well.&quot; The towering warrior gave Kun Wu a nod of respect. He could bow instead actually. That was more fitting, but his body would curse him for overexerting himself so much already. 

With precision worthy of a surgeon, Guan Yu released Kun Wu&#39;s arms using his guandao to grant him the ability to use his Magecraft and speak once again!

&quot;Now, if you could return my Master to me, I have a proposition I would like to run by you and Rider. Perhaps during a well-deserved feast?&quot; The man who just attempted to kill him was now offering a feast?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Guan Yu&#39;s strike was swift was lightning. Kun Wu didn&#39;t even have time to perceive the blade, before the green Lancer swung it dangerously close to his face. A few strands of hair met an unfortunate end as they came into contact with the blade, and Kun Wu&#39;s knees almost buckled as he rubbed shoulders with death.

Emphasis on <em>almost</em>.

In the end, his hyperactivity saved him from humiliating himself in front of his childhood hero. Having worked up a sweat and thoroughly loosened his joints, he took a faltering step back, settling into a sloppy horse stance before steadying himself. 

Lancer&#39;s next strike soon followed, but it was much gentler in comparison, slicing his binds with pinpoint precision and freeing his arms without so much as leaving a scratch on his clothes. Despite being opponents fighting to the death just now, Guan Yu showed him an act of kindness without a moment&#39;s hesitation.

Kun Wu was more than happy to be with his arms again, and even happier for his mouth to finally be free of his iron fan. He rubbed his cheeks, which had long since numbed rom clenching his weapon for so long.

As Kun Wu worked hard to unfreeze his jaw, Guan Yu withdrew his blade and reconciled with a proposition to free Laura from his flaming dragon. He spoke as if the match had been decided, and he had every reason to believe so: Rider had been incapacitated, and Kun Wu had Laura in a bind. If Guan Yu and Kun Wu continued to butt heads against once another...

Kun Wu would, without a doubt, perish on the spot. But the moment that he did, Laura&#39;s fate would be sealed as well. In the end, Guan Yu alone would be the victor.

...It was not the future that he had envisioned.

It was also not the future that Kun Wu had envisioned. A lose-lose scenario was not the reason he had tracked down Lancer and his Master.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Guan Yu&#39;s words resonated with him. The invitation sounded heavenly, and he could already imagine them laughing and drinking and making merry, the scars of battle forgotten at the bottom of the wine barrel!

...But he couldn&#39;t bring himself to do that. Not yet.

&#39;Guan Yu, Mr. Door Guardian, sir. Your proposal is splendid. I, too, would love nothing more than a feast with my idol.&#39; He returned Guan Yu&#39;s nod with a bow, slamming his right fist into his left palm in an old-fashioned salute as a form of utmost respect. But then he straightened his back, and regarded Guan Yu through the eyes of not a fanboy, but a Master.

&#39;Unfortunately, I cannot release your Master just yet. I may know you from bedtime stories and history books, but I can&#39;t say that I understand you. The you who have been summoned as someone else&#39;s Servant, that is. Your Master is quite the crafty one, and my Rider is out of commission. How do I know that you won&#39;t slice me in half the moment I bring your Master back to you?&#39;

&#39;<strong>I need an insurance.</strong>&#39; He continued, turning the table on Guan Yu as he voiced his own demands. &#39;Something more tangible than words. Something more <em>consequential</em>.&#39; His eyes flitted to Rider&#39;s broken body, and his eyes hardened.

&#39;<strong>Lancer, I want you to—</strong>&#39; 

--- --- ---

&#39;<em>—commit suicide.</em>&#39;

<em>History flashed behind Guan Yu&#39;s eyes. The end of his era, the humiliation suffered by him and him alone. He had manifested in the material world once again so that he could challenge fate and rewrite history...but was this a mission doomed to fail? Had he been cursed to repeat history again and again?</em>

<em>Perhaps, a swift death by his Guandao was too merciful for Rider&#39;s Master...</em>

--- --- ---

‘<strong>—perform for me.</strong>&#39; 

<em>...Did he hear that right?</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu finished his sentence. For once, he looked a little sheepish, as if he was aware that he had just asked something completely inane. Guan Yu, Guardian of Temples, degrading himself to nothing more than entertainment for an opposing Master?

Kun Wu cleared his throat and spoke louder.

&#39;Show me your best moves. The skills that earned you the title of War God of the three kingdoms period. I want you to <em>entertain</em> me with everything you&#39;ve got. Of course, by entertainment, I mean that <strong>I want you to completely deplete your mana, to the point that you can&#39;t harm me or Rider without going back to the Throne. And I will know that you&#39;re exhausted, because I&#39;ve seen the symptoms on Rider enough times to know what to look for.</strong>&#39;

As a gesture of good faith, he weaved his fan through the air and guided the dragon to perch at the rooftop of a dilapidated building, saving Laura from the danger of falling to an early death.

&#39;Do that, and I will bring your Master back, safe and sound. I won&#39;t ask you to trust me, because I know you are more than capable to putting that Guandao through my heart even at your weakest...&#39; 

Though his words were cold, Kun Wu unexpectedly...tugged his phone out of his waist sash. 

&#39;...And let me record it!&#39; He added with a fervor that was quite unbecoming of a Master.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">From a deadly confrontation into an invitation to a buffet—Guan Yu often blurred the line between enjoyment and battle, often jumping from one to another with little to no transition. It didn&#39;t help that his opponents were deemed <em>worthy</em>, as confirmed by his still guandao and his signature smirk.

With but a few words and a quick exchange of friendly gestures, the tension that had built up in the course of the battle was cleared, much like how Kun Wu&#39;s dragon cleared the battlefield from the deafening insects and the swarm clones.

Said dragon finally came to a stop as it reached the peak of a tilted building, letting the young girl escape from its clutches as it rested nobly atop. Free of his clutches, feeling the cold air of the Underbelly brush against her delicate and exposed skin, she couldn&#39;t help but redden a fraction. Even as her undergarments still stood, even as she was currently a few hundred meters away from the three—an unavoidable wave of discomfort and embarrassment washed over her.

But those silly feelings came to a halt as she heard the boy&#39;s words.

<em>I want you to completely deplete your mana.</em>

The tension came back, stronger than ever. The damning realisation that she was now used as a bargaining chip for Kun Wu and Rider to escape from her Servant, perhaps even finish him off as soon as he did the unthinkable—Laura felt her stomach drop once more.

The only thing that kept her panic at bay was going through her available options.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Escaping from the dragon was no-go, he was much faster and more agile than she was. She wasn&#39;t athletic enough to drop on a lower floor by hanging from the ruined building&#39;s edge, either. Would she survive a fall if she was to jump off? She couldn&#39;t judge the distance to the ground very well, but it was certain that a fall from this height would break some bones <em>at the very least</em>. She would just succeed in injuring herself before the oriental dragon descended to pick her up once more...

Nothing.

As it stood, not a single option was realistically doable. She wouldn&#39;t, <em>couldn&#39;t</em> influence the tide of battle in her state. 

Guan Yu was a stubborn as a mule. Knowing him, he would go through with the boy&#39;s outrageous demand no matter what. She couldn&#39;t hope to influence him by merely asking not to cooperate with the enemy.

No, she had to speak with the man himself.</span>

&quot;Wait a god damn second.&quot; 

A flat voice came from the small swarm, incredibly warped yet familiar somehow. It sounded faint, almost inaudible due to the lack of cohesion that the insects had.

&quot;You can&#39;t possibly ask something like that with a straight face. How do I know if you won&#39;t take advantage of Guan Yu&#39;s good nature? What if you&#39;re planning on-&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His smile only beamed brighter once he heard Master of Rider seemed to have accepted his proposal, though this smile faded slightly as they continued.

Insurance? It made sense after all. They had no reason to believe Guan Yu besides his words alone. Trust needed to be formed between both parties. But what was the price he had to pay to ensure his Master&#39;s safety?

For a split second his fate was sealed. He saw unknown specters of the past subjected to the same fate. Was this some unknown curse that must be upheld? Was it his turn to meet such a fate? This sensation didn&#39;t last long fortunately as his arrival back to his world came to a blunt stop.

<em>&quot;The boy wants me to perform?...&quot;</em> He thought to himself as if to make sure he heard those words correctly. 

To secure his trust, all he needed to do was to preform for him. The various waves of confusion was visible on his face. 

The next thing that came from him is another boisterous laughter. One that rang true throughout the Underbelly. This must have been the hardest he has laughed since his summoning. To think he got tensed up for a request such as that! 

&quot;You wish to for me to delete my mana reserves completely? That&#39;s your demand? Master of Rider, you are a weird one indeed! But, I haven&#39;t met a Master so far that isn&#39;t at least a tad bit strange after all.&quot; His gaze turned to his Master once she was set upon a roof for safety. Did he just take a jab at her? 

He was worried that she heard him when she formed a body to speak with them, but those worries were mute once she voiced her concerns. Before she continued to ramble on, Guan Yu held up a hand to stop her in her tracks. His gentle smile gave her comfort. The man wasn&#39;t worried in the slightest! &quot;Trust in me, Miss Hess.&quot; Such simple words carried quite the weight to them. He wanted her to trust in his abilities as he did hers.

I shall grant you the honour, Young Master, of being the first to witness the true strength of my fabled blade!&quot;</strong> Guan Yu gave Kun Wu&#39;s shoulder a friendly pat that might have dislocated something if he was just a bit less careful with his strength.

He turned away from him and glanced over his shoulder to speak with him one last time. &quot;You have one chance at this. Make sure you acquire the best shot lest you squander your opportunity.&quot; He gave him a wink and a smirk. Normally, he would be against someone filming his secret technique but there was something about Kun Wu&#39;s passion that got to him. He couldn&#39;t help but give the Young Master a gift like this! How could he not?

With those words, he walked over to Red Hare who was resting where they landed. Such a hearty beast to be alive still! He wouldn&#39;t doubt if the beast sported an Endurance greater than he did. 

&quot;Would you grant me your strength, my friend?&quot; Guan Yu spoke softly to the steed as he kneeled to comfort them. Guan Yu was unable to call his greatest move solely his own. It was only possible due to the bond he shared with the legendary beast.

Despite the wounds, Red Hare stood up. The cuts and scrapes from Rider&#39;s assault coated its body, much like their Rider. Swiftly, Guan Yu got and reared the horse before taking off down the main street. He was still slightly visible once he stopped and turned around. He needed the run-up to gain the momentum needed to pull this off.

&quot;I call upon your strength once more, Great Beast of Old!&quot; The area that surrounded him pulsed with power. It was as if something was awakening. &quot;Strike my opponents down with your divine might! Tear their bodies asunder and reduce them to ash!&quot;

<strong>&quot;Green Dragon Crescent Blade! Awaken!&quot;</strong>

The surge of mana formed around them as Red Hare took off racing down the ruins of the street. Guan Yu held his weapon out in front as he held onto the reins. The blade craved a path forward as the pair rode together. Laura felt as half of her mana was drained for this True Name Release as well.

Soon the mana surging around them turned a brilliant green that illuminated the dark underbelly. A simple colour change wasn&#39;t the only transformation that took place! No! Kun Wu saw a familiar sight mere moments after the green light appeared. The massive amounts of mana transformed into the shape of an enormous green dragon of oriental descent with Guan Yu and Red Hare visible within the head of its translucent body.

The dragon tore up the ground, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The speed was just as impressive as Red Hare was pressed beyond their limits. The speeds they went capped around 200km/h. The overexertion of Red Hare&#39;s muscles and the massive amount of mana needed to pull this off was a steep price to pay, but one neither had any qualms paying!

The force of the wind carried debris along with them as they rode towards their target. A column holding up the overpass above. It was thick and covered top to bottom with graffiti aplenty. It was no easy feat to break, and yet when Guan Yu collided with it, the column shattered into countless pieces and reduced them to mere ash in the air as if they ran through mere paper.

This was the full might of the Taoist God of War!

Green steam emitted from both of them as they appeared to have ran a marathon while out of breath from the start. They were completely depleted. It was thanks to Laura&#39;s bond with him that he could still operate at a decent level.

Guan Yu fell to his knees once he attempted to dismount but luckily he caught himself. The marking upon his blade still burned as it slowly cooled off from using the technique. A bedazzling finale to their fight! He could only hope it was enough for Kun Wu.

&quot;So...About that proposal I told you about.&quot; The man smirked at them. An immeasurable  sense of pride oozed from this man as he caught his breath.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider lied on the ground for a few minutes. Her energy reserves were spent due to continuous use of her Noble Phantasm, not to mention the exhaustion and damage she had accumulated throughout her struggles with Red Hare.

Regardless, she was still a Servant. Human concepts such as tiredness and injuries applied only at a surface level to them. She woke up soon enough, while it would have taken the average human around 6 months to fully recover from that assault.

When she awakened, her eyes immediately darted at all sides. What Guan Yu still around? Had she been killed? What was the outcome of the fight?

Whatever happened to Kun Wu?

She then felt a powerful force surrounding her as she witnessed Guan Yu&#39;s display of power, his almighty Noble Phantasm, being activated right next to Kun Wu. She immediately assumed the worst and felt the urge to scream, but would be surprised to find Lancer miss his target. <em>By a lot.</em>

His usage of mana seemed wasteful, even. He kept directing blows towards the empty air, causing his reserves to gradually dry out. Once he was empty, he simply stood still and stared at Kun Wu with a grin on his face. The boy smiled back. It was like a performance.</span>

That&#39;s when it clicked to her, and she sighed with relief. Despite looking like a scheming brat, Kun Wu had something about him that allowed him to approach others with ease. Not even Lancer could escape from his shrewd plans.

Guan Yu looked exhausted. It was a miracle he was still standing, and even more impressive that he had kept his Noble Phantasm up for several minutes. In comparison, Ching&#39;s own reserves were like a drop in a bucket.

She reflected on that for a moment, before dropping this line of thought for now. Instead, she approached the two victors.

&quot;That was a magnificent display, Lord Guan Yu.&quot; Ching said. &quot;I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed it with my own two eyes. The books pale in comparison to the real thing.&quot; She added, before delivering an elegant bow.

&quot;And I thank you for sparing my Master. I owe you quite the sizable favor it seems.&quot; Ching admitted, before turning towards Kun Wu and delivering her trademark pinches to his cheek.

&quot;Are you alright? Any injuries I should know of?&quot; She asked with a worried tone.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Guan Yu&#39;s boisterous laughter echoed all around him. It was bombastic, <em>infectious</em>, and in an instant, Kun Wu&#39;s thoughts were snatched away. He imagined himself standing alongside the General as they were about to spearhead their troops into an enemy fray. Oh, to think that he&#39;d be granted the honor of fighting with the War God himself!

In what alternate reality could he make it happen? If only they weren&#39;t enemies, if only they weren&#39;t destined to shed blood against each other for that coveted honor of winning the City Grail War. If only he had met Laura and Lancer under ordinary circumstances, perhaps he could even recruit them into his team! 

The dream lasted but a moment. But it was a good dream. Kun Wu beamed at Guan Yu.

&#39;I&#39;d like think myself as a <em>pro</em>. Not weird. Just professional.&#39; He insisted as he waved his phone about. &#39;You won&#39;t find a steadier pair of hands in all of Delphi when it comes to shooting videos on the move! I will capture you and Red Hare in all of your glory, so you better not hold back.&#39;

He meant it both as a request from a fanboy and a threat from a Master, but Guan Yu already knew. Honor was in his blood, and he wouldn&#39;t stoop so low as to go back on his words now of all times.

Unless, of course, his Master insisted otherwise. 

A swarm of bugs rose up next to Lancer, flapping their wings collectively and trying their damnedest to produce a string of coherent sounds out of their warped form. Laura had heard the exchange of demands between the two, and she obviously did not like it. She immediately questioned Kun Wu on his motives, but this time, it was her own Servant who cut in and reassured her that everything would be okay.

Guan Yu trusted Laura. But did he trust Kun Wu? What did he see in the youth that had put his mind at ease?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;You know, that&#39;s a very good question you&#39;ve just asked.&#39; Kun Wu slinked next to the bug swarm as Guan Yu rode off into the distance to prepare his impromptu performance. &#39;I <em>could</em> yell about it on my socials and let all my followers play witness, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re one for attention like I am! So frankly, I&#39;ve got nothing but a bag of hope that Guan Yu would make sure to catch you should I decide to pull a fast one on you both. Knowing him, knowing his legend, I have no doubt that he will be able to do that <em>and</em> condemn me at the same time.&#39; 

He pressed the record button on his phone as Guan Yu started his chant. A verdant storm descended upon him and Red Hare and mana coalesces, then exploded around them, tearing up stone and concrete as it transformed into a green oriental dragon.

Compared to Guan Yu&#39;s Noble Phantasm, Kun Wu&#39;s own dragon was as meek as an earthworm. Wind picked up as Guan Yu&#39;s dragon thrashed the Underbelly, and Kun Wu had to fight hard to keep his hands from shaking.

&#39;You really should place more confidence in his skills.&#39; He told Laura&#39;s bug swarm. &#39;No amount of tricks I pull can bail me and Rider out if he really wanted us dead. I bet you&#39;ve never even watched all 140 episodes of the Legend of Guan Yu. As someone who did, I can assure you that all the special effects in the show don&#39;t hold a candle to what you&#39;re seeing right now! So why don&#39;t we stand back and enjoy the show? If you want, you can even climb up my dragon and watch it from the sky.&#39;

--- --- ---

Next to Laura, Kun Wu&#39;s flame dragon awoke with a start. It dipped its head in front of the girl, as if waiting for her to climb on, properly this time. Kun Wu was giving her the option to ride the dragon back. 

Would she accept the invitation? Could she trust Kun Wu&#39;s words like Lancer had done? Or would she simply ride the dragon, trusting that Lancer would always have her back no matter what happened?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What lasted a few minutes felt like an eternity. Guan Yu stayed true to his words, sparing no resources as he led both Red Hare and the green dragon around the Underbelly, causing mayhem as they charged and thrashed and whipped about the abandoned buildings like a raging tempest. 

Kun Wu could watch this all day. But all good things must come to an end. Eventually, Guan Yu&#39;s mana reserved dried up. Unable to maintain his dragon without sucking Laura dry, Guan Yu simply let it go. With heavy steps he rode back to Kun Wu. Exhausted but exuberant and more importantly, curious to see how the seasoned street performer would judge his performance.

Instead he found that his audience had <em>doubled</em>. Rider was back on her feet. Battered, but alive, and she readily showered him in praise. Kun Wu, on the other hand, fiddled around for something in his pockets. 

When Rider turned to her Master, what would greet her were not the soft cheeks that she had grown accustomed to pinching out of habit, but rather a pair of gloved hands. One of them grabbed onto her jaw, forcing her mouth open, while the other shoved a few mana batteries in. 

&#39;I don&#39;t have water, so you&#39;ll have to make do without.&#39; Kun Wu closed her mouth and gave her a few pats on the cheek. Then he turned to Guan Yu, and offered him the same pills as well.

&#39;Care for some mana batteries?&#39; He asked the green Lancer, unaware that he no longer sourced his mana from them. &#39;I rate that performance a 100 out of 10! Did that dragon come out of your <em>blade</em>? I can&#39;t even make anything half as big!...Hmm.&#39; 

He rubbed his chin and pondered.

&#39;No, I <em>could</em> do it if I had more time to charge up. Maybe on a good day. Color is the hardest part. I would need a large amount of copper on demand...Rider, what is your anchor made of?&#39; He looked at Rider like he was looking at a bag of gold.</span>

&quot;Thank you, Madame Ching.&quot; He returned the bow Rider gave him. His muscles strained and ached as he did, but he wanted to pay proper respects to someone like her. &quot;Worry not, it was a just duel after all! Duels don&#39;t always have to result in the death of the other!&quot; He winked as if that was his plan all along. It wasn&#39;t in the beginning, but plans change!

&quot;Rider. Allow me to say that I am truly honoured to be in the presence of someone of your stature. I can see that the Throne chose wisely.&quot; Guan Yu spoke as he kneeled for Rider. &quot;Your strength and determination was truly legendary to behold!&quot;

As he got up, he was offered Mana batteries from Kun Wu. Such a kind lad. A wave of his hand and he dismissed the offer. He no longer needed them thanks to Laura. &quot;Thanks, but I receive my mana directly from Miss Hess now, Master of Rider. Those won&#39;t be necessary.&quot;

Kun Wu&#39;s continued enthusiasm was impressive. Not even a tsunami could snuff out the flames of his passion! &quot;Why yes, the dragon came from my blade. There is a legend that you might like to hear if you care to listen. I might not be a seasoned storyteller like you, but I can sure try!&quot;

&quot;Mmmph!&quot; Ching&#39;s gag reflexes kicked in as she almost started to choke on the tablets, being too distracted to even keep pinching at the boy. She was forced to gulp them down in one go, panting heavily afterwards as she felt her strength start to return.

&quot;You should have warned me! And why are you-&quot; She spouted in a rage, not only angry at her treatment but also at the fact that Kun Wu was giving Lancer more fuel for the fire. Of course, she immediately stopped once she realized that this could instigate another fight.

&quot;...being so kind and generous all of a sudden?&quot; She gave a light giggle and ruffled Kun Wu&#39;s hair, giving him a few pats along the way. Not that the boy couldn&#39;t tell her true intentions...

Instead, she focused on another thing of note: Guan Yu&#39;s last statement.

&quot;Miss Hess? Wait, she supplies your mana on her own? I thought that was impossible unless the Servant and the Master bond-&quot; She put two and two together. So that&#39;s why Guan Yu was able to keep his Noble Phantasm active for so long.

<em>&quot;...I&#39;m being left behind.&quot;</em> Fears and worries started squirming their way into her head, before she shook them off and tried her best to maintain a warm smile.

&quot;How bold. To think that the great hero of China found a Master worth bonding with.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The young girl had collapsed. A feeling not unlike that of the fight against Lord Brandin and the crazed monk. Born in a genuine Magus family, blessed with solid magical circuits and respectable Mana capacity—even then, it wasn&#39;t enough to keep steady after the use of his powerful Noble Phantasm. She felt her insides stirring, her life-force forcefully extracted from her fragile body through the link that connected them. Truth be told, the only reason she was able to handle the after blow at all was purely due to <em>experience</em>, having been drained dry of her magical energy once before.

Her wheezing and quickened pulse aside, the less-than-advantageous position at the top of the dilapidated building didn&#39;t let her enjoy the beauty and strength of the warrior&#39;s Noble Phantasm to the fullest.

But even more distracting was the state her feelings were left in. The countless praise that the warrior sung for his Master thus far couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. The fight had ended in a stalemate, forced purely by her incompetence and lack of strength. Her first real fight had concluded with an overwhelming defeat to the hands of the Feng-Shui artist.

She wanted to scream, thrash and cry over this shameful performance. Being pitied by an opponent which hadn&#39;t even showed the full extent of his powers. <em>Unable to shoot someone in the back.</em> What a joke of a Master, she was. 

Yet, in a very gentlemanly move, Kun Wu had proposed her to ride atop his dragon puppet and experience Guan Yu&#39;s performance from her own two eyes, leaving the sad scenery that the ruined building procured to witness it from the skies.

Her head was a mess. Mixed between frustration and sadness, anger and regret, and a whole lot more—she wanted nothing more than to be left alone at this moment. Exhausted both physically and mentally, the young girl stared at the dragon&#39;s frame with an uncaring, incredibly tired expression.

She indulged in the momentary pleasure, finding her way to the dragon&#39;s neck and tightly clenching it with both arms and legs. Soon, the dragon lifted once more, gently rising in the sky and snaking its way towards the green light that punched through concrete like a spoon through jelly.

Frankly, she didn&#39;t enjoy brawny shows of strength at all. Hell, you could say that she <em>utterly despised</em> violence, and even fighting in general.

Yet, her eyes kept following the green light that rampaged across the dim Underbelly, watching the scene unfold with a mixture of regret and child-like curiosity. Like a satellite slowly crossing the starry skies, shining brighter than any star amongst the void of space. The powerful sounds that rose from it mellowed out when arriving within the dragon&#39;s altitude and transformed into quiet whispers that gave the scene a surprisingly relaxing mood.

In a moment that lasted mere seconds, her horizons broadened like never before and her worries all but disappeared.

<em>It was beautiful.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Perhaps due to their commander&#39;s exhaustion, or because of the young boy&#39;s soothing words—the swarm slowly calmed down and regained its composure bit by bit.

&quot;...I know that already, dumbass.&quot; Finally retorted the swarm to Kun Wu&#39;s words, very candidly. &quot;I have the utmost confidence in his abilities. I know how hard he slaps, I <em>am</em> his Master, after all.&quot;

The words hang in the air as the insects collectively turned to witness the aftermath of his grand performance. It was grandiose, awe-inspiring, befitting of a grand man such as himself.

&quot;...But,&quot; It spoke again, taking a pause before continuing. &quot;Seeing him constantly push his body to his utmost limits, setting aside any and all care that he might have for his well-being, swinging that big ol&#39; blade of his even as his muscles scream in pain—it hurts to see. <em>It fucking hurts</em>.&quot;

Although the swarm&#39;s speech lacked any inflections and didn&#39;t portray tone or nuances in pitch, Kun Wu could easily deduce that the girl behind it was taking those words straight from her heart. It took a special kind of courage to be this sincere, to talk so genuinely to an enemy she had barely made peace with.

<em>&quot;And it hurts even more when I&#39;m the reason why he pushes himself so hard.&quot;</em>

An oversight. Words that the swarm wished it hadn&#39;t spoken.

Words that rang truer and more sincere than any others spoken thus far.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The oriental dragon finally found its way to the ground after much flying around, letting Laura hop off its back to finally meet the ground. Her shaky legs almost crumbled due to the fall&#39;s shock, a reminder that she had pushed herself like never before in that last fight. 

Conveniently, the dragon had landed a couple hundred meters away from the three, leaving Laura the occasion to dress up her nude body before reuniting with them.

Much like a Disney princess receiving aid from various small animals to get into a frilly dress, Laura&#39;s swarm carried her clothes over and helped her get into them while she nonchalantly walked through the battlefield.

Once again, her scrawny physique was covered in loose clothes. The flight atop Kun Wu&#39;s puppet eased the tension that had built up in her head, and it seemed like Guan Yu was getting along just fine with the two ex-opponents.

Her previously cathartic expression mellowed out, her face muscles relaxing as she reached the group just in time to overhear a <em>peculiar statement</em>.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing to fuss about,&quot; The young girl spoke smugly, emerging from behind Guan Yu. &quot;Bonding is <em>just</em> a natural consequence when a Master and his Servant attain peak understanding and compatibility, after all.&quot;

Matching Rider&#39;s warm smile with a proud smile of her own, the young girl eyed the mature woman and her Master curiously. 

&quot;What, did you guys not bond yet?&quot; Accompanying her words was a shocked expression, perhaps a bit over-the-top. &quot;But I thought... I kept seeing you act all buddy-buddy, pinching cheeks and left and right... Oh dear, did I misunderstand?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A tale straight from the legendary Guan Yu himself? Kun Wu was smitten with the idea, and it showed on his face. He smiled, eyes narrowing into mere slits. 

&#39;I would love to.&#39; He said, pocketing the mana batteries that Guan Yu had refused. &#39;There is nothing better than hearing a tale straight from the source! I&#39;ll have to grab my pen and paper. This&#39;ll be excellent material for my plays as well-&#39;

He was pulled aside by Ching Shih, who had finally started to recover after being force fed a dose of mana batteries that was several times the quantity required by a normal Servant. Fortunately, her Master was quite well-off, but that didn&#39;t mean he could give the batteries away willy-nilly!

She covered up her dismay with doting looks, but Kun Wu was used to her antics. He knew what she was thinking. 

&#39;I&#39;m always kind and generous.&#39; He said earnestly. &#39;But I will always be the most kind and generous to you, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about!&#39; He let Rider release her pent-up frustration on his hair, turning the once tidy locks into something resembling a bird&#39;s nest. Meanwhile, he kept up his end of the bargain, guiding his flame dragon back down to the ground with his iron fan. 

It didn&#39;t take long for Laura to regain her bearings. When she rejoined the group, she was already back to being her snarky self. In that, she and Ching Shih shared common ground. A spark was all it took to start a fire, and she and Rider both were quite proficient at generating those sparks. Even Kun Wu, the resident flame wielder, paled in comparison.

He listened to Laura&#39;s relentless prodding. Rider&#39;s soured mood did not escape him, but, well...

&#39;It&#39;s true.&#39; He sighed, folding his arms and looking pensive. &#39;Rider and I have yet to bond. I think she&#39;s shy.&#39; He took a jab at Ching Shih, but then he cracked open his eyes and smiled, no, <em>smirked</em>, his lips quirking upwards as he regarded Lancer&#39;s Master with an air of playfulness.

After all, this place doesn&#39;t seem like a place worthy for a feast.&quot; One look was all one needed to see that the Underbelly would be the last place anyone would suggest for such a celebration! 

&quot;Why, thank you, Madame Ching. It was a large and risky step, but I do not regret my choice in the slightest.&quot; As he said that, he turned to face Laura to give her a kind smile. His words carried the utmost sincerity with them.

It didn&#39;t take long for his Master&#39;s sharp tongue to attempt to find new targets once she arrived. He shook his head while letting out a short chuckle at the jabs being thrown. She was beaten fair and square and she still had some fight in her! That&#39;s the spirit! Perhaps something he shouldn&#39;t be encouraging given that they still needed to secure an alliance, but he knew he couldn&#39;t stop her if he wanted to.  Such is the nature of his Master.

&quot;Would it now? I&#39;m almost tempted to see if that&#39;d be true or not.&quot; Guan Yu&#39;s battle-lust flared up again. He turned to Kun Wu with a wide grin on his face once he mentioned that the fight could have been even closer, maybe even ending with a Rider victory. The thought was exciting if they fought this hard without a bond! 

Master of Rider posed a good question that stopped his line of thought regarding possible battle outcomes. <strong>Did</strong> she know about the risks? He simply assumed she did so even he didn&#39;t know. His gaze returned back to Laura as his curious stare came upon her, as if awaiting her answer.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Taken aback from the sudden flurry of stares directed at her, Laura slowly shrugged her shoulders.

&quot;I did know about the risks involved,&quot; The young girl admitted with a sigh. &quot;But I don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve changed anything if I didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I mean,&quot; She explained herself, scratching the back of her neck in thought. &quot;Bonding just sort of happens when you really get along with your Servant, right? Didn&#39;t matter if I knew or not, pretty sure it would&#39;ve happened regardless.&quot;

She returned Guan Yu&#39;s smile with one of her own, albeit more reserved and sheepish than his.

&quot;As for the outcome of the fight if you had bonded,&quot;

Soon, her sheepish smile turned confident once again, a glimpse of her past self emerging at the surface. She grabbed her Servant&#39;s arm, squeezing his tight muscles as if showcasing his strength, not unlike a car salesman slapping the roof of a car to show its sturdiness. No matter how hard she squeezed, the muscles didn&#39;t budge an inch. A statement to their incredible solidity, or more realistically to Laura&#39;s blatant lack of grip strength.

&quot;...Come on, do I <em>really</em> have to spell it out for you?&quot;

A playful expression, akin to that of Kun Wu&#39;s. In keeping with her previous statements, her words carried perfectly her opinion in regards to his abilities—an unshakeable confidence.</span>

I&#39;m truly a fortunate woman.&quot; She said gently, scratching at Kun Wu&#39;s head to the point that the boy felt like his hair was being plucked.

Thankfully, her rage subsided once Laura accosted the group. She did a great job at presenting herself as an alternative target, since she immediately started flaunting Guan Yu&#39;s superiority and mocking Rider and Kun Wu&#39;s relationship.

<em>&quot;You little-&quot;</em> Ching had a few choice words reserved for the young lady, until Kun Wu spoke over her and admitted Rider&#39;s flaws.

<em>&quot;Milord! Not you too!&quot;</em> She cried inside, not muttering a word, but her gaze made it apparent that she felt betrayed. Of course, Kun Wu was shrewd enough to repurpose the question in order to show Rider in a more positive light.

That vote of confidence was soon overwritten by Laura&#39;s boasting, who had complete confidence in her Servant. Ching Shih felt like a vein would pop. This comparison of Servants was pointless and ridiculous...yet she couldn&#39;t stop herself from getting involved!</span>

&quot;Well,&quot; Ching Shih laughed at Laura flexing Guan Yu&#39;s muscles. &quot;I will admit that Lord Guan Yu does his legend justice. As a Chinese Servant, I can&#39;t help but admire him. However, <strong>don&#39;t forget that Masters exist.</strong>&quot;

She swiftly placed her arms underneath Kun Wu&#39;s armpits and picked him up for all to see.

&quot;Behold, the one who defeated you. Bond or no bond, I have complete faith in milord&#39;s superiority towards you. He gave a pretty good demonstration right now, did he not?&quot; Ching raised the boy even higher, making it so even Guan Yu could see him at eye level. She seemed incredibly proud of her Master, for once.

&quot;Regardless, a draw is a draw. I admit that we weren&#39;t fully capable of defeating you.&quot; She sighed as she slowly lowered Kun Wu to the ground. 

&quot;But if you have the best possible Servant in existence, then I can assure you that I have the <strong>best possible Master in existence.</strong>&quot; She proudly declared, tugging at Kun Wu&#39;s heartstrings.

She then proceeded to tap at his shoulder and whisper in his ear. <em>&quot;You owe me a free lunch.

Ching Shih picked him up like a lion cub and put him on display between the Lancer pair, as if he were some rare commodity. As much as he reveled in her praises, he didn&#39;t feel so invincible when his feet were dangling above the ground.

Thankfully, Rider didn&#39;t plan to keep him on display for too long. After a brief showcase, she released him and proceeded to extort free meals from him! Kun Wu almost facepalmed.

&#39;You know that what&#39;s mine is yours.&#39; He told Rider, wondering when had been the last time he and Rider enjoyed a meal together. The past few days had gone by in a flash as he busied himself with playing detective. He couldn&#39;t even recall the meals he had eaten!

He <em>could</em> go for a feast right now. With Rider, Lancer, and...even miss little informant, for all the snark she embodied.

&#39;Ahem.&#39; Kun Wu gathered his thoughts and turned to look at Laura. &#39;You know, you are actually pretty nice.&#39; He said bluntly, shattering the image the girl had been trying to build for herself. 

Bonding was a two way street, but it didn&#39;t just happen because a Master and Servant were compatible. Otherwise, Servant auctions and black markets would cease to exist. During his research behind Rider&#39;s back, Kun Wu had read plenty of cases where a Master <em>refused</em> to bond with a Servant. Some held back in case they wanted to switch them out for a better unit, and some simply wanted to grant a little more freedom to their Servants. Regardless of the reason, bonding was quite uncommon among ordinary Master and Servant pairs. Even the New World&#39;s public database held scant few records that were actually useful for his research.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Though they weren&#39;t exactly in an <em>ordinary</em> situation right now, considering they were currently in the middle of a City Grail War. Plenty of Masters would grow desperate, and desperation begets drastic measures. Compared to losing or, worse, dying, perhaps bonding was not so bad.

Was Laura desperate? Or...

<em>&#39;—And it hurts even more when I&#39;m the reason why he pushes himself so hard.&#39;</em>

&#39;You did it for him, didn&#39;t you?&#39; He asked knowingly.. &#39;You&#39;ve got a sharp tongue, but a big soft heart. Sounds like someone I know quite well.&#39; He added cheekily, then turned to address Lancer next.

&#39;If you want a rematch, I say bring it on! But instead of a test of strength, how about we do it <em>my</em> way this time? History has it that you are a good drinker, but wines from the Three Kingdoms period were a lot weaker compared to what we have now. So, Mr. Door Guardian. How well can you hold your liquor against modern day alcohol?&#39; 

He pitched the question to Guan Yu, quite provocatively so, as if it were a challenge. Guan Yu wouldn&#39;t back down from a challenge now, would he?

&#39;And here&#39;s an extra bit of motivation for you. Let&#39;s <em>bet</em> on it.&#39; He raised his hand, and pointed first at the Lancer pair, then at himself. &#39;If I win, then you both do a joint performance with me in the CBD. If you win, somehow, even though I doubt it,&#39; he wagged his fingers, &#39;Rider and I will answer to a single request of similar scale from you.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was quite amusing to see the Rider pair interacting so closely together. One might seen their chemistry as too mixed to work properly, but they managed to meld theirs so well with each other. It really showed through during their fight.

Then he heard something curious that caught his attention.

<em>&#39;You did it for him, didn&#39;t you?&#39;</em>

Those simple words made him glance at Laura as if to gauge her response. A soft smile replaced his curious look. It was heartwarming indeed to see just how much she cared about him. A mechanical shell of warrior from ages past. This only served to solidify his decision to bond with her even further! 

After that came the glorious request for the rematch! 

His sentimental demeanor was overshadowed rather quickly once Master of Rider challenged him. 

&quot;A drinking match, huh? I may be no Zhang Fei, but I served as my brother&#39;s drinking partner on more than one occasion so don&#39;t think me to be a novice, Master of Rider! Be it modern alcohol or not, I will hold my liquor as well as I hold my own ground!&quot; Guan Yu proudly stood and struck the ground with the pommel of his guandao. 

There the young man goes again, riling up the famed protector once more! It seemed he had quite the way with words. Either that, or he knew how to push Guan Yu&#39;s buttons just in the right way to get him to accept. Though once you get to know him, it isn&#39;t that hard to do.

&quot;I accept your terms, Master of Rider. I look forward to facing off against you a second time!&quot; Guan Yu declared with a confidence that made it seem like he already has won. A hand was extended out towards him. The sealing of their deal would be made with Rider and Laura as their witnesses.

The conversation then steered back towards the proposal of a feast, along with some overthinking on Rider&#39;s part regarding her Master&#39;s cheeky remarks. A sharp tongue and a soft heart? Not exactly subtle about it...

&quot;...Milord, <em>what?</em>&quot; Ching exclaimed in disbelief, completely taken aback by Kun Wu&#39;s proposal. &quot;A drinking competition? Right now? At this hour?&quot; She sounded more incredulous with each question, before seeing that greedy glint in the boy&#39;s eyes, followed by his terms for the competition: If they won, Guan Yu would have no choice but to perform in one of his various plays...

He had already been enthralled by Guan Yu&#39;s spectacular display. No doubt, the boy had already envisioned a billion ways to use his Noble Phantasm for the most mundane tasks in order to pretty up his performances! Ching felt like groaning to death.

&quot;...I&#39;m not drinking.&quot; Ching replied with a nonchalant face, sighing as she started to walk away. &quot;I&#39;m just, going to go home. Knock yourself out, milord.&quot; She said as she started to walk towards the path that would lead back to the surface. Unfortunately for Ching Shih, she had no idea that the arena for this rematch was a lot closer than she had imagined... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">From the very start, she and Rider were incompatible. Where Kun Wu redirected her snarky remarks at her with much subtlety and twice the power, Ching Shih took them at face value and fought venom with venom. While she didn&#39;t mind being underestimated—belittled, even, the she-fox didn&#39;t hesitate to bite back at any and all remarks threatening her status. 

Yet, she understood almost immediately as soon as Rider spoke to boast over her Master, that she had been wrong about her assumptions. Kun Wu&#39;s kind words only helped solidify her thoughts—She and Ching Shih were similar. 

<em>Both had been blessed by incredible, larger-than-life partners that knew how to bring them out of their metaphorical shells.</em>

Witnessing the energy and passion with which Rider boasted about her Master, Laura couldn&#39;t help but let out a little giggle.

But even as the mood lifted, that feeling of frustration kept nibbling away at her psyche. In a world where things hadn&#39;t gone as smoothly as they did now, her antics and poor performance might&#39;ve costed her, perhaps even Guan Yu&#39;s life. Contradictory feelings washed over her, that of feeling lucky yet regretting the way things unfolded. 

Those feelings were quickly brushed aside as the two men raised their voices in excitement, creating an opportunity to settle this unfinished battle over a drinking match. 

<em>If you win, Rider and I will answer to a single request of similar scale from you.</em>

A devilish grin found its way to Laura&#39;s lips. A request, from both he and Rider. The perfect occasion to get payback over the many humiliations she had to endure during their fight.

As for Rider, she was clearly having none of that. 

&quot;You weren&#39;t kidding, she <em>is</em> shy.&quot; She spoke as she watched the mature woman walk away, echoing Kun Wu&#39;s previous statement over his partner.</span>

Maybe!&#39; Kun Wu scratched his head, looking a little unsure. Well, at least Rider seemed more at ease around Guan Yu now, going so far as to give him - as well as everyone else - the stink eye before heading back on her own. Did she even bring her own keys? 

Maybe she was still exhausted. Kun Wu had a pretty good idea how long it usually took for Rider to fully recharge. Maybe she was just looking for an excuse to do so away from prying eyes. In which case...

&#39;Let us meet at my place in an hour&#39;s time, then!&#39; He grabbed Guan Yu&#39;s hand for a handshake that nearly crushed his bones. &#39;We crashed at your office for lunch last time, it&#39;s only fair that I play host today. You do know where I live, don&#39;t you?&#39; He asked Laura with an eyebrow raised, as if questioning her capabilities as an informant. 

&#39;I hope you are good at climbing stairs, because I doubt Guan Yu will fit inside the elevator.&#39;
