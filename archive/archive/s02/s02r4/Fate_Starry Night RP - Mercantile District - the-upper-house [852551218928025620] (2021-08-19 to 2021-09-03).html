<em>&#39;I don&#39;t need promises. I just want you to be happy. Happy that you got contracted with someone like me. Happy that you got to experience things you&#39;ve never been able to before. I did not ask to bond because you&#39;re weak. I wanted to do it because you don&#39;t have to bear this burden alone.&#39;</em>

...

Kun Wu buried his face in his hands. A deep sense of shame and embarrassment resurfaced, and the young Master sank into his seat, hiding his burning cheeks behind his laptop screen. 

<em>What an idiot he was. A hopeless, incorrigible fool.</em>

He sunk even deeper into his seat, forehead pressing against the table hard enough for the wooden surface to creak. For once, he was glad to be alone in his <strong>office space</strong>, which really was just a fancy term for the corner of the living room with the <em>nice</em> armchairs. The corner had been temporarily <strong>cleaned</strong>, which, again, was yet another fancy term for removing the piles of junk occupying the space...by piling them up somewhere else.

Kun Wu had never been one to do house chores, not even menial acts of &#39;cleaning&#39; like this.  But now he found the gesture to be oddly relaxing.

Anything to distract himself from thinking about Rider.

Except, the endeavor had proven to be quite the impossible task. After all— 

The laptop made a timely <em>ding!</em> as a new notification popped up, signaling him that his newest video had just finished uploading to DelphiTube™️. The webpage automatically refreshed, redirecting him to the video, which immediately started playing.

...

His own voice, loud and brimming with enthusiasm, reverberated back to him through the laptop&#39;s speakers. 

<strong>&#39;Are you a CGW enthusiast? Have you ever participated in a CGW? Once? Twice? Thought about it? DREAMT about it? Well listen up, because with regards to being a successful CGW Master, I&#39;m going to show you <em>NINE</em> reasons why all the big name participants <em>NEVER</em> make it to the end and, if that describes you, how to fix each one.&#39;</strong>

The video cut to a fancy, but cartoony chalk scribble of a ship on fire, with a stick figure of a guy in suits, glasses and wearing a maniacal laugh. The scribble was animated in an almost endearing way, which was quite fitting for the tone of the video...aside from the fact that he was also waving a flag that read &#39;Mackenzie Industries&#39;. 

To an innocent Delphian, the cartoony splash screen meant very little. On the other hand, to those who were more invested in the CGW, or an Olympian accessing DelphiTube™️ through the cities&#39; shared network, the scribbles would feel a tad bit deliberate-

<strong>&#39;Mistake number one: thinking that you are too rich to get your hands dirty.&#39;</strong>

-and they would be correct. The video mentioned no names, but Mr. Stick-Figure-In-A-Suit went on to guest-star in its moderately biased recount of the event on the <span class="mention">#brobdingnagian</span>, donning a different evil expression and new firearms each and every time. 

The recount may have been more sensational than accurate, but if there was one thing Kun Wu was good at, it was permeating his storytelling with absolute confidence, to the point that his audience would sooner be distracted by his persona than notice how far-fetched the narrative was. <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span>

Reality Kun Wu groaned as he recalled all the items Rider had forced him to return via Amazones.com because ordering twenty sets of new outfits for a new video did not qualify as acquiring <em>riches</em>.

Not only that, but an assortment of his personal belongings (read: trash that he had bought but never used) had also been packed up in return boxes, stacked in a corner and waiting to be picked up by delivery workers.

He could still remember the stern look on Rider&#39;s face, which became grimmer and darker with each room she had swept through looking for his expensive but useless purchases.

<em>&#39;Milord,&#39;</em> she would smile with murderous intent while holding up a whole box of fine leather gloves of every pattern and thickness available, most of which still had tags on them. <em>&#39;Kindly tell me why you would need a whole box of gloves when you only ever wear a single pair.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;I don&#39;t need them now, but I</em> <strong>might</strong> <em>need them later. Oh! This one I bought just in case it snowed-&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;It</em> <strong>never</strong> <em>snows in Delphi.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;But Olympia is-!&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;I will give you permission to warm your hands in my bosom if it ever comes to that.&#39;</em> She flexed her fingers, her sharp nail guards long, metallic and sinister-looking under the light. <em>&#39;Well?&#39;</em>

He felt a part of him shrivel up. <em>&#39;...Yes ma&#39;am.&#39;</em>

And that was that. Except it wasn&#39;t. Now he was sparked with a burning desire to temper with Delphi&#39;s weather dome...

A fatal mistake.

Kun Wu started banging his forehead against the desk, making crisp sounding <em>bonks</em> similar to the mokugyo drumming at the temples. Except that the mokugyo had been used to meditate, and he was currently doing anything <em>but</em>.

&#39;Focus, Kun Wu. <strong>Focus.</strong>&#39; The struggling CGW Master quietly recited the mantra while his own video played in the background.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A ton of notifications started popping up on his feed, from fans and haters alike as they bickered with each other under his video. His other socials had been rather busy as well, where fans waged bidding wars against one another to own a piece of his hand-signed merchandise (read: more trash that Rider couldn&#39;t return to Amazones because they had been opened). 

The idol business sure was lucrative. In the span of days, he and Rider had already made back more than he had ever splurged through secondhand auctions and effectively doubled, tripled, and even <em>quadrupled</em> their &#39;treasury&#39; in the form of cash and precious metals. They had rented a few storage houses in <span class="mention">#the-underbelly-b1f-b5f</span> to distribute the hard-earned wealth; just like Rider had insinuated, her strength had also considerably grown with each new deposit.

With one catch. Her appetite for mana batteries had also increased along with their wealth. 

Suffice to say that Kun Wu had brought up the idea of bonding no less than five(!) times over the past few days, but each time his proposal had been dismissed with a different reason. As sound as Rider&#39;s excuses were, he couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that the woman had been digressing on purpose, as if the idea of bonding itself was taboo. 

Smart as Kun Wu was, he wasn&#39;t that well-versed in Servant handling. Rider was his first! And the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. instructions manual plus CityNet could only tell him so much, with a big fat <strong>CAUTION</strong> slapped onto the first page of the bonding section and <strong>&#39;your mileage may vary&#39;</strong> mentioned in every Servant enthusiast blog he came across. 

Add that onto the pile of Rider-related things he had been occupied with lately, and Kun Wu was starting to suspect that he was going insane.

He couldn&#39;t get Rider off his mind.

<em><strong>Dingding!</strong></em>

A new private message. Kun Wu mustered enough strength to unglue his forehead from the desk, then quickly sifted through a throwaway account&#39;s request to sign their underwear for a ludicrous amount of credits. With a twitchy eye he blocked the account and set his head down again. 

Playing detective had never been one of his strong suits; he wished he had something else to distract himself from all the intrusive thoughts while playing the waiting game...</span>

 <strong>&#39;You. Are. A gem. An unpolished diamond. A flower waiting to bloom. Even though there is dirt in your roots, you can still grow. You can still blossom.&#39;</strong>

 ...

 Those words echoed in her head, impacting her cranium like stalactites. Her brainpower was expended on constant thoughts from the stay at the bathhouse. That warmth that made her worries melt away, enough for her to look at the future under a new lens. A catharsis she hadn&#39;t experienced in ages.

Who knew that the person who would support her the most was the one she had no expectations for?

It was enough to drive her mad. She chastised herself for her unawareness, ignorance and cowardice. <em>&quot;I&#39;ve mistreated him all this time, yet he still believes in me.&quot;</em> Guilt, obligation and most importantly of all, passion.

She wanted to make it up to him. She wanted him to live a fulfilled life. A life that she could only dream of. The life Ching Shih wished she could have had.

After all, she was barely confident in her own chances of survival. While Kun Wu was ecstatic at the thought of supporting Rider further, to the point he suggested bonding to maximize her potential, she dreaded the thought. Not only was her bonding process complicated, but...could she really entrust herself to him? No, could she <strong>really entrust such a burden on him?</strong>

She wasn&#39;t wise enough to answer such a question. Therefore, she simply tried her best to make do without bonding. This was surprisingly effective. Despite having known each other for a month at most, Rider and her Master were a terrifying combination when it came to show business. Kun Wu&#39;s stories and performances attracted fans like wildfire, while Ching Shih&#39;s good looks and eye candy kept more than several other audiences entertained, while simultaneously fanning Kun Wu&#39;s flames as his lead actress.</span>

For a pair that hadn&#39;t bonded, their synergy was on point. They covered their weaknesses nicely and had countermeasures ready for any encounter with enemy Servants. In fact, they were currently on route to track their own, feeling confident in taking the offensive after stockpiling so much treasure from their previous exploits.

All that was left now was to &#39;trim the fat&#39;. In other words, discard anything useless and turn it into useful valuables. Of course, that meant separating Kun Wu from items of sentimental value. For such a smart youth, he could be incredibly dense at times.

Gloves, boots, and various other paraphernalia. Ching Shih felt like playing housewife, cleaning up after a slob of a husband. So much rubbish in the apartment, rubbish that could be sold and repurposed as a source of strength. Convincing her Master took a while, but the thing about puppy eyes was that they lost effectiveness if you used them too often. Kun Wu could do nothing but cope as his Servant ransacked his apartment and left only room for necessities and commodities, while eliminating anything gaudy or unnecessary.

His inefficiency was mind boggling, to the point Rider almost gasped upon stumbling on his closet, which was filled with 100 coats. Apparently, ever since the vomiting incident, he had bought several spares to make sure he never went without a coat ever again. She cut the amount to a tenth of the size and instead taught Kun Wu on how to do laundry.

The apartment was finally clean. Tidy, but not minimalist. A homely environment that made the woman feel relaxed. It seemed like Kun Wu didn&#39;t mind either, albeit he was more focused on his laptop these days due to his recent work schedule. That was fine! Ching Shih would just patiently wait for his reaction and-

Wait for him? It almost sounded like she was a wife waiting for her husband&#39;s approval on a job well done.</span>

...

She immediately attempted to erase that line of thought. Instead, she focused on the gray plastic bags that covered the outside of her apartment. They were filled with excess materials. Items that Ching Shih was unable to return to Amazones.com™️ because of no return policies or the condition of the items themselves. These large shipping corporations were truly worse criminals than even pirates...

The only solution was to sell them at a store. It would be an easy task for her to drive up the prices with her good looks, but that felt too standard. Standard was not acceptable, especially when they were working with a deficit due to her mana issues. She needed to contribute more. What if she advertised Kun Wu&#39;s shows at the same time? That could work and would boost his sales by a significant amount. Of course, she would have to convince them that she was his titular actress. In which case...

She started rumbling through Kun Wu&#39;s second closest. The one reserved for Rider.

...

Kun Wu was suffering. His mind was more torn than the Titanic, feeling like two dogs were playing tug of war at opposite ends. One side craved Rider, the other wanted to avoid her at all costs. Couple that with his current task of keeping an eye on his fanbase for any potential Lancer news, and he felt like a fish in an open grill barbecue.

Such colorful metaphors were probably the result of him writing so many plays and stories in the span of a few days. Rider wanted money immediately, so he delivered, pulling an all nighter to draft numerous performances. Only the cream of the crop were selected, but he still had various drafts lying in a cabinet somewhere. Not to mention he even repurposed existing costumes he had ordered in the past (such as the bunnysuit) to match the more modern scripts. Reduce, reuse, recycle: The best way to get rich while abiding to Rider&#39;s laws of avoiding excess.</span>

&quot;Milord...&quot;

Speak of the devil, and they would appear. A chill ran down Kun Wu&#39;s spine as the woman of the hour finally made her presence known. The boy thought that she had left in order to sell any excess items to a store over at the #shopping-mall. Instead, she was still around, and was now-

What the...

An elegant dress in a shade between cherry and plum, much like Kun Wu&#39;s own face upon witnessing such beauty. An outfit designed to accentuate Ching Shih&#39;s features while still maintaining an element of dignity and refinement. The end of the dress was marked by a short cut, allowing one to visualize the woman&#39;s thighs, but denying them a full view, which would incite anyone to come closer.

A cheongsam, more commonly known as qipao. An outfit Kun Wu had bought a while back when thinking about performing a traditional Chinese play. He knew Rider would be the perfect fit, but he had no idea she would completely surpass his expectations. She was even wearing the matching red heels, elevating her even higher while the outfit&#39;s breast window complimented her supple bosom.

Even better, Ching Shih had added her own flair to the outfit: Instead of sticking to her long, natural hair, she had adjusted her hairstyle and formed two small buns on her sides, along with a miniature braid adorning the back of her head.

&quot;...I noticed that you have yet to perform the tale of the wandering silk weaver, so I tried to see if I could advertise it in the streets while playing the titular character. The outfit is a perfect fit, so I praise you for remembering my sizes,&quot; Ching explained.</span>

<em>&quot;albeit I don&#39;t remember ever sharing them...&quot;</em>

&quot;But still, does it look good on me, milord? Should I go ahead and hand out fliers while dressed like this?&quot; She asked, as if looking for both permission and approval. Of course, she had no idea that her Master was having an inner conflict of their own. How would they react to seeing Rider wear a gaudy outfit <em>out of her own volition</em> just to support his show&#39;s success?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider&#39;s voice, crisp and fragile like the autumn wind, carried itself to Kun Wu&#39;s ears. This troubled the young Master greatly. To think that he would let his guard down enough to start hallucinating in the middle of the day! He could even hear Rider speak as if she were in the same room with him! 

&#39;<strong>Gah! Get out of my head, accursed spirits-!</strong>...Oh, it&#39;s you, Rider.&#39;

...

&#39;Wait! No! You&#39;re not-that&#39;s not-&#39; He stammered, eyes bulging with surprise as he took in the sight of Rider&#39;s new outfit. No. This cannot be. Rider would <em>never</em> wear anything from closet no.2 unprompted! He must still be hallucinating! Truly, he must have severely overworked.

He immediately jumped out of his seat and assumed a defensive stance, as if he were trying to ward off an evil spirit. Unfortunately, his own face would betray him, turning redder than Rider&#39;s heels as his gaze traversed the few highlights of her outfit.

The qipao was a perfect fit. Rider even added her own touch, putting her hair up in buns and adding a playful vibe to her ensemble. She was even looking at him expectantly, as if waiting for a praise from her Master...

Kun Wu stopped functioning.

&#39;Who are you and what did you do to Ching Shih?!&#39; He interrogated Rider as he kept up his defensive stance.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To think that just a month ago, she was disgusted at the thought of wearing such tacky outfits for the sake of public entertainment. She still remembered how dreadfully boring Kun Wu&#39;s video montages were, along with how much she cursed herself for being summoned in the hands of such a mediocre Master.

Yet now she couldn&#39;t help but look back at those moments fondly, to the point she considered herself crazy. Had she been brainwashed? Was it perhaps an acquired taste? She didn&#39;t know. All that Madame Ching knew in that moment was that she wished for Kun Wu&#39;s happiness, even more so if she could be part of it.

But to think that he would react like this to her appearance...

&quot;E-Eh?&quot; She asked in disbelief, her pupils dilating as she wondered what was up. Instead of getting closer and admiring her, he was backing away?

When was the last time a man had done this to her? Well, besides when she was raiding a few villages here and there...

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that I look...<em>ugly</em>, milord?&quot; Her mind immediately led to that conclusion, as if it was a natural reaction. The flower boat had taught her that men were fickle and would repudiate you for the slightest of reasons. Were her hair buns too tacky? Was the cloth not a perfect fit? Maybe he simply felt intimidated at the fact that Rider was now several times his height thanks to her heels?

She needed to fix it! She <em>wanted</em> to.

&quot;Keep waiting for a few more minutes! I&#39;ll, erm, change back to my normal outfit.&quot; Ching Shih replied in a panic, whimpering almost as she started undoing her hair buns and letting her hair flow. Kun Wu couldn&#39;t even tell what was going on. What had gotten in his Servant&#39;s head?! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

What normal outfit?

Kun Wu had been so enamored with the qipao that he had almost forgotten that Rider owned her own set of mana-generated clothes. In the span of time it took for him recall that inferior outfit, Rider had already undid one of her hair buns and was moving to undo the other. It was then that everything finally clicked: Rider was going to put away the qipao!

&#39;NO!&#39; He shouted, jumping over the desk with a burst of energy he didn&#39;t know he had it in him. Rider had already undid one of her hair buns and was moving onto the next, and he absolutely cannot have that!

<em>Kun Wu, you idiot! Do you even need a reason to keep Rider in that outfit?!</em>

He bonked himself inwardly as he sprinted the length of the living room, coming to a halt right in front of Rider. Before she could utter another word, he dropped to his knees and <em>prostrated</em> himself on the floor.

&#39;I was wrong! I spoke too soon!! Put your other bun back! Please!!&#39; He beseeched Rider like he were praying to the buddha. &#39;I&#39;d do anything to have it back!&#39;

<em>&quot;Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be helping him advertise in the first place? If he&#39;s already given me such harsh criticism...&quot;</em> She felt like crying in her head, a fact that puzzled her. Ching Shih, crying over the remarks of a boy like him? She never thought she&#39;d see the da-

Kun Wu lunged at her, before landing just a few inches away from her knees. He covered his face, kneeling respectfully as a serf would to a queen. His forehead touched the floor.

He was <em>begging</em> her to redo her hairstyle.

Ching was completely taken aback by this reaction. The misunderstanding revealed itself as she realized that her Master was actually quite delighted by the change in appearance. It felt like she had just bought a new pair of glasses, since his previous actions now looked a lot more reasonable: He wasn&#39;t panicking because he disliked her outfit, but because he liked it <em>that</em> much.

She wondered how she had even misinterpreted his words in the first place. Someone like her should be fully capable of understanding the subtleties in body language.</span>

It was simple: She wasn&#39;t thinking straight. Neither of them were. While Kun Wu constantly had Rider on his mind, the same applied to Rider, who hadn&#39;t spent a day <em>not</em> thinking about her Master. She simply did a good job at hiding it with her domineering aura.

Something that she would employ right now.

&quot;...This is pathetic.&quot; Ching snarled, finding the situation ridiculous as she stomped her heels just a step away from Kun Wu&#39;s head. &quot;Get up, milord! I shall not witness my partner and equal humiliate themselves like this in front of me.&quot;

The tiger mom inched closer, kneeling as she forcibly grabbed Kun Wu by the shoulders and lifted him up. She dragged his face and let his chin rest on her bosom. The breast window was indeed a great addition to the outfit.

&quot;There. That feels better, I hope.&quot; Ching Shih puffed out air from her mouth as she ruffled Kun Wu&#39;s head. &quot;If you love my hair so much, you have full permission of styling it for me. Get to work.&quot; She pinched his cheek, before noticing the laptop in the distance.

&quot;Oh, and any news on Lancer? You <em>did</em> promise me that you were keeping an eye out for him and his Master.&quot; She asked while still caressing his head. &quot;Of course, it&#39;s also fine if you haven&#39;t yet. It just gives us more time to pillage as we please.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The <em>clack</em> of Rider&#39;s heels felt like a death sentence. Whatever evil spirits had been possessing Rider seemed to have dispersed as the Servant went back to her domineering demeanor. Kun Wu felt Rider&#39;s hands on his shoulders, manhandling him with ease as she dragged him off the floor. He fully expected her to literally mop the floor with him at this rate; what he <em>didn&#39;t</em> expect, however...

<em>squish</em>

His face landed on his winter hand warmer (reminder: Delphi had no winter) as Rider started using the classic carrot and stick method on her Master, ordering him to put her hair back the way it had been. Except that it didn&#39;t sound like a punishment. Quite on the contrary, Kun Wu felt as if he&#39;d just been given an early Christmas present.

Naturally, he wanted more.

&#39;Can I style it anyway I want?&#39; He blurted out, eyes sparkling. Rider could almost hear the gears churning in his pretty head. A shiver ran down her spine. Was Kun Wu good at styling hair? She had never seen him in anything more complicated than a ponytail. Though he was good at arts and crafts, could she really entrust her hair to him like stage props...?

<em><strong>Dingding!</strong></em>

Thankfully, as if to both answer her question and save her precious hair from much grief, Kun Wu&#39;s laptop interrupted with a new private message notification. Kun Wu reluctantly extracted himself from Rider&#39;s bosom.

&#39;-And I <em>am</em> keeping an eye out for him as we speak. It&#39;s just that most people would rather ask me to sign their foreheads than tell me anything useful.&#39; He said with a pout, dragging himself towards his desk. It had been yet another unfruitful day. Would this new private message be the change they needed? 

Kun Wu hesitated when he saw the account&#39;s name.

OtterOnTheFence.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He studied the seemingly ordinary looking profile picture of an otter in a party hat, then mustered up enough courage and clicked open the message.

<em>&#39;Is this the green lancer you were looking for?&#39;</em>

A brief message, accompanied by a photo. The photo was blurry and grainy, as if it had been taken in a hurry under unfavorable lighting conditions. In the center of it were two blobs, one large and green and definitely humanoid, the other...Kun Wu squinted at the pale pixels. Was that supposed to be a person?

In his heart, he knew that if there was anyone accompanying Guan Yu, it would be his Master-slash-informant, Laura. But that was from his own deductions. Was it really too much to ask for a photo shot with a decently steady hand in this day and age?

And even more importantly, the photo didn&#39;t tell him anything useful like when it had been taken, or where it had been taken. Kun Wu quickly messaged OtterOnTheFence back.

&#39;When was this taken? Where are they headed?&#39;

His handle remained silent for a good minute. Then a voice message appeared, and auto-played.

&#39;OMIGOSHOMYGOD YOU ACTUALLY REPLIED I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE YOU&#39;RE ACTUALLY TALKING TO ME <em>squeeeeeeee</em>-&#39; 

Kun Wu snapped his laptop close. He steeled his nerves before jumping back into the conversation, grimacing as he started a barely coherent conversation with OtterOnTheFence. He satiated their desire to gossip with a few (made up) personal facts before they finally dropped the key info he had been seeking...

&#39;They are at the Underlly.&#39; He said wearily, shutting his laptop and rubbing his temples. He had once thought that he was loud, but now he wasn&#39;t so sure anymore.

&#39;Seems like they&#39;re on an agenda. <em>No one</em> goes to the Underbelly without a good reason, so I think they&#39;ll be there for quite a while.&#39; He pushed himself out of the chair and stretched. &#39;Seems like you are my goddess of fortune,&#39; he grinned from ear to ear, glad to be done with his torturous desk job. &#39;All it took was for you to show up in a qipao, and bam!

Her soul froze, as she pondered whether to &#39;&#39;&#39;accidentally&#39;&#39;&#39; knock her Master unconscious just to prevent herself further shame. Thankfully, the gods were kind, and the boy would be spirited away by the sudden message of a mysterious otter aficionado.

He hogged his laptop, giving Rider the time to compose herself. She felt out her outfit: It was tight, but not exactly uncomfortable. Enough thought was put into the design, allowing for ease of movement even for hectic performances such as musicals. She started styling her hair again, forming the hair buns once more and finishing once Kun Wu was done with his own endeavors.

He had found him.

&quot;The Underbelly.&quot; Ching narrowed her eyes. &quot;I am unsure on whether to be delighted or not. Fighting in an area close to our deposits will benefit us greatly, but at the same time I wonder why they are headed there.&quot; The incident at the ship was still fresh on her mind. &quot;You don&#39;t think...they could have been monitoring us, right?&quot;

While her question was rather serious, it was simply met back with Kun Wu&#39;s shit eating grin, as he tried his best to sound cool and smirked at her. His teeth were even shining!</span>

Normally, that merited a slap. However, to be called a goddess of fortune and having her good looks praised once again...

Ching Shih&#39;s face went red as she covered her mouth. She turned away from the boy, much to the latter&#39;s confusion.

<em>&quot;Never say that again.&quot;</em> She weakly scolded him, taking a deep breath and composing herself.

&quot;Ahem. Fantastic job locating Guan Yu, milord. I assume we shall now take the fight to them?&quot; She stood up, tall and proud as she mentally prepared herself for the encounter. In the past, she would have dreaded the possibility of fighting against one of China&#39;s greatest heroes. Guan Yu was a name far beyond her own, echoed across the world.

But she wasn&#39;t alone. Not anymore. A powerful ally had offered his services and goodwill to Ching Shih. Through their powers combined, even a tiger would be able to harm a giant.

&quot;...Do you want me to change before we leave?&quot; Ching asked innocuously, wondering if the outfit was even fit for battle. If it got damaged, that would leave a hefty dent in Kun Wu&#39;s bank account... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

But Rider did not answer, most likely because doing so would meant repeating those embarrassing words herself. What a dilemma she had placed herself in...

But Rider was a smooth talker. Instead of focusing on her weaknesses, she seamlessly digressed and started praising Kun Wu for his efforts, earning her yet another dazzling smile from her Master. 

If Kun Wu had a tail, he&#39;d be wagging it right about now. They now had a solid lead on Guan Yu, plus Rider had just redone her hair-

<em>&#39;...Do you want me to change before we leave?&#39;</em>

&#39;<strong>NO!</strong> Do you even need to ask?! The answer was no, and it will be no until,&#39; he counted, &#39;laundry day!&#39; He said with more force than necessary. &#39;I need you to, er, look your best. Yes! Consider this a performance too!&#39; He hid his true intentions, albeit poorly, behind an ironclad excuse.

&#39;...Unless you have trouble moving in that outfit, I suppose. I did have it modified to support your movement during a play...&#39; The truth was that he had modified it more than what was needed for movement. But who could blame him? He simply had good taste.

It took a while for Ching to process Kun Wu&#39;s request. She wasn&#39;t foolish, nor oblivious. It was rather telling that he was asking her to keep wearing that seductive outfit. He was completely smitten with her new appearance.

She felt flattered. Tempted to reward him for such praise too, even. But what perturbed her was the thought of letting others see her in this getup, an opposing Servant at that. It sounded embarrassing, especially since part of her wished to be beautiful for Kun Wu <em>only.</em>

She shook her head and eliminated such ridiculous thoughts. Since when did <em>the</em> Ching Shih need to feel ashamed about flaunting her body?! If she couldn&#39;t use her good looks, then what good was she? Those performances weren&#39;t going to advertise themselves...

Plus, she knew her Master wouldn&#39;t mind.

&quot;...You&#39;re quite the naughty person, milord.&quot; Ching Shih sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to punish you nicely once we get back home. Keep that in mind.&quot; She warned, before snapping her fingers and pointing at the door.

&quot;Let us go then. We have a Lancer to hunt.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span>
