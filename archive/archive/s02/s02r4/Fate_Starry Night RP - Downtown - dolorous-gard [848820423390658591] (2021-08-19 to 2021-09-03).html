                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The day had finally arrived. All preparations had been made, any individuals that had elected to join were armed up by Mackenzie equipment and supplies. Each was outfitted with riot armor and padding to protect themselves, some were given batons, others carried tools of their trade such as sledgehammers and pick axes. A rare few of them actually had their own shotguns. Nothing militaristic or Mackenzie branded, simply something of their own self defense. I’m total 75 Olympians were selected for the campaign, each one properly vetted for the sake of Laurent and the church. On top of that all non fighting civilians were encouraged to evacuate the area if able of r hunker down tightly in their homes. Although he wasn’t against recruiting his own forces, Uther sincerely did not wish to spill innocent blood unnecessarily.

Snow had steadily began to come down upon them, not enough to cover the ground yet or to turn into a full blown blizzard but it would prove to be an uncomfortable factor of the day. Currently Uther, Lark, and small group of fighters stood at the end of the road facing the encroaching castle. This may prove to be one of the more challenging battles thus far, and in a small part of Lancer’s heart it excites him. It had been a long time since he marched upon the enemy, facing the uncertainty of battle. However, with that also came the responsibility of leading one’s men well. Any death that occurred this day would be on Uther’s head and he wanted to ensure it was as few as possible. Turning over to his master he’d whisper “If those files Laurent gave us about Jampo and Brandon are to be believed, this will likely be much trickier than our previous battles. I’ll need your whits sharp today Lark, I invite your aid but try not to bite off more than you chew. Your death would not only effect you, but all the people that surround us.

Straightening up Uther then spoke our loud enough for the crowd behind him to hear. “The time is now, this is what we’ve been waiting for. Your chance to fight furiously for your hike and your claim of ownership. Do not let this would be usurper take what’s rightfully yours. He wishes to crush your property, dismantle your families, and trample upon your livelihoods. Are you going to stand by and let this happen?” A loud and resounding “<em><strong>NO!</strong></em>” was heard from the crowd. “Then I call upon all of your strength and fortitude this day, let us stop this tyrant in his tracks and show him the true willpower and might of Olympia!” An uproar of cheers, hollering, and chanting filled the square, as a massive grin grew upon the king’s face. “As soon as I give the signal that’s when we act. Until then let our preparations follow through.” 

In the distance as Doloras Gard slowly edged forward across the terrain, it’s boundaries soon approached a different group that hid on both the right and left side of the castle waiting in the shadows. They anxiously watched as their target moved closer, and as soon as they felt it was within range a hand signal was given whereby one member of either side pulled a small detonator and immediately pushed the ignition. Within moments two large explosions erupted on both faces of the front of the castle striking outwards ar it’s front gate. Due in small part to this two buildings that had long since been abandoned in the industrial district toppled downwards upon the growing structure attempting to add even further damage to the castle and piercing through their defenses of possible.</span>

&quot;snore...snoooore... Heh? Erm?&quot; 

A cloud of dust roils within Jampo&#39;s chambers, falling from the rafters to filter into his nostrils and send the old monk into a sneezing fit. Lifting himself from his position on the floor, he slowly rubs the ache of sleep from his eyes as he approaches the window, welcoming the cool breeze that came with Olympia&#39;s newfound snow. Such weather he hadn&#39;t seen in such time on this vessel, and the soft bite against his skin only helped to rejuvenate his vigor. 

&quot;Yaawn Now just what is that...hm.&quot; 

He expected a blanket of white to stretch across the grounds and surrounding forest, but he was pleasantly surprised to find that shoots of life still clung as the earth made itself clear despite the weather. What he  couldn&#39;t have prepared himself for was the row upon row of warriors lined up outside.

&quot;...Ah, I see. Brandin&#39;s words have come closer to fruition than I anticipated. Ehh, it doesn&#39;t look like I can scare off this many people...&quot;

With a deep sigh, the monk fetches his robes, tying them around his naked body before climbing out of the window, making his way for the towering battlements...</span>

&quot;Saber, we have company. I&#39;ll attempt to reason with them, but I suspect you were right. This seems like another conflict we&#39;ll have to face. I wonder if the Church has anything to do with this...&quot; 

Cross-legged, Jampo scans the approaching army from the height of the tallest battlement, perched neatly on the very edge while he ponders on the turn of events. His only audience right now being one of Brandin&#39;s Copper Knights, looming over his shoulder as it stares robotically at the gathered warriors. 

&quot;Tell your master what you see. I will stall as long as I can...hrm, and investigate those explosions. I suspect Dolorous Gard can withstand them, but one can never be too careful.&quot; 

He nods at the Knight as it strolls away, watching it&#39;s feet track crater sized prints in the thin snow, revealing the slate grey stone making up the castle fortress . He was no fool; they were loyal to Brandin, and Brandin alone. But as long as he was supplying the mana, he&#39;d benefit from the illusion that they were listening to him. 

Clearing his throat, the monk rises before clapping his hands together, summoning his Qi. His body warms as mana flows through his veins, reigniting himself for potential combat.</span>

&quot;Greetings!&quot; He calls, his voice carrying through despite the whipping chill of Olympia&#39;s generated winds. <em>Boisterous, but not too boisterous now...reign it in a bit. If you&#39;re not careful, you may get too excited, hmmm.</em>

&quot;It&#39;s a fine day for assorting armies, that much I can say. The snow does wonders for setting the stage of conflict...but, what business do you have here? Is there perhaps a Master down there participating in this War?&quot;

He searches through the militia once more, trying to spot anyone that might fit the bill. Masters were common, but the Masters he&#39;s faced have been rather...particular. Of course, he couldn&#39;t spot Lark...but Uther&#39;s very figure stood out quite astonishingly. Brilliant, flaring, a lion standing at the head of his pack...

&quot;Ahhh...there&#39;s a particular air that comes with this war. You are a Servant summoned for this war, are you not? It&#39;s rather obvious, judging from your gait, if not your armor itself, hohohohoho.&quot; Laughing...was he laughing? What kind of Master was this?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">On that day, snow blanketed the landscape.

Miniscule. Cold. And above all, it was abundant. Lark gazed up at the sky, those grey clouds, and wondered just how much of this stuff those large cotton balls could possibly hold up there. It was a sight to behold, nonetheless. It came down with the grace of a swan, going whichever way the wind or gravity decided. He watched as one particular flake whipped and floated throughout the air and landed amongst the thousands of others upon the ground.

“--ark! Come, or you’ll miss out on the breach!” Geeves called. He shook his shoulder gently, to wake him up from his daydream. 

Oh. Right. It was time for war.

Countless people milled around, either anxious or in anticipation. They bore the equipment lent over by MacKenzie, armor and even some personal weaponry from either their places of work or from their own homes. He himself bore standard armor. Normally it would’ve made it difficult to move around, but the design plus his work out from Lancer meant that it wasn’t too bad. He kept his trust instrument, though, held at his side.

If only he could stare at the thousands of frozen tears that descended around the group. His fingers itched to play a melody, to mimic the freely moving snowflakes all around. However, Lancer instead commanded the men with his Military Tactics, and the explosives detonated.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Now, he walked forward, to stand by his Servant. They were greeted by Jampo, the Buddist who was the Master of Saber. It was the sort of thing he’d say, a casual greeting that touched upon the assumed topic at hand but skirted around it the sort of hope that it wasn’t what it was.

And he wished that was the case. On any other day and in any other timeline, he’d offer the Monk to simply discuss whatever topic may sprout from the mind, as they watched the wondrous weather and meditated their minds. Maybe even play in the snow, engage in the childhood they might’ve had in a world not drowned by the past of their ancestors. 

Instead, Lark stepped forward. “We are here for obvious reasons. Your rule of this area with nothing short of a sudden dictatorship, with no consideration for the original leaders and the people who live here! I know that this is a long shot, but if and your Servant step down and remove the Castle from the lands, you will be spared from a violent siege!”

His own blood begged for violence, his itch not sated for long enough. To dance in the midst of combat would relieve his stress a great deal. Stressed caused from his encounter from Laurent. Who required them to do this in the first place. Which sent his heart beat into the stratosphere.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The explosives went off at the front gates. However when the smoke finally cleared, the massive gates stood unperturbed. Cursed dark energies erupted from the gate itself, roiling over the crowd before like a miasma for daring to challenge the keep before them. Instantly, those magically inclined could tell that this gate held within it an extremely powerful curse. While such mundane means of entry might&#39;ve worked if the explosives had been placed elsewhere, no such method would give them quick entry through the front. The gate stood defiantly, waiting for those who would challenge the rule of Dolorous Gard.

From the snow covered ramparts, Saber looked over the battlefield.

&quot;Surprising, I wasn&#39;t expecting someone to trick the masses into throwing their lives away to breach the gates.&quot; Saber said to himself. He then looked to the head of the crowd and saw the Servant leading them. That brilliant, lion-like figure was unmistakable to someone like Brandin.

&quot;Pendragon? No... Uther Pendragon.&quot; Brandin was briefly enraged before a wicked smile spread over his face as he chuckled to himself. &quot;It&#39;s as if fate itself is smiling upon me. I&#39;ll correct my place in history with you as my stepping stone. Your armor will look magnificent displayed over my mantelpiece.&quot;

Meanwhile, from the outside. movement could be seen inside the keep as the Copper Knights began to prepare for the siege. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Although there was a part of him hoping that the explosives would do something to the gate, Lancer didn’t truly expect it to really work. His only true hope was to see how the fortress would react and to get visual on his enemy, both of which have made themselves seem. It seemed based on the miasma, it was mostly coming from the front. Several thoughts filled Uther’s mind on how he should proceed. Looking out at the two that had revealed themselves, the master seemed put off by the idea of fighting or at least didn’t want to lead with it, whereas Saber became enraged by the mere sight of him. Uther found this amusing, especially after reading up on the servant’s file. 

The king seemed to wipe his brow and scratch the back of his head before glancing over to Saber. “I assume you must be Lord Brandon. I must commend you that is a mighty fortress. It’s a shame I’m only getting to witness this version of it, and not it’s true magnificence under the ownership of Sir Lancelot.” There was an intentional pause given to let the words sink in. “I didn’t know the man personally, but apparently he had a great many adventures with my own progeny Arthur. Supposedly they went on to be great knights together.</span>

Looking around at the people standing at his shoulders, Uther understood he held their lives in his hands. 

Turning his attention to the master Lancer called out. “It’s as the young man said, these people are unhappy about you trampling on their land. You may not care, but most of the men and women at my back are without homes, without means to provide for their families because you overran their places of work. I will not mention names but I was informed earlier that a number of children have passed away from either malnutrition or expose to the elements whether it be the recent or now the recent snow. That’s blood on your hands, I will not pretend to understand your motivations but I hope it’s worth the lives already lost.” There was quiet murmur amongst the crowd that slowly built an atmosphere of frustration and anger. All individuals were ready and prepared in their gear, each one itching to get started. “You ask why we are here, it is for them. They do not want you here and this is their way of telling you. For that reason, we call to challenge you and your forces on the field of battle. Will you meet us or hide away?”</span>

What were the odds of facing THE father of lions, the progenitor of Britain&#39;s destiny. Jampo casts an eye to Brandin, watching his Servant glower down at a most hated of enemies. One who, also, was not afraid to use the past to their benefit...

&quot;Brandin, keep in control. You are not the man that lost, but you stand to be the man that will prevail. The past cannot be drudged up by words alone.&quot; 

Still, this might be a troublesome scenario. The Copper Knights themselves could stand up to most humans, but the numbers might vastly overcome their power...he was beginning to lose hope on whether or not this could be solved with minimal bloodshed. Often, war must be paved by broken bones and bodies, but the thought still shakes the demon within and rattles its cage. How much sin could he bear...

&quot;...Uther Pendragon...you swear this is the truth? Children have died due to Dolorous Gard?&quot;</span>

&quot;...Where were your employers?&quot; He never quite understood just how captivating his words and silences could be, the old man merely speaking his mind and sharing his experiences of the world at large. Perhaps these were just the ramblings of a man that&#39;s spent so long searching for the opportunity to redeem his transgressions...but with how long he&#39;s spent here, the strength behind each word resonated deeply with the Qi currently pulsing through his frame, now illuminating the monk in an azure glow that shone against the slate backdrop of the sky above, as if he was bringing it to bare for all to see. &quot;Where were your benefactors...where were the people that riled you against such a threat? I have lived on this vessel for years...I have toiled like the rest of you, I have seen how Olympia breaks the backs of those without the strength to fight back.

&quot;UTHER! MASTER OF LANCER! WHAT IS YOUR WISH?&quot; The question bears the burden on the backs of the King and his Master, and flares Jampo&#39;s mana around him, swirling and flickering about him, flames of destruction just waiting to be unleashed on those that deserve it. True, a great deal of mana is needed to help a servant construct a territory such as this...but this level of reserves was...well, it was impossible. In this age of humanity, there should be no one with this amount of power at their disposal...

&quot;I wish...to give power back to those that never had it. I wish to change this reality from one where fathers must choose between bread and home, where mothers must awaken to find their children toiling their youth away. I wish to make Olympia a haven where all have the means to live, without the threat of benefactors breaking them...so, if you wish to guilt me, I&#39;m afraid there isn&#39;t much you can add. I have too much burdening my soul, every waking day. However, if you wish to take away my wish, I cannot abide that.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Now the monk spoke. Deep words, a blue glow to mix perfectly with the while flakes from heavens high. Who sent them here? What did they desire from this war? If it wasn’t greater than his wish, then it was not worth it.

And Lark couldn’t agree more. He grimaced, not terribly in the mood to say that the Largest Arms Dealer in all of Olympia wanted them to remove this castle. And his wish was noble in thought. To empower the masses would be to reverse the cycle of pain and misery that had plagued the city for so long.

However…

“You goose!” Lark responded. “To give power to the powerless? That is only a bandaid to the problem! All that will do is reverse the tables. Create a new royalty from the ashes to brutally rule the city  and then some from those previously on high. There will be the same amount of pain and suffering from before!”

He hoisted his violin up, and a new light emerged. A warm spring green sprung forth, a horrible dissonance to the color palette present. “No, to truly help the people, there must be systematic changes from the ground up! Fair wages, fair hours, unions! The rich must pay their fair share, and the poor must be supported in order to remove them from the shackles of poverty! No one must suffer!”

They fought for the same reasons. To bring the lower class up from the gutters and live. However, the one who has been affected personally desires a reversed cycle. And the other wished to break it all together.

And they were both hopelessly stupid. What they wanted was well outside the realm of reality. A dream of a better tomorrow that was always the next day out. To wish that people will throw away their greed and desire for more was simply impossible.</span>

&quot;As for your &#39;noble&#39; goals, you lot are far crueler than I. These people chose to flee from their homes to the arms of their uncaring masters. You&#39;ve went and poisoned their minds with hope, knowing fully well that you send them to their deaths for your own benefit. Tell me, which aristocrat is backing this little uprising?

&quot;On second thought, it does not matter. I&#39;ll find out who it is in due time, they&#39;ll relent to Dolorous Gard or be made into an example.&quot;

Brandin raised his hand and another surge of cursed energy rippled through the gate.

&quot;You wish to challenge the might of Dolorous Gard? Very well then, Be crushed beneath the unrelenting might of my power!&quot;

The Gates of Dolorous Gard cracked open, the cursed energy flowing over the crowd gathered before it. A horde of ten Copper Knights emerged from the entrance and descended upon the attacking party. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span></span>

Letting out a sigh, Uther called back up to Jampo. “I have a feeling that you have the instinct to disregard anything I say, therefore I’d like for you to hear it from the horse’s mouth.” The king then turned around to usher someone forward, it seemed to be a man in his early 30s dressed out in gear and wielding a club. There was fire and resentment in his eyes. “My boy was 3 years old. My money was tight enough as it is. I didn’t live the high life, but I had a roof over my head. That’s until you came around. We had been displaced for days, and when we felt like our world had already fallen apart, that’s when the rain came. I tried to keep him as warm as possible, but all the blankets soaked through.” The man began to break down into tears, Uther attempted to put a hand on the man’s shoulder but he quickly brushed him off and pointed a finger directly at Jampo. “You say you understand us, that you are one of us. Yet there you stand upon a literal pedestal over all of us, claiming to know what’s best and that you want us to have equal treatment. I don’t feel very equal right now. In fact from how you’re speaking it seems we’ll just be replacing one overlord for another.” 

At this Uther had at last patted the man on the back and allowed him to mingle back into the crowd. Right now it was a battle of ideologies that Jampo wished to wage. Although Uther hasn’t always been a part of the moral high ground, he felt rather confident in this position. He spoke up once more to Jampo. “You see its difficult to justify being for the welfare of the people, when they all stand against you. As my friend just pointed out, the way you are conducting yourself makes you no better or different than the abusers of power that you claim to detest.” 

Uther heard Lark’s words, and although there were a few details they differed on, the king agreed</span>

To properly lift up a nation, the issues at hand must be addressed while at the same time not creating a new problem in the process. Jampo’s solution was to trade one devil for another. That will only shift the blame not bring a solution. Shouting outwards right beside his master. “I wish for Olympia to be elevated beyond its current standing, for all people rich and poor to stand above all other nations. Every man, woman, and child has the guaranteed right at birth to be great if given the right opportunities, and I intend to provide those to the people. The lowly ones that we all are collectively talking so loosely about are those that stand amongst the crowd. The factory worker, the crane operator, the janitorial, all want to be treated better. The only difference between us is that I don’t seek to destroy those who disagree with me in the process. All whom you see chose to be here. I didn’t force them or trick them, these Olympians knew the risks and they felt this stand was worth it to them. We indeed had someone make donation, but this fight was intended to be waged by me regardless if we had outside support or not. I believe in this cause for the people. However, I have a suspicion our words fall on deaf ears. If you seek to control and subjugate as the means to your end, then I agree we can’t let this end in diplomacy. We will not let you crush the spirit of Olympia for your own whims.” Uther pounded on his chest plate that echoed across the street and the crowd yelled and cheered, each one tightening the grip on their weapons ready to fight. There were plans and preparations that the king had setup before arriving, hopefully it’ll be enough to win the day. 

Brandin then shouted out a taint concerning Uther’s child. Although he</span>

Despite not seeing it for himself, from what Uther read about his daughter she did go on to be an excellent king and maintained peace in Camelot for an extended period. It was a shame that Camelot fell, but there was no sense in holding grief about the past. It’s a weight upon the sole that only slows the mighty down, that is why his wish focuses on the future and the endeavor of raising a whole new nation. From how Brandon spoke, it was clear he had no sense of that concept. He seems to carry the idea that men and woman facing death for something they believed in was foolhardy, expecting them to simply roll over when he knocks their homes over. It seemed the general was going to have to show him what fighting for ones home meant. 

The energy pulsed at the gate and from the emergence came the illustrious Copper Knights. This would be a difficult fight for them all, Uther</span>

As the knights rushed towards them Uther waited for them to get closer, watching them sprint in synch. The reason he did this was that he was not fully certain what exactly the castle was capable of and he didn’t want to risk his fighters getting caught in a blast zone of some large attack. Once Lancer felt they had moved sufficiently enough from the front gate he yelled out for a forward charge, which they all gladly obliged. In total there was 35 Olympians rushing off to face the enemy, excluding Lancer, Lark, and Geeves. That gave them roughly 3-4 for each knight.

The king dashed ahead of them to be the first to meet the enemy, both so the crowd could see him and get that jolt of endurance flowing through them as well as offer the necessary aid required for this fight. Instead of directly fighting one opponent at a time, Uther would strike out hard against one of them before jumping away and hitting the next one beside it. With his enhanced speed he bounced from opponent to opponent elbowing heads, kicking sternums, sweeping legs. This was all done to keep them on their toes against him, knocking them off balance, and providing an opening for the non servant fighters to swing out at the knights with their own weapons of clubs, pick axes, and sledge hammers. This was a coordinated effort where they supported one another and watched each other’s backs. The attacks were calculated and they would not linger in one spot for long. They’d be on defense until Uther provided an opportunity for them, they’d strike, then back away once more. They were aware of what they faced, they had been thoroughly trained leading up to this moment, and many were willing to do what was necessary to win this day.</span>

Jampo considered their words deeply, keeping silent and heeding Lark and the people at his back, bowing his head deeply as the true final blow came to pass. A child had fallen...and the others were just as likely...

&quot;...&quot;

The breeze carries away that strength that had been ruminating behind his next response, the monk&#39;s fallen visage showing a window into the eyes of a man that had descended deeply into himself for retrospection. This is no meditation. This is self-reflection, Jampo looking over the titles bestowed on himself in this moment. Tyrant, Dictator, Murderer. The path to his supposed dream has been paved already with blood...youthful blood...

And more was yet to come. Brandin announced the beginning of battle. It was time for action to replace ethics.

His body tenses, mild strain showing on his brow as he forces the demon down. Now is not the time to lose oneself...now is the time to show true discipline. The Copper Knights begin pouring out to meet the attackers, distress filtering through several of the militia at the sight of the automatons. Brandin&#39;s fury has been stoked. No doubt these people will die...unless he steps in. 

&quot;Brandin, forgive me, but your Copper Knights are not enough. I will join...you saw me at my worst. Your impressions can only improve from here, geheheheh.&quot;

A toothy grin plastered across his face, Jampo takes the next step...literally. As he steps over the edge, his Qi flares once more, coiling around his legs, bracing each with a surge of power as he falls from the towering height of Dolorous Gard and smashes into the battlefield. Frozen earth loosens from its hold with his arrival, sleet shattering beneath his feet. He levels his gaze, taking in the sounds of metal clashing and discerning where he might be needed. From the corner of his eye, a Copper Knight lifts its halberd high, aiming to split the skull of one such militia, their eyes replaying every moment of their life before their demise...</span>

A blow strikes through the snow, a palm landing right in the middle of the man&#39;s chest, enough force to blow him back into the surrounding forest, but not enough to break anything important. A light tap, or as Bug might call it, a snooze button, and more importantly, a button that saves one from imminent danger. 

&quot;Well...I suppose it&#39;s time to test myself once more. Whoever wins this battle is the more righteous one. There&#39;s no shame in losing to warriors that put others before themselves...&quot; 

Jampo launches himself into the fray, his power flaring and his Qi reinforcing his body against oncoming blows. No one has to die today...he&#39;ll make sure of it.</span>

Sure, <em>he</em> might care. But the person who put them in charge of this operation didn’t care. As a matter of fact, he wanted to keep the status quo! It was perhaps the only reason they operated in an alliance in the first place. 

It went even further when Lancer brought forth an actual person from the crowd. It was hard to not feel a sudden pang of guilt when he spoke. What had he done to help? Nothing, of course. It was hard to help the common man out, sure, but there wasn’t an attempt. Maybe--

No, now wasn’t the time! He was falling victim to his own mind yet again, just like at the Beach. He shook his head and gave himself a few smacks on the cheeks. It was time for combat!

Combat… with civilians. Trained for a day. It sure was hard to ignore all these thoughts inside his head when he was subjected to situations that brought them to center stage! Maybe it was just the weather that brought him down. Put him in this foul mood. 

Unfortunately, that was all the thinking he could manage before the gate opened to a degree. A small horde of bronze filtered out and rushed ahead to meet the guests, weapons drawn and emotions absent. He had heard about these unfeeling machines, but it was much different seeing them in person. Lancer wasted no time as he was the first to meet them, a counter attack launched as soon as it could be. 

Quickly, the scene descended into chaos overall. About half of the militia joined in, doing their best to defeat the knights. They were doing… alright, to put it nicely.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Then Jampo came down. 

From up high, he <em>jumped</em> off the top of the tower. He was a streak of light and flesh, a lighting bolt from the clouds. He landed with a force like a pallet of bricks as ground gave way and any piled up snow was blown outward. The monk too wasted no time in engagement. A man was punched out of the way from a Copper Knight, saved but out for the count. 

Well, that was probably his que. Lark rushed forward, violin at the ready. A hearty song started playing as he entered the fray, an uplifting march to inspire confidence in the men. Each note held purpose, each measure to the beat of the heart. He too felt the chills of the music as his pace increased to almost superhuman speeds, his heart an engine. Maybe there was a chance after all!

And he charged right towards Jampo, arguably one of the most dangerous men in the midst of combat.

“Shall we dance?”</span>

Frowning at the gall of these ordinary folk to involve themselves in a battle between servants and the true participants that spoke honeyed words into their ears while leading them to certain slaughter.

Brandin raised a hand, it would be an extraordinarily simple matter to end the lives of these simple folk with just a flick of his wrist. To show these fools the powers they dare meddle with…

At that moment, Jampo entered the fray and knocked out one of the rebels. Specifically to prevent them from being finished off by a Copper Knight. An action that did not go unnoticed by Brandin.

Brandin paused, Dolorous Gard was complete but it was still a bit early to handle the problem that was his Master.

“Fine then, we’ll see how far your pacifism really takes you.” Brandin said to himself.

With that, Brandin turned the full wrath of the curse of Dolorous Gard onto Lancer. The weight of the cursed energies crushing past his Magical Resistance. Lancer could feel his limbs grow heavy as the curse slowed down his movements.

The hit and run tactics Lancer employed failed as the Copper Knights were able to keep up with his movements. Three Knights broke off from the brawl to surround Lancer in an attempt to overwhelm him.

Meanwhile, while the civilians had numbers and morale on their side, the Copper Knights were no simple opponents for them. They were unfeeling automatons who knew no mercy, no rest, no retreat. The simple weapons and minimal training they received paled in comparison to the magically enhanced armor and weapons, and cold calculating battle tactics of the Copper Knights.

The flow of battle was even for the moment,  but in an instant could turn disastrous for the civilians involved if nothing was done.  <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The battle had begun in earnest and both sides were giving it their all. Jampo joined the fray but seemed like he was attempting to not kill any of the civilians, intriguing. Lark had appeared before him and challenged the monk, that was likely not the best course of action but part of their growth together was about them trusting each other. Lancer’s master was someone who at the very least could hold his own for a little while until aid could arrive. Lark needed to take what he’s learned and contribute as much as he could. This will be a challenging fight, but one that they could prevail in. 

Many things were occurring all at once, now that combat had fully been set into motion. Each one carrying its own purpose and design for victory. To begin with Uther felt the magical energy course into him and unexpectedly smirked, thinking to himself <em>”So that’s one of its functions, he intends to put weights on me.”</em> A powerful maneuver, but potentially fruitless against the one he was employing it against. Uther was naturally fast, but he learned long ago from Merlin that men are naturally limited in their God born physical bodies. To exceed past ones limitations they needed to reach beyond the natural and take a power of their own to compensate for their shortcomings.  It was a good maneuver the knights were employing, surround the slowed opponent and attack from all sides. What they didn’t count on was Uther being able to rekindle his speed in a</span>

Wind began to swirl build up around the man’s calf’s and as the knights started their strike, almost akin to sliding across air Lancer would juke around one of the knights lunging forward with a halberd. Grabbing ahold of the staff of the weapon, he’d allow the momentum from the attack to carry on forward and would force the struck to continue forward into the knight across the way plunging into the center of its chest. He’d continue to run forward before taking a hard stop to swing both opponents off of the weapon into a nearby wall. From there he dashed backwards and swiftly jammed the point of the halberd into the head of the third knight that approached him, twisting it well to get full damage, before slinging the automaton off the weapon. It was quick succession of movement and action that was likely not expected, but they did succeed in temporarily halting Uther’s hit and</span>

To Jampo and Brandin they only saw a total of 35 civilians coming to fight, a decent size but nothing that one could consider a substantial army. Luckily unbeknownst to them there were far more volunteers literally waiting in the wings. Uther jumped backwards further away from the castle and the battlefield before he held up a hand sign in the middle of the air. Almost mechanically the civilians that were battling the Copper Knights quickly retreated backwards, despite not taking heavy losses yet. They all sought cover behind wreckage and inside the entrance of buildings. One brave man even ran to over to take ahold of the individual that got knocked out by the tree and dragged him away. If Lark saw this occurring he’d be aware of what was about to take place, and it would be his option if he wished to run or not. After a brief moment of confusion from the opponent, a sudden rumbling sound was heard from 3/4 of the street around them. A short distance away out of immediate eyesight were more of the volunteered civilians, specifically the construction crews who sat in seven separate hydraulic excavator machines that had the mouth of their cranes filled with a large round boulder in each one. There was three on both the left and the right and one large farther down the street behind them. Once the civilians were clear Uther closed his fist and immediately all of the excavator operators pulled hard back on their controls launching the boulders directly at the area filled with the copper knights, almost akin to moser day day trebuchets. As an added consequence, right before the stones made contact with the enemy each of the operators clicked a trigger that they were individually given that when pressed made the sides of rock explode outwards. So in turn the</span>

This was a form of destruction and warfare that was common in Uther and Brandin’s time, a precursor to modern day bombing. Jampo would see and likely recognize this tactic as well, but even more so the monk might have noticed that the first signal Uther gave was that for his men to retreat before he called for the attack. Although they apparently had different ways of facing the problems of the world around them, it be clear that Lancer did not want for any unnecessary bloodshed either.</span>

Brandin undoubtedly would not approve, but there was still much for that knight to learn, after all. Death only bleeds the soul, much like the body...to build foundations on top of it leads to a very unsound structure. Jampo was no fool, however; of course not everyone today could be saved. The mere building of Dolorous Gard proved that to be a fool&#39;s errand, but he could do his part to stay true to his soul. No matter how loudly the beast within knocks...he would hold it at bay. For himself, for the brave soldiers here, and for his masters...his family.

Meditating on the field is a dangerous endeavor, one he&#39;s reminded of when his peace of mind is broken by the Master of Lancer. The strings of bravery flow across the field and light upon the fire of each militia member, spurring them to action and crashing their blades against the immovable stalwart Copper Knights. A leader in the making...if he wasn&#39;t mistaken, this was Lark de Allegro. He had heard of the man&#39;s exploits, his character...it made him strive every day to be better.</span>

The monk smiles softly, eager to take this chance to engage his opponent and clear his mind. The troubles of today shall remain, but in the grip of battle...the only danger is right in front of you, a comforting thought. &quot;Of course, Master of Pendragon. Don&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;m a few years ahead of you, however.&quot; Levelling his hands, Jampo&#39;s power flows once more, expanding out in a purple haze that surrounds him in and Lark in a bubble of &#39;Qi.&#39; The old man braces himself, ready to dart forward for the first blow, only to hear Uther&#39;s call to arms. The sudden retreat takes the monk aback, he half expecting that they were retreating, but that couldn&#39;t be, not with the stature of power on display by Lancer team.   It was only from the eclipsing of the overhead sun that he could piece it together.  Catapults.  Or, makeshift ones, at least.</span>

&quot;<strong>MOVE!</strong> A sudden force pushes against Lark, moving him away as rubble descends from on high, several of the boulders exploding upon impact against the automatons, others still approaching from above, including one particularly large monolith, whose shadow overtook Jampo&#39;s frame. Tactics befitting the age of Knights, the monk grits his teeth before recalling his field, his body wrapped in a luminescent, crimson glow. Lark could see the transformation at play, the monk&#39;s mana slowly expanding the already impressive physique as muscles began to bulge against his skin, almost threatening to burst through. The boulder comes closer, its surface but a jump away as Jampo raises his hands. What kind of fool would risk all of this for just-

It was as if the moon was suspended mere inches from the ground, the snow and dirt forming a small crater beneath as it floats aloft, held by the strength alone of Jampo underneath. His eyes bulge under the weight, but still, the rock rises slightly, bit by bit, the monk slowly lifting it over his head as he stares off into the distance, looking for the purveyor of this destruction. &quot;I do much better...fighting with...my hands...why don&#39;t we stick to such <em>grk</em> methods...grrr....rrngh.....RRRRAAGH!&quot; With a shiver along his shoulders, his body ripples and tosses the boulder back, shrapnel exploding and striking his body while also sending more across the field, even towards Lark. 

Veins bulge and his body shivers as the power subsides, ebbing away as he silently rages inside against the swirl of power burgeoning for release, drooling lightly as he turns back to Lark. &quot;Master of Uther...Lark de Allegro...I will fight you...but tell your Servant, no matter how much he throws...I will stand against it all.

Expanding his Qi once more, Jampo takes a firm stance, panting as sweat drips along the edge of his body, heat emanating from him as his power exerts itself once more and begins lifting the rubble around him. Everything within the bubble rises steadily, spinning in place before levelling their edges towards Lark. &quot;I will show you how far I&#39;ve come...I have trained for 50 years, Lark de Allegro...this is the power that shows for that dedication!&quot; The stone pieces fly forward, Jampo&#39;s supply bringing the strength of a whole boulder back down on Lark.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark was so ready to have a nice proper duel, too. His blood was eager to get some action in, his mind already juiced up with enough adrenaline to put a leopard to shame. Even Jampo seemed ready. A small purple dome expanded past them, a small arena fit for the two.

Then that damn Call came. Within moments, the rats were scurried back into whatever holes they could crawl into. Men unable to do so were dragged away by the brave. All that left was Lark surrounded by Knights and one very buff Master. 

Oh, and the heaps of rubble headed his way. 

Lark was ready to dodge the bowling balls, but Jampo beat him to the punch with a punch. A forceful palm struck him dead center in the chest, and was now flying. Out of the path of the boulders, into the nearby wall of an abandoned building. He hit the bricks firmly with his back and collapsed to the ground. All the wind was knocked out of his chest, and it would definitely leave some bruises come tomorrow, but he would live.

So would the monk. His muscles expanded past human, maybe even <em>superhuman</em>. And he <strong>grabbed</strong> the rock. And then threw it away, nothing more than a heavy weight. Shrapnel flew around the point of impact. Small shards flew into Jampo, and towards Lark himself. He feebly held up his hand to protect his face as chunks pelted his body. That didn’t feel too great either, but nothing worse than what just happened.

And what was to come too. Now there were multiple pieces of rubble suspended in the air. All aimed towards him. He sure was willing to fight, and so was his opponent! Good.</span>

His tune sprang back to life in an instant, picked up from where he was forced to leave off just moments before. With his enhanced agility brought forth once again by that springly light, he was able to just <em>barely</em> avoid the large stones. 

Each edge was less than a foot away, a new dance with a path straight out of harm’s way. One wrong step and he’d have to watch his body get scrapped off the pavement. What absolutely heart-racing, spine tingling joy! 

When the last one fell and the dust settled, Lark leapt back into action. He approached Jampo as he had once before, a smile plastered on his face and eyes thirsty for more. “Savants seldom see sights outside their area of expertise! Sorry, I ran out of words that start with S!” 

He wouldn’t try to attack, but dodge all the ones that went his way. He neglected the knife that sat in his belt, unable and unwilling to draw the steel.</span>

Not only did Lancer simply power through his curse, but these rebels were more prepared than initially thought. Those strange machines acting as some type of siege weapon. Already, five Copper Knights laid defeated on the ground from the combined efforts.

Brandin mentally ordered the Copper Knights in reserve. From murderholes within the walls of the keep, a volley of arrows descended down onto the crowd.

Brandin then snapped his fingers and Lancer felt the cursed upon him shift and twist. The weight upon him had lifted, but now it attacked his eyes. Patches of darkness blurred his vision, preventing him from getting a complete view of the battlefield. <span class="mention" title="Gilan#1083">@Gilan</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The siege of boulders worked to perfection, knocking out half of the forces sent out against them. As the dust settled, Uther briefly caught sight of his master facing off against Jampo. After reading about the subtle information given to them from Laurent about the master of Saber, Lancer had a feeling that it might not be good for Lark to face off with him for too long. At some point the king may have to step in and offer assistance, however, Lark has been wanting to prove his metal for the longest time now and Uther did not want to interrupt him just yet. His master had something to prove to himself and others, to deny him that now would be a disservice to the relationship they had built so far. Besides, Lancer had his own responsibilities to manage during this fight. There were still Knights upon the field that needed to be dealt with.

Right as Uther was about to move the weight upon his body lifted, but was then shifted to a different curse entirely. Lancer’s eyes became foggy and his vision of the field before him blurred. If it wasn’t for his magical resistance the effect may have been far worse. He could still relatively make out where objects and people were, but his precision of sight was in fact compromised. This may prove to be slightly tricker to mitigate than the last curse. 

Aside from the new drawbacks that befell the servant the sound of released arrows filled his ears, which gave him the immediate realization that Archers had just joined the fray. Fortunately, a majority of the civilian warriors had already moved in doors to ensure safety from the plummeting</span>

Uther felt horrible that he could not properly make out his troops and offer them more supple aid, however, he did not need to see them to offer his protection. So long as they could see him, his warriors were filled with an endurance that excelled beyond the average human. In addition to that, those who carried riot shields into combat did their best to cover themselves any others beside them from the projectiles. It was minor defense, but every little bit helped. Through this combination they slightly reduced the amount of people perishing from the onslaught. Despite that there were still unlucky ones who’d find the point of an arrow shoot through their gullet or catch them in the back killing them instantly. In total of the 35 civilians that charged within the front lines, 12 have been taken out so far, only one of which was knocked unconscious by Jampo. The others laid dead upon the ground, many bleeding into the street for Jampo to see. Unlike before where the death of the children was an unfortunate consequence of the growth of Dolorous Gard, this time Saber and his master were responsible for the intentional demise of Olympians.

The sight of this shook those who were behind cover and only served to infuriate them more. Many brave souls ran back out as the volley died down enough for them to move safely across and a total of 6 of them stood on either side of Lark and Jampo,</span>

Even though Uther was not jumping in himself, it was clear that a standing order had been made to some civilians that Mr. De Allegro was to be protected if at all possible. They had witnessed what the monk did earlier upon the field and seemed apprehensive to move too close, yet they still provided a barrier of bodies around the monk to more or less box him in, while Lark did what he could to combat him. 

While this occurred the other civilians moved further inwards to the building in order to prepare for their next stage of the assault, dragging out several duffle bags. The construction workers operating the excavator machines slowly began to reload their cranes with new sets of boulders, most likely to unleash their next siege attack. Each individual crane had 3 individuals with it. One operated the machine, the other helped load the rocks, while the third one stood upon an elevated position above them either on a scaffolding or a ledge. These particular men were selected for this spot for one specific reason, they were the ones that owned hunting rifles of their own. Their job was to provide cover fire for any distance fighting that the enemy employed. Once the arrows flew, it became their time to shine. Ever rifleman racked their weapon and proceeded to fire upon any small hole they witnessed projectiles shooting out from.

Each civilian was working to their specific task and purpose, no job was a small job, each act added the the overall success of the campaign. If they were going to get through this it would be due to the community straightening their backs and coming together to repel an unwanted force.

Uther could not see the details of the action around him from his troops, but he trusted that they would press on like he showed them and had full confidence that they would make him proud. Now in regards to his own plight, Lancer had to answer back for the plague put upon him. Regardless of how they try to keep him down, King Uther Pendragon was not going to falter or let up for a second regardless of what they put upon him. He’d raise his hand high up in the air, before forming it into a fist, and pounding the right side of his chest. Lancer could still make out the general location of each knight, and he had an idea in mind to combat them despite his accuracy being diminished. With him no longer being weighed down, Uther descended from his stand and rushed towards the remaining 5 knights on the field. The halberd still in hand invisible moves from the king’s calves and began to swirl violently all across the length of the elongated weapon. When he felt he neared close enough to his enemy Lancer swung the weapon inwards and outwards at each of them continuously moving back and forth between them not staying too long on each opponent. Due to his distorted vision it would be difficult for him to get a direct hit on the knights, but with invisible air surrounding the halberd any strike that remotely got close to them would cut into the knights with razor sharp magically infused wind as it passed by or through their path. It was an unconventional way to fight, but Uther had created a kingdom on not taking the predictable or average method. He was far from beaten or held back in this fight</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Brandin grimly looked upon the battlefield from the ramparts. He had underestimated the old king. Even with such meager forces, his strategy and power as a Servant were strong. On the other hand, Brandin was restricted in his movements, both by forces within and without.

The hunting rifles barely made any impact on the archers. Such low power mundane arms were ineffective against the unfeeling knights. Only slightly affecting their accuracy from the impact of the shots as the archers focused on the impromptu siege machines.

The five remaining Copper Knights surrounded Lancer. One unfortunate Knight was caught by Lancer’s attack and blown apart in an instant. The other then four stood just outside of Lancer’s blind swings. Striking at his blind spots before immediately pulling back. Like a patient pack of wolves. 

Through his misty vision, Lancer could see another two Copper Knight enter the fray. However, something was odd about these ones. They had entered the battlefield not from the front gate, but from around the side of the keep. Perhaps from another entrance?

Meanwhile, Jampo heard Brandin’s voice in his mind.</span>

Sweat continues beading across his face, though it wasn&#39;t physical exhaustion...it was mental. The cages inside were rattling themselves as the monk fights back the joy that was building behind his chest; too much excitement and it could all come undone...

&quot;Your focus is to be commended, I wouldn&#39;t have expected you to maintain such agility against my Qi,&quot; The monk continues, casting a glance to the soldiers beginning to surround he and his fellow Master, eager to corral the two tightly together. Perhaps this was a measure to distract Jampo? It isn&#39;t like he&#39;s worried for the safety of Dolorous Gard; it would take more than boulders to break down its walls. &quot;Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to use it to its full potential, Master of this City Grail War.

Jampo&#39;s words are cut off as he hears a snap. Copper grinds against itself as Brandin gives the order, his Master turning to the battlements, his eyes widening as he sees the glint of sunlight reflecting off the points of the sharpened arrow heads. He turns to watch figures of Lark and Lancer&#39;s army retreating, falling back while others bring out rifles to combat. &quot;No...Brandin...BRANDIN, STOP!&quot; he shouts, but the words are lost as arrows fly from their quivers, Hell visible through the slivers of light that break between each shaft as they soar overhead. The sky darkens as the cloud descends, the last moments for those caught in its crossfire being the last fleeting glimpse of a sun that blinds them right as an arrow lodges itself in their throat. Men fall as the sound of copper digging itself into the earth acts as a trumpet fire for their ascent to the world after, Jampo&#39;s eyes being lost in the red spray that exits each wound. These men...what sin have they committed? What sin is Jampo committing now...

Spasms overtake him, his body twitching as he looks back to the structure he guarded, red having completely overtaken the sky and casting the Middle English structure in a ghastly, evil shade.

Jampo punched himself square in the chest, his heart stopping a brief moment against the impact as life briefly flashed away from his eyes, the monk statuesque as he waits for the palpitations to return, slowly spreading the warmth of life back through him as he pushes the beast back down. It was quite clear to any that watched, especially Brandin now. There was something very wrong with this monk. 

&quot;...As you wish, Brandin. I shall lead by example,&quot; He says, simply as he turns back to Lark, his face set as he holds the Master in regard. &quot;Tell these men to retreat. I will fight you, but I don&#39;t wish for anyone else to die...&quot; Jampo&#39;s head hangs low as he thinks back on each of the bodies lying in the frozen dirt, their blood seeping through the cracks and being swallowed by the unforgiving land. &quot;...TELL THEM NOW!&quot; He shouts before dashing forward, arms shooting forth and stopping mere inches from Lark&#39;s chest. Fluid, practiced movement takes control as two fingers extend, the monk using an inch to gauge the distance between his fist and his opponent before...</span>

Even his violin fell silent as the light faded. A few dozen gleams introduced themselves from behind Jampo, and then they were flying forward. 

The only music that could be heard was the streak of arrows that went into a dozen men.

Lark could only watch as they were felled. Not everyone was unlucky enough to find themselves up one new sick inside their flesh, but those that were only made the sound of themselves hitting the ground and cries of pain and agony. The rest seemed to be even more incited, more makeshift siege weapons operated as even a select few joined the fray between himself and the monk.

The monk seemed even more shook than Lark. His eyes flashed red, a clear intent to kill risen from inside. He could only take a step back as a demon <em>almost</em> broke free. It wasn’t hard to picture what would’ve happened if it had won control: there’d be seven new bodies to join the rest. 

It took a powerful self blow to stop the monk, from none other than himself. That was too close, and Lark realized it. These men that Uther had instructed to keep an eye on him were nothing more than victims if his opponent got serious. Such, there was only one order to give.

“All of you, fall back!” he commanded, the same moment Jampo gave the same call. Each one of them hesitated, unsure on whether to heed the order of the musician or to obey the true commander around here. Lark helped them decide who to actually listen to with his instrument. With a quick swipe of the bow, an ugly note stung their ears. They each recoiled in pain before the spring light expanded and blew each one of them back. No one went further than a few feet, but that was enough to get the idea across.</span>

Geeves, all this time, had stayed back. There was little reason to join the fray with his older age and limited combat knowledge. Another set of eyes, sat atop a ledge on the second floor close by. With a pair of binoculars, he was able to clearly see the scope of the field. 

Yes, this was truly a war! Not one you’d see in standard times, but a battle from a bygone era. Both generals with outdated weapons and soldiers of varying degrees of skill. From when disease would kill better than any actual death blow and when skill trumped numbers every day of the week. When ideals were the reason and frustration was the driving force. 

Speaking of, it was both underway and almost ready to reach a climax. Almost all of the Knights had been vanquished or retreated, save for the group that was currently around Lancer. He had been busy with some unknown affliction, but powered through nonetheless. A perfect motivator, all things considered. Said motivation drove the rest of the men into arms, with more machinery launching rocks whilst gunmen provided cover fire. And best of all, the men who were currently busy with a secret mission were getting close to done.

Lark had distracted the enemy Master, and was doing a great job of it. He… pushed them away? That was odd. Maybe they were in danger from Jampo? The file had mentioned that he was a monster of a person, perhaps the push had saved them.

Upon closer inspection, they all looked confused. Baffled, even. So that threw that idea out the window. Maybe some Archers had decided to fire upon them? But no arrows lay around the small group at all, nor were any approaching them. What was--</span>

His blood grew cold, his hands struggled to keep the binoculars steady. The monk had a strained look, and his fist was extended. His liege looked visibly unaware. A hand that clutched the bow was pressed against the point of impact, and he fell to a knee.

The binoculars followed the idea from earlier, and Geeves followed as well. He almost fell down upon impact, but somehow managed to stay on his feet. With a few shakey steps, he launched himself towards Lark. Lancer might’ve seen the butler make his mad dash towards his liege, but if there were any attempts to stop him they would fall flat. Absolutely nothing would stop him.

Not even the rage of someone as strong as God.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The king continued to press on, he felt one knight fall to his strength yet he could tell the others were apprehensive to truly engage him. Choosing to instead to prod at him as if he was helpless animal, have they not learned by this point that such tactics would have minimal effect on him. There were a few stray lucks that struck against his leg, or at his side, but considering he was not fully blinded he was able to sway majority of the attacks away. He was about to engage once more when he heard shrill yell across the field. <em>”TELL THEM NOW!”</em> followed by the voice of his master calling out “All of you, fall back.” Then the cracking sound of something hitting against armor. He could sense his master was still alive, but from feeling of the situation Lark’s time on the field had likely run its course for the moment. Calling out mentally to his master, Uther said “<em>Lark I hope you are alright, you’ve done well master, but I think it’s time for you to seek shelter. Phase 3 is now in motion and you don’t want to be on the field for this. Let me take it from here. Currently my eyes by some sort of curse, If you wish to further assist me, mentally communicate where any enemies are in relation to me at any given moment so that I can be more aware of my surroundings. You did well Lark, I’m proud of you, you have been a true hero of the people today.</em>”

With that Uther raised his fist once more in the air and this time he extended three fingers before bringing it down to his chest once more. All of the warriors knew what to do at this point. First ones being that of the brave souls that came to Lark’s aid in addition to Geeves who took a defensive stance standing in front of his own master.</span>

All at once each of them stood up and ran to cover as instructed while two remaining ones tried to push Geeves and Lark along to safety. Their standing order was to ensure Lark’s safety and due to what they understood of the plan, they didn’t need telepathy to know they needed to get out of there.

The arrows fell upon the construction workers in retaliation of their previous attack, striking a few of the rifle men or one of the spotters. However, as one or two of the drivers got hit, one of the other men jumped into the seat and began to operate the machine. They knew the importance of this part and was not going to let it falter. Soon all the boulders had been reloaded and were ready for dispersal. 

One small group that had briefly hidden in the buildings were rummaging through duffle bags they had carried into the battle. They quickly pulled out pieces to a large cylindrical device that they had begun to construct. One of the more unique pieces of riot gear provided by Laurent Mackenzie, it was almost akin to a large saucer that sat upon a tripod. There was a designated large battery pack alongside it as well. They then placed it in the center of an open window, directed it in the direction of Jampo, before turning on the power. 

On the backside of the castle away from the eyes of Jampo, Brandin, even Uther was the demolition crew had begun this whole invasion. Due to a signal they received from the king at the beginning of the campaign</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">before they even marched against the enemy, the entire crew had stealthy moved around the exterior sides and back of the castle placing charges systemically all across the perimeter and face of the structure along the way. It was Uther’s intention with the first explosions was to draw out the enemy to the front and keep the focus on the main troops, although a small part of him hoped the gate would be effected in some way. Despite that he called for them to go around and place more down, the new hope was that the structure would be weaker on other sides of the castle based on the way it reacted to the first attack. There was no guarantee the tactic would have any different then it did last time, but they had to at least try. The maneuver needed to take precision and time for it to be setup properly, which is what Uther, Lark, and the main forces provided. At last everything was set, and as the lookout of their squad saw the latest signal from their leader they knew it was the time of reckoning. From their own safe distance, each of the demolitionists clicked their triggers. 

Everything was occurring simultaneously. Although Uther was the final puzzle piece as his fist came down and the last mental word reached Lark’s mind Lancer jumped high up into the air, leaving behind halberd. As he soared up high into the air, a bright yellow glow appeared in the center of Uther’s palm that elongated into a tall golden Lance much larger than himself. As it formed and gained energy the different seals of conditions began to release. 

<em><strong>1. The enemy must be more powerful than oneself.
2. The enemy must not be an elemental
3. The battle must be for truth
4. The battle must be to live
5. The battle must be to defend human order
6. One&#39;s comrades-in-arms must&#160;be courageous.
7. The battle must not be against one pure of heart.</strong></em>

At once the saucer like device emitted a sonic wave of noise directly at Jampo that would be stomach curdling and like nails being shoved in his ears. This device was typically used in order to disrupt or destroy eardrums, and incapacitate those caught in its beam. There is severe pain to the eyes, head, and most certainly the ears, as if nails were being shoved in each one. These civilians were trying to disorient the monk’s mind and body long enough to keep him in place for what was to befall him. 

Those brave souls were willing to do whatever it took to assist in what they knew was about to occur that involved the next seven boulders being launched out at the field each one in relatively similar locations, one of which being right on top of Jampo, while the rest were aimed at the field filled with knights and those murder holes filled with archers. Same effect as as before, exploding rock craters and shrapnel. 

On the sides and rear of the castle the secretly placed detonations, almost in sequence, took off in a series of explosions that entrapped the castle in flame and concussive force. Each</span>

Lastly was Uther’s contribution, holding the Lance aloft he fixed his aim and trusted in his heart for it to be true. The golden energy swirled and violently began to build up to what felt like an unnatural degree. He held his own weapon back in previous battles out of fear of harming innocent civilians. However, the civilians were on his side. From what he knew they had all fled to cover, and the enemy he fought against was merely automatons and a tyrant. To put an end to it all, he’d have to employ it eventually. So with resolve in his heart he braced himself and at the top of his lungs he’d shout out the True Name of his Noble Phantasm, <em><strong>Rhongomyniad!</strong></em> In a sudden burst Uther shot forward at an extreme speed, far faster than his normal pace in battle without restraint. It was as if the a shooting meteor had come forth in the center sky above the battlefield, it was both beautiful and terrifying to behold. Uther shot forth directly at the castle and upon impact a large explosion of magical energy surged around the encompassing area covering the seven knights on the field, wrapping to any of the archers that the boulders and demolitions could not vanquish on their own, and covering primarily the front half of the structure itself. In Brandon’s file it spoke of the legend of Lancelot that faced off against Dolorous Gard and its 20 Copper knights and was only granted entry after defeating them. That was the king’s suspicion, to breach the knights must also be defeated. As his attack as well as the others that occurred alongside him simultaneously, Uther hoped that this would be enough to knock the Lord down a peg.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For a moment, Brandin felt a bit of fear of the monk as the demon inside was almost unleashed. Fortunately the moment passed and Jampo seemed to be taking the situation more seriously now.

Brandin then turned his attention to the ants scurrying around his keep. The small army Lancer and his Master were well organized and busy, scuttling about with their modern, mundane instruments.

Then Brandin felt the change in the air. That brilliant pillar of light coming from Uther was unmistakable. He was about to unleash his Noble Phantasm, the pillar of the world, Rhongomyniad. 

Immediately, Brandin recalled his Archers back, deeper into the keep. The next wave had to be ready. The Copper Knights outside were already lost.

“So he intends to destroy Dolorous Gard in its entirety. I will not be bested again by some self-righteous brat!”

Brandin snapped his fingers.

The curse left Uther’s eyes and dug into the Sacred Lance itself. Sapping it’s energy and eating away at its brilliant light. But even the powerful curse of Dolorous Gard wasn’t enough to completely snuff out the light of the Sacred Lance.

Rhongomyniad blasted the front gate at the same time a series of explosions went off. The six Copper Knights outside were vaporized in an instant. However, when the smoke and dust cleared, Dolorous Gard still stood.

The walls had been compromised with large holes blown in them, but the gate still stood, somewhat battered and dented. The Cursed Energy still lingered over the battlefield but the repeated attacks on the keep and the destruction of the Copper Knights had lessened its presence.

The gates then began to grind as something began to open them.</span>

Not enough to kill him, but hopefully enough to put aside this duel. The battle was blossoming into a splattered massacre, the sickly stench of copper permeating every crook of the battered arena as both Brandin&#39;s knights and Lark&#39;s militia fell between their continuous onslaught. He could make out Uther&#39;s armaments preparing themselves for another volley of stones, Jampo himself finding things quite tiresome as his breath heaves. Was there any point in these displays of power besides the same wish? Perhaps this man had better aspirations, anyway. Jampo can&#39;t help but reflect, thinking back to his own family...his old temple...what would his masters think now?</span>

Dazzling light shines through the darkness clouding Jampo&#39;s vision. He turns along with several remaining soldiers towards the glow that gathers in the sky above, a pillar of angelic collection pulsing with power as the sacred chants were bellowed. The Pillar of the World. <strong>Rhongomyniad.</strong> &quot;No-&quot; Was all the monk could say before Uther Pendragon unleashed the power of one worthy of standing atop the world. With how close they were, the resulting blast would surely bury each of them beneath the rubble of Brandin&#39;s creation, Lark himself still recovering from Jampo&#39;s blow as well as the militia that stayed behind to aid him. So many people have already died...

&quot;...Brandin...is this worth it? Your ambition...and my wish...I can&#39;t stand to see an Olympia built on the backs of those it was meant for...this is not what my masters would have wanted...this...this is not the path to enlightenment...&quot; The monk mutters under his breath, his Qi extending out as he prepares himself for the result of Uther&#39;s attack. This was a Noble Phantasm, eh? This brilliant glow...it was a welcome distraction from the darkness that steeps itself within the Well. If only temporary.</span>

The blast bears itself against the foundations of Dolorous Gard, and bathes Jampo and the others in a brilliance of light and heat. Rubble cascades over them, Jampo&#39;s Qi catching as many as the monk could hold while taking the brunt of the stones, several skidding across his skin and leaving deepened scars. And from the dust that clears, the shadows surge to reclaim the day. 

&quot;You,&quot; the monk says, hissing out the words as the rubble falls around him. The Black Knight rises. &quot;Brandin! How many more of those can we withstand?! The Black Knight must attack Uther alone! Steer it from the civilians!&quot; he calls to the ramparts, making demands of Saber. As if he had such power to begin with. &quot;I will fight by my ideals, Saber, but know this; you will not kill anymore of these men! If you do, our promise will be empty and this partnership falls! Uther, and Uther alone!&quot;</span>

* I’m nothing more than a—<em>*

He never finished that sentence. While Geeves dragged him away and the few men either helped drag or block Jampo, the workd exploded into a world of light. It was hard to do anything but pay attention as Lancer unleashed his weapon. Sealed with a set of holy conditions, it seemed each one had been met in some capacity. To him, at least. 

Rhongomyniad was unleashed from her sheath and brought forth upon the grand castle.

And still it stood. Even worse, now there were more Copper Knights, more weapons unleashed upon the commoners. He wish they stood a chance, had some ace up their sleeve, but that was more than likely the last card left in the pile. 

The musician fumbled for his belt, all his might focused on the menial task. One of the militia grabbed his instrument, almost forgotten with his new plan. 

A blade was drawn. Short, capable of little if anything. He struggled against the people, desperate to get up and *fight</em>. 

“Stop,” Geeves said. “You’re spent! What good will your knife do?”

“More good than… whatever’s going on now!”

A twist freed his left side, and from there he freed his other side. With the coordination of a drunk and the will of a martyr, Lark was up. He pushed the two that carried him away, and they landed on the ground with surprise.

And he stumbled towards Jampo. Dead, exhausted look in his eyes. The knife never more than a moments notice away from the ground. 

“One life… for the many!” He yelled, point extended towards the Monk. Whose life did he mean?</span>

This battle has been nothing but a contest between their Servants...both of them were merely bystanders to the clash of light and darkness, but even now Lark has the strength to stand by his own convictions.

&quot;Listen to your comrade. You are spent. That blow was meant to knock you unconscious; it&#39;s a wonder you&#39;re awake now.&quot; He heaves a small breath before taking a stance, his hands brought up as a last bit of warning before they catch Lark&#39;s next words. One life...for many...

&quot;...Lark, you cannot absolve yourself entirely of blame, either. Do not show me such disrespect by returning to such a simple outlook. You stirred my heart deeply when you corrected my wish...I&#39;d expect you to hold to those ideals, even in the face of such opposition. Are you truly the Master of the Pillar of the World? Do you stand with him? Then you must accept your own sins...just as I now am accepting mine.&quot; His hands fall as he turns once more to Dolorous Gard, watching as the Copper Knights retreat in on themselves from the blast.

The monk&#39;s head lowers, his resolve shaking and his ideals quickly fading as he regards Lark and Geeves once more. Lark has a family...someone to help steer him right. Jampo hasn&#39;t had anything like that for 50 years. He&#39;s only had himself...and the demon. &quot;Lark...if you can kill me, then perhaps your dream is truly the greater one.

This is a battle of ideals, Lark...show me the brilliance that shines within you!&quot; Jampo says before stomping the ground, his power flowing once more as a blue light radiates from his body, his muscles soaking in his Qi and reinforcing themselves as he dashes forward. One punch is reared back, aimed for Lark&#39;s skull. It seems fairly clear now; Jampo would no longer hold back.

Unfortunately it still stood and more enemies took their place. Like the castle Uther still stood tall, yet he had expended a great deal of energy to accomplish that feat. Now he and his master truly needed to work together and trust each other. He heard Lark’s thoughts before, how they sounded uncertain and non confident. <em>”If that’s the way you see yourself then fine. I will deny that you are out of your element. You are not a fighter, you weren’t that good, and you had little business being on the front lines. But you chose this, you accepted responsibility. Now regardless if you believe yourself worthy of being a leader, these people are counting on you to be one right now. Do what you must, but I’m still out fighting for you, these civilians, and all of Olympia. My last attack drained a large chunk of my mana, so I will be sharing with you for the time being. I will try not to do anything too large like my last maneuver, but in return I need you to not overexert yourself beyond what’s necessary. Your discretion gives me power. We can do this master, we can win, I just need you to lend your aid a little bit more, and in return I’ll lend you mine.”</em> 

Instantly invisible air moved from Lancer and danced over to his master quickly forming around Lark’s free arm forming a flat surface in the form of a shield. It contained all the same properties as the normal technique with the whipping razor sharp wind. Yet it would not once strike out at Lark. The shield could be used both offensively and defensively if used correctly and was not cumbersome in any way allowing the musician to</span>

This was a prime example of the bond that had grown between the two, Uther was giving up one of his defensive tactics to aid his partner. This time not making him invisible or putting him in a bubble, but giving him the means to fend for himself, to give him a fighting chance against a strong opponent. In the simplest way this exemplified the whole strategy of Uther during this battle. No one person can do it alone, it takes teamwork and trust to win the day. There was still fight in the King and he hoped there was still some gumption in his master.

Suddenly the Black Knight arrived with murderous intent in his eyes and charged at the king. It was clear that this guy would be far more troublesome than the others and that brute force may not be enough. I’m addition without invisible air, he’ll have to incorporate his actual battle prowess. If it wasn’t clear by this point Uther was not a general who commanded from the side lines, he was up front in thick of it with his soldiers. One of his key factors was being able to strategize and adapt while in the heat of battle. Based on their behavior and summoning, the knights appeared to be an active part of the structure and territory itself. The major curse had worn off at this point but he couldn’t afford to be hindered again. Uther knew if he was</span>

As the Black Knight neared the king, he reared the holy Lance back and acted as if he going to pierce in the center of the behemoth’s mass. However, at the last one he pointed the downwards releasing a miniature explosion of energy by his opponent’s feet. It was far from as mana intensive as his last attack only enough to catch the Black Knight off guard as Lancer jumped far backwards across the field, further from the structure. “Are you meant to be the last line of defense, Brandin really must think so little of me. I hope you fight better than your comrades, otherwise I’m going to feel insulted.” 

On the other sides of the battlefield sat the different citizens deciding on what they should do next. After all their efforts the castle still stood, and more knights marched outwards although not as many as before. The demolition crew saw the damage the caused, but the symbol of their subjugation did not fall. The construction workers saw the bodies of a portion of their comrades laying dead from the previous volley of arrows and seeing much larger ones aimed towards them. The men who tried to usher Lark along as well as those hiding out in the building stared out at the marching knights towards, none were retreating yet. They simply</span>

One of the operators of the Excavation machines sat in his vehicle the motor still running, dust and blood across brow. He was having those same contemplations of what it was all about, then he glanced over at the fuel gauge where a small photograph of a beautiful brunette woman and a little girl that sat in her lap staring back at the man. The grip on the controls tightened as his heart began to beat faster, he stared back out at the field to see not only the king still fighting but his master seemingly doing the same. This lit a fire in his stomach as he shifted gears in the machine. Taking quick scoop of any large rocks they had piled up behind him, he floored on the gas as the vehicles revved forward with its load straight towards the enemy. The other civilians caught sight of this one Sieger breaking formation and charging the field. As he sped towards his target he gripped onto the crane lever and shouted at the top of his lungs “<em><strong>FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR OLYMPIA!</strong></em>” He then pulled back on his leaver launching forth several small boulders at the knights and archers, not as big as the massive ones launched before, and these did not have explosives but they shot forth in their own volley. Seeing this 6 of the civilians hiding inside rushed out in a fury, inspired by what they witnessed with their own weapons in hand ready to face the knights head on, regardless of the risk. Many of the wielded pickaxes while others fired their own shotguns at them. These brave souls intended to fight. The rest watched in marvel of their fellow men stepping up to the occasion to defend not only where they live but who and what they love.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“<em>Both of you, shut up!</em>” Lark yelled, physically and mentally. He used the makeshift wind shield to deflect Jampo’s immediate fist. It flew past his ear, inches away from his face. The first attempt to throw his brains outside his head failed, but without proper maneuvers the next one would. 

With his other hand, he slashed down with his dagger. Sloppy, a strike fit for a child. “I’m tired of being treated like this… wise sage, or destined leader of ye old! I dragged my feet every bloody step that lead us here, only to be told that I have to be a leader for those I can’t speak for. I’ve done no leading, and my ideals are naught but the sun Icarus flew towards!”

Another strike came his way, and this one was caught directly with the fake shield. He grunted from the impact, nearly sent back onto his ass once again. “I accepted responsibility for myself and any harm that came my way. I accepted the full weight of my sins. I can not accept responsibility for these people, as they are not mine. And our combined sins will help us grow into better people!”

His head throbbed, millions of neurons activated towards dozens of possible arguments. It was easy to have ideals, but it wasn&#39;t when you had to justify them whilst trying not to die. Especially when you also weren&#39;t sure if you believed in them entirely.</span>

A mere scratch. The monk listens once more, fist drawn back, ready to crumple Lark&#39;s shield, but he hears not a leader respond. But a person. 

&quot;...Is this how you truly feel?&quot; He says, fist falling slightly as he regards those around them. Was this his fate...to always be the Mad Monk? Surrounded by faces of fear, with people begging for some common ground? If he could not fight for his ideals, or their denigration...than what truly was the point? 

He looks back as new soldiers charge forward, eager to take the Copper Knights on while Uther clashes against the primordial evil that is The Black Knight. This was all his doing...Lark may be free, he accepted who he was...but has Jampo...

&quot;...This cannot go on...&quot; 

His arm pulls back. His shoulders slump. His reverent fury was gone...his eyes almost seem hollow...

&quot;I am done. This dream is foolish...this war is foolish...&quot;

&quot;BRANDIN!&quot; He shouts, turning back to the castle, glaring at the figure on top. This...this was always his destiny, wasn&#39;t it? To construct such a fearsome structure...to hold a city in panic...to be a monster. 

&quot;Brandin...I cannot go on. I cannot stand by this display. Call your Knights back, tear this wall down. This isn&#39;t worth such horror. Release us both from the War, Brandin, return to the Throne of Heroes...or <strong>I will have to force you to.</strong>&quot; 

Surrender. A strong man holds their ideals. But perhaps, the most powerful of all, recognize their ideals as faulted when the time comes.

Worse comes to worse, Lark had the perfect opportunity to stab Jampo in the back. End this entire fight right here. That’s what he wanted, right? The violence to end? 

The short blade clattered to the ground, muffled by the small pile of snow underfoot. Geeves gasped. He closed the distance, ready to hand the weapon back to his liege, so he could--

He used what little strength he had over the monk, in his moment of need, and swung him around to face the musician. While Jampo’s eyes might be empty, Lark siphoned the now missing rage into his own. His face was contorted, a struggle to change his exhausted look to a furious one.

<em><strong>SLAP</strong></em>

“Get a hold of yourself!” Lark said. He gripped his arms hard, with nails dug into his skin. “Dreams aren’t foolish! They are what keep people going! A purpose, a drive, a future worth waking up and getting out of bed for. If you want to abandon your dreams, then save us all the trouble and go crawl into a hole and <em>die</em>!”

He waited for a response. After all, he could simply be dead wrong entirely. If the monk wanted to chase his dreams this way, then he was more than welcome to. But if it were for any other reason, then there was a problem here.</span>

The Black Knight blasted right past the radiant lance&#39;s beam, still weakened by the curse. The Black Knight continued to charge, carrying Uther along at full sprint, right towards the charging excavator.

At this close of a distance, Uther could get a full glimpse of the sheer power of this being. It was the equivalent of an A-Rank servant. Outclassing even Ulther in a few areas. Uther also noticed a strange key hanging on a chain around the creature&#39;s neck.</span>

&quot;You dare...to have the gall to call me into this war to only pull out the instant the stakes of the situation get too real for you?!&quot; Brandin&#39;s voice filled with rising anger. &quot;Did you really think that you could&#39;ve made it to the top without getting your hands dirty at least once? I&#39;ve tried to be as accommodating as I possibly could, but I&#39;ve come too far to throw everything away because of a moment of weakness from you.&quot;

<em>SNAP</em>

Uther felt the curse completely leave his body as the dark, cursed energy leapt from him and streaked into Jampo.

&quot;I truly hoped to never have to do this, but you&#39;ve forced my hand Master. Now all these people have to die because of you.&quot;

Jampo felt the curse dig deep into his body. A similar feeling to that when Brandin had previously helped Jampo contain the demon inside him. But to Jampo&#39;s horror, the curse instead gripped at the thin walls of reasoning containing the beast inside...and shattered them.

Brandin then turned around and began to descend into Dolorous Gard.

&quot;What a mess of an affair.&quot; He said plainly to himself. &quot;Better make sure that there&#39;s no rats hiding trespassing on my property.&quot;</span>

At once he felt a semblance of his strengths return, although it was a relief to him, there was the feeling that the lingering energy had only moved somewhere else. Yet that is a worry that will have to wait a moment as he was being touted towards his allies machine. This knight truly was strong, and that key around its neck was curious, something the others did not have. However, despite the shift in power scale, his master still underestimated what the king was capable of, especially when he was being figuratively and literally pushed. “You really are a bruiser, but your lord really shouldn’t have released his hold on me, now you have to contend with someone who hits just as hard.” Gripping onto the back neck plate of the Black Knight, Uther reared Rhongomyniad behind himself, before swinging it upwards, and ramming the point of the holy Lance in the center chest plate of his opponent as they both collided into the excavator, the drive only providing more resisting force to shove the weapon deeper in. The impact buffeted Lancer pretty good, but so far in the fight up to this point he had only taken minor jabs of physical damage, so with a still active resolve as the machine toppled over onto its side Uther kicked his legs underneath the Black Knight, grabbed tightly upon the key, and proceeded to use the momentum of the charge to monkey flip him away from the king as well as to pull the key off the knight’s neck.

Standing up and brushing the dust and shards of metal off his shoulder, Uther glanced down to see the driver crawling out from the cab, the picture in his hand. He looked upset and distraught, staring at the woman in the photo he kept repeating loudly for those to hear. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” Uther felt pity for the</span>

Glancing back at the other militia behind him, there was an apologetic look on Uther’s face. “Leave now, any who do not have the heart left for this battle.” His expression then shifted again to that of determination once more turning back to prepare himself defensively for his opponent’s retaliation.

He did not say another word to any of them, he did not give them an order to continue on, perhaps he felt there was nothing more for them to do, perhaps he didn’t want to ask anymore of them to sacrifice their lives. Yet some of the civilians’s fists tightened upon their weapons even still. It was crazy to think they could overcome this insurmountable force, but Uther was still there. He had not backed down yet. Many of them were scared, many did not want to do it, but there were a few amongst the group that stood up and began to march out the door, a total of 15 with their clubs, hammers, and shotguns.

They saw what happened to the last guy that rushed out and yet they couldn’t sit back either. One jumped upon the shared radio frequency and called out “I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be taking orders from those lifeless metal heads. Charlie was brave, not only for us, but his kid as well. Let’s not let Charlie die out in the snow for nothing.” A series of ignitions revs once more as the remaining 6 excavators do as Charlie did, grab several of the remaining boulders and drive straight out onto the field behind the marching 15, firing their weapons, swinging at the enemies heads, flinging the stones outwards, and attempting to run those four coppers over if need be. 

On the opposite side of the field the demolition crew had already begun to move back to the front, and they bore witness to everything. Including the Archers ready to fire. They all looked at one another begrudgingly knowing what it was coming to. They weren’t meant to be front lines due to their expertise with explosives. This crew was the one that snuck around and was needed to tactically dismantle the castle while the others fought. However, they were warned by Uther that there may come a moment where’d they be obligated to step up and offer aid. Spreading out to safe distances between each other, each demolitionist opened their individual back packs revealing a stockpile of grenades in each one. This was going to be their contribution and hopefully something that will lend to their favor.</span>

There were 23 demolitionists that each tossed their own grenade while preparing to unleash many more to come. This was a preparation they hoped to utilize closer inside, but necessarily reared it’s ugly head. 

In total that was 44 of the remaining 60 civilians fighting in the field. The other 16 had their attention pulled to something else entirely. The 6 beside Geeves and Lark witnessed a change beginning to occur in Jampo, one that was affecting his demeanor and attitude. They could all sense something was wrong and immediately moved in front of Lark and Geeves and instructed them to move back while they held their weapons ready to defend. The 5 operating the Sonic Array saw this change as well and immediately turned the frequency much higher in the machine and once again aimed it Jampo in order to disorient and potentially cripple the monk’s movements. The last 5 hid further into the buildings away from sight, feeling they held little more to contribute as well as holding a fear of dying.</span>

&quot;Leave...&quot; The monk says, a last hoarse whisper before Jampo exits the stage. Within all of us lies some Ego, a figure that indulges in only the comforts of the flesh. For some it&#39;s moments of weakness, skipping a workout, indulging in the taste of sweets. For others, it&#39;s an explosive power, a moment of compulsion that drives us to momentary pleasure. 

For Jampo, his Ego can destroy worlds.

Ashura awakens. A moment of peace falls between both parties as the sounds of clashing steel and copper acts as mere white noise to the arrival of the demon. The snow around his feet starts to melt, sending veins of cool water to seep into the ground below...

And then he explodes. 

A guttural roar claws from his throat, and suddenly they were all bathed in an unfathomable heat. It bears its weight upon each as the demon breaks through the chains binding him, his eyes now glazed over in a mode of pure instinct. The sonic pulse strains to contain it, the beast slowly making his way to the soldiers, his presence only increasing the heat that seeps from the pits of Hell itself. He raises his arms, teeth bared like fangs as the monk grips the face of two soldiers. The heat...dear lord, the heat...

<strong>SPLICK!</strong>

A geyser of gore paints everyone and the slush around them in bits of brain matter, bone fragment and blood, the heat invading their bodies and forcing convulsions in their last death throes before each falls over. He moves on to the others, fear gripping them as Ashura begins a slow massacre that can only ratchet from here.</span>

All were in his sights as energy swirls in each hand, heat coiling around him before firing forth.

However, now was not quite the time for any sort of quips or attempts at humor. Especially when Lark witnessed Ashura come forth and waste no time in his conquest for an empty battlefield.

The six men that acted heroic didn’t act much at all after the monk killed them with no mercy. Lark wasn’t sure how to feel at this point, pushed back further and further via Geeves. His next immediate targets were… pretty much anyone in the way of the fiery balls of hellfire that approached the other parts of the battlefield. Snow underneath melted as they travelled, and it wasn’t hard to imagine what would happen if those made contact with anything living.

“Come on,” Geeves said, “we need to get out of here!” He carried Lark’s equipment in his hands, snatched from the men who surrounded them earlier. 

“I… don’t know what to do anymore.”

“What?”

“The man I thought I was going to have to talk to in a deep way is now on a murderous rampage unlike any other. I went from ‘fighting for a brighter tomorrow’ to ‘fighting because I want to’, Lancer became a Pillar of Light incapable of breaking even a single column of steel on that gate, even though he got close. And you still aren’t terribly phased by any of this. At least I’m confused.”

Geeves rolled his eyes, “Believe it or not, I’ve worked with your Father and your Sister before. The things I’ve seen haven’t been quite this bad, but they weren’t exactly pretty landscapes either.”

“I don’t think now is the time for jokes.”

“That’s what I’m supposed to tell you.”</span>

Maybe they weren’t Jampo, but he wasn’t about to stick a label on someone not intentionally a freak of nature. This wasn’t even their fault. Brandin was the cause of all of this, not themselves. <em>What a shocker.</em>

“How long do you think he can go for?” Lark asked. 

“The file didn’t say, but I can’t imagine it’s for too long. The amount of mana he’s burning must be great, and add to the fact that his Servant has a massive castle raised isn’t helping.”

Huh…

Lark grabbed the Violin from Geeves, “Well, that’s as good an excuse as any.”

“And what do you think you’re doing?”

“My best,” Lark said.

“More like your worst! If you die, all of this was for nothing!”

“If they live, then all of this was for nothing too.”

Ashura would see Lark once again on the fast track towards his location. “Over here, hot head! Come get me if you can!” 

If he didn&#39;t murder everyone in the area, then maybe Lancer could accomplish something important. If not... well it was a good run.</span>

The Black Knight stood tall in the snow-covered battle ground as mist began to rise from the heat of both the heat of Jampo&#39;s Qi and the jets of flame spewing out of the Black Knight&#39;s helmet. A small gash on the chest plate is all the damage Uther managed to inflict with his stunt. The Black Knight lets out a metallic roar as it furiously charges at Uther with unnatural speed.

As it approached, the Black Knight swung its axe along the ground and threw up a veil of snow and mist all around Uther. Immediately after, a rapid flurry of powerful axe swings came at Uther from all directions within the misty snow.</span>

Without the magical resistance of a servant, or even the aptitude of a magus, the curse instantly drains the life force of the man and kills him on the spot.

&quot;So you were the rats who went and blew holes in my keep.&quot; Brandin nonchalantly spoke from the shadows of one of the makeshift entrances in the walls. &quot;I spent a lot of effort in making these. I&#39;m going to have to do so much upkeep after this.&quot;

Brandin then flicked his finger and the cursed energy flew towards another one of the demolitionists. The cursed energy screamed past them and sucked them dry until they were just skin and bone. Brandin continued to move his finger like the conductor of an orchestra as the cursed energy danced around the civilians. Brandin paid no attention to their cries and instead focused on Ashura.

<em>So this is the power that monk was holding in all this time. How unruly. Fortunately, Lancer and his Master brought many bodies for him to burn through until he finally exhausts himself.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">First several demolitionists were taken out near effortlessly by Brandin, while the others to the side and the rear quickly ducked away and began to run back further into the field only to see the maniac monk losing his temper. It was the epitome of being between a rock and a hard place. Seeing what laid before them, the demolitionists threw a few more grenades in the direction of Brandin and the archers as the fled to the nearby buildings for shelter. Amongst the lord and the monk only 12 of the 23 were able to make it back. 

Although the copper knights did in fact take cover behind the one turned over excavator. The others still barreled towards them. One rammed right into them with the machine while three others swung the cranes like oversized bludgeoning weapons into the automatons. The remaining two pulled in front of Lark and Geeves to provide a modicum of cover themselves. Each of the operators were sweating up a storm from the heat. Trying to keep their heads low in the pods as flames struck against the sides of the machines and whizzed past their heads.

With key in hand Uther raised his Lance in defense against the behemoth’s blows. This may be the first match up where the king was being kept on his toes. A few strikes would land to the shoulders  and sides of his arms. He had to push his speed to keep up with the blows as well as to avoid the flame attacks, although he would sneak a few swings of his weapon against the base gash of the knights armor to deepen it more. There was no telling what the key was truly meant for,</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">but based on the Black Knight’s reaction it was something that it did not want Uther to have, which was all the more reason for him to hold onto it. There were a few suspicions on what it’s significance could be, but Uther would have to test them out to be sure. Amongst this back and forth between the two warriors, Jampo’s hidden nature had been released and was going wild across the field, attacking indiscriminately against any and all that got too close. That included Lark that was stepping up to the threat. <em>Master, I see what you are doing. Although I admire your tenacity, I might have a more beneficial alternative than you having to go one on one with him. Trust me, and try to follow my lead. Brandin unleashed a demon, but it has no reigns. Let’s use that to our advantage and box him in with something he can take his anger out on. Contribute your skills from afar, and keep our enemies occupied.</em> 

As an overhead swing came downwards with the axe, Uther raised Rhongomyniad to block its impact and juked around to the backside of his enemy. As he spun around a small amount of energy built up into the Holy Lance while Uther spoke out. “You had orders from your lord to defend the castle against invaders, now I your king command you to fight against the new threat of the flamed monk.” The point would strike the center of the Knight’s back this time, creating a small burst causing a greater impact than his last attack and would send him flying directly at Ashura. The words were to test one theory about the key, but even if they carried no weight with that key in hand, Lancer will have at least aimed his opponent into the close proximity of the demon’s rage.</span>

His breath plumes and wreathes about his face as heat continues to emanate from him, the beast lifting one hand and aiming it at his new prey while mana builds within the palm. Before he throws it, however, Uther&#39;s fast thinking stops the rampage for a brief moment, as The Black Knight topples over Ashura, both of them contorting in on each other and rolling into the woods. A peace falls back over the battlefield...as peaceful as it could have been to begin with, of course. But, still, the two colossi were likely taking this moment to tear into each other and destroy themselves, two raging fires that would extinguish the other. 

&quot;RRRRRRRAGGGGH!!!!&quot; A primal scream barrels from the woods, just as The Black Knight reemerges, rolling and crashing back onto the field after having been thrown aside. Not a scratch laid on its chassis, though that wasn&#39;t from lack of trying on Ashura&#39;s part. Instead, what they could see were the rising of embers above the tree line, and the glow of a furnace within.</span>

Crashes were heard as a force pounds away at the forest, dirt flies from the small crevices that make up the winding trails within, all interspersed with the brief lighting of an almost fairy like glow as embers join in. From the depths within, a tree trunk rolls from above the treetops, lit aflame and descending on the crowd before bursting apart, smoking wood chips descending as an aerial rave across the crowd, impaling several and burning more. Another tree flies over, the same as its shadow looms over Lark, Geeves and several Copper Knights. Either there was a semblance of Jampo still within, or the beast was taking notes from Lancer team&#39;s previous strategy. Tree trunk after tree trunk falls from the sky, threatening to crush or burst and impale others to thin out the herd. Nothing was safe, not even Dolorous Gard as another trunk flies at the structure, brimming hatred for Brandin still seen through its actions.

Just as the monk was prepared to launch an assault, he was whisked away by a Knight, not bronze of black in color. The pair rolled past into some forestry that he had no idea existed, curses and other noises a sign of what was going on.

If only that was the end of it. Now, there was another attempt at siege weaponry, this time in the form of crisp trees burnt from the inside out. Upon impact with the ground, they burst open like cans of soda in the freezing cold. Guts spilled out, splinters impaled in all sorts of objects. 

Lark danced along with this barrage of makeshift bombs. He utilized the makeshift shield Lancer had provided him earlier, used to block most of the incoming debris. Overall, it wasn’t terrible to dodge, though a few splinters found their mark and scorched his flesh. A little burnt, but the musician was mostly unscathed. 

<em>It’s a good idea that was the plan from the start!</em> he mouthed off to Lancer. <em>I didn’t plan on punching the actually dangerous part of him. Anything else you got in mind? That only buys us a few seconds at most.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite the ferocity of the battle, the Black Knight had only taken minor damage up to this point. It quickly rose to its feet again in an imposing stance. Uther&#39;s plan to pit the two giants of the battlefield against each other had failed, the Black Knight didn&#39;t seem to consider Jampo a big enough threat and Jampo just wanted to kill everything it seemed. As a falling tree sped towards the Black Knight, it swung its axe once and the entire trunk was bisected. Falling to either side of the Black Knight.

Lark then felt a chill down his spine as the Black Knight turned its gaze upon him. Recognizing him as the Master of Lancer and a threat to Dolorous Gard. Everything went bright as a massive eruption of hellfire spewed forth from the Black Knight&#39;s helmet and roared over Lark and his surroundings.</span>

One taking a quick moment to stab through the windshield at the occupant within. The two groups of Copper Knights quickly regrouped and took a defensive position from both the civilian attacks and Jampo&#39;s wild strikes.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">One unforeseen benefit of these siege trees was that they make excellent counter projectiles. Seeing the demonic eyes behind the Black Knight’s helmet and the building flames around him, Uther rammed his spear into a downed medium sized flaming trunk, that hadn’t splintered on impact, and swung it off his weapon directly at the knight intercepting most of the flames and attempting to bludgeon the opponent with it. He then dashed forward with his speed grabbing Lark and Geeves in either arm and ran them further down the field away from the knight and Dolorous Gard. The intention was to get them to safety and allow Uther a moment to breathe. At the same time invisible air bounded off of Lark and enwrapped around the legs of Ashura. However, the wind did not take offensive action against the monk, instead it partially fanned his flames and in a sudden burst of air launched Ashura in the direct path and area of where Brandin and the copper knights were. Yet another tactic to aim the wild monk against his own group. 

After they were several meters away, Lancer dropped the two men and took another glance at the key wrapped tightly around his wrist. The first test did not work, although it was the most far fetched idea to consider the key carried some control over the knight. He would stare at the object, trying to piece together what it could be, while saying aloud to the both of them. “Lark, I’d recommend you and Geeves find cover or shelter with the</span>

I will not stop you from following me back on that field, but if you do I’d encourage you to help in other ways. Try to get any injured or nom combative civilians off the field. I admire their bravery, but if they have nothing left to contribute then there is no point for them to cook out here. If that monk is going to rampage let him do so against his own people not ours. This battle is coming to a head and which side it falls on will depend on how we act in these final moments. I’ll continue to be as sparing as possible with your mana as long as you remember I’m tethered to it.” Uther carried a serious face, it was of a man deep in thought, considering what his next move should be and studying on the things in front of him such as the key and the knight. Uther was not ready to throw in the towel just yet. 

The excavator operators that were previously guarding Lark were already burning up and sweating from the proximity of being near Ashura, now</span>

Once the two men they were guarding got touted away, they saw no reason in staying in place either. The two excavator quickly drive away from the knight. As they fled from the enemy one of them spotted something on the ground that inspired him. Maneuver the best could away from the chaos, he’d use the crane to dig down into something that wasn’t all dirt that littered the ground at this point pulling it up there was mixture of Copper knights parts and wraps in a big scoop of his crane. Once that was retrieved the two of them proceeded to drive back down the road. The one with the scoop returned in the direction of the street they entered from. The other made his way to Lark and the others to offer any further assistance that the musician may require of him. The other excavator operators became trapped amongst the flames, debris, and the necrotic energy of Brandin. Of the 4 men only 2 were able to crawl out of their machines and slowly they limped together, arm wrapped around the other, across the field towards Lark as well.</span>

Blood and drool drip from his mouth as he rears himself back once more, crying out in utter rage before looking at Brandin, eyes flaring once more. &quot;Kill you...kill you...KILL YOU!&quot; He screeches as he launches himself at the Lord of Dolorous Gard, mana ready to try and melt through his ornate armor as it surges in each of his hands. 

&quot;RAAAAAGH!&quot; He cries as he throws fist after fist, several Copper Knights rising to meet the beast as they try stabbing him through, acting utterly on instinct rather than in self interest. A swift kick or punch throws them back as Ashura makes its way closer to Brandin, rage continuing to build and froth as he continues his assault, attempting to melt straight through Brandin&#39;s chest. &quot;KILL YOU! KILL EVERYTHING!&quot; Jampo was completely lost, only acting as a bullet that could be pointed at his targets, acting as a whirlwind of destruction that could be aimed to cause mayhem elsewhere. So far it didn&#39;t seem like something that couldn&#39;t be handled...but the glow of Qi around him, brimming red as the blood staining his body, was only getting brighter.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Oh, bollocks!” Lark said. He had gotten the attention of an enemy alright. However, instead of the man of the hour, it was that dastardly knight. The black helmet took a few moments to lock on with a terrifying visage before it erupted in flames. Spewed hellfire took flight towards the pair. Lark was ready to--

Another trunk came down this time, but right in front of the flames. A majority of them were absorbed by the already ruined log. He swung his head around to find the source of that parictular cylinder, only to find a blur of grey and blonde. Lark was <em>yoinked</em> from behind, along with his faithful partner. After a few moments, it became clear that it was in fact Lancer who played the hero this time around.

Once far enough away, they were dumped onto the ground like large rocks. Not much more than a deadweight, which he hinted at with yet another warning. He didn’t tell them to do something, but hinted at a course of action that wasn’t perhaps what he hoped.

“Alright,” Lark said as he brushed off soot and dust from his clothes. “I’m sure Geeves and that excavator driver can manage helping the survivors. Just throw them in the scoop, that’ll work. Get another man to help. Meanwhile--”

“Meanwhile what?” Geeves asked, hands clasped firm together. He smiled wide, stooped a little from his earlier physical activities and for show. “You’ll go run off again, to try and get yourself gutted by that fiendish knight, hmm? Or perhaps you’d like to melt to that hollow husk of hatred? Hell, if you wish to feel your very soul be sucked out through your skin like a straw.”

Lark looked over, eyebrow raised. “Geeves, you’re overreacting.”

“And you, sir, are <em>underreacting</em>. I’ve watched you go off and throw yourself at the enemy with absolutely no plan in mind no less than three separate times. If you had actually gone up against someone capable of killing you, you’d die after the second time! Hell, you had me worried that you actually did collapse and die!”</span>

I wore this armor, didn’t I? I utilized Lancer’s powers. Unless this is about something else, I’d rather we just get to it than talk about it.” Lark turned to walk away. 

Geeves darted forward, the same way Lark had done so just a minute or so before to Jampo. Now, it was his turn to vent. “Is this just a proving point for you?! I made a promise to your sister that I’d keep you safe, and I can’t do that if you are dead set on killing yourself in a blaze of glory! Your self-preservation skills make me sick to my stomach, why can’t you think of yourself for even a few seconds?”

Lark tried to push Geeves away, “Wha-what’s all this about? I’m here because you all wanted to be, I might as well make myself useful and I can’t be useful sitting around with a thumb up my arse. Didn’t you say that just a few days ago, huh? What is this actually about?”

The butler held firm, hands like iron upon the arms of his liege. “What do you think this is about, you <em>mindless machine</em>.  If something--”

Lark’s eyes narrowed, “Oh of course! I’m nothing more than a walking, talking robot. My only purpose is to play music and try to die!”

“Why can’t you listen for once in your life when I have something important--”

The musician used this moment to break the tight grip on him, now free from the makeshift shackles. He glared down at Geeves, “Sorry, I’m incapable. Can’t think about anything when I’m mindless, now can I? You said it yourself. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go do the only thing I’m good at.”

The cursed energy swirled around Ashura and redirected his blows from the remaining Knights and towards Brandin himself. The Monk flew towards Brandin with a flaming fist. A powerful shock wave burst throughout the remains of the keep as Brandin caught Ashura&#39;s fist mid-air. The floor beneath Brandin cracked as his gauntlet began to glow red from the heat.

&quot;I can&#39;t stand either of you anymore!&quot; Brandin raged as he threw Ashura deeper into Dolorous Gard and away from the Copper Knights.

Dark power radiated from Brandin, while before Jampo could&#39;ve made good on his threat to end Brandin, now in his fully realized seat of power he was easily a match for even Ashura.

Brandin drew his Copper Longsword and unleashed a flurry of powerful slashes against his former Master.

Meanwhile, the last four Copper Knights gathered in a tight-knit formation and began to systematically pick off the remaining civilians one by one as the cursed energy hovered over them protectively.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was not many civilians left upon the field for the knights to pick off. Most of the remaining ones had fled to the inside buildings for shelter. The copper knights stabbed into bodies that were still barely clinging to life in the dust and the rubble of the field. Unfortunately the two men who were limping away could not reach the other men in I time before being cut down. The excavator carried Geeves down some opposing streets to the backside of the buildings that the others had previously fled into. Several of the civilians began to load up into the pit of the crane and pile into each other. By this point they had gathered up their supplies and held it close to themselves. 22 civilians in total were left, a little over half of which was the demolition team. They peered in their bags one last time to see if there was any parting damage they could still cause as they were pulling away to a safe distance away from the field. They still had a number of grenades left, but the question was if any of them would even work against the remaining knights, especially with that energy surging around. With a collective sigh, the one in charge called for them to give one last volley and to keep it as close to the ground as possible in under to avoid crossing across the array of curse energy. They’d pull the pin and toss 12 separate grenades at the remaining for copper knights. One for each remaining demolition member. The hope was to take a few more out with a collective group of explosions as they moved away from the battlefield. 

The Black Knight was right on top of Uther trying to grasp at and crush his arm, and potentially take back the key. Fortunately, his plan with Ashura</span>

The magical wind began to swirl violently tearing into the Knight’s hand ripping and tearing into the armored palm and grieve of the knight. This magical barrier would provide enough of a space between them that Uther would be able to pull his arm out still grasping onto the key. “You don’t let up, I admire that, but I need you to be a good guard dog and heel!” With his other arm he swung Rhongomyniad once more with another charged attack striking in the same gashed area from before, keeping his head closed in to himself and his weapon to discourages for duck underneath any retaliation</span>

The point would hit the center creating another miniature burst of energy into the opponent sending him back as far as possible away from him. Those repeated strong blows should be showing some form of damage at this point. Thankfully Lark hadn’t used much of his mana in the fight, giving Uther a touch of breathing room, but with these repeated mana infused attacks with the holy lance, Uther imagined he had burned up a little over a quarter of Lark’s mana. A benefit to his master is that despite not being the most combative mage, he had an above average mana supply. Despite that, Uther did not want to put him into any further danger than necessary. His master should still be able to do what he needs to do fine, but going forward Lancer shouldn’t us anymore further mana abilities beyond invisible air. Since the field was clearing, it was coming down to the knight and himself. Uther threw the key into the inside portions of his armor away from view, he was aware that the black knight might target that area, but at least this way he could defend himself. He dropped into a combat stance once more, watching what his opponent would do, preparing to react to whether he charged, attempted to chase his opponents, or even tried to lure him in. This fight was fast approaching it’s conclusion, the Victor of the day if any would soon be determined. Uther’s current objective was to fight until told otherwise. There was a small sliver of hope that Master and servant would end the other in their fight against each other, but even that may not come to pass. At this point only Lark could effect what the King did next.</span>

Each blow sends a small Shockwave from the amount of force bestowed by Brandin, but each blow only further sends the beast spiraling on anger. Fury. Rage. Lust. All of it was fueling his desire and giving him strength to rise against his Servant&#39;s machinations, enough for his body to glow bright one more time before he unleashes a wave of heat, one that billows and pours from the interior of Dolorous Gard and back onto the battlefield. It feels more fierce, more debilitating as Ashura raves beneath Brandin&#39;s weapon, foaming at the mouth and causing the air around them to shimmer. The figure grabs rubble from around and begins lobbing it at Brandin, his Qi overloading each and causing a shower of smoldering stones to rain over his Servant and the militia outside. It would be frightening if part of it didn&#39;t seem untimely sad...indeed, this was Jampo. A beast laid scrounging for any leverage it could get to satisfy the most base of impulses. More rubble falls from Dolorous Gard, showering over those below and giving each a fresh threat and plume of smoke to contend with.

Brandin dances around the thrown projectiles, weaving closer to the mad monk. He readied a powerful strike towards his former Master before feinting into a quick and sneaky stab to Ashura&#39;s gut.</span>

It reared back and spewed a wall of flame between it and Uther before rushing back towards Dolorous Gard. While running, it gripped one of the excavators and hurled it through the air. Colliding with the thrown grenades and detonating mid-air with a massive explosion. The Black Knight then torched the battlefield, cutting off the retreating civilians and the Copper Knights. The Black Knight dashed over to the last four Copper Knights and swung its axe at the incoming debris, protecting the smaller figures.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark ran past all the people either in the process of dying or died before. At this point, the leftover men had committed to retreat, one last volley of grenades that marked the end of the siege. At this point, one could argue that it was a complete and total failure. A dent was left in the front gate, but little else. Reinforcements could be brought, but after such a loss it’d be a miracle to get anything more than half of what they got this time.

And unfortunately, Geeves left the excavator to tend to the bodies and the survivors. They had help from the leftover men, and Lark was far more valuable as a resource. Harsh to admit, but it was the truth. Both in the objective sense and the personal sense. The words he screamed out rang over and over in his head. It was the heat of the moment, and as per usual Lark took it at face value and ran away with it. 

It was good that he hadn’t gotten too far ahead. The lad had stumbled and tripped a few times, barely ahead of the butler at this point. What would he say when he caught up, anyway? ‘I’m sorry’? ‘This is a large misunderstanding’? Their relationship at this point was on a rough patch, but he was sure that after a few drinks they could--

A copper knight saw the distracted musician. Geeves saw the knight. Saw a bow knocked. An arrow pulled from a quiver. Perhaps only a few moments to aim, and then promptly released. The action took only a few seconds, but men died in even less. Lark? Perhaps even in one. If there was time to think, the butler would’ve appreciated it. Instead, he acted on pure instinct alone.

He dived and hoped the boy wouldn’t see the impact.</span>

Stupid Geeves. Stupid battle. He didn’t even want to be here, and yet <em>he</em> was the mindless machine?! He’ll show them! It was time to truly turn this into a show of courage, of bravery! He’d prove to them all that he could think something out. 

But what? Maybe he could take out those few knights of copper. That would be enough, right? How about just two of the five or so? Yea, that sounded more reasonable. But how? Oh, that was the easy part. He had a knife in hand. A violin ready to play, and a tank of mana at the ready. It was inside him, of course, and Lancer was slowly siphoning it out, but he was being considerate. That left more than enough.

And only a few dozens yards remained between them. To start off, he could stab one in between the armor. The neck would be the best spot, and if not there then a direct blow to the eyes would do as well. They were on high alert, so he couldn’t knock them down. Unless he dodged and weaved around them. Maybe they could land a few blows on themselves. Alright, time to--

“GET DOWN!” someone called.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The world was turned upside down. A heavy force knocked the wind out of him, and his instrument was released. It bounced a few times as its momentum carried it forward, and stopped once it hit a large enough pile of debris. The bow skid to a half a bit after it hit the ground, not enough weight to carry it on. At a glance, the instrument was broken. Only two strings remained intact, while the wood had a nasty dent on the main body. 

Speaking of, there was a heavy weight on his lower body now. Something pointed and hard stuck into his leg, more than likely what the point of the shout was. Poor bastard, more than likely died to save him. It was hard to differentiate the smell of smoke and blood, but he could already smell the wound from behind. Hot liquid spilled onto his pants, which soaked into the fabric. He turned around to push the person off of him--

That faced looked familiar, even from this angle. The bald head was propped up by the arrow, firmly lodged inside the left eye socket. A faint sound came from their mouth, the gurgle of blood that started to cascade from the wound. It had managed to go straight through all the bone and tissue into the lower skull. Gloved hands were splayed in front of them, on either side of Lark. 

Gears whirred to life, each one rusted from emotion. From the eyes, a microscopic connection of neurons and dendrites lead a stimuli through the pathway until it reached the brain. From there, all it took was a simple connection of object to name in order to recognize the fresh corpse.

“Oh. Geeves.”

The father figure had died, and so too had any confidence. He pulled his legs free of the dead weight, the largest struggle of the day. With heavy breaths, he crawled around and reached an arm under the motionless one. It wasn’t as heavy as he’d thought it would be. Even the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame that lead to this scenario felt like a bag of bricks compared to the butler. 

With the body thrown over his shoulders, he started to stumble away. Tears flowed from his eyes, which in turn caught the faint snowfall from up above. He barely recognized the large yellow machine that barreled down to them. The militia men were a blur as they helped bear some of the burden. They said… something, but it was hard to make out from the one, single thought that raced throug his head. Lancer would hear it too, a new song sang from the depths of his heart:

His savage clawing subsides as he finds his arm falling limply by his side, brushing against Brandin&#39;s copper plated gauntlets as his blood slickens his grip, the beast now grunting as it looks into Brandin&#39;s eyes.

Cold. Freezing over the intensity of Ashura&#39;s rampage and putting the beast in its place. His Master was nothing more than some pawn, a means to an end, and this was his ultimate fate. To simply be a dog at the mercy of-

<em>Kill him. Burn him. Burn everything.</em>

A ghostly hiss warbles from Ashura&#39;s mind and flows into Brandin&#39;s own head, the first time this beast forged a connection with Brandin. Suddenly, steam begins pouring from Ashura&#39;s wound along with his blood, the cut seeming to close around Brandin&#39;s blade as the beast&#39;s Qi flares once more. His eyes reignite, his teeth bare themselves in defiance as he lifts his hand slowly, Qi manifesting and bathing Brandin in heat before he reaches forth and grabs hold of his Servant&#39;s face. The smell of burning flesh and effervescent pain flows through the Copper Knight of Dolorous Gard as Ashura falls into his Servant&#39;s grasp, howling in fury as it brands the side of Brandin&#39;s visage. 

<em>The fool will take such insolence, but I am not so keen to be talked down to by some coward! BEAR THIS MARK, AND HEAR THESE WORDS: I, ASHURA, WILL DESTROY YOU YET.</em> 

As if to make word on his promise, the beast wrenches himself away, Brandin&#39;s sword making a fresh cut in his skin as he peels away from the healed over wound, blood falling in a stream before it slows from the rapid healing of flesh. With one last act of defiance, Ashura places both hands on the interior walls of Dolorous Gard...

This was the break they were waiting for, at last the enemy was back stepping. If they kept the pressure on a little longer they might be able to… That’s when he heard it, the desperate call for retreat. He had evacuated all of the civilians, so Yo hear that phrase was not surprising. What did catch him off guard was that it was received inside his mind, and from the voice of a man who up to this point had never shown trepidation of participating in the fight. Uther glanced over to see the pained expression of agony on Lark’s face as well as the lifeless eyes of Geeves. “Oh Lord…” 

The sight before him created a flash in his mind of memory long since past, of a much younger Uther holding a young man of a similar age in his arms. The man was poisoned and blood streaking out of his mouth and down his chin. He reached up and ran his hand across the face Uther and said “You must carry on brother. Humanity has to stand out from the rest of this world. We can not let pure descendants fall into obscurity, raise them up Uther. Be their leader, be their King if you must, but most importantly be the guide in darkness for them. Through you there can be a bridge between man and magic, I</span>

Just overhead a shining comet flew by in the form of a Crimson Dragon, it lifted the young Knight’s spirits and he decided that evening to live up to the hopes placed upon him and took on the surname Pendragon in honor of that comet. The vision faded as Uther’s mind returned to the present, and he saw that his master was far more broken than he had ever been. 

In all of his years as a General, Uther was never one to retreat when there was still a fighting chance, but even he understood that when the commander calls for it there is no room for argument. He maybe a King, but Lark was the one who ultimately called the shots, ever since the beginning when they first met. As long as equal respect was given and received between the two of them, the two men would stand together. It’s for that reason that despite the fact that Uther still had fight left in him, he could tell Lark emotionally could not carry on presently. Sometimes the greatest deaths are that of ones own spirit. Rhongomyniad faded away as Uther</span>

Invisible Air stretched in a thin wall of air to protect the group from being attacked from behind by any other potential projectiles. Along the way he scooped up Lark’s violin and bow, and carried it close to himself. 

As they got far enough away from the battle area, several of the remaining 22 militia had fallen to the ground exhausted. Others were examining and looking over the small pile of copper knight weapons that were snagged on the battle field by one of the two remaining excavators. However, Uther paid little mind to that presently or the key that hung inside his armor, his main concern was his master. He approached Lark, before glancing over to Geeves. A pit of guilt filled his heart. They hadn’t always seen eye to eye, but one thing Uther and Geeves shared in common was that they wanted the best for Lark. The King had failed in that regard, because he was responsible for the pain that his master was feeling. Approaching the butler Uther gripped onto the arrow rod lodged in his head and broke it off before pulling it out of the socket. Grabbing a water cantina and a rag from one of the nearby supply bags Uther began to dab and wash the blood off the man’s face, making sure to close his eyes and give the man proper respect. Lark wouldn’t want to hear words of wisdom or encouragement right now, if the musician wanted to say something he could. However, for the time being until everyone had caught their breathe the King was going to give apt respect to the servant. 

This was an intense battle that no side truly won, the Olympian forces had to retreat while Brandin was forced to knock his own master unconscious while his forces were worn thin. Neither faction came out truly unscathed, however, it was clear that for Dolorous Gard to truly fall a stronger force than that of the city revelry would be required.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the smoke cleared Brandin, Lord of Dolorous Gard, stood amongst the wreckage of his keep. Major damage had been inflicted upon the structure, but the gates still stood strong. The enemies of Dolorous Gard had retreated yet Brandin looked unpleased. His hand went to his face, a sizable burn mark stretched from his right cheek to his right ear. A parting gift from Ashura.

&quot;You think yourself clever for this pathetic excuse of a curse?&quot; Brandin mocked the unconscious Jampo before rearing back and kicking him in the stomach. The force from the blow sent Jampo flying across the room and he slammed into a wall. Brandin approached Jampo and raised his sword.

He held it there for a moment before lowering it.

&quot;No, not yet. You&#39;re more useful to me as a battery right now.&quot;

Brandin snapped his fingers and the four remaining Copper Knights approached.

&quot;Down to four?! Was I really that close to defeat? No matter, the Challenge was not bested and that&#39;s all that matters.&quot; Brandin pointed at Jampo. &quot;Take him to the dungeon, then go into the city and find all the mana batteries you can.&quot;

The Copper Knights dragged Jampo away. Brandin then went to the Well of Blackness and began to weave the dark magics within. Soon, a Copper Knight rose from the Well and went to go complete the tasks Brandin had set for it. However, as he was doing that, Brandin noticed the Black Knight.

The dark power of the Well flowed into the Black Knight, mending its wounds from the fight with Uther. But Brandin noticed a strange agitation in it. Then he saw that the key was missing.

&quot;You lost it?!&quot; Brandin shouted in dismay.

The Black Knight responded in a low grumble.

Brandin panicked for a moment before calming himself down.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, the Chest is still here, they would have to get through you to open it. In addition, the key being out of our hands is a threat to the Well, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The Black Knight simply responded with puff of flame from its helmet.</span>

It seemed that the remains would not hold their form for too long. However, the rest of the myth Uther pondered on had revealed itself to him. After Lancelot had vanquished Lord Brandin, the curse had remained on Dolorous Gard. Only after opening the Perilous Chest was the curse finally lifted from the keep. Perhaps if someone could get inside Dolorous Gard and open the chest, Brandin would be defeated without having to face that cursed trial. But that would have to be left to another force.</span>
