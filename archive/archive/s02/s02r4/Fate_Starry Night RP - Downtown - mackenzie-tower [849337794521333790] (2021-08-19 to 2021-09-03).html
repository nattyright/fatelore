Contracts between businessmen and vendor, between employer and employee, between customer and provider. Without some shred of integrity that honors contracts, businesses will fall apart into dust.

It was time to resolve one of the contracts forged in the fires of a grail war, Laurent considered as he sat at a meeting discussing investments and future ventures. Instead, however, they were discussing the castle outside their window.

&quot;We must negotiate with Saber and his Master, in order to spare both corporate estate and the value of our employees!&quot; An elderly associate said, wringing his hands. The same one that had been on Elias&#39;s council, as well as Laurent&#39;s grandfather. The memory made his mouth flicker.

&quot;And risk looking weak? What if he asks for all of our assets? Our employees? We&#39;ll be ruined!&quot; Another younger man, the chief of accounting, said, waving a paper.

&quot;Yes, but—&quot;

&quot;<strong>Gentlemen.</strong>&quot; Laurent coughed as he looked at the two, who both fell silent. The remaining council, which consisted of six other people, fell silent.

The CEO of MacKenzie Industries had made a full recovery after not being seen in the office for but a few days, with the official reason being &quot;visiting his daughter, who was sick&quot;, explaining her lack of appearances recently.

In actuality, she wasn&#39;t in Olympia, having been sent away at the beginning of the City Grail War.

Making matters more interesting was the man that sat next to Laurent. A small, plump man with a majestic mustache that seemed slightly out of place in a room of business vultures. Laurent coughed, and spread his hands.</span>

Laurent nodded to his chief accountant, head of HR, and sales advisor. &quot;Make duplicates of all paperwork that can&#39;t be put on the cloud, and send it to the temporary office in Delphi. <strong>We will get through this.</strong>&quot;

When Laurent spoke up with orders, they were followed with little objection, though there was always the occasional muttering. His business decisions were sound, and had been for years.

&quot;Meeting adjourned. Leave me and my associate.&quot; Laurent said. With a few nods, Laurent&#39;s executives left the office room, leaving Caster and Laurent alone.

Laurent gestured to his Servant. &quot;Speak up. You always have that expression—like you&#39;re choking on your words. What is it?&quot;

He looked to have a rather strong command over the room. Laurent&#39;s board members seemed to respect his decisions. He had come this far. It made sense to Caster why no one would question his words.

Caster jolted his head towards Laurent, as if he had been snapped out of a deep state of thought. &quot;Does my inquisitive nature bother you Master?&quot;

Since Nietzsche and Laurent formed their pact, Laurent was met with question after question. Surely the philosopher had to be wearing down on his spirit.

That incident in his penthouse, most likely. Caster was annoying, but if he could do what he did to Laurent to other people, he would prove invaluable. 

Besides, he was a schemer. Laurent liked schemers.

&quot;The people who hesitate to speak up often have the most outlandish ideas.&quot; Laurent said as he rubbed the edges of his glasses. &quot;Besides, you always have something to say, so I&#39;d rather you say it.&quot;

After finishing his statement, Laurent eyed Caster tentatively. &quot;Is this about the City Grail War? My performance as a Master. Answer my questions before you vomit another one onto my lap. This is a dialogue, not a ballroom for you to dance around questions.&quot;

The two had formed a fairly businesslike relationship, and, despite Laurent&#39;s dislike for Servants, he found that being honest with Caster was far more enjoyable than dancing around the proverbial landmine that was Assassin.

The philosopher had been observing his Master to the best of his ability and had a lot he could say. However, for his best interest he chose to hold his tongue… for the most part.

&quot;Master, I fear your lack of humility. Someone so dominant and loud is surely the opposite. I am not asking you to be humble either. Instead I ask you to be honest with yourself. If we are to win it is important to drop all things that hold us humans back. Humanity is something to be overcome master…. However, I am afraid that point may be out of our reach. I hope to be proven wrong.&quot;

Nietzsche spoke in cryptic language, explaining himself as a philosopher would. What did he mean by overcoming humanity? What exactly was Caster planning?.</span>

The relationship between Laurent and Caster always seemed to be one step forward, one step back, and one step to the left. Although Laurent had asked Caster to speak up, he was seriously considering punting him out the window, and yet.

<em>Humanity...</em>

All that had ever brought him was unrequited misery. If he hadn&#39;t been a desperate brat, trying to beg for unrequited love, he wouldn&#39;t have ended up wasting his childhood. Maybe Caster was right? Laurent scoffed. To be agreeing with a Servant like this... Fighting Rider and Assassin had changed him. Meeting Caster had changed him.

Now it was time to figure out if those changes were good.

&quot;Humanity is something to be overcome?&quot; Laurent said, turning back to Caster. &quot;That&#39;s a quote from one of your characters, yes? Zarathustra?&quot; 

So he <em>had</em> been reading those books, and not using them as paperweights...

&quot;What holds humanity back is our regards for what is sacred. Laws, morality, love. They change people, Caster.&quot; Laurent said as he stared out at Dolorous Gard, towering in the distance. He wondered how Lancer and Lark were doing.

&quot;Yet I cannot shake the feeling that you mean something by all this, Caster.&quot; A wry smile met Laurent&#39;s lips. &quot;But I won&#39;t pry. This war is becoming more and more hectic, wouldn&#39;t you agree? Yet I think we should throw our hats into the ring.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster jolted up in excitement as Laurent revealed that he had been reading his books. Nietzsche was more than delighted to hear this. Maybe his goals weren&#39;t as far off as he had originally assumed.

&quot;Ah so you have been reading. I hope you&#39;re enjoying the books, I poured my heart and soul into them after all.&quot; Nietzsche nodded his head as he tried to pour the excitement from his mind and get back on track.

&quot;Yes, humanity is held back by the goals of other men. As a species we lack mastery over ourselves, our own purpose, and our happiness. I call this the slave morality. Learn this well and you will understand my goals&quot;

After giving Laurent yet another unasked for lecture he would spin in his chair thinking about the idea of getting involved first hand. He hadn&#39;t engaged in conflict with his old Master, so it would certainly be a new experience for him. &quot;Well I wouldn&#39;t mind getting some first hand experience. I have yet to see what this war is about. On Top of that other servants are sure to provide me with some good insight.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Yes, of course.&quot; Laurent said, bemused at Caster&#39;s expressiveness. Turning away, he pulled out his phone and tapped at it thoughtfully. It was time to fulfill one of the business contracts he had signed during this City Grail War.

Caster was admittedly weak. Laurent could find little information on him through digging—he hadn&#39;t fought much in Olympia or Delphi—and Laurent was fairly certain that such a modern Servant, and a philosopher at that, would be useless in a fight.

Which meant...

&quot;Caster.&quot; Laurent spoke up, turning back towards the philosopher. &quot;You might not be strong, but I will need your powers nonetheless. There&#39;s a contract with a former Master that I need voided.&quot; Laurent&#39;s voice was deadpan, but even he couldn&#39;t hide the disdain that tinged his voice.

Gustave would never touch his company. It didn&#39;t matter if nothing mattered once Laurent had passed, it was wise for the businessman to cover his bases.

Laurent tapped a button on his phone, and many miles away...

A phone rang.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The businessman raised an eyebrow at Caster, as if the two were sharing a private joke. Was Laurent seriously going to arrange for a battle over the phone like there was some sort of City Grail War hotline?

&quot;Yes, hello to you too, Gustave.&quot; Laurent said stiffly. The old man had came out with little desire to deal with Laurent&#39;s wordplay. It was annoying, but understandable. &quot;I was grievously injured, and barely escaped with my life, with no help from you. Your Assassin tried to tear my guts out while our common enemy watched. You tried to kill me, I abandoned you, end of story. Let&#39;s let bygones be bygones.&quot;

Oh, the irony. Despite Laurent&#39;s murderous intent that day, he had, on paper, done no wrong. Gustave was the perpetrator. Despite that, Gustave knew that Laurent was a snake, and he was elegantly turning all the blame back towards his former ally.

&quot;I distinctly remember making a contract with you of some sort, Gustave. Despite our rocky relationship, I am, unfortunately, a man of my word. Would you like to seal that contract?&quot;

100% of Laurent&#39;s company, should he pass away, would go to Gustave Renoir as acting CEO until Laurent&#39;s daughter came of age. He hadn&#39;t been joking? 

Was this a trap?

These things happen.&quot; Laurent said, turning to Caster. &quot;I heard the culprit was shot. I wonder if you and your Assassin were behind it. If that&#39;s the case, I wonder why you and Assassin were meeting with Delphi&#39;s Caster.&quot; 

If Laurent knew anything about the disappearance of Caster&#39;s Master, nothing gave it away. He was just as suspicious and neutral as he always was. Caster, on the other hand, knew that this was total hogwash. Was he concealing Caster&#39;s identity and allegiance? A wise choice.

Delphi&#39;s illustrious Rooftop Garden. It had been the perfect place to begin such an alliance. It was now the perfect place to end it. 

&quot;Agreed. I will see you soon, Gustave. Leave your Assassin behind. I don&#39;t want to get stabbed in the back.&quot; With that, Laurent hung up the phone.

&quot;Let us depart, Caster. I&#39;ll have to debrief you before we reach Delphi.&quot; Laurent said as he walked past Caster.
