The way it scaled into the skyline would’ve been impressive if it didn’t belong to arguably one of the worst human beings in the city. The many floors lit up, with the two lines that cut across diagonally as it went up, the way the light reflected on each and every window… yep, this sure was a vile place. 

And the sun hat he wore made sure no one got a good immediate look at his face, with the droopy sides that hung down across his eyes. Being relatively famous had its downsides, for being spotted might mean a call to Mr. Big Bad himself, and from there things could get messy. 

Well, they didn’t have to be perfect. After all, the plan only required that Laurent be alone, and there could be many opportunities to be alone. A trip to the toilet, sleeping late at night, the possibilities were-- rather limited, come to think of it.

“Lance,” Lark looked around their environment, “You have anything to add before we get this show on the way?”</span>

Although a pest, Laurent was a master in the Grail War and should not be taken lightly. Keep me up to date on what is occurring and anything that might be a hinderance to us.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Your kindness does me wonders,” Lark said. The kindness did no wonders, but there wasn’t much else to say. Go in, wait for Laurent to return, mess him up, leave for the celebration in just an hour’s time. It would be really awkward if this failed and he managed to be the dead one, yet there wasn’t much to do but just don’t.

He slowly approached the building, stock taken of the layout of the front. A few sets of doors lined and marked the entrance, each polished with a shine unlike any other. Incredible. He pushed through them, greeted by the immediate relief of standard A/C units that pumped in cool air. Past the next set of doors was only more freezing air, which he drank in gulps.

Ah, the lobby! Seemed cozy enough for a weapon manufacturing company. A few chairs scattered around, a front desk and receptionist, people idle on the different sides waiting for their turn or loitering. It smelled cold with a hint of mint and sweat from everyone around, though that was unavoidable in a city like this. 

His skin erupted in goose bumps as he milled around for a few seconds, unsure on where to place himself. A few seconds of deliberation and personal thoughts decided that one of the comfy chairs, plush black leather, would be the best for now. He waddled over and sank himself into the cushion, violin swung around and held in his lap as to not be crushed. 

“<em>Well, I’m in. No sign of Laurent, though that is to be expected. There isn’t a good way I can get past the receptionist without being noticed, I think. No idea where he is. Unsure on whether or not to risk the attempt to get past.</em>”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent was a busy man. He was also paranoid.

Fighting Gustave, being betrayed by Gustave, and betraying Gustave made Laurent extremely wary of fighting any battles in the City Grail War. This, combined with Laurent&#39;s two-faced and naturally wary nature, made cornering him a daunting task.

&quot;We can&#39;t continue to avoid battlegrounds like we have, Caster.&quot; Laurent said, evidently annoyed as he checked his watch. He would be late to his emergency meeting with his personal advisors and council. &quot;The threat of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm has become such a problem that even the Church has turned against Saber.&quot;

Laurent sat in a personal train car as he waited for his stop. He had purchased Caster a phone, much to the latter&#39;s irritation. Something about tapping the buttons not being as satisfying as a quill or pen. Philosophers were so picky.

The train car was vacant with the exception of Laurent. Caster was on the constant lookout for foes and Copper Knights, the latter of which had been kidnapping people. Laurent would not rot in a dungeon with the common rabble.

&quot;The creation of a Delphi Branch and backing up all our papers and hard data was a good idea. Losing MacKenzie Tower will be disappointed, but once this Grail War is over and Saber is eliminated, we shall be able to reclaim it with little difficulty.&quot;

Laurent was secretly infuriated at the idea that he would have to evacuate MacKenzie Tower, the home of several generations before him, just because of a few pawns not being able to successfully kill a Servant properly.

Lark was worthless. Laurent should&#39;ve just killed him and dealt with Saber when he had the chance. 

&quot;Nonetheless, I am begrudgingly impressed with Saber and their Master. Perhaps I should have allied with them instead of wasting time on Gustave. No offense to your little thought experiments, of course. How are you holding up, Caster?&quot; 

Laurent asking about his Servant&#39;s condition? He was in a good mood. Or paranoid. Or both.</span>

His eyes jumped from one building to another as the train quickly passed by. It was easy to see that Caster was bored. He didn&#39;t care for all of Laurent&#39;s worries. Caster was in the war for the ride. However it would end should be enough to satisfy him.

The servant turned his attention from the window as Laurent checked up on him. &quot;I am bored… We have done little but worry, and yet there is much to see&quot; Nietzsche had been excited to exchange values with the fellow participants of the grail war. It seemed that Nietzsche was having trouble making that wish reality.

&quot;You are worried as usual I take it?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent nearly leapt out of his seat as Caster seemed to slink into a seat across from him. He had been so focused on logistics and Olympia&#39;s well being that he didn&#39;t notice Caster appear. &quot;Caster! When did you—&quot; Laurent stopped himself. If there was one thing Laurent and his new Servant had in common, it was a tendency to slink around unnoticed.

He had given Caster orders to stay somewhat away from him. Kun Wu&#39;s strike on his PR would ring true if he was seen poking around with Caster, his original Servant forgotten. 

&quot;As usual? On the contrary, this is abnormal for me.&quot; Laurent gave a breathy little laugh, before quickly checking his watch again. &quot;This is an unprecedented disaster, Caster. At this rate, Olympia will be overrun, and Delphi will experience an unprecedented population explosion, causing the city to collapse as Olympian refugees fight with Delphi. Burning it to the ground. I want to rule, Caster, <strong>but I don&#39;t want to rule as king of the ashes.</strong>&quot;

Laurent had come to expect Nietzsche&#39;s apathy for Laurent&#39;s struggles, much to the latter&#39;s infatuation. If it had nothing to do with the human condition, Caster was oddly lethargic. Laurent took a swig of water from his flask.

&quot;Correct. <em>I</em> have done nothing but worry. <em>You</em> have done little. How much do you know of business, Caster?&quot; Laurent said, leg pumping on the floor. He waved a hand. &quot;Irrelevant. The amount of logistics required to keep a company as large as mine active in times of crisis is immense. It makes your books look like picture books in terms of length.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;With Saber running amok, the Aristocracy is scared, and the workers are beginning to consider just surrendering and rebelling against their employers. This includes me, even with my actions in fighting back against Berserker at my weapon factory. All because Lancer actually took my advise and riled the populous against Saber. Now that that&#39;s failed, they have no option but to surrender.&quot; Laurent rubbed his forehead. &quot;Ironically, <strong>business is booming.</strong> Do you know Irons alone ordered the production of several thousand anti-material rifles to fight back against Saber&#39;s knights? The police department has done so as well. By jacking up the price due to &#39;emergency production&#39;, I&#39;ve almost doubled my wealth overnight.&quot;

A shrewd business manuever, but also a cruel one. Laurent was going to bankrupt the aristocracy of Olympia by producing weapons to stop Saber. They would succeed, but Saber&#39;s domain would continue to expand, leaving it meaningless. If Laurent&#39;s buyers began going into debt to purchase equipment for this scenario...

<strong>He&#39;d rule the city by the time the crisis was over.</strong>

The car slowed substantially as the train rolled into the station, a short walk from MacKenzie Tower.

&quot;Nonetheless, we will need to make a move against Saber.&quot; Laurent said, as if resigning himself to the fact. &quot;Come along, Caster. I need to meet with my council, and you can spread your teaching to Saber and his little automatons.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster let out a grin as he spooked Laurent with his arrival. Laurent was always serious, his mind on work, his goals, the war, whatever was important to him. Seeing a small bit of human emotion made the servant happy. 

Nietzsche stood from his seat as the train came to a stop. He pulled at his mustache listening carefully to his Master&#39;s lecture. For once Nietzsche was the one being bombarded with information, it was a nice change of pace. He appreciated the sense of openness and communication. It seemed to him that Laurent&#39;s trust had come a long way in their short time together. 

&quot;You think more than you speak Master, and today you have spoken a lot. I cannot imagine how plauged your mind is with thoughts.&quot; Nietzsche took a step out of the car following his Master back to their usual base of operations. 

&quot;Laurent, I understand what it is like to have a heavy mind. Such is the curse of all bright men. Intelligent people find their happiness where others would find disaster. Your ruthlessness, your command over the weak, your need to be ruler. Other people would not understand such things but I do. I only show a lack of care because my time has already passed. I am contempt with my fate yet I am here for a reason... However, Laurent your time is now, so believe me when I say not to worry about your enemies. We will win this war together, I do not fear Saber or anyone else of the sort.&quot; 

Nietzsche walked ahead of Laurent not caring to hear a response to his heavy set words. Something had influenced the philosopher to communicate on a more personal level with his Master. Whatever that motivation, it was a mystery.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For a few moments, Laurent was silent as he straightened his tie, took a deep breath, and stepped forward, with Caster in tow. It seemed like Caster&#39;s response would go unrecognized, until...

&quot;How profound. I&#39;ll have you write my speeches once this city is in the palm of my hand.&quot; Laurent said, adjusting his glasses to make himself look presentable. As the two left the station at a brisk pace, Laurent finally spoke again. &quot;<strong>Thank you, Caster.</strong>&quot;

A slightly awkward silence followed, with Laurent checking his watch. Slowly but surely, the businessman paced ahead of Caster, par their agreement. They were not to be seen together, lest they be considered a Master and Servant duo. Caster would remain close enough to protect his Master, but not directly at his side.

Meanwhile, Laurent&#39;s mind began to wander as he pondered Caster&#39;s words. They sere so uncharacteristic that Laurent seriously considered them being a trick. What would the point of that be, though? To kiss up to his Master? Laurent shelved the thought quickly. Perhaps, in his own, twisted sort of way, Caster actually cared about Laurent. It was a form of comradely attained by working towards a goal, as well as being somewhat similar.</span>

<strong>Stop.</strong> Caster would reprimand him for going down this road. He had a job to do. &#39;Save&#39; this city. &#39;Save&#39; his company. Win this City Grail War. Before allying with Caster, Laurent had accrued quite a large list of foes. Gustave and Assassin, who would strike him down given the chance. Rider and her plaything, perhaps they had forgotten about him. He lacked a Servant, so maybe he wasn&#39;t worth fighting in their eyes. Lark and Lancer, now that their attack had failed...

He had been so very sloppy. Desperately crawling around writing checks he couldn&#39;t cash in the form of alliances. Perhaps he could salvage the one between Lark and Lancer, but the City Grail War was entering its final stages...

Plus Saber... Laurent groaned irritably. This was truly becoming a mess.

After a few minutes, Laurent had reached MacKenzie Tower, with Caster lagging behind as planned. Without pausing to stop, he entered the lobby, and the security guards saluted him.

Lark and Uther&#39;s target had arrived.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The thought Lancer might’ve had wouldn’t matter. Lark didn’t hear a single word as some nearby security guards took up a form, a salute to a single individual that entered. The man, the myth, the devil himself: Laurent MacKenzie. He looked worse for wear, but Lark could see that smug aura hidden somewhere in that facade. Hidden in plain view.

Oh, how his fingers ached! His legs shook, eager for any action at all. The moping around he did for the last few days had him worked up. Even more so than ever before. Instead of a thrill, though, it was for revenge. Those words his sister planted inside his head had grown wonderfully. It was time for the bastard to get his very cold dinner! Or lunch. What time was it again?

Without a word, he slid from his chair. The most familiar of motions was played out like clockwork, as the bag was interchanged with his bottom and the latches <strong>clicked</strong> out of position. A wooden instrument was unleashed from its holster, the ammo locked and loaded upon the strings. 

Everyone in the lobby would look around confused as a lone man played a long, eerie note. A horrible mixture of notes echoed throughout the room, quite literally the most awful ones in tandem. They would see an elegantly dressed man in a sun hat with a violin in his hands, eyes locked with the newcomer. 

Only after a few moments and the people could finally recognize the stranger did Lark announce himself proper. “Laurent MacKenzie,” he bellowed, “I believe we have some unfinished business to attend to! Will you be a man and solve your own problems, or will you run like the coward you are?”

He challenged Laurent, one chance to act. Would he take up the call to arms, or would the hired goons be the ones who took action? 

Maybe not the best proposition, all things considered.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark really didn&#39;t think this through.

He knew from the word go that Laurent was slimy, and would easily sell out his former ally. It was why he had sent Lark and Lancer away on a suicide mission with minimal assistance. Their intuition screamed at them to not trust Laurent, and they had done so, albeit begrudgingly.

Now the person who had sealed their alliance was dead.

Laurent looked up at his phone, and the look of irritiation and bemusement that he gave Lark ignited a fury within the entertainer. It was as if Lark were an insect that had piqued Laurent&#39;s interest, and was a few moments away from being squashed. It was clear that the person before him meant nothing to the businessman,

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you.&quot; Laurent said, straightening his tie and handing off a folder to his receptionist. &quot;Can this wait? I have a business meeting to attend to, and I have a meeting with both the Church and the Olympian Police Department in a few hours.&quot;

Like that mattered. He&#39;d probably just wring them for cash or something. Laurent&#39;s excuses didn&#39;t mean much to Lark. 

&quot;See, we have to discuss the issue you failed to resolve. I heard your little battle with Saber ended with failure. How did you escape with your lives? <strong>Did you ally with Saber? Are you here to stop me from stopping this crisis? Do you work with the Copper Knights?</strong>&quot;

The receptionists gave a little scream, and the guards pulled out their pistols. The various people began to vacate the room. Laurent gave a little smirk. It was a false claim. Lark allying with Saber was unlikely, given Lancer&#39;s track record. Laurent just wanted to give his guards an extra kick of motivation. If they thought this man was with the Copper Knights, they would gladly shoot to kill.

&quot;<strong>Guards... Fire.</strong>&quot; Laurent sighed, before producing his revolver and aiming right for Lark&#39;s heart.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What Laurent failed to realize was that Lark had him right where he wanted him! Kind of! He didn’t expect the man himself to be armed, at least. The guards, well, obviously. That’s their whole thing. 

It was a good thing that Lark knew exactly how to respond. Without any delay, his fiddle began a playing. That all too familiar glow leaked out from the etched runes as he started is song and dance. This time, it was a classic hearty jig. From ye days of old, found in any respectable inn or tavern, perhaps from Ireland. 

The fun song lead perfectly into his spell, as he moved faster than any human had any right to. Guard would take aim and fire, only to realize that they were completely off the mark. Each opening shot missed and ricochet off the environment in a dangerous manner, the plinks echoed ten fold in the smaller space. 

He used the opportunity to close the distance, his next idea put into motion. Of course, after the men realized what was happening they would quickly just lead their shots for the quick maim and murder that would unfold once down. After all, he could be working for that blasted Saber who threatened the entire city!

So, he let them. Each shot from the guards landed, directly into his torso. Yet not a single drop of blood would spill from those holes. Instead, they would see puffs of fabric as his shirt gained a few new places to protrude limbs from. Hints of black lined the edges of where the bullets landed. Body Armor.

And now he was in distance. He ramped up the jig from the somewhat quiet start into an explosive quick chorus! The air in the room rushed away from the musician, now in close contact with him. At such a close distance, it felt like very miniature hurricane had sprung from nowhere, a gust strong enough to potentially knock the men flat on their asses, if not their guns.</span>

His bow arm jerked hard outward, towards the instrument. A flash of silver was produced from the sleeve and caught with one half of his palm. A super awkward handle on the two objects, no doubt, but now he was armed! And vaguely dangerous!

He took a swing at Laurent, no particular body part in mind.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Why had he armed his opponent again?

The issue with running one of the most famous armament companies in Olympia came with the daunting issue that everyone had the same toys Laurent did. Even his revolver, which was discretely made for Laurent in anticipation for the City Grail War, could be matched by a heavily modified MacKenzie Modern Flintlock .27.

That included armor, naturally. Laurent ground his teeth. Maybe he should&#39;ve just armed the populous, and skimped out on Lark&#39;s armor. Then that way, Lark would&#39;ve died unceremoniously in a field.

The guards failed, not that Laurent was surprised. They needed to be armed better, but they were simple security, meant to escort out ruffians and protesters, not to fight mages. Annoying. The guards were blown back, pistols dropped as they were pushed back by Lark&#39;s grand ode.

&quot;Stand down! Protect the lobby!&quot; Laurent barked as Lark rushed towards him. Just as Lark prepared to slice open Laurent&#39;s neck, the businessman <em>jerked</em> out of Lark&#39;s way faster than he could blink. Magecraft! So MacKenzie could use it as well? That wasn&#39;t in the <em>Olympian Insider</em> magazines.

Laurent&#39;s bullet had no visible effect on Lark, but Laurent wasn&#39;t fooled. Even with body armor, it was like having a high velocity brick thrown straight into your sternum. It had to have hurt. That pain would help.

Using the surprise he had earned by using Magecraft, Laurent lashed himself to a lightpost outside the lobby, and began <em>falling</em> towards it. The businessman could fly? This world was far too cruel...

As the businessman fell past, he scraped his hand against several heavy potted plants in the lobby, which then flew towards Lark, aiming to give him a knock on the head. Hopefully another well placed bullet would warrant a reaction from the modern bard...

<strong>BANG!</strong>

Now that Laurent was outside, Lancer could strike...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A deep exhale of quiet frustration exuded from Lancer as he witnessed his master jump the gun once again. The boy will never learn it seems. Running headfirst into danger is simply how he operates, there seems no other way around it for him. If one of his soldiers had ever acted so brashly they would have been placed on latrine duty for a month until they learned to not run into shit and endanger others. Despite this Uther put up with Lark’s antics because in truth the twig of a man had begun to grow on him. Although he had a great distance to go till he was truly a warrior befitting the station he was placed in. So much had occurred to the boy that Uther longed for him to reap a fraction of the success that he aspired for. A king or leader he was not, but a thoughtful man was a the pedestal he could rightly stand upon. 

However, the moniker he most accurately represented currently was that of a fool for rushing into an enemy base without backup and little defend himself aside from his violin, remaining gear from the siege on Dolorous Gard, and his whit. It was within Uther’s nature to rush in to Lark’s aid, but this assault was specifically requested by his master to be conducted on his own for the time being. Patience was never the King’s strong suite, it was always something he struggled even as a young man. Memories of yesteryear amongst the war against the Saxons would often cross his mind, and the voice of that damned wizard’s lectures.</span>

The best course of action is keep the opposing armies surrounded and pick small segments off one by one.  Cut off all outward paths from their cities and deplete their supply line.

It’s for that reason that it behooved the High King take everything he said with a grain of salt In many ways Uther shared that trait with him, caring only enough for others as long as they served some purpose to him. He was proud to have a woman such as Lady Igraine by his side to elevate his standing, however, his adoration had since been waining for the woman since she had unsuccessfully produced him a male heir. The first was shipped off to Orkney to be wed when they had reached the appropriate age while the most recent one had been placed under the charge of Merlin, although Uther was not much aware of what he had done with the girl. The wizard proclaimed she was the answer they were looking for, yet that was a hard prospect on faith alone.

 Still he could not afford to simply stand still and wait for Britainia’s savior to arrive, he was still King and needed to do all he could to defend it. “I’ll take your words under consideration Merlin, however, my brother is hiding in that capital. He has tortured my people and put fear into their hearts for the future, it is as if he casts a shadow on wherever he makes his presence known. Vortigern has to be stopped here and now, otherwise his tyranny will only stretch further across my lands. I hope your visions of the future are true, but I fear I may not be there to see it.

So long friend.” Uther than dashed on horse back to what subsequently was to be his final battle in life, where he fought his brother to a stand still before the white dragon retreated, whereby as his final living act the High King imbedded the Ceremonial Sword Caliburn into a nearby stone. 

Back upon the present field Ither witnessed the enemy rumble into the courtyard in view, he seemed distracted with Lark and unaware of what observed overhead. He had warned his master beforehand that if the opportunity arose he would take it. Invisible Air fades away from Lancer’s body as it begins to violently swirl around in a pointed long fashion around his and upwards of a narrow indiscernible length. He had not yet used the technique in such a way, but this seemed as good time as any to drop the hammer. The energy began to build up around his hidden weapon as Uther took aim and was preparing to strike.</span>

Unfortunately, Lark’s was a knife while Laurents was Magecraft. Not much to be done about that, as the target in question literally <em>flew</em> outside. On the way out his hand brushed against a variety of beautiful and, more importantly, heavy-looking plants in their vases. 

Those were vaguely easy to dodge, although annoying. With another round of notes in continuation with the jig, he sidestepped the first two, each one barreled past towards the nearby wall. Each one crashed with some semblance of terminal velocity. That last one, though, was in the perfect spot as compared to the last two to make it almost impossible to dodge. 

That worked well in his favor, for Laurent was using the plants as a <em>distraction</em>. Another shot had been lined up, and the click of the hammer onto the barrel was deafening like before. The planter caught the bullet a little, which made the impact of it fell akin to the stone itself. It impacted his chest with a heavy thud as Lark was knocked back several feet. Combined with the bullet itself and he was put on his knees for a few brief moments.

The musician took several deep breaths, each one a little more painful than the last. Vapors of gunpowder burnt his nostrils as he struggled back to his feet, ears still ringing from the sounds of gunfire. While the guards might be scrambling to figure out what the hell was going on, Lark would find himself slowly on his way towards Laurent, now on the outside. He had hoped to avoid the abysmal weather outside, but that wasn’t an option.

“What a clever idea,” he called out. “To throw yourself outside! How did you know the unbearable heat was my one weakness!”</span>

His instrument had been brought back to position, and he strung his notes slowly but surely. “However, some would say that I’ll have enough adrenaline to kill a small child inside my veins in the coming minute. It’ll take more than that to take me down.”

He glanced towards the rooftop Lancer found himself on. He was now visible, and was in the process of charging up his attack. It would be a shame to not strike the killing blow himself, but not much could be done about that. 

“The same can’t be said for you, unfortunately. The great Icarus flew into the sun as well…”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster had fallen behind Laurent just as ordered, following 30 paces behind him. Nietzsche&#39;s eye was keen on Laurent, he was rational for believing danger to be near at all times. Men of Laurents stature were commonly hated, especially if they meddled in serious affairs. However, Nietzsche no longer worried about his Master. Laurent had come a long way and the philosophers faith in victory had grown. 

Just as luck would have it, today would be a day to test Nietzsche&#39;s faith. Caster stood back as Lark approached Laurent. Unlike Uther, Nietzsche had planned to watch the altercation without care for Lark&#39;s servant. He wouldn&#39;t let Laurent die of course, Cater only wanted to get a stronger grasp of his Master&#39;s capabilities. 

Unfortunately Nietzsche&#39;s observation was cut short as he sensed a strong presence. His eyes darted to Lancers position as he readied an attack. Caster eye twitched, his teeth rubbing together. Just like Assassin, Uther had decided to go for a quick finish. Nietzsche didn&#39;t blame their desire for a swift victory, however, there is more to winning then the victory alone. 

A disgruntled caster let out a large sigh before projecting his voice into the mind of Lancer. &quot;I would not strike if I were you.&quot; A strange voice permeated through Lancer&#39;s mind. It was an unusual voice, however it came from the same likeness of his conscious, it was inside of his head. 

&quot;Lay down your weapon from those weaker than you and confront me. This is your warning, strike and your guard will be down. I will strike you at that very moment. Lay down your weapon and I will give you a chance to prepare for out battle.&quot;

Lancer sensed another servant in the vicinity and within moment he heard their voice pervade his mind. Glancing in the direction of Caster, Uther allowed invisible air to dissipate and calm, no energy wasted but still prepared as it calmly enveloped the holy lance. Although he did not literally drop his weapons, it was clear that Uther mitigated the aggression. A servant that could invade the mind likely had psionic abilities. Regardless of how fast the king may be, he wouldn’t be able to outrun an assault like that. He needed to examine his enemy, gauge where their power laid before he struck again. “Our masters have their own grudges to settle between one another, forgive me for being protective and acting as another tool in his arsenal. I was not yet aware that Laurent gained a new servant, I hope your fate is not like the last. Perhaps you could shed a light on what his goal in all of this is. From the outside looking in, he appears to be working many of the other groups against each other, or In our case setting us up for failure.” It was not a comfortable position for Uther to act patient and methodical, however, he did not want to underestimate his opponent. One wrong move and it could be over for him. He didn’t heed the words of Merlin back then and it meant his doom, things will be different now. He was a far better king and warrior. <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

The battle against Lark was fairly difficult on Laurent, as well. There was plenty of information on Lark&#39;s abilities, most of which had been gathered by his informants and spies, but most of it now eluded him, infuriating the businessman. Nonetheless, Lark had come knocking on Laurent&#39;s front door, would it be rude to not open in response?

&quot;It&#39;s good to know, though, that you can&#39;t defeat the Saber terrorizing Olympia, but you can go after one of the pillars responsible for what little security we have. Thank you, Lark. Truly, you are a man of the people.&quot; Laurent said dryly, hand in his pocket. Goodness, his voice could be so irritating when he put his mind to it.

&quot;Or, perhaps my accusation was correct, and you ARE allied with Saber. But why not come with a swarm of copper knights? Hmm...&quot; Laurent said, waving his finger thoughtfully, as though he were some condescending instructor. &quot;You are an enigma, Lark. Why are you here?&quot;

This was good! While Laurent was doing his monologue, Uther would strike him down like a bolt from on high! Lark wouldn&#39;t have to lift a finger. By the time Laurent finished his theorizing, Lancer would be ready to fire. All Lark had to do was wait.

<strong>But the bolt never came.</strong>

What had happened? Technical difficulties on Lancer&#39;s end? Was Rhongomyniad warming up? Why wasn&#39;t Laurent a grease spot on the pavement yet? Something was wrong.

&quot;Icarus? What&#39;s your plan, violinist?&quot; Laurent chuckled, before looking around. &quot;What&#39;re you waiting for? Strike me down! Do it!&quot;

Lancer...

He closed the distance even further, until they were about ten feet away. The musician looked worse for wear, but no signs of dying anytime soon. Darn.

“And I would rather die that alliance with that damn Saber, we both know this as well as anyone! We can drop the pretense that I am now, save us both that particular trouble. No, I am here for a different reason. Your dragon hoard accrued from the acclimated fear of that Servant is disgusting, and you lead me on a fool’s gambit! An expedition with no promise of success!”

Revenge, for lack of a better term.

Above all else, his sun hat still stayed on despite all the action that had just occurred. He had come prepared this time, lesson learned from his first endeavor with the object with a string bound to the edges of where his head entered the hat. Such a tremendous help in keeping the thing on, but it made him look a little silly upon closer inspection.

Said sun hat made it easier for him to see that Lancer had… stopped his attack. What? That didn’t make sense. Now was the perfect opportunity to strike! The guy stood out in the middle of a relative nowhere, nothing but a thin lamp post to block a very large attack. His attack looked almost ready as well. Very few things would make a Servant stand down, if only temporary. A sniper’s mark on his back, or…

“<em>Lancer, yes or no. Is there a Servant in the area?</em>”

Lark waited for Lancer to answer, meanwhile he stalled for more time. “And the comparison is obvious. You quite literally just flew into the sunlight, no? Besides, I finally got around to that myth a few days back. I wanted to do more research on the City that we are fighting over. Felt that the myth had at least a couple parallels to the real world.”</span>

“And to finally answer your last, most important question: I’m waiting for the perfect song to pop in my head before I cut you down. Have to set the mood. You understand, right?”

Whether it was an excuse or the truth, Lark tensed up as soon as he finished his words. Perhaps the piece was almost in mind, or he wanted to be ready for the scenario that Laurent raised his gun. Either way, he was ready to go another tune.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s face was expressionless as Lark explained all the reasons on why the businessman should be struck down. After a few moments, his lips begrudgingly twisted into a frown.

&quot;<strong>Stupid boy.</strong>&quot; Laurent sneered. &quot;Trust me when I say that cracking my shell won&#39;t end well for you.&quot; Laurent said, taking off his suit and untying his tie, before folding them and tossing them to the side. &quot;What I <strong>know</strong>,&quot; Laurent continued, &quot;is that you are somehow both suicidal and stupid. You couldn&#39;t do something as simple as killing Saber, so you turn around and assassinate one of the few people holding him back, why again?&quot;

The businessman chuckled. If he believed Lark&#39;s explanation for finding the perfect song, he did not show it. Knowing the businessman, though, he suspected Lancer was around here somewhere. So why did he not feel stressed or twitchy? Something was amiss.

&quot;For my money? Petty man. The fortune I accrue means nothing if the entire city goes up in smoke. Trust me when I say I&#39;ll put the money to good use. And don&#39;t accuse me for your failings. Lancer said it himself: he&#39;d go after Saber at the first opportunity. I did nothing. You failed yourself through poor planning and poor execution. You are a failure. You and your self-absorbed Lancer.&quot;

With that ominious claim, Laurent flicked a bullet into the air, caught it, and his arm glowed brightly for a moment. The bullet was loaded, and Laurent shot it to the side.

An obvious miss. The man couldn&#39;t hit the broad side of the barn if he tried. However, it quickly curved towards Lark, a glint of light revealing its arc and trajectory.

Laurent rushed forward. A two-pronged assault!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The fight was on! Lark darted forward as soon as Laurent raised his firearm, ready to dodge and weave as needed. His music changed back to the hearty dance song from the lobby, only magnified passively by his own magecraft. 

Only it wasn’t needed at first. A loaded round was fired off to the complete side as Laurent too rushed forward. 

The tiniest glint of light gave way to the intentions behind the round: a flank without need for a second man! Clever boy, that one. With a random move, he was back in the barrel, and the spear was ready to strike down. With the two dimensions covered, either or would possibly lead to a direct shot and a potential kill.

Well, it was a good thing that they existed in more than two planes. The X and Y-axis had been covered, but the Z-axis would be his savior in this scenario. Lark met the rush head on, <em>down low</em>. He ducked down at the last possible second, a limbo pose struck as the bullet whizzed by. The shell pieced through the molecules that separated him from the yellow object and skirted by, no longer a threat for the next few moments. 

Speaking of, Laurent was still there. He whipped his upper body back up and stepped to the side of whatever swing or pointed barrel the businessman could muster up. Increased agility would be the single thing that let him do anything other than collapse instantly from a weapon, bullet or otherwise.

“Which is more bizarre, the pot talking or the fact that it called the kettle black,” he quipped. His bow arm struck out with a short jab, with a knife that gleamed in the sunlight. “That was a joint affair, which means the blame falls on both of us! When will you get off that ridiculously high horse and join the world back in <strong>reality</strong>?”</span>

Caster kept his eyes glued on Uther. He pulled at his mustache while he fished for answers to Lancers question. It seemed an odd question to him. What else is there to victory for such a greedy man. Surely a kings mind was as keen as a philosophers Nietzsche thought. Caster had complete control in his confrontation with Assassin, however the philosopher intended to be more careful around Uther. 

&quot;Dear King are you not familiar with controlling the political battlefield. What is my Master doing? Why does he do it? What is Laurent but a modern day ruler? Such questions can be answered by yourself.&quot; 

Nietzsche spoke only to dance around Uther&#39;s question, he had no intent to give insight to his Master&#39;s mental state. &quot;Tell me Uther, and yes Uther I am well aware of who you are, do you intend to kill me? Our Master&#39;s are enemies but that means nothing of us. I invite a king from an era before mine to indulge in a conversation of old ideals. That is more exciting than death... And make no mistake, I refer only to your demise.&quot;

For a few moments, the two were interlocked in a brutal tango, with Lark dodging each of Laurent&#39;s lightning-fast strikes. How were they so fast? Laurent wasn&#39;t some secret boxer, was he? A cruel uppercut, followed by Lark dancing away. It would&#39;ve made for a grand street performance, if the two weren&#39;t fighting to kill.

&quot;I am the only one still in reality. You, who went after a mere spectator in this City Grail War for no other reason than some petty revenge, stopping me from going to strike down Saber.&quot; The businessman mocked the foe joyously as he flew around the battlefield, trying to find a weakness in Lark&#39;s defenses.

&quot;Oh yes, I&#39;m aware. With Lancer acting as council, there is no reason for you to make such a bold and idiotic move. Was it your butler? He rushed to seal an alliance between us. I would not be surprised if he put you up to such a rushed assassination attempt as well. A dull move for a dull person. I suppose a bargain bin entertainer attracts similar scavengers.&quot;

Laurent sneered, unknowingly spitting on the grave of Lark and Lancer&#39;s ally. Was this some elegant strategy, or was Laurent just going to systematically insult every person Lark had known until the entertainer stumbled?

Little did the businessman know that he had struck the freshest wound...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A familiar voice entered Lark’s mind in response to his previous question. <em>”Yes, a caster by my estimation. They appear to have telekinetic abilities. I can’t risk attacking Laurent and being unable to defend against a mental strike. I have to deal with the threat in front of me otherwise this battle will conclude before it’s even began. I apologize Lark, you may just get your wish to take Laurent down on your own. I swear my Lance shall meet his heart by the end of this. However, for the time being you will have to incorporate all that you have learned and fight on your own for now.”</em>

Uther stared blankly at Nietzche before a grin appeared upon his face. “That is what it always comes down to, more power, more control, more recognition. You are right in the fact that I understand the appeal of being a ruler, to stand above others and have say over their lives. To certain individuals it can be a glorious gift or a destructive curse, I’m curious which way it’ll be for Laurent. If his current actions are any indication on how he intends to run Olympia, I fear for its future. Due in no small part to his intervention and manipulation the city has been thrown into turmoil while he reaps profit. Now as a businessman that may be great, but as a king or ruler you live and die by the welfare of your people. When you claim the crown your citizen will credit you with anything and everything that occurs to them, whether good or bad. Considering how he has taken up the tact of hiding away in his castle, I do not how his subject shall react when their homes continued to be knocked to the ground. But that is simply my observation as a former ruler myself in regards to how he is currently presenting himself. My actual curiosity is the why.” Uther could tell when someone was trying to redirect him or avoid his questions. Caster</span>

Slowly Lancer approached the man, not in an aggressive manner, but more so to get a better observation of him. “You seem like a philosophical individual Caster, what are your reasons for siding with this man. I assume you have no stake or concern over the actual state of the city, so what is it you wish to examine your master. Watch what burns first, him or his kingdom? In addition, what do you stand to gain from winning the grail war. Is your study more important than that of someone who has the desire for something benevolent, that is unless you see Laurent’s aspirations as righteous to which I would begin to doubt your wisdom and understanding of society. At least that’s what I’d hope, that you are simply misguided and not wishing to see to chaos in order to watch how the flames burn. As a perfecter to a kingdom that eventually fell, I recognize the cracks I left for future generations and how it could have been different if I had only strengthened my people so that my inheritor wouldn’t have had such a hard time keeping it together.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The philosopher grinned as Uther pulled the conversation back to the point of Laurents reasoning. Uther was a smart man as all Kings should be. A static ran through Nietzsche&#39;s bones, he couldn&#39;t shake his feeling of excitement. This is what he wanted from the war. A conversation with a King, a figure who was the very definition of old world values. To Nietzsche, this war is paradise. 

&quot;On the contrary Uther I care very much about what happens to this city, to the world... To humanity... I dedicated my life to warning humanity of it&#39;s errors, the aging morals of old creeping on human progression. Yes I care very much and I am heartbroken to see that humanities trajectory was just as grim as I predicted. I side with Laurent because It is a necessity. Should he die I too will fade away. I do not fear what he will do nor do I have much faith he will win the war. Tell me Lancer, If Laurent fails do you think there will never be a second attempt at conquest? The same mistakes of man are to be repeated until the end of time. Yes, we are destined to fail, just as you destined your daughter to fail.&quot; 

Nietzsche gave his rebuttal making sure to work Artoria into the mix. Nietzsche was betting on the fact that her fate was a soft spot for Uther. The philosopher had spent his down time doing extensive research on his opponents. Caster was a man of smarts only. To win he needed every mental advantage possible.

One was just a businessman who knew how to throw a punch, while the other had never really considered fighting back during an encounter. The song and dance kept its tempo for a surprisingly long time, each note from the violin in perfect rhythm with the punches thrown and the steps used to dodge. 

That is, until Geeves was mentioned. Even if indirectly. 

Something sparked within the musician. His song took a more sinister tone after Laurent finished speaking the new round of insults and jabs. Each note was rushed one after another, a river of sound that promised a beating. Lark’s own face grew red, a slight frown followed by a narrowing of his eyebrows. As clear as day: anger.

Weakness found.

“Considering you were heading to a business meeting, I’m sure that you and your <strong>Servant</strong>,” Lark said through gritted teeth, “had no intention to stop Saber. Not until you milked this city dry and spit on its corpse.”

He kept up on his assault, no longer the measured song and dance from before but something a lot more serious. “Who’d you kill to get that, huh? Which one of the contestants had to die just for your twisted ambitions?!’ Spectator’ my arse! I see the snake hidden inside the brush, ready to strike at a moment’s notice!”

Now there were some personal parallels to be drawn between the two men who battled in the streets. Their fight continued, but Lark moved with the zeal of a Berserker. His pace increased even more, his jabs and swipes doubled. That left his defenses with something to desire, though...</span>

My only failing is that I could not sire a son before I passed. Merlin insisted that she would be enough, but I see that the wizard was not entirely wise on all things. I commend the girl for holding the kingdom together for awhile, but in the end she simply wasn’t strong enough to make it last. In truth she should be proud of what she accomplished, even a female Pendragon has the capability to stand a part from average men. Now if you intend to infuriate me by mocking that my beloved Camelot is no more, than you’ll find yourself sorely dissatisfied. Since my summoning I have made peace with my kingdom’s fate, and my wish is to simply uplift the new one that I have been brought into. I want for Olympia and it’s people to prosper and grow, to be the strongest and most feared land around.” Uther’s we’re proud and firm, even when discussions his daughter. It could be seen that these</span>

Uther began to circle around Nietzche, inching closer with every rotation, his eyes never leaving the mustached man. “You ask me what I think would happen if Laurent were to fail. The answer is simple, it would be a victory, another battle one against tyranny. I agree, history repeats itself, yes. Many people are under the delusion that there can be this halt to fighting, a predestined peace among nations. That is purely the dreamlike ideals of those who have never participated war, or at least hasn’t been effected by it in a way where they’ve experienced up close. War doesn’t end, only the participants change. There will always be another man seeking power that is not his to claim, just like their will always be those who meet them at the gate to fight against them. Lord Brandin for example, he is also a man who fancies himself a king. He thinks all there is to do is conquer or take land. He knows nothing about leading men or uplifting people, it is seen in the fact that his only allies are automatons, even his own master is at odds with him. I guarantee, that a group will soon rise up against him, to overthrow the madness. If not now, sometime in the future. Humans do not favor being treated like cattle, especially when it’s blatant. The more you treat them as slaves, the more they will want to rebel. Brandin will learn that soon enough. Laurent will learn that lesson if he keeps seeing them as price tags or beasts of burden while he hides away in his comfy tower. Citizens are willing to tolerate a crooked bureaucrat if he signs their checks, the sentiment changes when they notice he believes them to have full autonomy of their livelihood. How long can he honestly expect to hold control if he continues to be afraid of his own shadow or the average man on the street. He’s making far too many enemies and not maintaining enough friends, and if it’s not us someone will get him.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Finally, some luck. Out of all the topics he could&#39;ve poked and pried at, Laurent found a weak spot on his very first try. 

Lashing himself to the remains of a potted plant behind Lark, Laurent flicked an empty bullet shell into the air. Empty, obviously. A cheap deception, one Lark wouldn&#39;t fall for. However, as Laurent flew towards his foe, his direction quickly shifted towards the bullet.

Wordlessly, Laurent emptied his entire revolver Lark&#39;s way, Many were aimed in slightly different directions, with the intent of sealing Lark&#39;s escape. If he went left or right, he would eat lead.

&quot;Hah!&quot; Laurent said as he quickly lashed himself to the ground, before going in for a jab to the gut. Lark was fast, faster than Laurent, and just as fast as the bullets he fired about. However, Geeves was a gaping wound, and Laurent had thrown salt into it, goading Lark into an attack.

Laurent lunged forward, but Lark, despite his hasty offense, was still fast enough to take barely a touch. In exchange, Laurent got a knife across his chest.

The businessman howled in pain, dropping to his knees. The cut was surface-level, but still stung. Most importantly, it gave Lark the perfect opportunity to strike down the indirect murderer of one of his closest companions.

Until suddenly, Lark was flying away, and the resounding thud and cracks revealed his location: Laurent had lashed him to the window, and by extension, the tower itself.

The businessman took a deep breath, before getting to his feet. He looked at his shirt in annoyance. &quot;This shirt cost more money than you could possibly imagine. More than your backwater little tavern makes in a week.&quot; Laurent seemed genuinely hurt that his shirt had been ruined. Maybe Lark should just set his entire closet ablaze.</span>

Laurent simply sneered at Lark&#39;s accusation that he had killed Caster&#39;s Master. &quot;My business is everything that goes on in Olympia. Whether or not you believe me, my intention was to go defeat Saber. Does me not having a Servant make that more logical? It certainly makes more sense than mindlessly rushing to kill someone you perceive as Servantless, just to convince yourself that you, Lancer, and that little butler of yours are the good guys.&quot;

Laurent reloaded his gun methodically, safe in the knowledge that Lark could not physically harm him from being confined to the wall of the tower. &quot;Nonetheless, this is an act of treason on an alliance neither party broke off. When we&#39;re done here, I think I&#39;ll buy up your little bar, and make your butler work for me.&quot;

As Laurent finished reloading his gun, he lashed himself to MacKenzie Tower, and rushed to finish off Lark, who was a few floors above.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Although he was keeping up with Caster Uther was still hearing the rambling of Laurent. The man had a big mouth on him, seemed more invested in belittling Lark than actually trying to fight. Typically the reason someone would do that is either their stalling for time, have no real strategies and hope to catch their opponent slipping, or regardless of their actual fighting capacity subconsciously think little of themselves and must make themselves feel big by bringing others down. Whatever reason mattered not, he was a loud mouth he needed to be shut up. Lancer couldn’t directly attack the businessman, but there was still other ways he could help his master. 

Suddenly invisible air flew from Uther’s side, with no physical indication that it was going to occur, and enwrapped itself around the legs of Lark. The musician was now twice as fast as he was before, making him far more difficult to strike, especially with bullets. It would feel to him as if the wind itself was carrying him aloft with each movement.  Uther would hold a hand up in defense while facing caster. “I’m not attacking Lark, but I think I can be forgiven for still aiding my master. After all, you yourself are acting as a proverbial shield preventing me from killing your own master outright. With that said, continue with your study and analysis of me.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The chain of events happened so fast, they blurred in his mind. A multitude of bullets were unleashed his way, which was a good idea to cut off most of his escapes. This was countered with a ramp-up in the song, in rhythm with each shot that rang out. Air flew out around Lark himself, which meant that each bullet was thrown off track a <em>little</em> further than before. Enough for him to squeeze between each round with no room for comfort.

And with Laurent’s minor love tap, Lark responded with a love cut. A thin slash blossomed from his chest, a cut to the fabric and the outermost layer of skin. Apparently enough to drop the man. With his knife raised high, the musician--

--flew off his feet. What? 

It took all his wits to not drop his instrument nor his weapon as his gravitational pull changed entirely. No longer was he shackled to the ground, but now something behind him. MacKenzie Tower. He landed firmly on his backside, as if he had been dropped off a dozen feet or so drop. Not only did it hurt like hell, it also drove the wind out from him. 

“I never said,” he started, spit launched from his mouth as he lifted his head, “that we were the good guys! But you certainly are the bad guy here, and no mistake!”

He struggled to his feet, the weird sensation of being sideways still a hard concept to get used to. “And that just goes to show how small that pink mass inside your skull is. Even if Geeves were still around, he’d <strong>never</strong> associate with pond scum like you.”

If Lark wasn’t sure what Laurent’s Magecraft was before, it was certainly obvious now: gravity. The man could probably change what held the all too familiar pull on who or what. If he had to guess, he also needed to make contact with whatever he used the technique on as well. It explained how he could make Lark attached to the building. 

“The revenge I enact will be the perfect dish for this brutally hot day.”</span>

Invisible Wind swept around Lark’s feet and encased them in weird swirls. It wasn’t obvious at first, but when Lark started his song once again, he seemed supersonic by comparison. His legs blurred as the distance was closed. Any attacks Laurent attempted were dodged before they could get close to being finished, any shots fired would be dodged by raw speed alone. His attacks weren’t any faster, but that didn’t matter when he was almost unhittable.

“We are more similar than different,” he quipped after he dodged a particularly nasty fist, “but those differences are worlds apart.”
He sidestepped yet another attempt to shoot him down, “I know my faults. Mistakes. Limitations. You only pretend!”

Finally, the musician attacked with something other than his actual weapon. He dashed around Laurent and shot his leg out from behind. The limb flashed towards the businessman with lighting speed, “Dodge this, you blight upon the world!”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The rapid footsteps of Lark ignited, becoming a blur of indistinguishable sounds as Lancer bestowed his Master with the speed of the winds. Meanwhile, Laurent had a gun, and a philosopher that spoke too much. Lucky him.

Laurent looked down, and to the side. There was nothing he could comfortably lash Lark to, in order to stop this assault. He could throw a bullet towards the ground, or away, but Lark could simply use one of Lancer&#39;s various other techniques.

Luckily, Laurent and Lark were still standing on the windows of the lobby, which stretched little over a hundred feet into the air. The lobby was also encased in glass. Perfect.

Thinking fast, Laurent shot a bullet onto the window he was standing on. Glass shattered, bouncing lights and reflections all around the duo, letting the businessman dodge the blunt of Lark&#39;s strike, taking a remarkably firm kick to the calf. Painful, but workable. Gustave would&#39;ve had a field day with this.

As Laurent fell through the window to the lobby, he once again lashed himself to the window. Now this time, he was on the other side of the window. Lark, on the outside. Laurent, on the inside.

&quot;<strong>CASTER, DO SOMETHING!</strong>&quot; Laurent howled as he continued climbing the tower from the inside. Soon, he would meet the ceiling, and he would need to face Lark on the other side of the window...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche narrowed his eyes as Uther aided his Master. That wouldn&#39;t do... Nietzsche wanted Laurent to fight his own battle and any interference was too much for the philosophers liking. He shook his head looking down at the floor. His time to strike was soon, Uther was set in his ideals, he had the mind and the makings of a king. Further conversation would lead to nothing. 

&quot;Yes you are quite aware of Kingly stature. However I disagree with you Uther. Laurent and Brandin will fail because they do not know the happiness of men.... You&#39;re failure is controlling it too much, such is the tragedy of all Kings. A smart ruler creates a sense of freedom, one strong enough so their subjects never realize their slavery to the monarch.&quot; Nietzsche followed Lancer with his eyes watching carefully. His movements were useless, Nietzsche could and will attack from any direction and he was soon to make it known. 

Caster opened his mouth to speak once more ,however, he was cut off by his Master . The philosopher let out a deep breath turning to Laurent. &quot;Patience Master, there are more important things to this war then battles!&quot; Nietzsche let out a small sigh like an annoyed child. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Uther but due to your interference and my Master&#39;s displeasure with it, we&#39;ll be ending today&#39;s discussion&quot; as the last word came from Nietzsche&#39;s lips, Uther would begin to feel light on his feet. The world that he saw disappeared pulling him into a vast darkness, his own mind. The transition from reality to an internal world would be odd and unnatural. The sensation of being pulled into ones mind was a nauseating feeling. 

&quot;Now before we start Uther I have one more question. As a king what is your greatest regret?&quot; Caster&#39;s voice echoed through the empty space. He was nowhere to be seen but his mind resided within Uther&#39;s.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The world faded around him as Uther felt his mind and body pulled away. Due to his magic resistance the experience was not as jarring as it likely would have been to others, but it seemed to be a powerful illusion nonetheless. Caster was enacting his power onto him, there’s little the king could do aside from hold strong and power through the madness. His thoughts and hopes went with Lark. Lancer’s invisible air should remain active upon him and continue to maintain its form. This was to be the true test for his master, if he learned enough to fight and stand on his own. For there will not likely be any intervention from the king anytime soon. “Fine Caster, I’ll play your game and answer your question. Although in equal share I think I should get to know your name, it’s only fair considering you get to openly use mine.”

 Lancer stilled his mind to ponder on any regrets he had, if any. His wish was based on the desire to create a new kingdom, he had no desire to bring back the old Camelot. In life he never stopped Vortigern himself, but his inheritor saw to that. Every action he made in life was deliberate, precise, and unyielding in resolve. “I apologize for the disappointment, but as I ponder I can not think of a single regret. A king must be absolute in any and all decisions he makes, there can never be room for doubt. Whether right or wrong, my decisions as a ruler should be owned and acknowledge by myself. To look back upon my tenure in such a way would be a disservice to the common folk that I represented. I do not know what is the meaning of your ability, but you’ll be hard pressed to get to buckle under my own weight.” Uther swung Rhongmyniad around in a defensive position ready to meet whatever challenge laid before him. <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Another gunshot, but this time aimed down. Laurent took a dive on the inside and flipped. Feet almost mirrored his own as he latched onto the glass in a reversed manner. Lark could faintly hear Laurent’s shout over his own music, a plea to his <em>Caster</em> to help him out.

That information was nice to know, but it would probably do little in terms of the battle. Kept his Servant busy, but that’s about it. It wouldn’t matter at the end of the day, so long as Lancer helped him out. 

Which, would help him in the next few steps. Or rather many. Lark followed Laurent’s pace upward, towards the ceiling inside. While he wasn’t sure what his gameplan was, if it involved breaking all the glass then it would be best to not be on the glass. While gravity lashed him to a part of the tower, the Earth lashed him to the ground likewise. A jump off a cliff would bring him back down all the same. It would be unfun to find out the hard way how it worked.

And Lark beat him to the punch easily. When Laurent was three fourths the way there, Lark had safely reached the upper part of the large window. Of course, if it was possible to return his center of gravity to the ground it would certainly kill. So would his gun if he found himself far away. A hint of Vertigo rushed into his head as he patiently waited for the businessman to come back to his side, a knife sat perched for any body part to pop out.

Who was the fish in the barrel now?</span>

However, Caster did see to be controlling the pace of the battle. &quot;No it does not matter, we will end Uther in this battle&quot; the philosopher thought to himself. &quot;My name is Friedrich Nietzsche, I am a philosopher from a few centuries after your time. I have devoted my life to analyzing the human mind, searching for a human purpose and self mastery.&quot; 

A silence filled the void of Lancer&#39;s mind as Nietzsche thought of his next action. He had not received a desirable answer from his question before. Perhaps he just needed to phrase it differently. &quot;Uther one more question and then I will defeat you... I do not ask you your regrets as a king, rather I want to know what you regret as a person.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Am I meant to tell you the means of my defeat?” Uther was willing to entertain the philosopher and his questions, however, the more he probed the more evident it was that this was likely part of the process of his ability. “I wonder what would occur if I simply did not answer. You would not get to study me, and I would have little fear of what occurred afterwards. Although I suppose I’d also put you in a state where you’d need to be creative, I’m certain I’d be able to get through it but that would also likely take longer and I do not have the time to play forever.” Uther looked around the void and wondered what state he was actually in, if he was actually transported or his body was still unmoving in reality. All the more reason to hurry through this game, lest he be tampered with from the outside. 

Lancer’s wandered once more to find an answer to Caster’s query, the king truthfully last time. He carried little to no ill feelings of his past. Changing the angle to his personal life did little to shake this resolve. If Nietzche’s power is dependent on his opponent being remorseful than he currently faced an unfortunate enemy, Uther lived his life proudly with little thought out into his rights and wrongs. However, one small factor peaked at his mind, something that was not his fault at all but something that he did wish had a different outcome. One single factor that might have made a difference in the fate of Camelot. “If there is anything that I desired to transpire differently it was the fact that my inheritor was not a man, so much of the drama that befell them was because they could not satisfy and maintain their wife. It cannot be helped, the kingdom needed a symbolic matriarch to stand by their king. However, due to the circumstances the Queen felt she could seek love in another and that was the sole reason I believe that Camelot fell.”</span>

The sound of glass shattering echoed behind behind Lark as Laurent preemptively shattered the windows, before returning to the outside of the building. Despite all the glass falling onto the businessman, it seemed to all miss him.

&quot;Excellent. Finally, he&#39;s done something productive.&quot; Laurent noted, watching as Lancer disappeared into mist. &quot;Our differences mean little. I do not care how similar you are to me. You are in my way. I respect your dedication, but that will not save you—&quot;</span>

He laughed <strong>hard</strong>. This was it? Lark was going after him because of this? Because his <em>butler</em> had died? It was almost too much for the businessman to handle.

&quot;You... You BROUGHT your personal household caretaker into the field of battle? Oh, of <strong>course</strong> you did! That&#39;s just what you people do, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Laurent said &quot;people&quot; as if he were talking about something revolting. &quot;And your little friend died on the assault on Saber, did he? And now, in some herculean leap of logic, that is my fault, how? You haven&#39;t blamed me for that, but let&#39;s be realistic, if &#39;Greaves&#39; hadn&#39;t died, you would not be here.&quot;

The businessman took a step forward, as if Lark no longer meant anything. If this was his actual motivation, Laurent had nothing to fear. &quot;So now you&#39;re here, waiting for a shot at revenge? Please. You&#39;re not entitled to anything, barging in here for a whole slew of false reasons. &#39;Oh, your immeasurable wealth is strangling the city, you dragon!&#39;&quot; Laurent mimicked Geeves&#39; voice as best he could. 

&quot;<strong>You don&#39;t care.</strong> If you did, you&#39;d be forming a begrudging alliance with me to stop Saber, now that you know I have a Servant. Yet you still attack me. I want to save this city so that I can rule it. I am far more honest than you.&quot; 

&quot;People are replaceable. I have little care for them individually. As a part of the greater whole that is Olympia. <strong>Well, that is where they have value.</strong>&quot;

&quot;As long as I feel joy in being above the common man, I will continue to invest in and protect this city. There&#39;s your &#39;honestly&#39;. Get out of my sight.&quot; 

Several pieces of glass shattered as Laurent shot several windows near Lark. Suddenly, his panel began to crack...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent laughed. His howling could be heard all around, with how obnoxious it was. ‘People’? ‘Greaves’? Lark stayed silent through the entire monologue. What point would there be in an argument for or against what his opponent said? Most of it was true, more than likely. 

Geeves was dead, and it was Lark’s fault. If he hadn’t joined the war in the first place, the old man would still be alive to this day. If he had been more adamant about not joining forces with the demon in front of him currently, Geeves would still be alive. If he had commanded the butler to stay home instead of joining them on the battlefield, he would still be alive today.

That small niggle from the fight with Saber returned with a vengeance. Perhaps it would be best to simply let Laurent put him out of his own twisted form of misery, to plummet down from on high towards the desolate land below. Much like the contestants of the last Holy Grail War. Like the myth he fondly recalled a few minutes prior. 

So, why did he fly over the newly created gap from the bullets, back into the fray of combat? His legs danced with an invigorated fire, the violin poured the vibrant green light as his musical tirade reached the heavens itself. His body was on <em>fire</em>, ready to move and dance whilst his mind toiled away in the summer fields, the lowest of the low.

“As you assault my mental fortitude,” Lark said as he dodged and weaved around Laurent, “my body continues to move without a care in the world. I am in my element, yet I fail to see any reason to be.”

Maybe… that was the secret? To move without a care? To reach for the sun, the stars, just because he can? The sheer force of will, the simple desire to. The mindful machine worked it’s rut into the ground as it clung to that faint hope, that desire to obtain the unobtainable.</span>

Or maybe he had it all along? Many thoughts of this conundrum raced through his head as their battle continued on the skyscraper face, as bullets flew and music sang out.</span>

&quot;You dare pass your short comings on your daughter.&quot; Caster&#39;s voice rang in Uther&#39;s head with a sharp tone. &quot;I have done my research Uther, I have read your tale, did you forget so easily the wrong you have done by your other child?&quot; Nietzsche began to lecture Uther with a sudden frustration. If one thing bothered Nietzsche it was a lack of self responsibility. Yes Uther was the kind of man who blamed others for his faults, even if they are his own children. This was despicable in the eyes of Nietzsche. 

There was a silence in Uther&#39;s mind. Nietzsche had seemingly held his tounge for the time being. Their conversation was done. Nietzsche no longer cared to hear more, Uther was not as wise as the Philosopher hoped. Normally Nietzsche would trap his opponent in a world of tragedy, one suitable for holding his opponent. However, this time he would make an exception. Caster would show Uther the pain he placed on his children&#39;s 

The air around Lancer would grow cold in an instant. A flicker of torches would appear around the King as a long hallway stretched in front of him. The hallway was crafted of cubed stone, a velvet carpet separated his feet from the bricks. On either end of the hallway was darkness. Suddenly a voice would ring in his ears. A loud voice full of anger. &quot;Are you listening to me! That title, it does not belong to you!&quot; 

As the voice hit Uther&#39;s ears the body of said person would manifest in front of him. The dim light pressed against the woman revealing a black veil over their face. The person in question was someone easily recognizable. It was his daughter, Morgan, one which he had yet to speak of with Caster.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The vision solidified around the king and instead of viewing some grand horror, instead Uther beared witness to a space that seemed vaguely familiar to him. As if someone had reconstructed a room off of incomplete blue prints. This was the Royal Capital within Camelot. Caster had transported Lancer home. Inspecting around it was lifelike yet he could still differentiate that it was an illusion. At the angry tone of an otherwise sultry and alluring voice. The veil concealed a great deal of their face, yet somehow Uther still could pierce through it despite not seeing the exact details of their face. By the look of their body, the long flowing blonde hair, and even the voice that called upon a familiarity to a woman he once took up as a wife. Caster’s word the final nail in the mystery, Uther knew exactly who stood before him. A slight grin grew across his face as he stared directly at the young woman, with a furious aura about her. “Ahh…the first born. So this is what you came up with. You intend for me to fight an offspring I barely knew. I’m sure my heart will shake for a moment, but she is king past. This is simply a trick of the mind. To kill her, I doubt it will carry any true consequence on the real world. I will do what I must.”

Uther raised his arm in a defensive stance, prepared for the weight of his holy lance, however the weapon in question seemed for lighter as he raised his arm. Looking over he noticed his arms were far more</span>

Uther recognized this was not his own body, but that of someone else. The mystery would have carried on if he didn’t see the actual weapon that he gripped tightly in his fist. It was a large ornate long sword with a blue grip, a golden half arch cross guard, and a blade that seemed to carry a almost divine radiance. Although he had not seen it’s exact design before, Uther could piece together from the similarity it carried to a blade he carried in his own life, Lancer could tell he now wielded the legendary Excalibur that he had read about in the legends past his own death. This could mean only one thing, Uther had been projected into the body of his inheritor Artoria Pendragon.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Wait, no! This was NOT how this was supposed to go!

Laurent had spent years of his life making deals, worming his way into companies, discussing, debating, and arguing with company heads and government officials alike. No matter what happened, there was one thing that remained consistent:

<strong>Logic always prevailed</strong>.

That small bit of joy fueled Laurent. The idea that things could be so consistent and constant gave him a solid base to rely on. If he could say words. He could worm his way out of anything.

Lark had, in a very Lark-esque fashion, tossed that idea out the window.

Now, Laurent had to physically beat his foe into the dirt. There was nothing else he could do but spew insults, like a kid throwing a tantrum. It infuriated him. But also...

&quot;You have guts, <strong>Lark.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, finally acknowledging his foe. Something slight shifted within the businessman. &quot;Commitment is important, even if that goal is destined to fail. I commend you. However...&quot;

&quot;Music means nothing if it falls upon deaf ears. It&#39;s time to put your instrument down to be restrung.&quot; Laurent bellowed as glass orbited around him, before striking at Lark.

Their battle continued, fierce as fire, as Lark used his awe-inspiring agility to knock Laurent back, again and again. For each cut Lark received, Laurent received a strong jab. Rage and purpose fueled the entertainer. Which meant that the only way Laurent would win...

<strong>...was if he tapped into those emotions as well.</strong>

&quot;Hrrk!&quot; Laurent gasped as Lark struck him in the chest, dodging a bullet in the process. In exchange, Lark received a firm smack to the face. A fair strike, but nothing fatal.

Lark was fast, and that speed increased the amount of &#39;oomph!&#39; behind each of his punches and stabs.

Strike, dodge, repeat. The cycle continued. Blood splattered the windows as the two Masters climbed further and further up the skyscraper, hoisted by Laurent&#39;s Magecraft. Dolorous Gard loomed below, and blood made the terrain slippery.</span>

No. NO!</strong> Laurent thought to himself as he took another unarmed strike from Lark, getting flung backwards. All of the businessman&#39;s energy was devoted to dodging that knife, which was something Lark had taken advantage of. Even without rational thought, a man with something to fight for was a force indeed. 

Turning around, Laurent noticed something: they were reaching the top of the building. Laurent lashed himself to the corner of the roof, flying away from Lark at remarkable speeds. 

Breathing deeply, Laurent took a few steps towards the center of the roof—a location filled with antennae and other communication devices. However, it also had a small clearing meant for technicians. The elevator was close by as well.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re strong.</strong>&quot; Laurent said to nobody in particular, before taking a knee. Think. There had to be a way out of this, but words—

No, words had not betrayed him. His own perspective had. Then if he had—

No time. Lark would be here in a second.

&quot;Stupid entertainer. He&#39;ll be here any second. How nice it must be to have zero obligations. To dance with the wind, without a care in the world.&quot; Laurent gasped as he greedily intook air.

Disgusting. This air quality was horrid, but what did he expect? It stung. It burned. Laurent&#39;s mind grasped at random emotions and objects. <strong>There was a bird on that antennae. Why? &quot;Shoo!&quot; Laurent bellowed, but it simply stared back at him. A raven. Would it not go away?

<em>Stop.</em> Laurent thought. He organized his thoughts. They were his only advantage over Lancer&#39;s Master. <em>Think.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The men traded blows at lightning speed. Broken glass scraped and cut Lark’s flesh, each broken fragment yet another tear in the facade. It seemed for every hit Laurent got out, he himself got one right back. A fist to the chest was met with a strong kick to the shin. With a dodge from the wicked blade, a bullet missed its mark for the umpteenth time. For having two deadly weapons, neither of the two men was able to make much use of them.

But why? There wasn’t a purpose to this. It was nothing but a glorified excuse to make himself feel better about Geeve’s death. To feel as if he was doing something right when no such classification fit in this gray situation. 

What did he even want? 

Obviously, winning the fight would be nice. Sure, it would stop Laurent’s chokehold on the city. The revenge would feel bittersweet. Some proof that he wasn’t just a fool, some madman with a death wish. None of those felt right, despite being vaguely true. Rose had filled his head with these nice ideas, but they all rang as hollow as the glass they danced on.

“<em>Music means nothing if it falls upon deaf ears.</em>”

The dots connected themselves. Even if Laurent could not hear his song, nor Rose, nor Geeves, Lancer, even if the entire city would turn away from Lark in any moment… there would always be an audience. A willing soul to his antics and playing. 

Their battle scaled the skyscraper. The businessman was pushed back, scrapes and cuts added up. Each person bled their fair share, with streaks of crimson upon the transparent material they smashed shoes on. Laurent grew frustrated with each failed attempt to kill his opponent, while Lark started to… smile.

“Then if I must play for not you, then I play for myself! There not exist a more important man to my existence than my own!”</span>

Not that he needed anything else. 

His opponent was right in that Lark would join him quickly. As he heckled a Raven sat aloft, the other bird flapped its wings and stood in front of him, at the edge of the building. He too breathed deeply, yet not nearly as hard. All that adrenaline rushing over the past few years had really built him up for these sorts of fights. In the long run, Lark would pull out. Endurance was a specialty.

“I must apologize, Laurent.”

“While you are indirectly responsible for Geeves death, you did not kill him yourself. You cut the purses of everyone around you, but keep the Copper Knights at bay. You hide in the brush for the perfect chance to strike, for that’s all you know. For making you out to be the quote-unquote ‘worst person to ever exist’,” Lark made the quotation marks with his fingers, “I apologize, as you can’t be the Devil.”

He slowly closed the distance with his foe, the made-up evil in the world. “I am not here for the reasons I may have said earlier, despite those being nice side benefits. This fight, our lives are put on the line because <strong>I want to</strong>.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For the third time today, Lark would simply stand far away from Laurent. Feet firm on the ground, eyes locked. This time he reeked of sweat and blood, which was hard to tell over all the smog. One was currently on the cusp of a mental breakdown of all they had ever known, while the other had finally found the one thing they ever needed.

“When I was young, I practiced this instrument for hours on end, because I thought I wanted to simply be the best. When I thought I had become the best, I lost a sense of purpose, a will to live. My family gave me back that will to live in the form of adrenaline addiction, but they did it because they wanted me to have a reason to get up in the morning.”

“And your words… well, they inspired me a little.” Lark knelt down, now eye level with his opponent. “I’ll keep it short, as we still have things to do: I will fight until I can’t any longer. I will reach for the sun, even if it kills me. There need be no better reason than the fact that I am able to. ”

He still wasn’t sure if this ‘revelation’ was because he had lost one to many marbles to have a grip on reality, or because he had finally figured out his purpose for this limited life. Whatever the case, he <em>thought</em> he did. And that’s all that mattered.

“You let me know when we can continue our battle, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.”</span>

If Uther thought this trial was as simple as killing Morgan, he would be painfully mistaken. Caster had purposely brought Uther here knowing how prevalent his cold heart was. For Uther to escape, it would mean coming to terms with his wrong doing. Reconciliation was something that Nietzsche did not expect to be easy for the former King. 

In front of Uther stood his daughter giving a blank stare. His absence of speech confusing to her. While Uther was aware of the illusion the people inside seemed as real as could be. Morgan&#39;s lips curled beneath her veil, the witches hands spramg up gripping onto Uthers shoulders. &quot;Are you listening to me Artoria!?

If I recall you were sent off to be wed to King Lott in Orkney. You were to be a Queen of your own right. Was that not to your liking, were so overtaken with envy and greed that you sought control of my kingdom. To overthrow Camelot on some twisted temper tantrum.” The king shirked her hands are did his shoulders, his stance firm, his eyes transfixed on his progeny. “What sort of Pendragon would stand their complaining about what is and isn’t fair. The throne was stolen from you, what makes you believe you were worthy of it to begin with?” It was clear Lancer had not yet picked up on what was being presented to him. Before his eyes Uther only saw a spoiled child, who had apparently not been given the rod enough as a child. Excalibur was held ready for battle, and in a burst of speed he dashed forward attempting to strike horizontally against the phantom daughter. “I will not let you stand in the way of my ideals!” Morgan was known as a powerful witch even in the tomes Uther ready back at the bar. The king expected retaliation, but had little fear due to the Magic Resistabce he knew he and Artoria carried. He would end this quickly and return to the real battle.</span>

Was this a matter of him yielding control to her. That couldn’t be it, there would be no point, neither would it make sense. It’s not as if Uther was unwilling to let someone inherit the throne. Why else would he have gone to the effort to prepare Artoria in such way, so that she may be the perfect king. Although it did not go according to plan, he was hardly what he’d consider to be selfish. Perhaps he did not slay the being in the proper manner. Invisible air began to build up around Excalibur as he called out to the illusion. “You are not real, you are a figment of my mind, a tool used against me to keep from my true responsibilities. It does not matter what gave you wear I will strike you down and bring glory to Olympia.” At the height of its power invisible air swirled violent around the blade of the holy weapon. Rearing the pommel to his shoulder as if intending to jab his opponent from across the hall Uther prepared himself as he thrust Excalibur forward shouting out “<em><strong>Hammer of the Wind King!</strong></em>” a burst of spinning magical wind shot forth enveloping all of Morgan’s body threatening to rip her to shreds. <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

Something was wrong, this was not the innocent sister she knew. Uther could tell himself time and time again that this was just a projection, however, the suprise in Morgan&#39;s face, the pain in her voice, and the betrayal in her heart was real. The winds ejected from Artoria&#39;s blade wrapped around Uther&#39;s daughter ripping out her flesh, causing Uthers own blood to die a second time at his hand. 

Once again the attack was successful and one again Uther was back to square one. In the body of his daughter Artoria, the king locked eyes with his forgotten child. &quot;I am the rightful inheritor, I am the one born with his curse!&quot; This time Morgan&#39;s first words were different, however they carried the same idea. She wanted Artoria to hear her out, to acknowledge that Morgan belongs on the throne.

That is a power that should only have been passed onto the strongest of my kin. The red dragon was infused into the intended heir, but when it was not received it was thought to be lost.” In some ways this gave Uther a measure of pride. He did not expect his first born to have the genuine wherewithal to carry such a burden. Lancer shook his head and stole his feelings away again. “Regardless, you are still merely a memory of my past. I can’t falter, I can’t let tricks of the mind stop me. There is a way to vanquish you, and I shall find it.” 

Uther charged once more to strike down Morgan, which he continued to do over and over and over again, each time in more destructive and brutal ways. Each swing of the blade cutting her down. Her screams filling his head and ringing his ears. She was not real, Morgan was long since dead in the past, yet with every passing scenario her anguish felt more and more desperate begging him to listen, something the high king was never good at. Throughout his entire life there’s hardly any issue he couldn’t solve at the point of his sword. He was born into war, raised in it, until at last he made it his haven. Uther felt comfortable fighting and destroying his enemies, and the fact that he could not seem to break the illusion by cutting down the only obstacle in front of him was beginning to get to him. At last after several turns of the scenario and being brought back to the beginning once again. Uther immediately lurched forward using</span>

Not waiting for her to speak first Ither called out. “Why are you here Morgana?” That name, a name that was hardly ever used, especially in the time that she was an adult. To all the people of Camelot ,especially Artoria, she was Morgan Le Fay. The only ones who would have known her true name was her own parents Igraine and Uther.</span>

There was a sadistic enjoyment Nietzsche gained from watching Uther crumble under his own arrogance. He was a king who thought only of goals and nothing inbetween. This mentality reminded the philosopher of someone current in his life. 

Morgan looked down at the exhausted Artoria, her face drawn with confusion as to how her sister had gotten in such a state. The witch took a step forward ready to yell at Uther once more, however this time she did not speak. Instead she stepped back stumbling over her feet. &quot;You have never called me that before...&quot; Morgan&#39;s tone grew silent her eyes shifting back and forth. The witch shook her head getting back to her senses. &quot;I am here to tell you of my rightful place as King. I have inherited the curse from Uther, that makes me the rightful owner the kingdom!&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Letting out a deep exhale, Uther centered himself once more and stood tall again. He glared at his daughter. Killing her was not going to end the charade, Caster’s test obviously involved him confronting her in a different way. Perhaps he had to defeat her argument. “You say you are the rightful heir, that you deserve it more than the one who pulled the Sword of Selection from the stone. You may carry the curse, but that doesn’t inherently make you a proper ruler. It takes discipline, it takes fortitude, and it takes a willingness to put the people above all else. Can you honestly say you are capable of such action, that you haven’t already enacted measures for your selfish means. What is wrong with Arthur sitting upon the throne. Why can you not be happy for your sister, rejoice that you share the privilege of nobleship in such a grand kingdom. What is it about your sister that angers you so?” 

This whole exchange perplexed the king, and in some ways it was truly questioning his own understanding of his daughter. Truly why did she walk this path, why couldn’t the siblings live in harmony. In any ways Morgan reflected his own brother Vortigern. Jealousy, rage, and a difference of how the kingdom should be run is what came between them. Yet he could not see the motivation as clearly within her, those lines were far more blurred and not as concise. If Uther was going to get out of this he needed understand what was going on in her head when all of this occurred.</span>

To Morgan, Uther was Artoria and hearing her speak in the third person was bewildering. Normally Nietzsche would reset the illusion if the actor had not played their part. However, this one time he would let it slide. Uther&#39;s words were stern, but why converse with Morgan if he didn&#39;t have the will to understand? Yes it would seem Nietzsche just might be cracking the King&#39;s hardened exterior. 

&quot;Happy? What is there to be happy for!?&quot; Morgan&#39;s voice raised once again. It was strained with rage and sorrow. The witch was not only filled with anger, but a deep pain resided in her. &quot;Should I be happy that you received the love and approval of Uther? Should I be happy that I was forgotten and unwanted!?&quot; Morgan looked away a tear streamed past the black veil. She adverted her eyes from Uther, not wanting to be seen in such a state. &quot;I am the one who doesn&#39;t understand... How you could be so clueless!&quot;

That Uther’s compassion did not extend to the both of us. Tell me what was wrong with King Lott, did you not have several offspring with him that grew to be wondrous knights? You were put in a rather favorable position, not to mention you seem to have developed into a string and fearsome individual yourself. Uther gave you those opportunities. Is this whole farce all about the crown not being big enough?” Although Uther was allowing himself to listen to his daughter, it seemed he wasn’t quite hearing what she was saying just yet. The scope of his sins hadn’t fully sunk in, nor does he see how this is all his responsibility or fault.</span>

&quot;It&#39;s not about the crown being to small. It&#39;s about the love I never had! The two of us were both born woman, undesired by Uther... But why did he place his faith in you and neglect me, despite me being the first born?!

She looked defeated, it was as if she lost hope that her sister would ever understand her pain.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Uther was taken aback, he thought he’d given his children the world. They were raised to be great rulers and nobles. They had the best sort of training and education. Their earthly desires were nearly always met. What is it that his daughter was lacking, what more could he give. He’d pause for a moment or so to let the words sink in. Uther prided himself on being able to read through his enemies, so why was he struggling with this. Why couldn’t he see through her. That’s when it hit him. she was not his enemy, at least she didn’t want to be. From the context of the situation she was pleading with her sister to understand her plight. A plight that was directed and caused by him. 

At last the grip on Excalibur loosened as Uther slowly began to approach his daughter. “Morgana, did you truly feel as though he did not care for you, that he didn’t want for you to succeed? He may not have been as present in our lives, but he did entrust the future to us both.” Going on from this it appeared Uther was still trying to justify his actions and validate what he done for his daughters, but there was evident cracks. His voice shook, and his gaze was not as firm. Slowly it seemed that even he was beginning to question what effect he had on his kingdom and his children.</span>

It is his fault that I have endured such pain, such neglect...

If one thing was clear, Morgan blamed her pain on Uther. Everything that lead her to hate so much, was because of Uther.

He wanted the best for both of his children, why else did he work so hard to create a ideal kingdom. To see her resent him in such a way was heart breaking. The issues at hand were becoming clearer for him. The blame of destruction of Camelot did not rest with the bickering of his children, but in his own negligence as a father. 

Excalibur fell from his grip as he dashed forward taking hold of Morgan’s shoulder, spinning her around, and then lifting the veil from her face. Uther stared directly into her eyes, at first he wasn’t certain of what to even say. All he knew was that there was a newfound weight on his heart. His hand gently caressed the side of Morgan’s cheek as a small tear seemed to crawl down from his eye. “I…I’m sorry. This is all my fault. I did this to you.

His voice shaked and his grip upon her seemed to be loose yet he refused to let go. The realization of what he spent the last several minutes doing suddenly began to dawn him. From the start of the illusion, he believed it more prudent to strike his own flesh and blood down then to hear her out. A product of his own upbringing and arrogance. That was his ultimate crime from the beginning, the inability to see or hear her. However, that was different now. Although not entirely real, he had the opportunity to say what needed to be said. His forehead lowered to meet the young woman’s and he whispered. “I love you Morgana, I’m sorry that this is the first time you are hearing this from me and you had to hear it in this way. Despite that you should know that, I’m truly sorry that I didn’t give you what needed growing up. You are just as important to me as the kingdom.

Hopefully with a now broken resolve, the Philosopher could make quick work of his opponent. Caster would not leave Lancer alive like he did Simo. Nietzsche was not the type to make a mistake twice. 

Morgan looked into Uthers eyes. Before she could let out a word the illusion began to fall part. Uther had met the proper conditions to undo Nietzsche&#39;s noble phantasm. Caster however wouldn&#39;t waste a second. He would try to end things swiftly. As soon as the illusion fell apart a large one eyed monster manifested in front of Nietzsche. The Cyclops took a step forward swinging a large club clean into Uther. Nietzsche was betting on the fact that his attack would land before Uther could readjust to reality.

Before he could even feel the cool breeze brush across his skin a <em><strong>SMACK</strong></em> was felt as the club struck hard against the side of the king. He was shifted over several feet and the blow produced a small dent in his shoulder chassis, however, he remained on his feet. Caster indeed got a free shot in on Lancer, but he may have underestimated how durable the servant may be, especially since he had yet to take any true damage yet in this fight. 

As he stood there for a moment Uther felt different, as if the reason he was there had completely shifted. Caster was likely hoping that his Phantasm would disorient Uther to the point that fighting would feel meaningless. However… “The enemy must not be an elemental.” Uther’s head shot up as the grip upon Rhongmyniad tightened. A electric aura of heat and compressed air built up around him. “The battle must not be inhumane.” The point of his spear jabbed forward directly into the abdomen of the cyclops and in bright</span>

With each passing phrase the aura surrounding Lancer grew stronger and stronger in addition to the holy lance taking on a brighter glow. “The battle must be to defend human order.” Dashing once again towards his opponent, Uther lead with a hard punch across Caster’s jaw before grasping upon his collar, throwing him to the ground, and placing a boot to his head while slowly pushing into the back of the skull. “You deserved far better than Mackenzie to carry you through all of this.

His limbs were trembling, exhausted from his battle with Lancer&#39;s Master. After a few seconds, he got to his feet. He checked his watch. It had been three seconds since he last took a strike from Lark, and dished one out in turn.

That bird wouldn&#39;t move from its little perch. Infuriating. Who did it think it was, watching this battle? There were to be no spectators, this was personal. Laurent fingered his revolver&#39;s trigger, considering shooting the bird. Meaningless. He&#39;d just miss.

Lancer&#39;s Master, however...

&quot;<strong>Lark. Why did you have to appear now?</strong>&quot; Laurent asked quietly, eyes staring down at the concrete floor. &quot;If I had met you sooner, I think your music would&#39;ve been quite beautiful indeed.&quot;

<em>Seven seconds...</em>

This entertainer had embraced honesty. He had evolved leaps and bounds within such a short fight. Were Laurent&#39;s words that powerful? No. Lark had come to such a conclusion on his own. How beautiful and poetic.

Unfortunately, it was far too late to matter.

&quot;I am the devil, unfortunately. I cannot be anyone but. I would gladly raze Olympia to the ground if a throne of ash interested me. As such, do not place value in my words.&quot;

<em>Ten seconds.</em>

Hesitantly, slowly, haltingly, Laurent took steps towards Lark. His energy was almost spent. His anger, almost spent. His desire and disdain for Lark were no longer capable of fueling the man-shaped void who sucked happiness from others to sustain his own. How was it fair that this entertainer could embrace his own character flaws? Why couldn&#39;t Laurent do that? Why was Lark a stronger person than Laurent <em>MacKenzie</em>? This wasn&#39;t fair.</span>

&quot;Maybe if I had met you earlier, my goal would be different. Actually...&quot; Laurent smiled wryly. &quot;I doubt that. I&#39;ve been a demon since my conception. You are a good man, Lark. An honest man. Even if you play for yourself, others still get joy out of it.&quot;

&quot;There is, however, a problem...&quot;

<em>Seventeen seconds.</em>

&quot;I will kill you. Letting you live would not stop you from chasing me again. I&#39;m the itch that you long to scratch. As long as I live, the shadow of your friend will continue to haunt you.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s eyes flickered for a moment from behind his glasses. He was tired, unlike Lark. Where Lark&#39;s body could function without his mind, Laurent&#39;s body would collapse with his mind remaining active. There was no way for Laurent to defeat Lark. Even within this tumultuous state of Laurent hating and respecting and even liking Lark all at the same time. Even with Caster&#39;s help...</span>

This single goal was what fueled him. Caster had awoken this hunger to see this goal fufilled. Despite his conflicting emotions with regards to Lark, Laurent would march forward.

Over his corpse.

The bird was still there. Why was it still there? It was time for it to spread its wings and fly off into the sun.

&quot;<strong>Goodbye, Lark de Allegro. Allow me to help you reach towards the sun, and towards your beloved butler.</strong>&quot;

<strong>BANG!</strong>

The bird sitting on the antenna, watching Lark and Laurent, flew off into the sunset.

<em>Twenty seconds.</em> There will be no need for an encore tonight.

Laurent MacKenzie lashed Lark to the bird flying into the sunset.

It was barely a second. Just one second. That was all it took of being controlled by altered gravity to send Lark flying off the tower. The rules of this world were clearly defined and unbreakable. Laurent knew this, and now Lark would know it too.

Laurent walked to the edge of the skyscraper, and looked down. He smiled.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark was ready to finally end this battle. Laurent was too. The man stood up and closed the distance ever so slightly, clearly physically unable to really continue on. It would be a sad affair, to kill such a weakened man. However, it was what must be done. Must? Had. There were no ‘musts’ in this world.

However, that wasn’t what fate had in store for the lad. He was not the hero of this particular story. The world hadn’t needed a new hero for decades now. That’s why they had to conjure them up from ancient times, where terrible beasts, dictators, and scoundrels were plentiful. No, some other fellow would have to slay this demon, have an appropriate climax. 

Meanwhile, Lark flew himself.

All it took was a single second of motionlessness. A single shot and a little birdie flew off into the sun. It took the musician with them.

And as he plummeted, dagger lost with the transition from solid ground to weightless air, his mind finally figured saw what it had longed for. The search for a certain series of notes, a perfect combination of tones and beats that cultivated into the absolute height of musical prowess. Men died for the opportunity, collapsed from exhaustion or stress or fatigue, or even a deadly mix of the three. A show of mastery over the sounds of music.

A Swan Song.

With fingers that struggled to keep a tight hold on the bow, from both the wind that rushed all around him and the excitement from the ultimate revelation, he connected string with string. One, two, three, four…

The melody sang out from the instrument. Each note held a purpose, a place in the short yet lovely song. Not a single beat was missed or misplaced, all accounted for and put into the perfect spot in order to convey the feeling behind the short tune. A death cry, a scream to the world that said ‘I was here’.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">No one heard a single thing, though. Not even Lark himself. The air that breezed past his ears was too strong. Laurent might’ve heard the start, and anyone below might’ve heard the end, but no one heard the whole song. Such was the place of a somber piece, only fit for those at Death’s Door. Nature’s truest secret.

Before the ground finally caught the pseudo-Icarus, he thought of those few souls who had participated in the last Holy Grail War. He had forgotten most of their names, only vague descriptions left in his mind. Out of all the masters, only one had actually died. Szrac Vaughn, a machine and a self-described tool. Servant: King Midas. A crazed Berserker who had an infatuation with wealth. Would’ve given Laurent a run for his money.

All those before him had failed, with even the victor unable to lay claim to the actual artifact of legend. A lie, spread by the previous owners of Persepolis in order to try and gain control of the city. An entire city was unheaved and destroyed, all because a select few wanted to grab hold of that sun, just like himself.

Lark was not special. Many before him had taken aim and reached for the stars. Most failed. Those who succeeded didn’t live long after. More would fail in the future. That insatiable desire for greater things would always hold the hearts of humans captive, enamored with that siren’s call. 

For a man who had grabbed the attention of thousands of people, to be equal to them all at the deepest level was as great a wish he could’ve ever asked for.

Lark bowed one last time, for the people. For the bird who flew without a single care in the world. For his Sister. For Uther Pendragon. 

For himself.

Any remaining thoughts were ejected from his head, along with his skull and brains, when he hit the pavement. Now, it would be best to describe him as a red stain. The Holy Grail War had one less contestant to worry about.</span>

The first thing he witnesses after exiting that nightmare is his master falling to his demise. Yet he had the feeling deep in his heart that this was not some grave error of stupidity, but just his opponent being one step ahead of him. They may have had their disagreements and their spats at one another, but Lark truly treated the king not only as a partner but as part of his family. A family that Uther did not deserve or had yet to earn. His daughters were punished and left to ruin because of his negligence. He wasn’t there for them, he was not going to make that same mistake now. Mere moments before Lark made contact with the concrete, the invisible air that enwrapped around his legs suddenly spread out across his body forming a large shield of wind. Once he met ground the impact was drastically reduced. It would still hurt immensely and he may have a few broken bones, but Lark would be alive. Uther saved him. 

Despite this narrow escape from terminal execution, Lark was more than likely going to be unable to contribute much further to the fight.  Lancer needed to end this here and now, and once again since the first</span>

This was the moment, this is the opportunity they needed. “The battle must be to defend human order.” Golden magical energy began to swirl around the Holy Lance as Uther brought it up to his shoulder, the energy multiplying with every passing moment. His eyes only briefly glancing down at Lark who had fought so hard up to this point to defend his fallen friend. “One&#39;s comrades-in-arms must&#160;be courageous.” His stance firmed with Caster’s head acting as steadying perch, his aim and gaze centered on the target. The dragon must be vanquished for the kingdom to survive. For a moment, Uther could swear he saw a glimpse of Vortigern standing atop that roof edge. At last this fight was about to be over and all lost souls avenged.</span>

As the last phrase of the seventh seal was said and subsequently released a string of magical energy began to pour out across him and the area. There was no time, no second chances, no room for doubt. Uther needed to end this here and now. Bracing himself the energy swirling around him distorted the look of his body from a distance. His golden eyes flared, akin to a burning flame staring directly into Laurent’s soul. From Laurent’s vantage point Uther no longer looked like a man, but something of a god or worse, death itself. To exemplify this Uther shouted out. “Your sins have been weighed, your actions have been judged. Your greed has accrued a great many debts that you are now being called upon to pay. Prepare to enter the void of your own making.” Uther’s grip tightened once more upon his weapon as he gritted his teeth. “Today I slay the dragon that ravages Olympia. Today you experience death. <em><strong>RHONGOMYNIAD!!!</strong></em> In a yellow flash Uther was propelled off of Caster directly at Laurent. The attack exhumed that same golden burning energy that had built up so far. Flying forward it was as if Uther’s entire body was transfigured into the image of a divine spear of judgment aimed directly at the businessman. Lancer had fully control of the energy output and would make sure that the building itself would not be damaged by the attack, however, there was no part of the distribution that Laurent would be able to escape to. He was the only one on the roof, and the only target. Before the Lance would even near him, Laurent would begin to feel his flesh melt away from the proximity of heat. A hellish punishment for all that he had done and planned to do, Laurent Mackenzie in his own way also flew to close to the sun and would now be swallowed in its burning light.</span>

He had won.

&quot;...heh.&quot; Laurent chuckled to himself, voice raspy in the wind.

&quot;That was an excellent song, Lark. How tragic that nobody could hear you. Ahhh... but of course.&quot;

&quot;<strong>You weren&#39;t playing for anybody, were you?</strong>&quot;

Laurent took a knee, beaten and bruised. There was little energy left. No adrenaline pumping through his veins, no rush of blood. He was beat, through and through. To think that a humble entertainer could push him this far...

&quot;...I won.&quot; Laurent whispered to the wind, remnants of his shirt flapping in the wind. Another chuckle leaked out of the businessman. Then another. Then another.

&quot;Ha... Ha... <strong>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA</strong>!&quot; The businessman laughed into the sky. &quot;<strong>Did you see that, old man? I DID MORE WITH YOUR MAGIC CREST IN ONE MOMENT THAN YOU DID IN A LIFETIME! I WON!</strong>&quot;

&quot;All on my own! I didn&#39;t need money or your opinion! I don&#39;t need your love or respect! All I needed was my own cunning and motivation! And I&#39;ll keep winning! I&#39;ll keep winning until this city is mine!&quot;

This was the answer he reached after beating Lark. It was not the correct answer, but who was going to dissuade him? Caster simply wanted to see the result of Laurent&#39;s single-minded obsession and grudge. Lark? He would be dead in minutes. There was somebody else, however... Who was it? Did it matter?

No.</span>

Lark had imparted a valuable lesson into the CEO: nobody was special. The illogical could become logical. One could fight for themself and reach for a goal with their own two hands. The same message Caster had tried drilling into Laurent&#39;s head for weeks was imparted easily by a rambunctious bard. How amusing. Now then, who would he defeat next? Perhaps it was time to give Gustave a visi—

Laurent&#39;s blood ran cold.

<strong>Lancer.</strong>

Where was he? In his giddiness, Laurent had casually excused Lancer&#39;s existence, and had forgotten about him to stroke his own ego. Laurent turned to where he had last seen him with Caster.

And saw a massive blinding light coming right towards him.

Laurent blinked once. &quot;<strong>Oh.</strong>&quot;

He disappeared into the light of Rhongomyniad.

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

MacKenzie Tower shook as Lancer&#39;s fully powered Noble Phantasm struck its owner. Steel groaned and concrete cracked, weeping as their owner was struck down due to his own hubris and sloth.

The tower didn&#39;t fall, but the top of the tower had a massive hole in its side, and a crater where Laurent had stood. Shortly afterwards.

<em>Clatter.</em>

A pair of smoking, cracked glasses fell next to Lancer&#39;s armored foot.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It would seem that Nietzsche had severely miscalculated. He had not broken Lancer&#39;s will, he had strengthened it. The Philosopher&#39;s heart sunk as Uther retaliated, showing just how powerful a knight class was. Each blow landed on the scrawny man shook him to the core. It seemed Lancer could end his life at any moment but chose to give Nietzsche a second to breath. Yes, perhaps we would have been fine acquaintances, the Philosopher thought. He could not speak under Lancer&#39;s boot as he was too busy gasping for breath. However, it did not matter, Laurent had won. Upon Uther and Nietzsche realizing what had happened to Lark, the Philosopher knew that he had won no matter what. 

Uther lept away from Nietzsche attacking Laurent with a magnificent display. One that seemed truly worthy of the Kings reputation. He was certainly an excellent fighter, however today that would not matter. Nietzsche&#39;s head turned towards the ruble, Laurent&#39;s glasses looked back into the Philosopher&#39;s eyes. A cough came from Nietzsche, his breath returning to him. It was time for him to use a trump card. Something he would have much rather saved for a different day.</span>

Caster let the words roll from his lips and then in an instant everything that had transpired in past few moments had never happened. Laurent was once again alive, glasses and all. Uther was getting his Noble Phantasm ready and Nietzsche was still a bloody pulp. The only difference was this time Nietzsche was well aware of the proceeding events. He chuckled to himself a grin rolling across his face. He had done it. Once again the Philosophers brain prevailed. He had successfully used <strong>Eternal Return</strong>, the end of this battle, the climax, it was all in his hands. 

&quot;Laurent this is not time for celebration! Lancer, he is coming, he will strike in the coming moments! Do not let him hit you at any cost!&quot; Nietzsche&#39;s voice pierced his Master&#39;s mind warning him of the danger coming. The Philosopher had faith in his Master to be quick on his feet. Nietzsche had done his part to stop Uther, now it was Laurent&#39;s turn.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent had died. 

This was not a claim, but a genuine fact of reality. The CEO of MacKenzie Industries, one of the most powerful men in Olympia, had been completely atomized by one of the most powerful armaments in the world. In a way, it was an honor.

It was not intended to be an honor, however. It was to be a curse.

So as Laurent&#39;s body dissolved into nothingness, the only thought running through his mind was bewilderment and begrudging acceptance. He had died. Everything that came after would mean nothing. His goals: irrelevant. The future: meaningless. If he would not be around to experience it, why would it affect him?

Death was indescribable. Laurent had no brain to acknowledge or understand it. All he had was his [___], which would leave him to...

It hurt. It hurt It Hurt. It hurtithurtithurtithurtithurtithurt

Was this death? Was this what awaited every person after their life was snuffed out? No. Nononononono WHAT WAS THIS?

Then all of a sudden, Laurent&#39;s soul was grasped by the power of his Caster&#39;s philosophy given form. Only a god could do such a thing, but Nietzsche did not let trivial matters keep him pinned down.

He would surpass God. This was his power, shoving Laurent&#39;s soul back in time.

Everything was forgotten.

—

Laurent&#39;s eyes snapped open. He had no recollection of what happened after killing Lark. All he felt was this deep dark dread worming into his being. Eating and gnawing at his reserve. What was this feeling? Fear. <strong>This</strong> was fear? He hadn&#39;t felt something like this since his grandfather had—

<strong>Stop.</strong> Do not go down that path. Stand firm.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">All of a sudden, Caster spoke to him, relaying information from a long-abandoned timeline. One where Lancer had struck him down. How did he know this? Why? What? He would need to grill his Servant later, but for now...

He had to stop Lark&#39;s Servant. 

Such a powerful Noble Phantasm would require a massive ramp-up time. Laurent would need to be fast. There was no way Laurent&#39;s Singularity would stop it, so how...?  Laurent looked down at the broken body of Lark.

Ah... that would do. Lancer dug his own grave.

Laurent&#39;s Magecraft would not allow Lark&#39;s body to fly towards him. It was too far away, and the time since Laurent had last touched Lark had been over twenty seconds. That meant, in order to stop Lancer, he would need to strike at the Servant&#39;s heart.

In order to do that, he would need to throw himself off the tower.

And so he did.

Laurent flung himself forward, adrenaline flowing through his veins. He would defy Fate. <strong>His</strong> Fate, and make his own future.

&quot;YOU HAVE DONE WELL, NIETZSCHE!&quot; Laurent bellowed, finally acknowledging his Servant&#39;s True Name. &quot;Leave this relic to me!&quot;

<em>&quot;The battle must be to defend human order&quot;.</em>

Laurent could almost hear the words being uttered from Lancer&#39;s mouth as he flew towards the ground. Maybe it was his connection with Caster. Maybe he was going mad. Maybe his senses were overclocking to keep him alive. The businessman did not know. He did not care.

Laurent lashed himself to a bullet that flew out of his pocket, hoping to slow his descent. The earth was growing closer and closer. At this rate, Lancer would know what he was doing...!

Got him.</span>

...and using him as a human shield.

&quot;<strong>Do it, Lancer. Did you not burn Camelot to the ground with your lofty ideals? Surely, killing a Master is not difficult. Even if he is your regent, your follower? </strong>&quot; Laurent said, holding his enemy&#39;s Master as if he were a famous coat being flaunted off.

Would he seriously sacrifice Lark for such a disgusting, underhanded tactic? Of course he would.

He was Laurent MacKenzie.

Laurent will at last reap what he sowed. Yet Lancer was filled with a strange sensation of deja vu, then it dawned on him as the philosopher shouted out a warning to his master. A form of trickery was being used and Laurent was taking advantage of it. There was no time to fully charge up the attack at this point, Uther had to strike now. 

As Laurent plummeted Uther shot forward to the side ledge of the building and with the energy he built up so far launched himself directly at the businessman. He couldn’t get away, not after everything. He had already so many people in his life, he couldn’t fail Lark, Rose, or especially Geeves. This needed to end in any way possible. His rage filled his attacked as he soared downwards Lance protruded forward. That nonstop drive to constantly be moving forward, to never slow down would now be his and his master’s undoing. Laurent had been warned just soon enough, touched the ground one second ahead of him, and worse brought Lark in front of his aim a moment shy of him being able to slow down

<em><strong>VRSHH.</strong></em> Rhongomyniad slid into Lark’s gut like paper, went straight through. Unfortunately, for Laurent’s wisdom he didn’t calculate the size of the weapon or the force it was coming at him. Due to this he’d find that the point of the Holy Lance had went through his human shield and pierced into his abdomen although not as deep. What would be far more noticeable than the pain of being impales was the burning sensation of the weapon against his flesh, a minor reenacting sensation from a</span>

However, Uther was not concerned about that in the least at the moment. It was all he could do to keep his eyes straight forward as he glared directly into that of Lark’s. Someone he swore from the beginning that he would protect, but swore he’d be his ruination if he ever stepped out of line. A man who simply wished to be understood and to do what he thought was right. Lancer hand went up to graze the side of his master’s face. “La..Lark..I’m sorry…I didn’t mean.” Flashes of memories appeared in eyes, recollecting tales of his daughter on her final battle. There was an image of her jamming a spear through the gut of her own child. Was history repeating itself, was Uther so blind that he not only failed those he was meant to uplift in the past life but in this one as well. The king stood motionless, merely holding Lark aloft as his eyes only briefly glanced over to Laurent to see his reaction.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s plan was cruel, especially for one cobbled together on such a short notice. However, in a desperate gambit to avoid the fate of his predecessor, he had made one major miscalculation:

Rhongomyniad was large. A hulking spear that tied together the world&#39;s texture was not to be compared to some trivial spear or toothpick. Lark&#39;s body would not block the attack.

But it would save him.

It was difficult to describe the sensation of being impaled by Rhongomyniad. The most apt description was like being stabbed by a white hot rod or a drill that had been dipped in magma. It pierced, it drilled, it swirled Laurent&#39;s insides like a mixer, all while cauterizing the wound. Maybe not the ideal choice for a weapon of infinite power, but the Fae of Britain were not known for their impeccable wisdom.

Yet as it burned, it reminded. The feeling of dread was back. No, not a feeling of dread. A feeling of <strong>deja vu.</strong> The businessman had felt something like this before. Was it back on the Brobdingnagian? Delphi&#39;s Rooftop Gardens? No... Where was it from?

It was likely that Laurent would&#39;ve died, if not for Lark&#39;s human shield, as well as the spear&#39;s cauterizing effect. Lark, however, was not so lucky. His death had been brutal and painful. He had died twice, both in misery. If it was a small solace for Lancer, it was likely that Lark wasn&#39;t even conscious. 

&quot;<strong>No. No!</strong> Do not apologize! That is not what he would&#39;ve wanted. Commit to it. Commit to striking me down! Don&#39;t let such a minor transgression get in your way, Lancer!&quot;

But it did.

Rhongomyniad stopped. With a sickening <em>squelch</em>, Laurent removed himself from the spear, falling to the ground. He put a fist to his mouth, trying to vomit. He couldn&#39;t, and as such, there was only one thing left to do:

Gloat.

He had won. Lancer knew it. Caster knew it. Laurent knew it. It only had to be proclaimed.</span>

&quot;My first Servant, Assassin, was Brutus. A ruler known for his backstabbing.&quot;

&quot;<strong>I killed him. I stabbed him in the back when he lost value, just how he killed Caesar.</strong>&quot;

&quot;You, Lancer, set in motion the fall of Camelot.&quot;

&quot;<strong>You die here, causing your defeat by killing your Master.</strong>&quot;

Laurent smirked, despite the pain in his face. &quot;I love irony. Disappear gracefully. I will see to the funeral of your Master.&quot;

No sign of anguish, no symbol of annoyance at his taunting, it was almost as if Laurent wasn’t even really there to Lancer. The king held two fingers up before using them to gently shut Lark’s eyes. The Lance was removed before it dissipated. Picking up the still body, he gentled cradled Lark in his arms. His grip tight as if he had no intention of letting him go. At last while maintaining his blank stare at Laurent, Uther at last spoke. “I believe what Lark would want to say, is that he doesn’t need your money or your hollow charity. Like most things in life he will do it his own way. It’s for that reason I’ll shall be taking his body back home to his sister. I have expanded rather little of my mana during the fight, due in no small part to Caster my Noble Phantasm was not fully released. I should have just enough energy to make it back. If I was a more vengeful man, I’d kill you right now. I doubt Nietzche would have the power to stop me a second time, though in the end nothing truly would get accomplished that way. Geeves would not be avenged, because it was not you who killed him. Geeves died because he loved Lark, and he wanted</span>

Lancer glanced down at the still body in his arms, holding it close to him. “Fathers are meant to die for their children, not because it’ll make a better society, but because they love them.” Those words seemed to hang in the air for awhile, almost as if Uther had fired a gun. “I hope someone loved you at some point, I hope someone made you feel wanted. Though looking in your eyes now, I believe the only love you ever had was for yourself. If that’s the way you wish to live then so be it, but do not be surprised that it turns out to be a lonely and short life. I knew a man like you once, who carried a darkness around with everywhere he went until at one point everyone was against him and that darkness became a part of his eternal rest.” Uther’s eyes narrowed as if peering a hole through Laurent. “I think you realize what had occurred moments ago as well, though you aren’t ready to admit it. Be careful of how you proceed from here Mackenzie, otherwise that void shall become all to permanent like it did him.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s face collapsed into a scowl. Who was this arrogant dog, barking up the wrong tree? He looked like he wanted to snap at Lancer, before he could, however, he turned around, breaking eye contact with the Servant.

&quot;Do whatever you wish. Go back home. I&#39;ll be surprised if you manage to last the trip. You have no Master. Your clock is ticking, Servant. I wish I could see the look on his sister&#39;s face as you tell him that you killed her brother. Or will you blame it on me, perhaps?&quot;

The businessman snorted as he walked past Lancer, over to his own Servant. &quot;Up, up. Let&#39;s go, Caster. You... <strong>have done well</strong>. Too much excitement for a non-combatant like you. Come along.&quot; Laurent looked somewhat disgusted as he brought Caster to his feet, but if that was in response to Lancer&#39;s words, or Caster&#39;s condition, was up in the air. Nobody certainly looked like they were in peak condition. 

&quot;I would dodge, methinks. I don&#39;t make the same mistake twice. Get off my property, lest I call the authorities, and they lock your Master&#39;s body away in a body bag.&quot;

Anger and scorn threatened to bubble out of the businessman, lashing out at the King of Britain. How dare this shadow lecture him on family. This man who had failed his own daught—

Laurent took a breath. Lancer and Laurent were two sides of the same coin. Laurent was Olympia&#39;s Vortigern, for better or for worse. It did not matter what this man thought. He had died hundreds of years ago on an island nation.

&quot;I don&#39;t need a shadow&#39;s generosity, nor do I need the wisdom of a loser. I&#39;ve lost more than enough in my life to recognize my own failings. Begone. Your monologue is irrelevant to me.&quot;

With that, Laurent and Caster made their retreat.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A smile creeped across Uther’s face as the man walked away. Based on Laurent’s reaction he could tell he got a rise out of him. For someone who claimed to not care what others thought of him Laurent tended to shout a great deal. In truth it mattered little what emotions the businessman felt, those who are truly mighty had little reason to project or show off. One of the few lessons he did recall teaching Morgan when she was young, it may have been one of the few reasons she was able to stay under the radar of the Round Table for so long. 

Watching them part back into the building. Uther called one last time to Caster. “Thank you, truly, for what you showed me. Perhaps one day I can make right the sins of my past, but for now I must settle for ensuring this young one makes it back home. I wasn’t there when my child died alone, the least I can do is be there for this one. I sincerely you discover what you are seeking through this partnership. I hope you do not get caught in the flames as well.” With that Lander stood up and began to carry Lark back home. <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>
