Filth covers the old monk from head to toe, their face fallen and sunken as they stare at the only means of sunlight allowed to filter into the darkened hallways of their imprisonment. His body, ragged with neglect and thinning from starvation, hangs helplessly from the wall as he simply waits for the end. What that end would entail, he couldn&#39;t say. 

&quot;...What key does this challenge unlock, I wonder...&quot; he whispers, hoarsely, enough for the automatons standing at attention before his cell to turn their gaze slightly to the monk. As the early morning fades away and the overhead sky grows brighter, a golden glow filters through the bars on the bare window, giving his toes the briefest respite from the freezing mortar of the castle. It&#39;s enough to catch the monk&#39;s attention, raising his head to gaze through into the sliver of sky he was allowed to witness. 

&quot;...Today...there is a finality about today...&quot; he remarks, only to nod back into the past once more, merely focusing on his teachings to distract from how far he&#39;s truly fallen...</span>

From the cracks and holes housed within Dolorous Gard&#39;s walls, the trusty <em>Bug</em> came to life. &quot;Something something, impeccable with timing ... yeah, I guess I <em>do</em> have impeccable timing.&quot;

The insects barely stuck their heads out the walls&#39; crevices, their low buzzing meant only for the trained monk&#39;s enhanced hearing. The clanks and clings that reverberated from the cell&#39;s guardians would be enough to mask their words ... hopefully.

&quot;If by impeccable you mean <em>horrendous</em>, that is.&quot;

This sentence, not nearly as monotone as the rest of the swarm&#39;s words, spoke at length about the feelings of their commander. It didn&#39;t take much to discern the weight and the emphasis that was placed on the word &#39;horrendous&#39;.

&quot;I&#39;ve watched you guys for a while. Your encounter with Rinne and Nietzsche. Your grandiose battle with Uther and his violinist Master. I&#39;ve seen it <em>all</em>.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I&#39;ve also seen enough of your interactions with Lord Brandin—or lack thereof—to know that it wasn&#39;t all sunshine, lollipops and rainbows on your part. I thought <em>I</em> was having a bad time fighting in the CGW, but seeing you for the past few weeks ... it really helped put things into perspective.&quot;

Obviously, the swarm&#39;s commander hadn&#39;t been obvious to the happenings of Dolorous Gard, having implanted many colonies of bugs beforehand. They weren&#39;t obvious to the suffering that the monk had gone through, either. Not that it mattered, they weren&#39;t particularly heroic, or at least they didn&#39;t <em>feel</em> heroic. For the most part.

&quot;Fifty-something claimed victims, counting those that died during your fight against Uther. A couple dozen homes fallen to the hands of Dolorous Gard. A few small factories too, resulting in many Olympians losing their day-time jobs and main source of income. Several shops have been pillaged by the Copper Knights, bringing a swift end to the hard-fought career of many merchants. Lots of homeless people have been driven off their homes, since the religious hotpot was the first to be targeted by Brandin. Some of them probably perished by now, seeing how unkind Olympia is against its low-class citizens ...&quot;

A never-ending flow of information, with each new addition more dreadful than the other. The swarm didn&#39;t need to take breaths in between words. The report just kept going on and on, describing the doings of the tyrannical master of Dolorous Gard in a cold, detached and factual manner.

&quot;... the scope at which Dolorous Gard has expanded was big enough that people have started putting bounties on your heads. And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. Even I couldn&#39;t say how deeply he has affected Olympia and its citizens with his thoughtless expansion.&quot;

The swarm&#39;s words sank in, leaving the filthy and incapacitated monk to think about his Servant&#39;s wrong-doings for a bit, as if he hadn&#39;t tormented himself enough these last couple of days.

&quot;Needless to say that you broke your part of the deal.&quot;</span>

A soft smile creases his face, his tired eyes swimming as he listens to the sounds of a voice that...well, friendly might not be the best word for it. But not antagonistic either. Master of Lancer...Bug...it was simply the presence of another that helped distract from the memory of his masters and their crippling disappointment in his state. 

&quot;You may have made a mistake a long time before, Bug. You should have killed me...it might have prevented this madness we see before us. However, even if I am ready to receive it, I doubt it will do little good.&quot; 

His head slumps forward, resting against his thinning chest that even now looks labored as it feebly rises and falls, Jampo&#39;s own breaths short and shallow as he clings ever limply to this plane of existence. &quot;Brandin has amassed enough power that I&#39;m merely a battery now, or worse off, a means of insurance. You&#39;ve seen the Mad Monk in action if you watched our fight with Lark de Allegro and Uther Pendragon...my hands are not clean either, and he sees this as a welcome tool. That is, until there&#39;s nothing left to raze...&quot; 

His eyes open meekly as he takes Bug in, his head rolling to reveal his neck, thin and nearly stick like, and the vein that thickly puffs against it, a cord of his life that he exposes to the Master. &quot;If you are still willing to kill me, it&#39;s better if it were a quick death...I&#39;d welcome it. I...I realize the truth, Bug. One you likely knew...I&#39;m too far from Nirvana. I&#39;ve always been too far from the teachings of my masters...I&#39;m a sinner, Bug, unable to fix the mistakes I let loose. If only I was stronger for Brandin, for Olympia...I might have tried to bring us all closer...&quot;</span>

He pauses, both from his emotional well springing forth and lining his eyes, but also from the loss of breath. He hadn&#39;t talked this much in several days; the sensation was almost alien. 

&quot;I fear even now that Brandin is far too powerful for either you or Gu...Lancer to handle. I fear...I fear that my sins have damned all those around me...that I&#39;ve been damning those around me for decades...&quot;  <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

A deafening silence sounded as the insects watched the monk, reduced to a pathetic shadow of his former self, going so far as to present his neck to his opponent.

The swarm grew restless, flying headfirst through walls and flapping their wings with more and more intensity. Whether it was because of the incredibly hot weather or because of the filthy monk&#39;s words wasn&#39;t clear, but one thing was certain—they were hysterical.

&quot;... You&#39;d make a young girl kill you. And you call yourself a <em>monk</em>?&quot; The insects screeched, louder than ever.

More insects came flying out of the walls to meet with the guarding Copper Knights. Without Lord Brandin&#39;s curse, the walking tin cans would have close to no way of dealing with the bugs, leaving them to look for the monk&#39;s cell key without fear of being taken out.

&quot;I know this is gonna sound cheesy, clich&#233; or whatever—but you can&#39;t take the easy way out. You fucking can&#39;t. Like, if you feel the slightest bit of remorse over what happened with Lord Brandin, then <em>fucking fix your shit!</em>&quot;

Although not very condensed, those clones would hopefully slow the movements of the Copper Knights while the other bugs looked for the cell&#39;s key.

&quot;I&#39;ve been there, okay? I&#39;ve felt guilt over my own powerlessness. One of my favourite person in the world got badly hurt because of my stupid ass. <em>Numerous times</em>, but I didn&#39;t sit idly waiting for my death. That same person even <em>saved</em> me, giving me some much needed support when I was close to giving up, and I stand here today thanks to them. See? All it took was a <em>helping hand</em>, and I was back from that dark place.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not saying I understand how you feel. I probably wouldn&#39;t get a fraction of a percent of an idea of what you feel like even if I tried to. I&#39;m merely saying that ... feeling powerless, having regrets over what you&#39;ve done—I&#39;ve been there.&quot;

&quot;Which is why I&#39;m making you one more offer, and with no strings attached this time—let us give you a helping hand. It&#39;s not just me and Guan Yu, we&#39;ve brought two powerful allies with us as well.&quot;

&quot;Help us take down Lord Brandin, and we&#39;ll help you take that first step towards Nirvana. You might not reach it in your lifetime, but you sure as hell can get closer to it.&quot;</span>

Even for the monk, he was half convinced to simply...deny them. Perhaps it was crude to ask Bug to kill him, but in the end, it wasn&#39;t as if there was much that he could do here. His power, the source of all the mayhem, discord, murder, bloodshed and sorrow in his life, was dwindling at best. Even if he rose up, what good could he do now. Brandin was powerful. Lost, but powerful...

&quot;...Nirvana is not an easy road, young one. You and your allies...do you know what you&#39;re offering? Do you know of the pain that surrounds this soul...&quot; 

Even on the cusp of denial, Jampo finds his words being bitten back. This frantic display, so unlike the cool nature of the Master of Lancer. And her friend...was she perhaps speaking of the Divine God of War?

As the Knights continue to swat and swing at the Swarm, a rock sprung from inside of the cell, shooting forth like a bullet and smashing into one of the Knight&#39;s helmets. The blow dents the metal, and the helmet falls over, the knight faltering as the same rock floats menacingly before the other. It rockets itself against the sword of the other, bashing the gloved but empty pauldrons before slamming itself against the body, pushing the automaton far back enough that it&#39;s body falls to pieces, slowly trying to recover as Jampo whistles to Laura&#39;s insect Swarm. 

&quot;If even you can come back from the brink, then maybe...maybe I can pull Olympia back from my own. Brandin has left the keep...if we are to escape, it must be now. My power is miniscule, but I can make my way through...simply unlock these binds, Miss Laura,&quot; he says, the last whisper of her real name bringing a brighter smile to the face of despair. 

&quot;I figure it&#39;s better to be on first name terms...if we are to save this city...and if I am to make amends, save Brandin as well.&quot; Did he still believe there was any good in that Lord? Well, no matter. He was game; now he just needed to be freed from his cage.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Hearing the name <em>Laura</em> come from his mouth was nothing short of a shock. Had he known this <em>entire</em> time, yet insisted on calling the commander <em>Bug</em>? They weren&#39;t sure if it was just the antics of an old man, or if a switch had been flipped in the monk&#39;s head.

&quot;... I came back from that brink, but it wasn&#39;t such a big deal in retrospect. I wouldn&#39;t have the nerve to compare our two situations, mainly because I have no idea what you&#39;re going through or what you already went through. I know <em>facts</em>, sure. But I sure as hell don&#39;t know about your actual feelings.&quot;

The two Copper Knights fell to pieces thanks to the weakened monk&#39;s efforts, giving some leeway for the swarm to rummage through their remains in an effort to locate the cell&#39;s key.

&quot;But if you&#39;re willing to make an effort, then it&#39;s all that matters to me. I don&#39;t think anyone can fault you if you&#39;re trying to do good, even if you end up making matters worse. <em>Intentions</em> matter a lot more than people think.&quot;

Deep within the breastplate of one of the two guards, the key was finally found. Truthfully, the swarm&#39;s commander had no doubts that Jampo would&#39;ve been able to break out by himself. The one thing he lacked was an initial <em>push</em>. Just a few sentences ... nay, a few <em>words</em> could make a huge impact. 

&quot;Let&#39;s get you out of there, Jampo.&quot; The insects spoke softer than before, bringing the key between his hands. &quot;We&#39;ll worry about saving <em>Brandin</em> after you&#39;re all set and done.&quot;

Would the monk open the door to his cell and finally step outside, he would witness that the swarm had taken on a different form. Many <strong>X</strong>s would be placed down various paths, while only one showed an <strong>O</strong>. 

Escaping from the cell was but the first step. If he was to leave this place alive, he would need indications as well. The swarm&#39;s commander would make sure that he took the best possible path, avoiding the ones filled with Copper Knights and other dangerous hazards.</span>

&quot;...I don&#39;t think my feelings account for much, Laura, but...thank you regardless.&quot; He whispers, noting the symbols she left behind to guide him on the right path. He wasn&#39;t sure if he could handle a Copper Knight at this current level, and definitely not more than one on his own. He only managed to knock the others by surprise...

<em>&quot;Jampo, what happened with this bluebird?&quot;</em> 

&quot;Urk!&quot; He grunts as he falls hard on his knees, the monk grasping at his face as sorrow wells up in his chest. Ashura slumbers, but even now, his emotional state was in a flux with the onset of hope within reach. <em>&quot;I...I didn&#39;t mean to, i...I just wanted to play with it...</em>&quot;

<em>&quot;Its wing...you must be more tender with these creatures, child. Remember this, we are all connected in a cycle; we&#39;re all on our own path to Nirvana and enlightenment. It&#39;s our purpose to guide not just each other, but the birds under foot. To harm anything is a grave sin, Jampo. It takes us further away.</em>&quot; 

<strong>&quot;JAMPO, STOP. STOP. STOOOP.&quot;</strong>

He leaves himself gasping as he catches a glimpse of that night, the smell of fire and burnt flesh seeping into his mind before he shakes it away, regaining himself as he continues on, nodding at the Swarm. The man puts on a facade, but his imprisonment must have left a mark. Steady footsteps from behind let them both know that the Knights from before are back on their feet, their search now fervently underway as the old monk hurries forward, making sense of the labyrinth walls as he tries to remember its layout. Taking the right path, he makes his way up a spiral staircase, slinking around the corner at the top to find the Great Hall, Brandin&#39;s throne lording over a vast chamber as two more Knights stalk through. 

<strong>BOOM!</strong></span>

Dust falls from the slight shake of the Earth, Jampo turning his attention to the great doors that lead into the outer courtyard. &quot;I suspect that is your accomplices? We must hurry then,&quot; he says, turning back to look down another hall...one shrouded in darkness...

&quot;The Black Knight will be summoned if enough of his automatons fall...if it catches us here...nevermind that. Laura, distract that Knight, I believe I can make a dash for the courtyard at least. He&#39;s likely brought more of his Knights into the city, so there shouldn&#39;t be much resistance.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bearing witness to the monk&#39;s struggles, the swarm followed his limp advance through Dolorous Gard. 

Many thousands of eyes kept tabs on the monk at all times. The pained facial expressions he desperately hid with a soft smile, the way his jaw clenched at each taken step, the strength at which his pulsing veins frantically fed oxygen to his already dying system—the commander would have to be blind not to realise that something was going on. 

<em>There are things about us that we wished we controlled.</em>

The ... <em>thing</em> that had resurfaced by the end of their fight against Uther Pendragon and his Master, that which Lord Brandin had awakened inside him. If Lord Brandin was truly all-seeing inside Dolorous Gard, there was a high probability of <em>it</em> awakening at some point. And <em>it</em> wasn&#39;t a creature of reason, but a beast that devoured again and again until it was satisfied. Tacky friendship talk wouldn&#39;t be able to reason it.

The swarm&#39;s commander had promised a helping hand. To give the old monk the push he so desperately needed to start anew. But would they be able to extend such a hand if Jampo broke down from the pressure of his inner demon? How would <em>he</em> react in their shoes if that happened?

Doubts. Those were the heavy burden that the pillars amongst men carried onto their shoulders. The uncertainty of having what it takes to provide support, of being able to make a difference at all.

Witnessing the blasts on the boat and being on the receiving end were two completely different experiences, Rider truly exhibited the strongest firepower that the commander had witnessed up to this point. It was reassuring to think that they had such an ally by their sides.

&quot;... You&#39;re right. Brandin&#39;s right in front of us as we speak, surrounding me and Guan Yu with a number of Copper Knights,&quot; The insects spoke, their ranks bulking little by little as the smaller critters joined the bulk. &quot;But I&#39;m afraid distractions won&#39;t do us any good. Brandin already <em>knows</em>.&quot;

For a while now, the arachnids within the swarm&#39;s ranks had been hard at work, weaving silks upon silks of thread and going over each thread numerous times in order to reinforce their durability. Strength and flexibility, the two strongest assets of spider silk, made it perfectly suited for their next task.

Having squeezed their glands dry, the spiders made room for the swift flying insects to carry their denim-like strands of silk, out-manoeuvring the two knights by binding their metallic hands and ankles together before they could react. Truthfully, even if they did react on time, there was little they could do to stop the advance of the swarm.</span>

The demon inside...he won&#39;t risk activating it here.&quot; He says, throwing himself to the side as the Knights fall over each other, mechanically working at the silk threads, all the while Jampo gazes down at the helm of both, as if to glare into the eyes of Brandin himself. Both sides have eyes all over the battlefield...for the monk, power was only one factor. Intelligence would dictate much of this fight as well...

&quot;...He&#39;s allowing you to guide me out.&quot; He says simply, rising to his height once more as he turns to the Swarm, his tired eyes now drawn down in apology as he looks to the exit. &quot;He wishes to awaken the beast amongst you both. Or, at the very least, use me to weaken your resolve. I believe he is truly finished with me...which means I&#39;m more a liability than an asset. Killing me will no longer make a difference, so there&#39;s no need to stop my escape...which means I can&#39;t join you on the battlefield. At least, not with his eyes watching.&quot; 

The monk slinks towards the doorway leading to the courtyard, looking up to the small hint of sunlight that peeks beyond the walls of Dolorous Gard. 

&quot;You&#39;ve done well, Laura, but I must ask something of you. Something you may rebuke...you must cease surveillance of me. The only way for me to help you is in secret. Brandin will use not only his Knights, but <strong>you</strong> to keep tabs on me. We are bonded, tied together...it will take great caution to break those bonds.&quot;</span>

The monk slinks outside, his view of the town below the main building giving him a glimpse at the madness he has wrought upon the people he wished to help. Fires roared from the Shangri-La&#39;s artillery, Brandin&#39;s own return fire blazes against his very kingdom, the knight surely uncaring of the damage. It could all be rebuilt. 

&quot;...I must stop him on my own. If you keep him busy, I believe we can end this.&quot;</span>

That news was hardly fathomable by the commander. They had known that different Servants required different conditions to form bonds with their Masters, but for such a toxic relationship to still establish bonding ...

Then came the next request, that of leaving the monk with no surveillance. If the insects had eyebrows, they would&#39;ve been raised to the highest degree. 

Finally, his last statement, that he would be the one to end it all as long as they could distract Brandin. Bombshells being dropped one after the other, barely leaving time for the commander to process them correctly.

&quot;But why would you need me to stop ... &quot; The insects started rebuking the proposal, but then fell to a heavy silence. The insects took a good look at the monk&#39;s features, as if doing so would reveal the answers to all their questions.

&quot;... fine,&quot; They eventually yielded, much to the commander&#39;s disapproval. &quot;I&#39;ll let you do your thing, no questions asked. But at one condition ... &quot;

The swarm split in two, revealing a brightly-coloured insect in its heart—<em>a ladybug</em>. It&#39;s small wings flapped intensely, nestling itself deep within Jampo&#39;s creased hands.

&quot;If that thing you&#39;re trying doesn&#39;t work and you&#39;re in a severe pickle, just crush that bug. I&#39;ll know immediately where you are and I&#39;ll send a million billion bugs to your location, hopefully before anything bad happens. Don&#39;t worry about monitoring, I&#39;m not able to make sense of anything from just a single bug.&quot;

&quot;... if you&#39;re planning on doing some kinda heroic sacrifice, <em>I&#39;ll never forgive you</em>. You still have a <em>lot</em> to answer for, so don&#39;t you <em>dare</em> think you can take the easy way out.&quot;

A roundabout, not quite friendly way of telling the old monk to be mindful of his own safety.

Leaving the lone ladybug at the monk&#39;s side, the swarm swiftly departed to join their fellow soldiers on the battlefield.</span>

The past is the past. The only future is the one we make by walking forward. And so, he does, making his way out of the castle and into the subjugated city...</span>

His chest heaves as he ducks through one more alleyway, his breath hitches as he scales the side of a shop, long since abandoned of its wares and customers. He reaches the top, his form hidden behind one of the many off shoot streets that housed a number of the long since forgotten side of the industrial district, and slowly, his breathing calms. He had a place to rest...to meditate. He brings his hands close as he sits, his mind beginning to clear as he focuses on the one thing that could save them now. &quot;Forgive me, Miss Hess, but I&#39;m afraid even with your very real threats, this is the only way. The kill switch...if I activate it now...I can stop all of this. I can...I can fix this mistake. Lord Brandin...if only I could have done more for you...i could have shown you the light of this path...shown you-&quot; 

<em>NO!</em>

His concentration breaks as heat seeps and bleeds into his skull, the monk clutching at the force and doubling over, his screams of agony cut off by his own hand clamping his mouth shut. Him...

&quot;This is the only way to defeat him...if I try anything else, he&#39;ll unleash you and kill the others!&quot; 

<em>No! Kill him! Destroy him! He&#39;s taken everything from me!</em></span>

He grinds his teeth, slowly lifting himself up and bringing his hands back, his forehead throbbing as he tries once more to activate the kill switch...

<em>DO NOT DENY ME!</em> 

Another wave presses down, forcing tears to leak from his eyes as the monk undergoes unbearable pain, it coursing through his body and forcing his already worn muscles to spasm, his mind broken once more as Ashura fights its way to the surface. With only a spark of mana left in his body, it was all Ashura needed to break loose. 

&quot;...Why are you like this,&quot; he says. His words choke on themselves, but with his only plan left fruitless, he couldn&#39;t stop the wave that was coming. Tears well in his eyes as he slams his fist against the roof of the shop, weakly, before the old man does something he hadn&#39;t done since that fateful day: he sobs. &quot;Why have you done this to me...please. I need to know...why do you cause such pain...&quot;

<em>...</em>

&quot;ANSWER ME!&quot; Jampo throws caution away, raising his voice and slamming the roof once more, this time more forcefully, as small cracks form beneath his fist. &quot;After all of the pain and suffering you&#39;ve caused, after killing our masters...you owe me that much!&quot;</span>

<em>&quot;I owe you? I OWE YOU?! You&#39;ve buried me for decades, you&#39;ve refused to see the truth of what you are. For every moment you&#39;ve lived, I suffer! I watched as you toiled for years in this cesspool, watched you make an empty deal with that roach Brandin. You attempt platitudes where they aren&#39;t welcome, and worst of all, you fool, you still believe Brandin is worth saving. That he somehow has a golden kernel deep inside. This isn&#39;t true. He&#39;s evil, Jampo, and I&#39;ve had to watch him torture you mercilessly to instill some form of obedience. I will kill him, maim him...&quot;</em>

This...was the most he&#39;s ever heard the beast say. His sobs subside as he listens to the voice, <em>his</em> voice, reprimand him and scold him. Almost...parental...in a vicious way. 

&quot;...Why does that pain you?&quot; 

<em>&quot;...You are all I have. Just as I am all you have. To see you suffer only fuels this rage.&quot;</em>

&quot;Then why did you kill our masters?&quot; 

The bold question. The nexus of his life, the cornerstone of what became his self-imposed exile and pilgrimage. The event that made him who he is...

<em>&quot;...I regret that day as well, Jampo. But, you must understand your own part to play.&quot;</em></span>

&quot;I would <strong>never</strong> have chosen to kill them, you were-&quot; 

<em>&quot;You hid me away. You locked me away inside; a caged animal has only two paths. To die in silence, or to live in fury. I chose to live. But that will only grows the longer one is contained, until violently, it bursts. Just like it did with them...just like it did on every ship. When you hide the truth, it rears it&#39;s head in the most disgusting way imaginable. I am you. You are me. When we hide who we are, we never truly become our true selves. You have been living a lie, and that lie has only fueled the monster you choose to see.&quot;</em>

So then...that was it. The monk rests, sitting up and wiping at the teat staining his face while gazing at the high wall; he could spot the hole that Rider&#39;s attack had made, and through it, the rays of the sun peeking through. No matter how much Brandin tried to hold it back, the sun would rise, all the more blinding the longer it was resisted. 

&quot;...I should have told my masters of you. I worried...I worried rejection from the only family I knew. I worried you would ruin my life.&quot;</span>

<em>&quot;And in so believing, you made it true. I loved them as dearly as you did. But my rage...I couldn&#39;t control myself....</em>

<em>&quot;Jampo. I am sorry.&quot;</em>

He falls to his knees once more, his head nodding as he listens. &quot;Ashura...I am sorry.&quot; 

The two voices fall silent, with only the body being left to right itself and to stare at the ensuing chaos. Gunfire swept it&#39;s way through the streets, roars of an ethereal black knight could be heard from streets away. Two souls in one body were now faced with a choice. 

&quot;...Ashura...what if I were to promise never to suffocate you...never to bind you...would you trust me?&quot; 

<em>&quot;...Why do I need to?&quot;</em> 

&quot;If we are to share this body...we each should have our own claim to it. But it&#39;s only through trusting each other that we can reach our full potential...will you join me?&quot; 

<em>&quot;...Will Brandin die?&quot;</em> 

&quot;The Buddha states that killing is a mortal sin, as it prevents one from reaching the light of Nirvana in one cycle...however, I would argue that Brandin has strayed too far from that path. In short...yes. <strong>To save Brandin...we must kill him.</strong> Before that, however, we must set terms...&quot;</span>
