The towering ramparts of Dolorous Gard had not halted due to Lancer of Olympia&#39;s intervention. If anything, the stalemate only caused a shudder of hopelessness to grip every citizen that found their home in the district, as nothing could stop the walls that grew around them and blocked out the warmth of the sun overhead. Only after did the Knights come. 

The resistance was swift and futile; with the retreat of Lancer, the citizens had little chance to survive but to surrender to the will of their new Lord, Brandin of Dolorous Gard, or to see the end of a blade tear through their flesh. Several houses still have the dried remnants of those that defied the Servant. The lone Copper Knight walks autonomously, its head unflinching as it surveys for any sign of indecency or betrayal. The head of one &quot;freedom fighter&quot; hangs from its grasp, fresh blood dripping and running down the length of its Copper chassis.</span>

Blood became the calling sign of Brandin&#39;s soulless legion. Its scent, metallic and cruel, warned the former workers to hide in their homes. Its warmth precipitated utter obedience in those that were forced to bathe in it after their friends, families and loved ones were struck down. The sight of it reminded them that none had come to their aid, and likely none ever would. Initially an afterthought, none could have predicted Saber of Olympia to amass power such as this, and surely none could have expected to fear the inevitable. Even with their disqualification, several noticed the Church failing to come to their aid. Was it merely a chance for the other Masters to make a move? Or was the Saber too powerful for the Church to contend with...

The Knight halts, standing as a stalwart obelisk in the midst of a crossroads, its armor spattered in gore as it prepared itself to return to the keep. Despite the sun overhead, darkness has gripped Olympia...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;So let me get this straight,&#39; Kun Wu look over his excessively large sunglasses at the castle walls emerging in the distance. &#39;When you said to tear down Brandin&#39;s castle, what you <em>actually</em> meant is to invade Olympia itself with a four man army.&#39; 

He looked out from his ride, a massive ship parting the waves. Wind caught at his hair and blew it about his head. He guarded his eyes with his sunglasses and turned to look at his &#39;companion&#39;, a swarm of bugs from yours truly, which were struggling to maintain their form against the wind.

&#39;I have a feeling that you&#39;re better off staying inside,&#39; he told his slowly diminishing bug guide. &#39;It&#39;s not like I can&#39;t find my way to the Gard. The entrance, anyway. I mean,&#39; he shrugged at Olympia&#39;s massive iron fortress. &#39;It&#39;s kind of...right <em>there</em>.&#39;

The ship steadily made for what remained of Olympia&#39;s docks. With all the smog belching factories lining the perimeters of the city, it was hard to tell where the castle walls ended and where Olympia&#39;s streets began. Though it didn&#39;t make much of a difference when viewed from afar. Both were equally dreary in appearance; even the wedge of sky above Olympia&#39;s platform grew dark, like someone had just placed a massive cup over the whole of the city.

It was getting harder to see through his sunglasses, but appearances must be kept. After all, what kind of celebrity would dare show their face in public, possibly <em>crowded</em> spaces without covering up at leave 80% of their face? 

Not him, obviously!

&#39;Besides, if it&#39;s really like you said, that the further away Brandin is, the weaker the castle gets, don&#39;t you think we can blast our way in wherever we want now that his castle has almost taken over the city?&#39; He raised an eyebrow behind his massive shades, a grin cropping up his face. &#39;I hope you&#39;re all set up to film, because <em>boy</em> have I got a surprise for you...&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was certainly unexpected to see the castle walls spread overnight, or perhaps Saber, astute as they were, had planned this massive expansion for a while. Regardless, it was mere fact that their opponent had seized a sizable chunk of Olympia. To have a portion of the city as their territory meant they were already fighting an uphill battle. Even a simpleton could tell, since the Church itself had instated an order to defeat Saber at all costs.

&quot;My my. I feel like Olympia looked better than this the last time we visited.&quot; The clack of her heels resounded on the ship&#39;s metallic hull. Kun Wu would look to his back, beyond Laura&#39;s buzzing critters as he saw his Servant emerge from one of the ship&#39;s various doors.

&quot;Personally, I can&#39;t stand the sight of it. Was never a fan of western ships, either.&quot; Ching Shih puffed smoke out of her lips, a long pipe in her hands as she adjusted a sleek pair of black shades that covered her cold gaze. Unlike Kun Wu, she was rather particular about her measurements. Practicality above all.

&quot;Speaking of,&quot; She turned to her Master, albeit calling him that was getting old. &quot;can you even <em>see</em> in those, milord? I did suggest you simply buy two of my pairs instead.&quot; She stated, tapping her glasses with her index before noticing that he was talking to a swarm of floating bugs.

&quot;Oh. I see. So the little lady is here as well. Wonderful.&quot; She sighed, feeling rather awkward about having someone else aboard, but she would live with it.

After all, the ship was <em>big.</em></span>

Piles of riches, along with several bags of physical, paper currency. Exotic items and precious jewels were stored in a secure part of the ship&#39;s hull. To top it all off, Kun Wu&#39;s bank account was currently amongst the top of the Delphi middle class, but it was expertly hidden thanks to Ching spreading his money in powerful stocks and businesses.

His cash flow was unobstructed and pure. Perfect for Ching&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Her strongest one, which could only be used if her mana levels were on point.

Fortunately, that issue had been fixed.

Bountiful riches coupled with an untapped mana flow. This resulted in the creation of a boat that went beyond the legend of Ching Shih, beyond her majestic red fleet. Instead of a Chinese pirate ship or a cargo vessel like the Brobdingnagian, she had combined both massive size and firepower. An unparalleled vehicle that embodied both attack and defense.

A gigantic steel frame, wrapped around the ship&#39;s hull. It was large enough to overshadow most of Olympia&#39;s ships, along with being capable of holding various armaments and firepower for combat use. Numerous cannons, ranging from archaic to modern, were currently trained on Dolorous Gard. It wasn&#39;t a ship. It was a battleship. It was meant for <em>war</em>.

A rose flag adorned the top of it.

<strong>GORGEOUS FLOWER BOAT: SHANGRI-LA</strong>

&quot;Oho? So we just need to blast our way through?&quot; Ching repeated, having only half followed Kun Wu&#39;s conversation with Laura. &quot;Should I go ahead and bombard the walls then? This ship is fully capable of that.&quot; She snapped her fingers as the entirety of the ship&#39;s cannons aimed at the castle walls.

&quot;Speaking of, where is Lord Guan Yu, little miss? Surely you don&#39;t expect me to do the heavy lifting on my own?&quot; She turned to a fly buzzing next to her ear. Such disgusting creatures... <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;I meant what I said,&quot; The insects replied, somehow managing to form a silhouette near Kun Wu despite the horrendous wind. &quot;<em>All</em> of this counts as Lord Brandin&#39;s castle. I told you exactly how big that thing was beforehand, too.&quot;

<em>&quot;Not to mention that my assistance doesn&#39;t end with locating the Buddhist Temple.&quot;</em>

At those words, an enormous black cloud started appearing on top of Olympia. How unusual, the pair would&#39;ve thought as it fearlessly advanced through the skies, stretching thinner and thinner across the island.

&quot;Compared to the battle we fought or the one with Saber, things are vastly different this time. I didn&#39;t get caught off-guard, which means I&#39;ve had <em>ample</em> time to prepare.&quot;

The truth quickly came to light—that was no regular cloud, but a huge swarm of flying insects soaring through the sky with astounding speed. Upon closer look, the swarm wasn&#39;t quite at cloud level, but it was high. <em>Really high</em>. Just thinking about the degree of control that one would need to have for <em>this</em> to work properly would be enough to give any Magus a headache. 

&quot;Also, I&#39;d rather you not sigh upon looking at my swarm, Ching Shih.&quot; The silhouette collapsed, reforming near the she-pirate. &quot;Trust me, you won&#39;t fly high with that kinda attitude. It&#39;s the sort of behaviour that really bugs people, y&#39;know.&quot;

The insects hurled their bodies into one another, making sounds akin to laughter.

&quot;Bug puns aside, <em>we&#39;re already in the thick of it</em>. You&#39;ll be able to spot us soon enough ...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Stones, paved roads, layers of ancient architecture that shouldn&#39;t have been there. The young girl, accompanied by her trusty Lancer, were making their way through their next battle.

Up until now, the anticipation of a violent battle would make the young girl&#39;s shoulders drop. Violence was not her forte, after all. The thought of being physically harmed and bringing harm to others was truly sickening, enough to make her shake by moments. 

Yet now, she was proudly walking towards their objective, ahead of Guan Yu by a few steps even. Distance did not matter so long as they could communicate through their link. It felt like they were always close by, regardless of walls or space. Her steps were decisive, heels and toes touching touching the ground. No more shakiness, no uneasy feelings. At a first glance, her demeanour didn&#39;t seem to diverge that much from the one she usually had. She looked like a cocky, overconfident and seemingly untouchable young girl.

The only difference between today and the previous fights was that it was no longer just an artificial facade.

<em>&quot;...The swarm that went with the other two just stepped into Olympia&#39;s waters.&quot;</em> The words rang true in his head, clearer than any he might&#39;ve heard in his previous life. <em>&quot;Seems like they&#39;re the ones that are late now, fufu.&quot;</em>

Laughing in the face of adversity, diffusing the situation with lighthearted remarks. Even those, although similar to her habitual manners, felt somehow different this time around.

Wearing but a simple linen dress and summer sandals, she was probably the better off with managing heat between the two of them. Even then, the heat was <em>barely</em> manageable for her.

But truthfully, those conditions were ideal. This summery, skin-burning heat was exactly what she needed. In such conditions, an island scorched by heat and surrounded by all the water in the world, <strong>the insect and arachnid population <em>thrived</em></strong>. 

Coming all the way from Delphi&#39;s Residential District, Laura had had all the time in the world to gather her soldiers, as proven by <em>the ominous black cloud that stood lone in the skies of Olympia.</em> The non-flying insects were swarming through the deserted streets of the city, scaring a couple of stray cats along the way. No, not swarming. <em>Flooding</em> would be a better term.

They would meet up with Ching Shih and her Master at twelve o&#39;clock, right in front of Dolorous Gard. Up until now, every meeting between the two pairs was marked with lateness from their part, prompting many an earful from Kun Wu regarding punctuality and the need to be at the right time on a rendez-vous.

This time, they would arrive on time. Guan Yu would make <em>sure of it.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This assault marked their second inclusion into Olympia. And it couldn&#39;t have been any more different. The roads were changed. Sights of tall stone walls were aplenty. Even the atmosphere was gone. The previously cheery streets are now grim and heavy with grief and pain.

Was this even the same city they wandered into? The only thing that was similar to the last time was the intense heat. That sure didn&#39;t change one bit. News of the weather a week prior made him wish that he planned this attack sooner. Maybe they would have dodged this heat if they did. 

<em>&quot;Let&#39;s just hope that they are able to make it in time to join the fight. I&#39;m sure Master of Rider would hate to miss out on such a show anyways!&quot;</em> Even if they spoke to each other through their link, Laura could <em>feel</em> the smirk from those words of his. 

Their constant practice sessions they had together has strengthened their bond! It was becoming second nature for the both of them. Well, second nature to Guan Yu at least. Laura was already used to this thanks to her skills. 

<em>&quot;If they have already arrived, then stealth will soon no longer be an option, Miss Hess. That&#39;s fine with me. I wasn&#39;t much for stealth myself!&quot;</em> Though one look into the skies of Olympia and it was clear who gave them away the most out of the four. 

If the ominous cloud heading towards Saber wasn&#39;t telling enough, the next part would surely alert him to their presence.

The presence of the legendary beast seeped into the surrounding area. The familiar presence revealed who was nearby to those who faced off against Red Hare previously...

Guan Yu was quick to hop onto Red Hare. Soon Laura saw a hand extended out towards her. <em>&quot;Red Hare may not allow another rider to sit upon them, but that doesn&#39;t include those I carry myself. Take my hand, Miss Hess. I carried you out of our fight with Saber, it only makes sense that I carry you back in.&quot;</em> A gentle smile came from Guan Yu as he stared down at his Master. It might be embarrassing to given someone might be watching, but is that really the main concern on their minds at the moment?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The young girl paused at the words of the warrior, getting momentarily thrown back into the shoes of her past self, one month ago. 

The bottled up frustration of coming close to victory, yet yielding because of one&#39;s own weakness. A feeling that started with the fight against Lord Brandin, amplified with the lost of Guan Yu&#39;s arm against Kingsmade&#39;s Archer and reached its climax against Kun Wu and his Rider. It kept nibbling at her psyche little by little for a while now. A previously untouchable girl getting thrown off her horse at each obstacle—anyone in her shoes would&#39;ve broken down in tears, and she was no exception. If not for her Servant&#39;s unending support, she would&#39;ve stopped at square one.

The anticipation of each fight after Saber was met with the same words from the young girl. &#39;I have changed&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m not the one I used to be&#39;, &#39;I won&#39;t commit the same mistakes again&#39;, &#39;It&#39;ll be different this time around&#39;. Yet, the same scenario happened again and again. A loss, an unexpected draw, a forced retreat. <em>Even more frustration piling up on her plate</em>. Even with one of, if not <em>the</em> strongest Servant in this war, she couldn&#39;t pull the small weight that she was entrusted with.

But, those feelings would be her strength. She&#39;d use them as fuel, feeding the upcoming fire that would eventually brew in Olympia. The same fire that would burn her lone, powerless and frustrated self. It had started at Dolorous Gard. It will also end at Dolorous Gard.

But while she reminisced, the hand of her Servant was still raised in front of her, awaiting her response with much anticipation while she just ... stood there.

<em>&quot;I&#39;ll give that line a ... nine,&quot;</em> The retort struck the warrior. <em>&quot;If it&#39;s out of ten or out of twenty, I&#39;ll let you figure it out yourself.&quot;</em>

With the second sentence came her signature smirk, one that had shaped to be less mocking and more genuine than usual.

A faint tingling sensation short through her arms as she gave more complex orders to her swarm. Making a <em>bee</em>line towards Dolorous Gard would be simple enough with her indications and Guan Yu&#39;s unrivalled swiftness. Even if a few Copper Knights stood in their way, they surely won&#39;t be enough to slow down the two.</span>

Guan Yu pulled Laura up and into his arm. Held in a princess carry, He kept her close. As embarrassing as it might have been, it seemed that he wasn&#39;t kidding around when he said that he would carry her back in the same way. Luckily, he only needed one arm to use his weapon so this wasn&#39;t a problem for him! 

&quot;Now! We will do what we should have done at the start of this war!&quot; Red Hear reared up and bolted down the street at full speed. The wind flew through Laura&#39;s hair as she experienced riding the Mystical beast truly. This sensation of <em>freedom</em> felt liberating! It gave her a sense of perspective towards her servant now that she felt how it was to be in their place; even if it is just a smidge of it.

<strong>&quot;AND THAT IS FINISHING OFF SABER FOR GOOD! HERE AND NOW!&quot;</strong>

The first signs of Saber took the form of a single copper knight in front of their warpath. A simple obstacle. Guan Yu prepared his strike to take care of the knight with a quick swipe towards their head as they rode by. Regardless of whether or not they took out the knight, they continued forward. Their true target is awaiting them further up ahead.

As Lancer and his Master rode further into Olympia things slowly began to change. The streets grew silent as pedestrians no longer appeared and the temperature started to drop as they drew closer to the Worship Center. Laura could tell that even though they weren’t at the main keep yet, they were well within the territory of Dolorous Gard.

A sudden wave of a malevolent miasma swept over the two. Even while being shielded by the divine aura of Guan Yu, Laura still felt an intense nausea as the wave passed over her. The ambient buzzing of Laura’s swarm grew silent as thousands of insect corpses dropped from above the two. The streets grew silent except for the clopping of Red Hare’s hooves.

<em>VVVRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMM</em>

Loud engine roars filled the streets as six Copper Knights on motorcycles flew out of the side streets and swarmed the two. The weaved around and cut across Red Hare’s path to slow the two down, but stayed out of Lancer’s reach and took no hostile actions towards the two. In addition, a black limousine merged onto the road before slowing down to a stop a short distance away. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

But that was yesterday, and now is now! Who wants to ride a boring old dragon when you can march into the city on a <em>ship</em>?&#39;

The clacking of heels did not escape his ears. His star actress finally made an appearance, and Kun Wu welcomed her with arms wide open, walking up to her with the full intent of receiving a big hug. 

&#39;Took you long enough.&#39; He greeted Rider with a wide grin. Unfortunately, Rider was not so kind. She immediately started judging him on his choice of sunglasses, bringing both aesthetics and practicality to the table as her judgmental gaze pierced even the colored lenses of her own pair. 

Kun Wu pushed his sunglasses up meaningfully, with both index and middle fingers. Ching Shih saw her own reflections staring back at herself on those huge lenses. She felt as if she were staring at the face of a giant insect herself...

But Kun Wu was obviously very proud of his tasteful selection. Ching Shih&#39;s questions did not deter him; with one dramatic spin he turned to face the bow, then threw his arms out in a passionate gesture towards Olympia&#39;s stone-turned gates.

&#39;Well, Madame Ching. With a target <em>so</em> large, and <em>so</em> close, even I would feel bad if I didn&#39;t give myself a handicap!&#39; He replied cheekily, no doubt earning himself another disparaging glare from his Servant. &#39;Besides, yours eyes are good enough for the both of us! After all, you are the one who&#39;s got the experience <em>and</em> the firepower. How does it feel, leading your first naval battle in your new life?&#39;

Cannons of all shapes, sizes and origins protruded from the fusion vessel, made three times more impressive than the largest Olympian ships and hundred times more deadly. In response to Brandin&#39;s fortress, Ching Shih had brought over her own castle on the sea.

How many moves until checkmate?

&#39;Fire away!&#39; He told Ching Shih excitedly. &#39;Guan Yu and Laura are waiting for us at the front gate. I say we take a bite at everything else we can get our hands on in the meantime. How far can Shangri-La reach?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Hmm.&quot; Ching stared at the formless cloud of bugs that took various shapes while near her. She approached it with disdain and disgust. &quot;You&#39;re lucky that I haven&#39;t brought any pesticide. I have no qualms with your assistance, but you certainly ought to learn some manners. What sort of lady would willingly interact with critters like these?&quot;

She scoffed, getting back to business as Laura warned them of their impending arrival. She heard it loud and clear as she heard a proud growl near the Olympia docks that were currently part of Dolorous Gard. It belong to an all too familiar warrior, riding their fabled horse as they immediately engaged with nearby Copper Knights.

<em>&quot;Good. The fabled warrior is on our side.&quot;</em> She reminded herself, realizing she could count on Lancer for this particular endeavor. She then redirected her attention back to Kun Wu, who was glaring at her through his oversized glasses. It would have looked cute, had the colors not reminded her of a roach&#39;s shell thanks to Laura&#39;s existence.

It wouldn&#39;t be Kun Wu if he didn&#39;t immediately try to defend his tacky fashion attempts. Despite the woman going above and beyond to rebuild his taste from scratch, it was simply impossible to change Kun Wu&#39;s preferences. He was cursed to have a rather...esoteric taste in clothing.

But this was simply who her Master was. She would never deny that aspect of him, for he had accepted her despite all of her flaws.

&quot;Well, besides the bug staring at me right now,&quot; Kun Wu and Laura wondered who she was referring to. &quot;it feels rather refreshing! I did miss the sea breeze, along with a view of the vast ocean.&quot;

She stepped forward, staring at the imposing castle walls in the distance. Despite their size and length, looking as oppressive as the Great Wall itself, she felt no fear. The proof of her strength was standing right next to her.

It wasn&#39;t her ship.</span>

She was quick to wrap her arm around Kun Wu&#39;s shoulder and drag him closer, forcing him to stand by her side.

&quot;Besides, <strong>I&#39;m no longer alone.</strong> If the world couldn&#39;t handle one of me, then I shall simply deliver twice the pain.&quot; She laughed, as Kun Wu felt the ship move. The cannons had gone from aiming to having flickers of light appear in their holes.

&quot;You want to see how far Shangri-La can reach? Milord, no need to ask such redundant questions.&quot; She chuckled as the smell of gunpowder filled the air.

<strong>&quot;This entire sea is yours to conquer~&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>BOOM</strong>

The first barrage commenced, as a hail of artillery rained down on what was formerly known as Olympia. Gigantic cannon balls and modern projectile shells penetrated through the Gard&#39;s walls. Rock cracked, marble broke and stone evaporated. It felt like an unstoppable force, tearing through Brandin&#39;s defenses like tissue paper. If Saber could sense the ongoing fight, he would be flabbergasted at how his defenses were being shredded. What kind of mana was required to output this amount of raw, destructive power?!

&quot;Do you see, milord? This is the fruit of your labors.&quot; Ching whispered. Kun Wu understood immediately. His body felt famished, as if a sizable chunk of mana had been consumed by Ching&#39;s barrage. She was using her resources well, firing away by siphoning her Master&#39;s mana.

He could sense that she was going all out. Because she trusted Kun Wu to tell her went to stop. There was no need for her to babysit him further.

He was a <em>man.</em>

&quot;Now please, witness me&quot; She turned to him, her face contorting into a smile. &quot;There would be no greater honor than to have you see me at my peak. Blink even once and I&#39;ll tape your eyelids open. Understood?&quot;

She giggled like a child. For once, Rider was truly enjoying herself, a sight he seldom saw.

&quot;These sturdy cannons, this massive frame...&quot;

<strong>BLAM BLAM BLAM!</strong>

Another volley followed suit. Numerous holes had started to form around Dolorous Gard&#39;s walls, eventually culminating into a larger, bigger hole. She was creating an opening in Saber&#39;s defenses!

&quot;...This hail of missiles.&quot;

<strong>BOOM BOOM BOOM!</strong>

Kun Wu would be taken aback. He stared in awe at numerous rockets emerging from the back of the Shangri-La, homing towards the streets and walls as they blew up in different colored explosions. It was a beautiful rainbow, yet he had no idea that Ching Shih&#39;s ship held such modern weap-

&quot;And this expensive railgun!&quot;</span>

<strong>WHIRRRRRRR</strong>

He wondered if his ears had misheard, but the humming noise of a gigantic railgun charging up could not be ignored. The ship&#39;s middle housed what appeared to be a gigantic cannon outfitted with electronics. Technology that he hadn&#39;t seen in his life, except in D-tier science fiction movies.

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

The magnetic current erupted, releasing a powerful shot that pierced through six castle walls. Destruction filled every corner of the docks as Dolorous Gard&#39;s presence on the surrounding environment started to wane. The castle&#39;s core was still intact, but Rider&#39;s ability to destroy Saber&#39;s defenses effortlessly was downright infuriating at best.

&quot;Do you understand now, Saber?&quot; Ching cackled, wondering if her opponent could even hear her from this distance.

<em><strong>&quot;That you are NO match for me!&quot;</strong></em>

After her moment of triumph, Ching Shih relented from firing further, as if waiting for someone else. She hadn&#39;t destroyed the walls for herself, but merely to carve a path for others...

Laura and Guan Yu were astounded to witness such destructive firepower. Even more surprising was the fact that the holes caused by Ching had given Lancer a clear path to his destination!

&quot;Hmm. I did not think this through.&quot; Rider scratched her head. &quot;I can&#39;t exactly have my ship walk on land, so I suppose we will have to stay here for now.&quot; She turned to Kun Wu.

Suddenly, a dark rain befell the area. Though all one needed was a single glance closer to see that it was in fact dead insects falling upon them. 

The miasma that washed over them wasn&#39;t their only concern. Soon more Copper Knights came from the side streets on mechanical steeds. He has learned about these &#39;motorcycles&#39; during his time summoned here, but this would be the first time he laid his eyes upon them. They were <em>impressive</em>.

They encircled the pair and kept their distance well out of Guan Yu&#39;s reach. Red Hare&#39;s steps slowed down until they came to a stop. What followed next was the reveal of a black limousine that merged onto the same street. 

<em>&quot;Miss Hess, stay close to me. Worry not. Their weapons will not reach you, I promise.&quot;</em> Guan Yu tightened his grip around his Master once the situation changed around them. It appeared someone demanded their company. There was only one person it could be. To think they would find them so quickly.

In the distance, thunderous sounds were heard. A smirk formed on his face once he realized that Rider has already begun her attack on Dolorous Gard. Unfortunately, he couldn&#39;t witness Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm in all of its glory, but just from the sounds alone he knew it was quite flashy. The results were more than obvious. She has craved a path for them. All they needed to do was to get out of their current situation...

A weird, somehow insulting way of praising her enormous firepower. Very befitting of the swarm&#39;s commander.

The swarm quickly dissipated upon muttering those words, riding the air currents to rejoin their commander on the battlefield.</span>

The miasma, that feeling of one&#39;s energy leaking off from one&#39;s Magical circuits—Brandin&#39;s curse, no doubts. But today, even if a few thousand bugs perished, it was no big deal. The more resilient cursed bugs within her army were instantly killed by their fellow bug soldiers, leaving no room for Saber&#39;s curse to drain her Mana off through her swarm. The young girl had positively learned from their previous fights, it seemed.

&quot;<em>Your grip, old man ... it&#39;s too tight.&quot;</em> The young girl complained using their link. <em>&quot;We might want to split off right about now, I shouldn&#39;t get too close to Dolorous Gard if I want to preserve my Mana...&quot;</em>

Having thoroughly checked the market for S.E.R.V.A.N.T frames beforehand, Laura was positive that the frame Jampo had used to summon his Servant was subpar. It probably didn&#39;t contain much in terms of built-in information about the modern world. Yet, witnessing the Copper Knights riding on motorcycles while a <em>limousine</em> came out said otherwise.

&quot;Wow,&quot; The young girl exclaimed, her voice amplified by that of nearby crawlies—the ones that had been flooding Olympia&#39;s roads were finally starting to catch up to Red Hare. &quot;A limousine. Pompous much? Think you can just barge in and expand however you want? I thought we had a <em>deal</em>, Brandin.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The motorcycles come to a stop, surrounding the two but keeping their distance. A Copper Knight exited the driver’s seat of the limo and walk to the passenger door and opened it.

“You can blame the other Lancer for that.” A familiar older voice rang out from the back of the limo. Stepping out was the Lord of Dolorous Gard himself, Brandin. “He decided it was best to stir up the civilians and involve them in something they had no right being involved in. After that, well one thing led to another and here we are.”

The chaperone Copper Knight then handed Brandin a glass and poured him some wine. Brandin took a sip before continuing.

“But lets be honest with ourselves Laura, we both know that these little alliances are just a means to an end. We all know there can be only one true winner in this war. I’m sure that you’re already thinking of how to best dispose of the help that you’ve brought after they’ve served their purpose.”

Brandin took another sip of his wine as a retaliatory barrage of curse infused debris was launched via trebuchets from Dolorous Gard into the port where Rider’s attack came from. Barely any time after the first barrage, a second one already sailing through the air.

“Still, I’ll admit that you’re quite clever. But your chance of victory has long since passed. Whatever you have planed with my former Master and your little spies won’t amount to anything. That man is weak and broken, in both mind and body. Trash to be disposed of at a later date.”

“But I am capable of mercy. The option of working by my side is still open to you. I’ll need good help like yourself to solidify my position.”

Brandin swirled his drink with a smug smile stretched across his face. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The drain was imminent, and violent. 

Kun Wu felt as if his mana had been gouged out with a giant spoon, leaving nothing but a gaping hole in his once overflowing reservoir. He wasn&#39;t unfamiliar with the sensation. After all, his own shows often left him drained as well, seeing that he refused to bring anything but his 200% to entertain his audience. 

But there was a difference. The effect of the mana drain during his performances happened <em>gradually</em>, giving his body plenty of time to get used to the fatigue. Meanwhile, Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm was as demanding as the woman herself. It ravaged his circuits in the blink of an eye, shocking them into overdrive as they strained to replenish what had been robbed.

His breath hitched. For a moment his sight blurred, making him lose focus on the beautiful fireworks Rider had put on display just for him. 

Though his glasses would save him. With the massive shades acting as the perfect concealer, he masterfully covered up his unseemly reaction by pretending to be enjoying the show.

It wasn&#39;t even that hard, because the projectiles were <em>everywhere</em>.

The smell of gunpowder and the noise of the explosions clued him in on the sheer scale of Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm. As his eyes came back into focus, he managed to catch the second half of the act. Not just cannons. More than missiles. Weapons of near fantastical nature had unfurled under Rider&#39;s command and was blasting at Olympia with reckless abandon.

Dolorous Gard was under siege.

When the smoke finally cleared and the dust settled, the gaping hole in the stronghold&#39;s defenses was made evident even this far out at sea. A sizable chunk of Dolorous Gard had been razed to the ground, <em>exactly</em> like they had promised in the contract with Lancer&#39;s Master.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu turned towards Rider. His heart thumped madly. He had never been more proud of Rider than he was at that moment. Not because of her obedience. Not because of her strength. But coming to terms with her nature, being what she had always been with head held high. A pirate. A manipulator. A <strong>queen</strong>.

<strong>His</strong> queen.

&#39;Is it too early to ask for an encore yet? Your audience of millions are waiting.&#39; He said cheekily as he returned Rider&#39;s gesture, wrapping an arm around the woman and nuzzling her neck in a display of affection. &#39;Now that I&#39;ve seen it, I only wish I had seen it <em>sooner</em>. Imagine all the extravaganza we could&#39;ve had...a full month ago! Now I&#39;m sad just thinking about all the fans I <em>didn&#39;t</em> gain.&#39; He said with a deliberate, yet surprisingly effective pouty expression. 

Rider could only hope that she had gotten used to the puppy dog face&#39;s virulent effects.

Thankfully, Laura&#39;s bug swarm helped straighten her mood with their begrudging, but genuine compliments. Kun Wu delivered a thumbs-up to the swarm as they dispersed to join back with the main army.

&#39;Don&#39;t go too far in, okay?&#39; He waved after the bugs. &#39;Save some excitement for us!&#39;

Aside from the mass destruction left in the cannons&#39; wake, it was hard to tell how the battle was unfolding on  Lancer&#39;s side. Fortunately, Rider&#39;s aim, while chaotic, was largely accurate: she had avoided totaling their meet-up spot, meaning the only place on the city&#39;s peripherals that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> smoking must be the front gate.

As Kun Wu focused in on the city, so did the sky turn dark with a volley of projectiles from the Gard&#39;s inner walls. Brandin did not take Rider&#39;s assault kindly. He was retaliating with the castle&#39;s own armory! 

Debris were launched high into the sky, crossing the city, then the ocean in giant arcs as they hurled towards their target: Shangri-La. Normally, such a feat would be enough to put an entire fleet into panic...

It wasn&#39;t that he was disappointed!

...Well, not at first! But after seeing the fireworks that Rider had brought, was it really his fault to be expecting <em>more</em>? Rider had raised the bar incredibly high with her stunt; it would take a lot more than flying stones and metal to wow her Master.

But, well, all judgements aside, flying debris falling from the sky could still be quite dangerous. 

&#39;I don&#39;t suppose this ship comes with a shield dome of some kind?&#39; He asked Rider. &#39;As a Master made of flesh and bone, I think it&#39;s a good idea that I take shelter inside. Want to show me the way to the captain&#39;s chamber? I could use a break to regenerate some mana so you can keep firing those canons of yours.&#39; He laced his fingers with hers and tugged her arm, motioning for her to get out of harm&#39;s way as well.

&#39;But make no mistake. We are still going to keep pushing. I agreed to meet Laura at the front gate at 12pm sharp. It is now 12:04, and the clock is still ticking.&#39; He pulled his lips. &#39;If you can keep from firing your cannons, I still have more than enough mana to keep Shangri-La in operation. And to answer your question of what to do with the ship...do you really need to ask?&#39; He pushed his magnificent sunglasses up into his hair, and looked at Rider with an impish glint in his eyes.

<strong>&#39;We are going to dock, obviously.&#39;</strong>

He pointed at the front gate.</span>

While the two of them spoke amongst each other, Guan Yu remained ready to spring into action at a moment&#39;s notice. The tension was suffocating to the point that he didn&#39;t notice that his grip was tightening a bit much for Laura. <em>&quot;My bad, Miss Hess.&quot;</em> A swift apology came from him as he loosened the grip a bit so he is no longer crushing her. A slip-up on his part.

The offer of joining Lord Brandin&#39;s side was made. 

Lord Brandin reminded Guan Yu of another who once offered an invitation to join his forces during his time alive; The Hero of Chaos, Cao Cao. It appeared that his assumption that Saber would fit in perfectly with Guan Yu&#39;s era was closer on the dot than he previously thought. 

A smirk appeared on his face before a single swipe at empty air was made with his blade. This caused a echoed ringing to be made. An abrupt interjection to Brandin&#39;s offer of mercy.

&quot;Your offer is pointless, Saber.&quot; Guan Yu held out his blade in front of him. From his line of sight, the blade appeared to be rested upon Saber&#39;s neck. A simple declaration. &quot;This blade of mine belongs to one Lord and one Lord only. That Lord being Miss Hess here. And I&#39;m sorry to admit that she isn&#39;t one to submit to mere tyrants like yourself!&quot;

Just as her jaw started clenching in frustration, the words spoken by her partner brought a wave of comfort. Of <em>relief</em>. No matter how many times she heard it coming from his mouth, the fact that he had placed his faith upon her—it never failed to bring her self-confidence up. As a matter of fact, it was currently at an all-time high.

Mirroring the warrior&#39;s gest, Laura pointed the lord of Dolorous Gard with an index finger.

&quot;Not trying to burst your bubble, but you do realise that you&#39;ve been disqualified from the City Grail War ... right?&quot; The young girl snorted, barely managing to keep a straight face. &quot;I mean, between the two of us, <em>you&#39;re the one who&#39;s chances of victory have long since passed</em>.&quot;</span>

How ironic, that a blockade was one of her main obstacles in life. Yet as a Servant, she could dispose of one rather easily. She felt like a changed woman.

Granted, this wasn&#39;t only her strength. Kun Wu was the one enduring the toll in her stead, being steadily sapped of mana with every cannonball or missile being sent towards what was formerly Olympia&#39;s docks. But both of them knew what they were getting into when they bonded. They had no regrets.

&quot;Is that perhaps jealousy I hear, little miss?&quot; Ching replied with a smirk to the swarm of flies, but Laura disappeared as soon as the new path had been formed.

&quot;Oh well. Seems like they intend to take full advantage of my generosity.&quot; The pirate queen chuckled, before feeling Kun Wu gently cuddle her. He showered her in praise, before thinking about what could have been scenarios as he assaulted her with puppy eyes.

Ching thanked both of their sunglasses, since being unable to directly stare into Kun Wu&#39;s eyes hampered the effectiveness of his pouting by around 90%. It was akin to Perseus defeating the terrifying Medusa with a mirror.

&quot;Save these mannerisms for the bedroom, milord.&quot; Rider replied sternly as she started to shrug him off, much to her Master&#39;s discontent. Their brief spat would be interrupted by Saber&#39;s counterattack, who had fired several boulders and debris at the sky. Rocks threatened to land on the battleship and crush it to pieces.

She and Kun Wu sighed in unison.

&quot;Seems like Saber is annoyed. Granted, I expected some retaliation.&quot; She stared at the incoming debris, wondering on how best to approach it. Before she could commence her next attack, however, she felt warm fingers grip her own as Kun Wu tugged on her arm. His suggestion to observe from a safe place was sound. However, he had failed to account for one thing.</span>

<strong>&quot;The safest place is right beside me.&quot;</strong> Ching Shih proudly exclaimed, hugging Kun Wu with her arm and holding him tightly. &quot;If I was forced to stand by Zheng Yi&#39;s side during battle, then <em>of course</em> I&#39;m doing the same with you. Willingly.&quot; She pouted, insisting on her decision.

Almost as if to reinforce that fact, Kun Wu witnessed several harpoons erupt from the Shangri-La&#39;s armaments. They were fast and precise, aiming for the piles of debris as they perforated them like shish-kebabs. They weren&#39;t explosive, unlike cannonballs and missiles, but that&#39;s because they served a different purpose: They were incredibly heavy, allowing them to drag the debris down and greatly reduce its speed. The boulders never reached their targets, for they simply sunk down the ocean floor with the added weight of the harpoons. She did the same with the second volley, sparing no expenses when it came to mana reserves.

Of course, such a flashy maneuver caused Kun Wu to feel cold, as he felt more mana being sapped away from him. Rider could feel his body quiver, causing her to cast him a worried glance.

&quot;...Plus, I am not sure if you realized it, but your magical circuits are at their peak while you are next to me. Consider that one of my skills as well. Therefore, it is essential for us to remain together.&quot; She slid her fingers through his palm and grasped at his hands.

While Rider was worried about Kun Wu&#39;s wellbeing, the latter seemed rather thrilled at the prospect of seeing his Servant at their peak. In fact, he even gave her a rather amusing suggestion.

Ching Shih smirked back.

&quot;You&#39;re quite devilish, milord. Are you sure you don&#39;t want to take command of the ship in my stead?&quot; She jokingly proposed, before turning around and raising her arm.

&quot;Shangri-La. <strong>Anchors away!</strong>&quot;</span>

The ship replied back, steam and electricity snoring from the engines as it propelled itself forward. It rammed through what was once Olympia&#39;s docks, trudging through the terrain as it threatened to park on land itself!

&quot;Let us retreat to the captain&#39;s chamber. It has a much better view.&quot; Ching said, starting to drag Kun Wu back to the ship&#39;s middle for his own safety. More of Dolorous Gard&#39;s walls and surfaces were crushed as the ship started to approach the hole that she had created just minutes ago. It had become a glorified battering ram, causing tremors as the earth quaked with its approach. Both Guan Yu and Brandin could feel it, along with the various Copper Knights stationed nearby.

Inside the captain&#39;s chamber, Ching Shih let Kun Wu rest on a chair while she observed the battle from above, having a bird&#39;s eye view of the docks thanks to the ship&#39;s height. She noticed Lancer in the distance, talking to several armored fellows. One of them seemed to be drinking in the middle of the fight.

&quot;Milord, is that them, perhaps?&quot; Ching Shih pointed. There was no one else who fit the description of Saber.

Brandin would feel threatened by Rider&#39;s massive ship, not to mention it seemed to be intent on penetrating Dolorous Gard&#39;s defenses further and head towards the castle gates... <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Well, excuse me for having my sights set on the bigger prize.” Brandin responded to the news of his disqualification with the same smug look on his face. “Or are you so ignorant as to think that the Church will uphold your victory. Why don’t we ask the winner of the last war what they think about that?” Brandin said fully aware of how the current Grail War started.

“This offer wasn’t for you anyway Guan Yu.” Brandin said as he tossed his glass away. “It’s for your Master to keep in mind as I’m killing you.”

With that Brandin drew his sword and slowly started to approach Lancer. His relaxed stance gave way to an intense pressure that beat down on Lancer and his Master. Their opponent was far different from the time they had faced him all those weeks ago. The Copper Knights did not move as Brandin drew closer. <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

The suffocating and maleficent aura that escaped from him echoed that of the Black Knight, the same that had Guan Yu on the ropes upon their first encounter. Laura&#39;s instincts fought, implored, <em>screamed</em> not to go against the lord&#39;s will. <em>The first act that truly painted Brandin as a ruler in her mind.</em>

Yet, those same instincts were soothed by the warrior&#39;s strong grip. He had promised her safety, had he not? What was there to be afraid of? Returning smirks back-and-forth was getting obnoxious, the girl simply frowned her eyebrows in response to his words.

&quot;If you think you can win me over by threatening to kill <em>my</em> Guan Yu, then any business endeavours between us is doomed to fail—&quot;

The girl nodded towards the warrior, firmly clutching his arm in anticipation.

&quot;—much like <em>you&#39;re</em> doomed to fail, Brandin!&quot;</span>

They arrived to the point where they are standing right now through that same trust in each other, how they survived the battles they have fought, how they managed to still come out alive despite it all, and how they will prevail this day! 

Guan Yu could <em>feel</em> the immense pressure emitting from Saber. He refused to even fight alongside his knights before. Now he is so brazenly approaching him with sheer confidence surrounding him. They needed to act now!

With that, Red Hare sprung into action. All that tension released in a single bout of fantastical speed that kicked up the air around them. The mystical beast kept their distance away from Saber as they brought Guan Yu close to their target. Red Hare used their immense mass to bully any opposing Knights to clear the path.

Guan Yu knew better than to challenge Saber surrounded and outnumbered. He was no fool. So his first strike went not at Saber himself, but at his Limousine instead. The huge blade sought to cleave it in two right down the center and speed off to gain some distance between him and Saber for now.

It wouldn&#39;t amount to much, given Saber&#39;s newfound powers, but it was spark that ignited Saber and Lancer&#39;s rematch. This time, only one of them will be walking away from this fight.</span>

Wirh the limo torn apart like tissue paper, the Knights didn&#39;t need to heed the word of their master as they quickly regained their footing, speeding off after their quarry. It wasn&#39;t likely they would stop Guan Yu, but they could slow them down for their master to catch up. After all, perhaps Brandin might take this moment to exact Vengeance upon the so called queen of pirates...

The roar of their engines spark as the Knights chase after Guan Yu, their mana infused cycles still not enough to match the blazing speed of the mythical steed. The horse&#39;s grunts signal the the power and control it has over the safety of its master and their partner, weaving and cutting off any momentum the Knights could employ.

<strong>KA-CHOOM</strong>

A whisp shoots alongside Guan Yu, grazing the edge of his shoulder and coming dangerously close to injuring Laura. To the left, one Knight hefts a Pistol. The stark contrast of modern weaponry with the archaic servant would have been humorous were they not firing madly, even managing to ding a few of their fellow Knights, but what was such a blow to one that feels no pain? 

The buildings and wreckage from Rider&#39;s assault blend by as speed ratchets the Mob forward, all while more weapons were pulled from their holsters by the Knights, showing just how acclimated to the new age Brandin had become besides fine wines. He also had a particularly good taste in sub-machine weaponry. 

<strong>RATATATATTATATATATATTATTAATTATATATATATA</strong>

A new spray showers across the back of Guan Yu and Red Hare, the streets lighting up from the flash of the muzzle as one Knight takes aim with a rapid fire weapon, aiming to cut off and slow down the duo. Bullets wedge themselves into street signs and any still standing street lamps, sending new debris to catch the horse off guard.</span>

<strong>CRASH</strong>

The ship suddenly and violently shifts off course. As if they had collided with some rocks beneath the waves. The sound of tearing wood eminated from beneath Rider and Kun Wu&#39;s feet. The deck then exploded outwards as a black armored knight pulled itself from the innards of the ship. No doubt the same Black Knight Laura warned of. Its eyes burned fiercely with a hateful red light as it raised its axe and charged at Rider with a metallic roar.

At the same time, the onslaught from Dolorous Gard continued as a large rock sailed directly towards Kun Wu. <span class="mention" title="ResIsBestStat#5104">@Dad</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

&quot;Fascinating weapon for the modern age. I suppose if I&#39;m sticking around I should get some practice in.&quot; Brandin playfully mused.

Of course such a weapon would have little to no effect on a full fledged servant. At least with normal ammunition.

Brandin procured a single bullet and held it aloft. The dark, cursed energies of Dolorous Gard then seeped into the bullet itself. Filling it with so much cursed energy that it could be seen radiating off of the bullet itself. Brandin loaded the cursed bullet into the rifle. Holstered it. Aimed down the scope at Red Hare. Steadied himself. And pulled the trigger.


<strong>BANG!!!</strong>

An explosion went off in the streets as the cursed shot raced towards its target. A massive shockwave followed in its wake, blowing out the windows of houses and stores as it passed. The bullet streaked through the streets at it rapidly approached its target, the steed that Guan Yu and his Master rode on. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The telltale crack of a firearm was heard. Luckily the shot only grazed his shoulder and missed Laura, albeit it was too close for comfort however. These knights were equipped much different weaponry than before! It seems that the knights were still novices with them though. This might prove to be their saving grace..

<em>&quot;Tug yourself in as much as you can and hang on, Miss Hess!&quot;</em> A mental shout came from her servant as he proceeded to weave side to side to avoid the random onslaught of shots coming his way. 

Red Hare rode onwards, avoiding obstacles for Guan Yu as he looked behind him to swing and twirl his weapon in hopes of deflect any lucky few that came towards his steed. The sounds of bullets striking Red Hare&#39;s armour and his weapon decorated the air with harsh sounds.

A few of them grazed his body and even fewer found their mark. His endurance allowed to endure them for now, but from the pain that followed, he knew that he wouldn&#39;t be able to endure too much direct shots from the knights. He needed to escape from their line of sight. 

The true threat came not from the knights, but from the sight of Saber equipping himself with a modern firearm as well. A Saber with a gun? Isn&#39;t that a unique sight to see! What&#39;s next? An archer who dual wields swords?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The shot came from the rifle and the shockwave was telling enough to showcase the power the Curse of Dolorous Gard can possess. Guan Yu barely had enough time to pull Red Hare out of the way, but the powerful shockwave forced them towards the buildings on the side of the road. If Saber had the skills of an Archer, Guan Yu might have not been able to pull away in time...

Guan Yu couldn&#39;t risk harm to Red Hare so early so he leaned towards the buildings to create a buffer between them and his steed. It took a few seconds to realign but by then Guan Yu&#39;s exposed arm was scraped and cut by colliding with the buildings. 

&quot;We can&#39;t remain in Saber&#39;s line of sight! Hold on tight, Miss Hess!&quot; Red Hare took a sharp turn towards the opposite side of the road. Did he intend to ram straight through them? No, they ran straight up them to ride across the rooftops to escape onto the other streets. The Knights may have impressive firepower and speed thanks to the motorcycles, but they still needed a road to drive on! The Wild Red Hare was not restricted by mere rules such as those!

With their objective in their sights, they used the rooftops to quickly navigate towards the first gate. The magnificent beast made short work of the gap between the buildings with powerful leaps. They should arrive at the gate without any further issues. Master of Rider and their servants on the other hand...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Chaos ensued Guan Yu&#39;s manoeuvers. Laura had hopped that, if Brandin truly wanted her by his side, that he would go easy on the pair. Turns out that he didn&#39;t care nearly as much as she had hoped.

The barrage of bullets nearly grazed her paper-thin skin, the sudden whip strike almost caused a whiplash. If Guan Yu hadn&#39;t been there to protect her, she would&#39;ve died fifteen times by now. Even then, his soldiers were a pain to get away from, even with Red Hare&#39;s unmatched agility.

But Brandin wasn&#39;t the only one with remotely-controlled soldiers.

Barely clutching at the warrior&#39;s arm, Laura raised an arm. Hordes of crawlies immediately erupted from the alleys perpendicular to the main road. Never had she handled that number of bugs at once, but with her mental support at arm-reach, she didn&#39;t fear being taken over by the hivemind.

The waves of insects washed over the Chopper Knights, with thousands getting squashed under their wheels as the engines roared their way through the arthropods.

Nevertheless, a subsequent number of insects had climbed on the bikes. The critters didn&#39;t have the audacity to try and change the bikes&#39; direction by force. Instead, with but an order from their commander, the insects all swarmed the engines, collectively giving up their lives for the sake of the swarm&#39;s queen.

Getting clogged by insectoid fluids and hard chitin, the bikes&#39; engines collectively slowed down to a crawl, tripping the poorly coordinated automatons to the ground.

The flying bugs among the swarm went for the armed knights, clogging the barrels of the firearms—<em>pushing</em> through the cylinders until their bodies were deformed into brownish plugs.</span>

One fired off a few more shots, desperate to try and hit the Servant at least once. But, alas, Miss Hess had her own means of fighting back. 

<strong>BANG. BANG. BANG. BA-BOOM!</strong>

The firearm backfires, exploding I the Knights hand and sending it sprawling onto the concrete, gunpowder coating it&#39;s metallic sheen of armor as it struggled to rise. The same happened for their other weapons, as each Knight decided to leave them behind while they overflowed with guts and brown juices. 

 If Guan Yu was headed for the castle, that could only mean he planned to storm it himself...the Knights quickly hop back onto their cycles, half heading for the castle to cut off the God of War, while the others head back for their master. Or so they thought. 

<em>Chuggachuggachuggachooooooooooooooompppoppoblt</em> 

The bikes stalled, as several tried riding away, with two managing to get far enough to have their engines explode, engulfing two of the Knights in a bright ball of flame while the others watched. Needless to say, the abandoned the bikes. With not much left to go on, the Knights split themselves to chase after Guan Yu, 7 moving after the God of War while 8 head back to Brandin. 

<strong>18 Copper Knights remain.</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The ride towards Dolorous Gard was tumultuous to say the least. Shangri-La was capable of surviving the sea, but at the end of the day, it was still a ship. And ships weren&#39;t meant to travel on land. By sheer force it carved its way into Olympia, imprinting a jagged path on the land where its hull cleaved through tarmac and gravel. 

Even within the captain&#39;s chamber, Kun Wu felt as if he had been sitting through a mini earthquake. The constant tremor displaced the teapot on the table, sending it ever so close to the edge. Kun Wu grabbed it before it shattered on the floor and swiftly emptied its contents into a cup.

&#39;What I&#39;m seeing,&#39; he squinted as he shifted closer to the window. &#39;Is a heck of a lot of bugs.&#39; 

Compared to the ant-sized figures moving on the ground, the massive insect swarms made for a much better target. From his new vantage point, Kun Wu was able to spot quite a few different clusters, with the bulk of them following where Ching Shih had been pointing. No doubt to protect their master.

&#39;It&#39;s gotta be them. Think the bugs will catch me like a giant cushion if I decided to hop off the ship from here?&#39; He jokingly added, then put the tea cup to his lips-

The horrible sound of metal clashing against metal entered his ears, and Shangri-La lurched as if it had been impaled on a rock in shallow waters. But that was simply impossible. With Rider at her peak, the ship&#39;s hull was nigh impenetrable even under the collective fire of modern explosives. But nonetheless, the ship veered off its intended course as if it had met some indominable barrier, and Kun Wu only barely avoided the sad fate of splashing tea onto his outfit before the floor of the captain&#39;s chamber burst open.

With so much malignant aura packed into a single being, the mana signature coming from the armored figure was simply <em>insane</em>. This was not the mere footsoldiers that Laura had talked about. With its mana signature nearly rivaling that of a Servant-

&#39;It&#39;s Brandin&#39;s big boy!&#39; He exclaimed as he hopped out of the way of the Black Knight&#39;s trajectory. &#39;Careful now!&#39;

<em>Someone</em> was getting antsy down there, it seemed. The Black Knight charged at Ching Shih as more flying debris crashed out a cacophony in the background, using their bulk in hopes to not destroy the ship, but rather to stop its momentum. Kun Wu wasn&#39;t a seasoned sailor, but even he could tell that they wouldn&#39;t be able to keep land-sailing for much longer. 

The front gate was just ahead. Could Shangri-La make it?

With the Black Knight thrown into the mix, staying on the ship was becoming less enticing by the second. 

The youth rounded the room and invited himself to the hole that the Black Knight had ripped into the floorboard. A chute connected the hole to the ship&#39;s hull - a perfect emergency exit that was safe from the debris-lobbing trebuchets on the Gard&#39;s walls. 

&#39;Come, Rider! We&#39;re getting out of here!&#39; He called out amidst the chaos, extending an arm to Ching Shih as he waited by the hole. &#39;No need to dirty your hands so soon. We&#39;ll lure it outside and blast it to kingdom come.&#39;

It seemed like this fight would be a lot rougher than imagined, but at least they were approaching what appeared to be the Gard&#39;s front gates.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there, milord. Just be calm and patiently wa-&quot; She was cut off by the noise of clanging and screeching as the ship awkwardly stood still. Something had stopped it right in its tracks, which befuddled Rider. 

<em>&quot;...What could possibly stop the Shangri-La with this many resources?&quot;</em> It was implausible, unless Saber had decided to face them head on. But Lancer was currently engaging Saber&#39;s soldiers in combat, so that was not a possibility. Someone else on the level of a Servant had accosted them.

<em>creak</em>

She felt the hull of the ship be torn open, as a metallic armor suddenly kicked open the door to the captain&#39;s chambers and raised a menacing axe. A knight shrouded in complete darkness, with a mana signature rivaling a Servant.

&quot;You mean to tell me that girl wasn&#39;t just making things up?&quot; Ching asked in disbelief, narrowly avoiding the knight&#39;s blade while Kun Wu did the same. 

&quot;Saber, you won&#39;t even dare to face me yourself?&quot; Rider grunted, wondering if she could take down the Black Knight on her own. Right now, she was in her element: Her ship was a weapon of mass destruction, the docks were nearby and she had yet to use her second Noble Phantasm. Would the anchor be available to drag the Black Knight down?

The line of thought was interrupted by her Master. Quick on his feet, he had already theorized that the Black Knight&#39;s presence was not a show of power, but a sign of fear. Saber was worried of Rider joining the frontlines with such destructive firepower...

He wouldn&#39;t let this opponent stain his queen.</span>

&quot;Milord? I&#39;m completely fine. Just leave this opponent to-&quot; Ching started to say, taking out the Madam&#39;s Rose, before seeing Kun Wu extend his hand. His gaze alone said all that needed to be said.

&quot;...How foolish of me. I needn&#39;t concern myself over such boorish matters.&quot; She giggled to herself, running past the Black Knight, much to the latter&#39;s surprise. She grabbed her Master&#39;s hand and greedily clenched it before launching herself towards the path that the Black Knight had formed. They slid down the chute like on a slide, with Kun Wu resting on Rider&#39;s lap as usual.

&quot;I hope the ride isn&#39;t too unpleasant.&quot; Ching teased him, finding time to do so even in the heat of combat. They exited the tube in less the a minute, landing at the streets as they witnessed the commotion from afar. Copper Knights were falling like dominoes.

Their destination was obvious.

&quot;Hold on tight, Master. Simply think back to our first encounter.&quot; Ching warned, reminding Kun Wu of when they first met. That awkward moment when they were fleeing from Kun Wu&#39;s crowd, with Rider carrying him like a baby. Remembering it was embarrassing, yet there was some fondness in those memories.

She carried him with grace and elegance, following Guan Yu&#39;s trail of destroyed Copper Knights before finally reaching Lancer&#39;s side. Red Hare landed right next to the Gard&#39;s gate, greeting Rider with an angry neigh. Some old blood between the two.

&quot;Lancer. I assume you have a strategy in mind? I can&#39;t say I know much of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm, compared to you.&quot; Ching asked while gently putting Kun Wu down. &quot;But if you aren&#39;t pursuing him, then surely you have some sort of plan at hand?&quot;

Just as she said that, the Copper Knights finally reached their destination, accosting Lancer and Rider on all sides.</span>

&quot;...I see. So, there is something worth protecting beyond this gate, is there?&quot; Rider smirked, taking the appearance of the knights as a confirmation that Saber didn&#39;t want them there. She laughed as she twirled her rapier around and extended it into a whip.

&quot;Apologies for taking the first step, Lord Guan Yu.&quot; Ching said, lunging forward as she started slashing at the knights from afar, remaining at a safe distance while a number of knights was shredded to pieces by her rapier. It was infuriating how she could keep attacking with impunity due to her weapon&#39;s length. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

<strong>Grenades.</strong> 

The location of Brandin&#39;s Dolorous Gard had more to work with besides its vast size; it had the myriad of factories left behind by Olympia&#39;s denizens, offering a host of modern age weaponry to use at their disposal. If a cursed bullet from Brandin was terrifying, it would be disastrous to see what else Saber could use. 

However, these thoughts were for later, as judging by the falling explosives, there&#39;s wasn&#39;t much time to ponder such things. Should the servant&#39;s shield their masters? Who knows what sort of advantage that might provide the Knights; not to mention, what other weaponry they might have in store...

&quot;<strong>RAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</strong>&quot;

The Grenades stop in their descent, almost lazily floating in place as the rest of the party is forced to watch, until they suddenly fling themselves back into the score of Knights surrounding them, blowing several back and even blowing small holes into the walls of Dolorous Gard. 

&quot;It would be an honor to fight alongside you for once, Temple Guardian.&quot;</span>

Brandin then took one of the motorcycles from a Copper Knight and started to drive towards the parked ship in the distance.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the effects of Brandin&#39;s curse started to fade out, the young girl found herself closer than ever to her limits.

Managing a few million bugs, injecting precise actions into their brains, sorting through the images and sounds they provided, discarding anything unnecessary while keeping the more important details afloat—the bug army required her to stay alert <em>at all times</em>. 

In addition to her ferocious ride with Guan Yu, effortlessly slashing through mobs of Copper Knights, jerking his body through the quick and powerful strikes he delivered, swiftly galloping through streets and walls alike—keeping up with that was nigh impossible, even for the fittest of humans. And Laura wasn&#39;t the fittest of humans.

As Red Hare&#39;s crazy run dropped to a crawl and the adrenaline rush subsided, the young girl found herself gasping for breath, chest rising up and down while her lungs struggled to provide enough oxygen for her exhausted body.

Soon came Rider, carrying her Master much like Guan Yu had carried her. Seems like they had no problems getting this far, mostly thanks to the ... huge ship that had lodged itself deep within Olympia&#39;s soil? <em>Just how powerful had Rider gotten, exactly?</em>

&quot;You guys are late,&quot; She panted, her weak words amplified by that of the swarm. &quot;You failed to be punctual ... today of all days ...&quot;

In true Laura fashion, she still managed to be unnecessary abrasive even at the most inopportune of moments. 

Team Rider&#39;s situation was sorted ... kinda. They were unscathed and ready for battle, which helped diffuse some of the tension within Laura&#39;s brain.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With that settled, her mind naturally jumped onto the next crisis—that of Jampo&#39;s situation. He had been away for a few minutes now,  and he hadn&#39;t crushed the bug she had entrusted him with thus far. On one hand, it meant that he was probably okay ... On the other, it meant that Laura was in the dark regarding his situation, and there were few things she hated more than being in the dark.

Cutting her train of thoughts short, a deafening war cry erupted on the battlefield. Not quite soothing by itself, but one that still managed to bring a sense of relief to the young girl. 

<em>Jampo had returned.</em>

&quot;Something something, impeccable timing ...?&quot; The girl echoed their previous discussion, barely managing a smirk without her face twitching in exhaustion.

She wished she could&#39;ve said more, but the urgency of the situation required her to be brief. Seems like Brandin&#39;s Black Knight was still wreaking havoc within Shangri-La, tearing out metal coating and cannons-alike in his frenzy. Well, at least he wasn&#39;t concerned with them for now.

&quot;Brandin&#39;s heading towards Shangri-La,&quot; The girl repeated the intel her insects relayed, greatly enhancing the volume of her voice with the swarm so as to be heard by everyone present. &quot;... and it seems like he ordered eight of his Copper Knights to head onto Dolorous Gard, too.&quot;

As she spoke those words, Guan Yu would hear something else through their link.

<em>&quot;I know I previously told you to put me down farther from Dolorous Gard,&quot;</em> Hesitation tainted her words, a feeling so unlike the Laura he had come to know. <em>&quot;... but I&#39;ve changed my mind. I&#39;ll fight with everyone else there ...&quot;</em>

Her grip tightened on his arm.

<em>&quot;So please, carry me for a bit. I just need to rest a little more...&quot;</em></span>

&quot;I may not have been the best tactician in the Three Kingdoms, but I still possess enough to understand the battlefield, Rider!&quot; Guan Yu spoke loudly as he rode out to aid her with the surrounding knights. &quot;By all means, claim first the knight! Just make sure you&#39;re still breathing to be able to take the last one as well!&quot; A smirk was shot her way before he rode to continue their onslaught.

The two were a force to be reckoned with. Two titans from vastly different eras against a horde of knights. Both of them were accustomed to fighting when the odds were against them, but now they both had a dependent Master to count on this time around! 

Things seem to have been going well. That was until they became bombarded by a shower of egg-shaped objects. Whatever they were, if the copper knights were using them then they can&#39;t be good. There was so many of them as well. Perhaps he could escape using Red Hare, but what of Rider?..

Dread drifted over him. It seemed that they we-

They stopped. 

The objects floated in mid-air before being launched back towards the knights. That voice and that use of Magecraft... There was only one person he knew that it could be.

A grin came from Guan Yu as he realized who joined them. &quot;Jampo. It is good to see a warrior-monk like yourself still has some fight left in him!&quot; Guan Yu let a thunderous laughter out at the sight of a new ally before them. &quot;I seen your skills firsthand. You do yourself a dishonour, Jampo. You lasted longer against me than most in this grail war could say! I am glad to have an ally of your stature by our side.&quot;

The soft words that came from the link his Master and him shared stopped him in his tracks for a moment. Hesitation flowed along with her words. Despite that, she wanted to stay. <em>&quot;Spoken like a true warrior, Miss Hess. Rest as much as you wish. I got you.&quot;</em> Time and time again she has proved to him that he made the right choice choosing her.

The tides were tipping in their favour. The grin on his face showed an immense amount of confidence. Together they just might be able to end the Saber&#39;s tyranny after all!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Barely a month ago, Kun Wu would have objected vehemently to being carried like a baby. He was no baby. He was a distinguished performer and self-proclaimed, genius Fengshui master who commanded Servants as easily as breathing! Rider had been out of line, not only stealing his show, but also stealing his dignity as a Master in front of his fans.

But now he knew better.

The bond between them, an emotional bond, a <em>physical</em> bond, continued to exist. Molded in compassion, forged in trust, and bounded in love. Not just a Master and Servant. <em>Beyond</em> a Master and Servant. They were each other&#39;s armor. They became each other&#39;s lance, sword and shield. 

This was always meant to be a dance for two.

&#39;How can I possibly complain about the ride? Millions wish they could be in my shoes.&#39; He relaxed into Rider&#39;s bridal carry, letting the woman extricate them both from the confines of the ship. Meanwhile, he took the opportunity to tease his ride. 

&#39;Even in heels, your speed far outpaces mine. It&#39;d be a waste <em>not</em> to rely on this fine pair of legs of yours.&#39; He said smugly.

With Rider navigating the streets for them both, Kun Wu was given plenty of time to observe, and think. As they neared the front gate, the insect clusters had grown so thick and the shadows cast on the ground so dense, that what should&#39;ve been the middle of the day felt more like dusk.

&#39;Yes. Ten minutes late. I know! Forgive me for not knowing how to drive a ship on land.&#39; Kun Wu said with a grimace. Oh of all days to be nitpicky about <em>time</em>...

He sighed, then pulled himself together with a smile.

&#39;And that&#39;ll be one thousand push-ups and ten laps around Dolorous Gard, to be completed by the end of today. How does that sound?&#39; He delivered his own verdict with both hands raised to placate the informant. &#39;But enough of that for now. I wasn&#39;t aware that we would be getting even more reinforcements.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His eyes flitted to Jampo. At first glance, the old monk&#39;s emaciated frame did not elicit much confidence in him. But Kun Wu knew better than to judge a book by its cover. After all, had that not been what he had been subjected to throughout his whole life? His disillusioned past. His turbulent career. Even the City Grail War. Even Rider, at one point in time.

But that was just dandy, wasn&#39;t it? Kun Wu loved surprises. He, for one, had always sought to incorporate as many twists and turns in his performances as possible. To think that Laura would have another trump card hidden so deep within Dolorous Gard&#39;s enclaves...

&#39;<strong>Very well!</strong>&#39; The youth laughed. He raised his dominant hand to his chest and greeted Jampo in a traditional monk&#39;s bow, courtesy of his attire and the smooth, shiny head that reminded him of his old masters. &#39;The more guests we have, the more merriment to pass around! A show is not complete without an audience. And today, I am blessed with an ensemble that I could only <em>dream</em> of.&#39;

There was a soft <em>zing!</em> as Kun Wu unsheathed his iron fan with a flourish. His hand felt sufficiently warm under his leather gloves. The artificial circuits embedded in them had been receiving a heck of a workout since Rider had unloaded her cannons, but this simply meant that he could wield the fan with double the nimbleness as before!

<em><strong>snap!</strong></em>

Kun Wu unfurled his fan with a flick of the wrist. He guided himself forward with self-assured steps, following the path that Rider and Guan Yu had carved out of the Copper Knights.

&#39;Though we are still far from New Year&#39;s, honorary warriors of past and present alike, please allow me to impart you with a special tale befitting of this grand occasion.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The iron fan flowed as Kun Wu&#39;s performance commenced. With fluid movements he weaved the fan around himself, causing its blade to sing as it propelled itself through the air. The fabled Chinese warriors had paved a path for him; it was the least he could do to reciprocate. 

He opened his mouth, and began his chant.

<strong>&#39;A long, long time ago, not in a land before time, but a time before land, the universe was nothing but a single, egg-shaped entity. Inside the egg was nothing but chaos, where the forces of Yin and Yang collided with each other in an unending war.&#39;</strong>

<strong>&#39;It was within this egg of chaos that a giant was conceived...&#39;</strong>

Words flowed effortlessly from his lips and with it, a small fire sparked into life. With each utterance of his tale, more mana sapped out of him and packed itself into the fire. Feeding it, coaxing it, transforming it from a kindling flame to a roaring ball of fire in a few intakes of breath. 

Just like how Rider had greatly expanded her repertoire with her new bond, Kun Wu had received the blessing of his queen as well: thanks to Ching Shih&#39;s skill, <strong>Pirate Gentlewoman</strong>, his magecraft had strengthened as well, allowing him to drastically shorten the time it took to craft his flame familiars. 

With a broad swing of his fan, the ball of fire burst open like an egg. A magnificent bird stretched its wings, nearly five meters across, and greeted the world with a loud <em><strong>screech</strong></em>! Bathed in fire, its body radiated a gentle warmth and shone with a deep crimson that was reminiscent of certain mythological creature...

&#39;Say hello to the Vermilion Bird!&#39;

Kun Wu put his fingers to his mouth and gave a shrill whistle. With another flick of his fan, the puppeted bird &#39;responded&#39; to his whistle and took off in the direction of the Copper Knights. It was going to body slam them with its sheer bulk alone!

...Or so Kun Wu had planned at first.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A new shadow fell over them, growing in size until Kun Wu recognized the shape to be none other than a cannon that had once belonged to their illegally parked Shangri-La. The Black Knight hadn&#39;t pursued them after all; it had rather deemed their ship as the ultimate threat, and was currently hard at work demolishing it from the inside out.

Such insolence!

Kun Wu pulled his fan upwards, rerouting his familiar&#39;s trajectory and redirecting it into the sky. A gale of strong wind sent dust flying to the height of his shoulder. With a surge of strength, the Vermilion Bird took off towards the stray cannon like a fierce missile-

<em><strong>CRASH!!!</strong></em>

-and rammed into it head on, sacrificing both its bulk and momentum to knock it ever so slightly off course. The cannon tore through a chunk of its body, but landed a safe distance away from the allied Masters and Servants. 

&#39;Looks like this trespasser is rather fond of our ship.&#39; Kun Wu informed Ching Shih in between verses of his storytelling, feeling his mana starting to dwindle once again as he used more to repair the gaping hole in his familiar&#39;s body. A one-for-one was not ideal. The Black Knight had the advantage of both height and a convenient source of projectiles. Either they matched it in shields, <strong>or...</strong>

The solution had always been so <em>simple</em>.

&#39;Yes, I get it! It&#39;s a magnificent ship. But can&#39;t you do something about that? Shangri-La was built to last, wasn&#39;t it?&#39; He decided to cut to the chase and question Rider.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The slaughter commenced as Ching started to cull the knights&#39; numbers with her swift swordsmanship. Attacking with impunity was her speciality, and combined with Lancer&#39;s combat prowess, these knights stood no chance.

Of course, Saber knew that his summons were fodder. So, he would use them as fodder. The knights revealed grenades in their hands, ready to blow themselves up if it would harm their enemies. Ching&#39;s eyes widened as she realized their plan, her lips motioning to move as she attempted to warn Lancer before it was too late.

But her ears reacted first, listening in to Kun Wu&#39;s tale. The boy had started narrating, causing her lips to curl into a smile instead as she realized that everything would be fine. A flaming bird soared from the ground, about to collide with the Copper Knights...before the ominous shadow of a cannon started to encroach upon them.

&quot;That piece of rotten steel is still tearing my ship apart?!&quot; Ching exclaimed in rage and frustration. Her Master was quick to improvise, instead dedicating his bird&#39;s life to colliding with the cannon. The destroyed weapon landed on the ground, but the grenades were still-

A man emerged, using what appeared to be exotic Magecraft to slow down the projectiles and render them harmless. Ching was surprised. Did they have another capable ally among them? She turned towards her savior and saw...

Bald. <em>Bald</em>. Three hairs.

...

&quot;I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t see him.&quot; She whispered to herself, quickly turning away as she focused on Kun Wu instead.

&quot;I know. It&#39;s infuriating. I can feel Saber&#39;s black knight tearing at my ship from here.&quot; Ching ground her teeth in disgust. &quot;Normally, my Voyager of the Storm would suffice to protect Shangri-La, but I&#39;ve reduced its potency and dedicated myself fully to offense.&quot;

After she replied to her Master, she finally noticed the disturbing glint in his eyes. A hungry gaze that went beyond greed and lust.</span>

&#39;I merely wanted to gauge our enemy&#39;s strength. Had the Black Knight been able to demolish your ship at its finest, then I would have been truly worried. It&#39;s good to know that you only relocated your resources, but...&#39;

He snapped his fan closed against his palm, and pressed on with a more serious look.

&#39;Can&#39;t we have both?&#39; He suggested firmly, despite Rider&#39;s concerns. &#39;It pains me to see your treasure get robbed under broad daylight.&#39;</span>

&quot;...I wish I could slam your head right now.&quot; Rider blushed in embarrassment at his praise. Pirates were never known to be eloquent or sophisticated, so Kun Wu&#39;s compliments were actually quite hard for her to avoid. Especially when he was always 100% sincere.

&quot;But no. This is as far as we go. Your circuits are sublime, milord, but there is simply not enough mana to go around for me to use all of my capabilities.&quot; Ching said with a frown, believing to have reached her limit.

&quot;Shangri-La can serve as a distraction, at the very least. I&#39;d rather keep you safe than protect my treasures.&quot; She placed a hand on his shoulder.</span>

To think that her Master would openly flirt with her on the battlefield...

&#39;...Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve forgotten about all the money you withdrew from my account and all the valuables you confiscated from my suite. If I&#39;m not mistaken, they are still stashed away in Shangri-La&#39;s vault.&#39; His eyes narrowed into slits.

<em><strong>Oh.</strong></em>

...

&#39;So! Be a good Servant and put up Shangri-La&#39;s defenses for me, hmm? If those riches of mine goes, so does your strength. How can you protect yourself, let alone me, from Saber then? You can say that our fates are tied to the same thread.&#39; Kun Wu started wagging his non-existent tail as he assaulted Rider with words of immense wisdom. 

&#39;But that&#39;s not to say your praise went unheard.&#39; Kun Wu dug around his waist sash and withdrew a small packet. &#39;You are correct. My circuits are top tier. It&#39;s more than capable of funneling all the mana you&#39;ll ever need without breaking down.&#39; 

He smiled a wolfish grin, then tore open the packet and revealed a single mana battery. The same brand that Rider had used to ingest in absurd quantities. 

&#39;All I need is to keep myself topped up. Easy.&#39; 

He popped the pill into his mouth and swallowed it dry. 

His smile froze.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s tight squeeze and honeyed tongue were enough to make Ching Shih&#39;s legs falter. She was tempted to fall for him again right there and now, until he unleashed his old habits again.

&quot;...<em>Our</em> account. It&#39;s ours. I was merely borrowing.&quot; She said with a raised eyebrow, wrapping a finger around Kun Wu&#39;s ring finger.

&quot;Unless you would rather make it official?&quot; She said with a smirk, much to Kun Wu&#39;s surprise. It seemed as if his own Servant had learned a trick or two from him...

It would have been effective, had Kun Wu not revealed his ace in the hole: A mana battery hidden in one of his many packets. Rider&#39;s expression went from smug to worried in a second.

&quot;Wait! You can&#39;t be-&quot;

Too late. He swallowed it immediately, not even needing sugar or water to make the ride less annoying. Kun Wu laughed for a second, before he felt the immense surge of mana course through his body and circuits. It was akin to being thrown inside of a washing machine and a microwave at the same time. Raw energy seeped out from his skin as his stomach felt sick.

&quot;Milord. Milord! Are you fine? Speak to me!&quot; Ching shouted out loud, albeit her sounds were dwarfed by the battle ensuing around them. She let Kun Wu sit on her lap as she held his back with her arm.

He was very much still alive. Ching Shih knew that immediately, since she had felt her mana reserves sky rocket. But was it worth seeing her Master pass out in front of her?

She didn&#39;t even have time to grieve, since the howls of the Black Knight tearing the Shangri-La apart could be heard even from there. It drove her into a frenzy. <em>&quot;If that piece of shit didn&#39;t exist, then-&quot;</em></span>

She vented out her rage. Saber felt a disturbance in the force as he watched the ship be impervious to the Black Knight&#39;s attacks. What took a single punch to destroy now suddenly took six. It would be too time consuming to blow the ship to pieces with these newfound defenses, especially since the cannons were now turning around and taking aim.

&quot;Burn in hell, you bastards!&quot; Ching growled, all remaining cannons firing. A volley of shots aimed at the Copper Knights that were currently engaging Jampo and Lancer. The remaining shots were directed to the Black Knight, clearly as an act of payback towards him.

This concussion was painful, but refreshing: Fighting Rider themselves would also lead to no avail, due to the presence of Lancer and Jampo. The only solution was to cut off Rider&#39;s mana supply.

And what would that be? <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Battle was insurmountable for the Knights, even with the onset of 21st Century technology. Pieces of the Knights flew back, their bodies slashed and dented by the awesome might of this small militia. They had been able to withstand an onslaught from Lancer of Olympia, but with two Servants and a Trio of mages, one of which being a former master of theirs, the battle seemed much more daunting for Brandin. 

Guan Yu&#39;s strikes act as smears of violence that lift several of the Knights into the air, all while Kun Wu&#39;s quick thinking turned the Black Knight&#39;s rampage against them, sending molten steel to crash into several, taking another two out of commission while leaving the rest to scramble for new leverage. Several returned to the weapons of their homeland, blades sliding from their sheaths as the Knights attempt to break through the whirlwind slashes from Guan Yu&#39;s Guando, one managing to snake their way through to plunge their sword into Rider&#39;s back, holes from her Madame&#39;s Rose still punched into its armor to lead to a form of vengeance...

Rocks fly around the group, working to push back any stragglers and position several more of the Knights to fall into Guan Yu&#39;s trajectory, both working in tandem as the Monk works to his word and tries to protect the group as much as possible. As he hears Rider&#39;s vengeful barking, a glance to the sky would reveal the true dangers of messing with one&#39;s beloved...

&quot;Hmmm...Lancer, up there. Rider is gracing us with a show.&quot; He says, smiling softly before thinking a little longer on the situation...

&quot;...That may need to be taken care of,&quot; he says, the rocks falling by his side before his body flourishes in light once more as several Knights begin floating in the air. The strain on Jampo&#39;s face was notable, his eyes shut tight as his teeth grimace in exertion while 2...3...5 Knights rise, tumbling about themselves while moving into position. The volley closes in, with Jampo&#39;s breathing starting to labor as the might of Shangri La punches into the figures, their bodies acting as a shield from the explosive power behind Rider&#39;s retaliation. Heat kicks around the party as Jampo shakes violently, the pressure of holding up this makeshift shield wearing on him greatly against such impressive might. He thinks to himself that Saber and he might not have gotten this far had they met Ching Shi earlier...</span>

The volley ends, punctuated by the clatter of half melted automatons slamming into the ground around them, Jampo himself breathing laboriously as he tries to compose himself. Guan Yu might find this suspicious; was it the nature of Saber&#39;s torture? Either way, it was a far cry from the powerhouse they had met in the first few days of this Grail War. The monk attempts a brave face, however, grinning broadly and making a peace sign to the group...before a bullet lodges itself in his shoulder. His eyes bulge before he simply slumps in on himself, the monk&#39;s hand squeezing on his wound while systematically pressuring himself to act once more as another shot attempts to catch Kun Wu&#39;s prone body, Jampo&#39;s Qi managing to catch it mere inches from the boy&#39;s neck. 

Atop the tower, the Knights that remained had pulled out hunting rifles, aiming to catch the group as they tried to catch their breath...what&#39;s more, the bodies Jampo had used to shield from the blast slowly rose back to their feet. Their limbs were melted and their bodies bent at odd angles, but the increased power of Brandin&#39;s might made the force much more tenacious. In that entire showcase they had just put on, only 3 Knights managed to be destroyed...

&quot;Grk...it seems...we have an ace in the hole...<em>gasp</em>An excellent show, Rider...but your Master perhaps needs a bit more discipline...&quot; Jampo says, turning to the boy in Rider&#39;s lap, the mana battery overcharging the boy. Even if such an act was reckless, the monk can&#39;t help but smile as he holds a hand above the boy&#39;s head. &quot;...Now, what could make someone so young attempt something quite so foolhardy? Who&#39;s to say, hihihijii...but, it has given us a small window. The Black Knight must have its attention redirected, and I can only imagine Brandin having a veritable fit at the thought of working any harder than he feels he has to. Your Master needs but a moment, Rider, but in the meantime I can attempt to assuage him. I just need a bit of time...and cover,&quot; the monk says before he throws a punch behind him, catching a Knight crawling on its arms and flattening its helmet, the force knocking it back against the walls of the castle. 

&quot;His body is coping with immense amounts of pure mana...it won&#39;t kill him, but it can have lasting consequences if not tended to. It needs to be tempered with natural mana...I can gift the boy some of my own Qi, but I need your permission first.&quot;</span>

&quot;Well this is a surprise. I didn&#39;t expect you to grow enough of a spine to actually do something Jampo. I wonder how long you&#39;ll be able to keep yourself in check until you start killing bystanders. Months? Days? Minutes?&quot;

Brandin then looked towards Rider and Kun Wu.

&quot;You two are new, I suppose you&#39;re responsible for that eyesore on my property. No need to introduce yourselves, you&#39;ll be dead momentarily.&quot;

<em>CRASH</em>

The ground shook as the Black Knight jumped from the ship and landed behind the group, having changed targets from the ship itself to the intruders.

&quot;Now...which one of you should I kill first?&quot;

Brandin pondered and hummed to himself for a moment, his eyes glanced over to Jampo.

&quot;Hmmmmm...you.&quot;

Brandin pointed at Kun Wu. Immediately a powerful bolt of malefic cursed energy descended from the sky on top of Kun Wu. A far more concentrated and deadly form of the miasma that Laura and Lancer felt earlier. At the same time, the Black Knight charged again at the group, powerful swings descending upon them.  <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

The fields of war truly are a blessed thing.&quot; This man truly has a twisted way of viewing these things. 

Jampo&#39;s projectiles placed more knights onto the War God&#39;s path of conquest. For their first battle together, their teamwork was top-notch! Guan Yu swung side to side effortlessly to strike at as many knights as he could. Despite having only the one arm available, the weapon might as well be weightless with how dexterous the man was with his weapon. 

The cannon that would&#39;ve slammed right on top of them was taken care of through the combined efforts of Rider&#39;s side and Jampo thankfully. There wasn&#39;t much he couldn&#39;t have done to it unless it got within his reach, but then it would have been too late. 

Guan Yu felt his heart drop once he caught the sight of Kun Wu falling over in the corner of his eye. Did a weapon find its way and strike him down? No wounds were visible on him which brought a wave of relief to him. But what happened? 

Regardless of what happened to him, the end result was the same. Rider lashed out in rage and fired off more of her cannons towards the knights.

&quot;And a terrifying show it is. Let&#39;s work hard not to earn her wrath ourselves, Jampo. I have been on the receiving end of a <em>calm</em> Rider. I am not one to seek how it must be to be the receiving end of <em>that</em>!&quot; He said with a grin.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The grin slowly faded however once he examined Jampo a little closer. Something as simple as that should have been nothing for him and yet he was winded and recovering. He gritted his teeth as he tried not to let rage build inside of him. It wasn&#39;t outlandish to imagine Saber would do such a thing. But, the fact that Saber would disgrace a warrior by bringing him down through torture remained though. More reason to bring Saber down.

Speak of the devil and he has come. The roars of the motorcycles alerted them to Saber&#39;s arrival. 

&quot;Saber...&quot; He spoke through gritted teeth. Saber didn&#39;t charge alone either. Besides the entourage of knights, the dreadful presence of the Black Knight also befell the group. 

Soon they both struck the group in unison. Guan Yu quickly intercepted Black Knight&#39;s path and clashed against them. His mighty blade created sparks with each clash they had. &quot;I will keep this beast busy!&quot; Guan Yu shouted to the group. Hopefully, Red Hare&#39;s mobility would be enough to keep Black Knight at bay as they did their hit-and-run tactics.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The effect of the mana battery was instantaneous. It filled him up in a span of seconds, providing Rider with a fresh burst of energy that allowed her to gain access to her Noble Phantasm once again. Meanwhile, raw mana continued to flood his body from the half-digested mana battery, nourishing his parched circuits like water in a desert...

...If only that were the case.

Kun Wu&#39;s eyes fluttered open. The youth awoke to convulsive spasms that contorted his usually happy-go-lucky expression with pain. Cold sweat lined his back, and his guts churned and cramped as they absorbed the rest of the pill-shaped battery. His nerves were on fire, and his ears. Heavens, his ears, his <em>brains</em>, they were full to bursting with chatter, noise, and even <em>more</em> chatter, while the sound of metal clashing and clanking in the background made his head throb as if it was going to burst open. 

&#39;...&#39; His lips moved, and he muttered something inaudible to Rider and Jampo&#39;s ears. Shakily, he gripped Rider&#39;s arm, wrinkling her sleeve with a strength that almost tore the fabric at the seams-

&#39;-t up. I said, <strong>SHUT THE HELL UP!!!</strong>&#39;

He yelled at Rider and Jampo, startling both Servant and monk before his stomach churned again. He quickly pressed a hand to his mouth as he fell forward, eyes wide, face green, and throat constricted. His shoulders shook, and Rider and Jampo suddenly had a bad, <em>bad</em> premonition about what was going to happen-

<em><strong>&#39;BLEEGGGHHHHH-&#39;</strong></em>

Indescribable terror seized the battlefield as rainbowlike sparkles, too beautiful for words, threatened to end the lives of Kun Wu&#39;s helpers. Thankfully, both of them were quite quick on their feet; hopefully, they would get themselves out of harm&#39;s way in time.

Meanwhile, Kun Wu wiped his mouth on his coat, which he was already halfway through shrugging off. It seemed that he had become quite proficient at dealing with puke-stained clothes.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;I&#39;m. Not. Dead!&#39; He gasped, feeling his guts calm down after completely emptying himself of his breakfast. The residues from the mana battery continued to ravage his circuits, but it wouldn&#39;t be long until the effects subsided. Of course, the feeling was still extremely unpleasant: despite having superb circuits, ingesting such a large amount of raw, unconverted mana was akin to ingesting energy drinks by the barrel. He was a bona fide human. His body simply wasn&#39;t made to be put through the rigor of mana batteries like a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. 

But, well, the effect was quite astounding, if he had to say so himself.

&#39;Have you-have you never experienced motion sickness yourselves?&#39; He asked Rider and Jampo while a small vein popped on his forehead. &#39;The <em>last</em> thing you want to do is hold a conference next to my ears.&#39; 

Perhaps it was due to the discomfort, but Kun Wu sounded slightly on edge. He wiped sweat from his face, then interrogated them further.

&#39;Why are you all over me like I&#39;m dead? Rider, why aren&#39;t you commanding your ship? I have given you plenty of mana to do so. What happened while I was taking care of some personal affairs?&#39; He put on a stern voice as he questioned questioned Rider. Did he not remember her firing the cannons? It seemed like he had completely blacked out for a moment. &#39;If you have the time to waste, waste it on the knights.&#39; 

He turned to Jampo next.

&#39;Honorable guest, your skill with your mana is sublime, and your trick of juggling the grenades is an eye-opener even for a seasoned performer like me. But why did you stop? Surely our audience deserves much more attention than myself.&#39; 

Kun Wu clenched his fists intermittently as he spoke, as if to battle the receding waves of nausea in the pit of his stomach. His face still took on a green sheen, but he was able to hold himself quite well. As expected from a disciplined performer!

Unfortunately, the good times did not last long.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The motorcycle brigade pulled up in front of the group, carrying not only more knights, but Brandin and his champion fighter, the Black Knight as well. The whole army had practically assembled itself right this moment; would it be quicker if they felled the knights, or should they go straight after the lord of Dolorous Gard?

But Saber wouldn&#39;t make it so easy.

Kun Wu locked eyes with the formidable Servant - which was saying something, because it meant that Saber was currently looking his way as well. And when an enemy Servant looked his - a <em>Master&#39;s</em> - way, it usually spelled something dreadful for him. 

He took a defensive stance, but Brandin was one step ahead. Rather than going after him himself, Saber simply decided to transfer his curse. A cloud of malicious energy engulfed Kun Wu from head to toe, and the youth felt as if he had just taken a second douse of mana batteries and was battling the symptoms yet again. 

His carefully crafted expression contorted into a grimace. Unable to brace himself in time, he broke his act and fell - not to his knees, mind you, because doing so would be insulting, and humiliating - back onto his butt. He struggled for a moment to keep his composure.

&#39;I am so terribly sorry, but I already ran out of things to puke up. You won&#39;t get much entertainment value out of me!&#39; He said to Brandin in between breathes. But then he gestured to Rider and introduced her with a lazy swing of his arm. &#39;You&#39;ll have to make do with my Servant, I&#39;m afraid! Though...&#39; He pulled his lips into a grin. &#39;I think she&#39;s got a special performance ready just for you!&#39;

<em>Take him down. Quickly.</em>

Rider heard her Master through their shared link. Kun Wu didn&#39;t sound like he was kidding around. Brandin&#39;s curse must&#39;ve felt more potent than he had let on.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite her wisdom and cunning, Ching Shih was quite wary of Kun Wu&#39;s words. No matter how immature or childish he seemed, he always managed to find a way to toy with her with words alone. That talent was something she feared, yet something she respected and eventually, grew to love.

But she never once saw him be legitimately <em>angry.</em>

He was puking his guts out on the ground, yet all Ching could focus on was his irritable rage.

<em>&quot;Milord, are you alright? Do you need me to-&quot;</em> Rider immediately sent him a telepathic message, but received only garbled thoughts as a reply. Kun Wu was far too exhausted to send an answer, since his body was feeling the aftereffects of mana overdose.

Once he regained his composure after a painful puking session, he directed his frustration towards Rider. It felt like a stab to the heart, but Ching held strong. Surely her Master wasn&#39;t actually angry at her, right?

Before she could get a confirmation, several motorbikes approached them. Saber finally revealed himself, making his entrance with a pompous and arrogant attitude. He wasted no time in targeting Rider and Kun Wu first, the biggest threats to his Noble Phantasm.

&quot;Saber. Rest assured, the feeling is mutual. I care not for your name, but I shall have you sleeping with the fishes soon.&quot; Rider regained her composure once her true target had shown themselves. She would have no mercy.

Just like she had predicted, Saber struck back at her. He fired some sort of projectile with an evil aroma attached to it. Some type of curse, perhaps? Knowing that, she was prepared to dodge with her superior speed...until she realized the target wasn&#39;t her.</span>

Her mind fell into disarray once she saw Kun Wu be affected by the curse. He started convulsing again, his nimble body being subject to abject pain and horrors. Even when he landed inelegantly on purpose and taunted Saber with his usual, cheeky demeanor, Rider could sense all manners of pain from his thoughts.

Her eyes turned back to Saber, and they were filled with rage.

&quot;Curse of Shui Gui.&quot; She didn&#39;t even waste a single breath. She raised her arms as a chain manifested around her and launched itself towards Saber. Brandin would be shocked, as the chain wrapped itself around him and sent him flying. Were he to turn to his side, he would notice an anchor flying upwards. Ching had launched him to the skies.

&quot;Shangri-La. Fire all cannons.&quot; Rider motioned with her arms, as a flurry of cannonballs, missiles and other projectiles starting raining down the street. Several Copper Knights were caught in the crossfire, but make no mistake. There was a singular target: Brandin.

He had royally pissed her off.

&quot;Scream all you like, Saber. I&#39;ll rid the world, no, <em>the Throne</em> of your repulsive existence!&quot; Ching Shih snarled, a beast in human clothing, acting like the formidable pirate queen that tortured her own men for sport. The only difference being that she wasn&#39;t doing it out of pleasure, but out of pain. She could never bear to see Kun Wu suffer like that.</span>

However, Brandin was still inside the Gard, meaning that his strength was beyond what most would expect. Despite that, he felt completely trapped by his chains. Shui Gui&#39;s strength increased depending on whether the target matched a certain criteria. In this case, Brandin was a perfect target, due to him being a male Servant with an existing history of hoarding riches and territory. Truly, there was no worse match for him there. Could he survive the onslaught of cannon fire long enough for someone to deal with Kun Wu and Rider?

Meanwhile, Jampo realized that Kun Wu was under even more dire predicaments. Rider was currently confronting Brandin and Guan Yu was preoccupied with the Black Knight. Only he could save the boy, if he so chose. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

&quot;Brandin...&quot; Jampo whispers, his chest welling with a radiant heat as rage coalesced. He pushed the feeling down, keeping his Qi in check while staring down his former Servant. No matter how angry he became, Ashura had to wait...

<em>Steady, your time will come.</em> Jampo whispers to himself before looking down to Kun Wu. His body was being ravaged by the curse of Dolorous Gard, it&#39;s miasma of corruption infusing itself with his magic circuits and sending the boy into spasms of pain. He knows the dark feeling that swirls within the boy all too well, and while there wasn&#39;t much of a desire to revisit that feeling, he had to...for the sake of this boy. 

&quot;I suppose it&#39;s better to grow a backbone yourself than to rest on a throne made of them, Brandin. I&#39;ve tried to appeal to your better nature, to have you ascend past this horrible failure you hold deep within...but I suppose it&#39;s far too late. Your own insecurity has infected the farthest reaches of your mind...so, in order to save you...<strong>you&#39;ll have to die.</strong> The Throne shall hold you until your next rebirth...I made a promise to one that they would end you, but then again, I agree with the God of War. You might have your hands full with the Pirate Queen.&quot; Jampo taunts, watching as Ching Shi&#39;s full wrath descends on Brandin&#39;s cavalry, the woman&#39;s fury matched brilliantly by the strength on display. Of course, that strength was coming at a cost...</span>

&quot;Boy, that was a mesmerizing story...allow me to return the favor...&quot; 

He turns back, noting that Guan Yu held the Black Knight at bay while Rider placed her full concentration on Brandin. That left the Knights to hound them, something he couldn&#39;t afford...

&quot;Laura, I know you are recovering...but I need you now. Keep the Knights at bay while i...tell a story.&quot; 

With that, Jampo places his palm across Kun Wu&#39;s forehead, feeling the fever waft from his body as it tries to fight back against the foreign curse. It was strange just how much like disease western magecraft built itself upon. All of it wasteful, destructive...

&quot;Boy, there is a tale I wish to impart on you. It is about light and darkness...&quot; he begins, his own breathing slowing as his body glows, a blue light pulsing from his own core and slowly traveling the length of his limbs, bathing Kun Wu&#39;s forehead in a warm light that made the miasma curl as if in fright. 

&quot;Much like your own tale, an egg did fashion our universe...all that was creation housed itself within, safe beyond the void that swirled outside. Chaos contained itself within, unruly and untethered by the vast ocean of stars outside. And while a giant did slumber inside, it did not break itself out. The ensuing battle within broke its shell...and void was able to slip inside. Darkness found a way inside of the blinding light held within...&quot; 

Kun Wu&#39;s entire body slowly began to glow brightly, while Jampo&#39;s slowly began to wreathe itself in the coils of Dolorous Gard&#39;s curse, the monk grimacing as the pain infested his limbs and bones.</span>

&quot;The giant found itself caught within a crossfire...for it only was birthed thanks to the clash of Chaos and Order. It came to realize that it was part of each, a product of a long, never ending battle.

&quot;It engaged in both parts...it sought to create what it loved, but destroy what it hated. In time, these concepts became foreign...it simply built and broke what it saw fit, unknowing of how it attached itself. This is a natural law of our world, an inheritance. Divine purpose, built on the endless cycle...&quot; 

His own body began to dim as he mingled his own Qi with Kun Wu&#39;s, his breathing turning ragged and hoarse as he exchanged his gift with the boy&#39;s curse. It took root in his core, hollowing his chest, draining his mind. Despair and regret flooded into his thoughts, but through it all, he was determined to bring the boy back from the brink. No one would have to suffer from Brandin&#39;s darkness...never again.

&quot;We were born in an endless cycle...and so we continue living through each. Our Origins determine to keep us on our paths...but we have the strength to escape. The giant eventually learned of its place, and sought not to fight against itself, but to accept its nature. Only through this peace was the giant able to pass...this is why we no longer have them in our world. And so too can we follow in our ancestors footsteps...so too can we learn to move on. To root ourselves in love...to forge bonds with enemies...and to forgive our past transgressions. We are chaos and order. But in accepting these things, we can be as giants before us. We can be at peace...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Head is spinning. Strength is oozing out. Brandin&#39;s curse still effective. Was the decision she took in the spur of the moment, that of asking Guan Yu to delve deeper into Dolorous Gard while holding onto her barely alive corpse, really a good idea in retrospect?

Her cognitive abilities gradually dropped. Soon, the eyes she had on the battlefield would close, the ears would shut down too. She could no longer afford to process through that with her remaining amounts of magical energy. A few blister packs were sitting in her backpack—Mana batteries. As the thought of swallowing one came to her mind, Kun Wu had had his convulsions.
 
Taking a Mana battery was a feeling she wasn&#39;t unaware of, having done so not so long ago against the very same Brandin they currently fought. But while she did so after squeezing her magical resources dry, Kun Wu had done so while still retaining some of his. Did the two sources of Magical energy clash inside his body, resulting in adverse effects? Was it an odd reaction caused by Brandin&#39;s curse?

Either way, popping in a pill now would probably create more problems than it solved. She would have to do with what little Mana remained inside her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Of course, taking that decision would&#39;ve been easier if Guan Yu hadn&#39;t charged towards the Black Knight. But then again, this is what he did. He charged head-first into danger, not quite uncaring about his safety but not completely aware of the repercussions either. He did what usually worked for him, and of course—it usually worked.

Ching Shih took on Brandin by herself, using Kun Wu&#39;s sudden Mana burst to unleash her powerful Noble Phantasm. That same Kun Wu was currently stunned, with Jampo acting as the catalyst that would bring him back from his internal struggle.

What did Laura do while everyone else struggled? Not much. One could even argue that she was tipping the balance towards Brandin&#39;s side, being in the way of Guan Yu&#39;s fighting prowess by binding one of his arms.

And yet, Jampo had requested her help in taking care of the Copper Knights while he told his story, a story that managed to raise more questions about him than anything else thus far.

Thanks to Guan Yu&#39;s incredible martial prowess, she was still able to fight. It was now time to repay what his kindness, manyfold.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In answer to the monks words, ominous shadows crept up the battlefield. Quite the unusual sight, considering Olympia&#39;s usually clear sky. With the shadows came buzzing, deafening frequencies creating a chaotic mess of sounds. Much like during their fight with Rider, the swarm&#39;s irritating sounds almost completely drowned any other on the battlefield, the only difference being that it hadn&#39;t been done on purpose now—the sounds were but a natural consequence of the <em>cheer numbers</em> that composed the insect army.

<em><strong>BAM!</strong></em>

A blackened fist made of bugs came crashing from the skies, hitting one of the Chopper Knights right on target. Soon, another fist came. Then came another, and another—the cloud of flying bugs had effectively turned into makeshift arms, compressed enough to slap the knights around with their weight.

Not a bike was spared, all had been hit by the arthropodic fists. For the lucky few that managed to shrug off the initial hit, the fists collapsed back into swarms, pushing their bodies inside the motors in an effort to bring them down once and for all.</span>

The beast&#39;s ragged breathing complimented the growing fury within, his body being pushed back from his targets as the God of War kept him out of sight of the battlefield. The beast had endured much punishment, but likewise, it&#39;s body was showing the brunt of the damage. The Battle seemed insurmountable, but Lancer could see just how powerful Rider&#39;s volley truly was. It roars as it swipes at Guan Yu, attempting to change momentum and claw wildly at Guan Yu&#39;s face. It&#39;s true Master was in danger, and it resolved to do what it can to stop it by any means necessary....

Meanwhile, Ching Shi shows her might once more, raining another volley upon the battlefield. Any knight that managed to flee from the first attack still mobile found themselves not so lucky again, as her power crashed down upon them, breaking them against the cobblestone and putting the fearsome Lord Brandin on his last legs. All around him, he could see the battle changing swiftly.</span>

This damned Rider...first she defaced his Dolorous Gard, and now she very nearly was pushing him onto his backfoot?! This can&#39;t be how things ended...this can&#39;t be how he&#39;s remembered! 

Flaming piles of molten slag begin crawling around them before a wave of Knights finally fall to the immense pressure, any that attempt to push past their injuries being met with a looming shadow over head...

<strong>CRNCH! SLAM!</strong>

Laura, still debilitated and coming on to the end of her rope as well, puts herself into action on a Monk&#39;s behalf, managing to summon her strength to smash the Knights around her. The Swarm slams down on the molten piles, reducing many to a fine paste and easily managing to dispatch of the problem. The volleys from overhead even manage to send the remaining Knights on the vanguard tumbling down below, forcing Brandin to consider a very real possibility: They could end the Curse by defeating his Knights.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">For the first time, Brandin looked genuinely shocked. The chains wrapped tightly around him and flung him into the sky. Rider’s barrage then assaulted him, enveloping Brandin in a massive explosion. However when the smoke cleared, Brandin still remained alive, even though his pristine armor had been damaged and he had been injured.

“No, no, no, no!” Brandin shouted in frustration. The chain that binded him groaned as Brandin struggled against them. “I’ve come too far just to be stopped by some miserable upstarts and toyed with by some pirate wench!”

Brandin began to surge with power as Rider had made a potentially fatal mistake. For the original curse’s purpose was to stop those who would seek an audience with Dolorous Gard’s lord. The reason Brandin had remained on the sidelines, only participating with his curse magic, was that a trial to see the lord made no sense if the lord himself got involved. However, a direct attack on the lord was a different matter. By trying to bypass the trial all together, the Lord of Dolorous Gard would have no choice but to defend his honor with his full might.

<strong>SNAP SNAP SNAP</strong>

The chains that bound Brandin broke through both his top tier magical resistance and his sheer strength. He then shot from the sky towards Rider, a massive explosion kicked up from his impact. Rider would find no rest as Brandin wielded his Copper Sword and brought strikes down upon Rider like comets. His blows were so strong, so fast, so heavy. 

Rider then saw her anchor, still being dragged by Brandin and came to a terrifying realization. Despite being the perfect target for her curse, it was only by that measure alone that she even stood a chance at facing Brandin at this moment.

Meanwhile, Jampo felt Brandin’s curse intensify as if it reacted to the slaughter of the Copper Knights with a will of its own. One that sought to kill all interlopers with extreme prejudice.</span>

Their blows clashing with each pass. When nearly half of the Copper Knights were obliterated, there was a change in its demeanor. It looked towards Guan and started to move towards him.

As Lancer thrust his spear at the Black Knight, it finally found purchase and pierced the beast’s chest plate. Only for the Black Knight to continue advancing, the spear punching out of the Black Knight’s back as it rushed along the shaft with absolute disregard for its own well-being.

A metallic clawed gauntlet dug into Lancer’s side, and with unnatural strength the Black Knight tore Guan Yu off Red Hare and slammed him into the ground. With one arm, the Black Knight held Guan Yu down while the other arm was bringing the axe down on Guan Yu. Intending to end this as quickly as possible. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Even in the throes of defeat, in his final moments, Brandin refuses to let go. As if in desperation, the Master of Dolorous Gard begins thrashing against his opponents, raving against them in an effort to reclaim his power as the Lord of his keep. The Black Knight&#39;s own power surges with the death of each Copper Knight, the finish to this madness threateningly close, but so far...

And Jampo could feel the weight bearing down deep. Brandin&#39;s curse ravages his body, the monk shivering and struggling to rise after taking on Kun Wu&#39;s plight. Such sacrifice...it was all so pointless. &quot;Brandin...you are a dog clinging to rotten scraps...

&quot;<strong>RIDER!</strong>&quot; He shouts, the monk clutching at his chest while lying Kun Wu&#39;s head safely against the ground. The boy might only see this as a slight inconvenience once he comes to...it&#39;s for the best. This battle was no one else&#39;s but his...it always had been from the start. &quot;Your master is safe...hold on to him dearly...and Brandin, your fight isn&#39;t with Rider. It never has been. Not with Guan Yu, not with Uther Pendragon. Not with Lark, or Laura, that boy, or even Olympia...it&#39;s with me. It always was with me.&quot;</span>

The monk walks forward, his brow furrowed and his skin slick with sweat as he fights back against the curse attacking his circuits, eating him from the inside out. His pants betray his words, making him the prime target for Brandin&#39;s resignation and annoyance. If the monk truly wanted to serve himself on a platter, so be it...

&quot;I&#39;ve tried my best to reason with you...I thought patience was key, but you are lost, Brandin. Far too lost. Fear has taken over every facet of your being...you&#39;re living in perpetual failure and cling desperately to anything that will save you from it. But I will not let you forget it...for you haven&#39;t escaped Lancelot. He&#39;s been with you every step of the way.&quot; 

He holds Brandin now in his gaze, his teeth bared as he tries to hold back a fit of coughs, attempting to remain strong. &quot;I will save you, Brandin...I failed you already, and I won&#39;t fail you again. I owe it to those here, and to those in Olympia...and to you. I will end you, Brandin. Just as I promised...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Like their previous fight, the engagement against the Black Knight had Guan Yu relying on Red Hare&#39;s speed to gain the upper hand over the monstrosity. It seemed to have been working for awhile. The slashes and strikes against the armoured automaton were beginning to pile up. If he can keep at it for awhile longer, victory would soon be within his grasp.

However, just like the last fight, Guan Yu made one single mistake and leaned into an attack more than he should have. He wasn&#39;t as fortunate this time as to simply be tossed out of the temple. 

His weapon struck a devastating blow straight through the Black Knight&#39;s torso. A great hit! But the thing just pushed onward despite that and ripped Guan Yu right off Red Hare by digging its claws into his side. A burst of crimson came from the wound as it coated the claws and stained his robes. The wind was knocked out of his lung from the impact of the slam. The sensation of a few bones breaking was felt within as well.

&quot;ARGHH!&quot; He gritted his teeth as he did his best to endure the pain searing through his body.

Laura flew from his hands and onto the ground in the midst of combat. Red Hare continued running before turning back and headed straight for Black Knight. A look of pure rage burned deeply within its eyes. What right did the Black Knight have to tear its Rider from them so brazenly?

I would not have been given the title of Protector or War God if that were the case!&quot;</strong> He spat blood as he spoke at the knight towering over him. The wounded War God was grinning. Blood stained his teeth. He still had a plan left up his sleeve.

Guan Yu wasn&#39;t alone. Not while he had his Master and, most importantly, not while Red Hare was still in the fight! 

From his angle, Guan Yu knew when to do it. He utilized the lodged weapon as leverage and lifted to throw Black Knight overhead. With his strength, he wouldn&#39;t be able to do it in time. However, Guan also had a raging phantasm beast ramming the back of the knight at full speed! This might just provide the much needed momentum to grant him a chance to achieve this feat!</span>

&quot;You can moan all you want in hell, Saber.&quot; Ching spat, continuing her barrage, until Brandin decided to let all of his rage out.

The chains broke, much to Ching&#39;s surprise, as the Saber unleashed a flurry of blows towards the pirate queen. She was quick to draw out her sword, parrying each blow with the blunt side of her blade. However, she was gradually losing distance and every successfull parry resulted in her blade getting slightly more nicked.

The anchor was still dragging Brandin down, but barely. She was tempted to summon another one. Keep going until she had mana in reserve. But with Kun Wu&#39;s current state...

Her eyes jolted open once she heard Jampo&#39;s call. She gave him  a glance, which was enough to see the burning determination in his eyes. He was ready to end it all.</span>

&quot;...So be it.&quot; Ching gave him a solemn reply, before purposefully blocking Brandin&#39;s next blow with only half of her strength. The impact sent her flying, but she anticipated the fall and landed right next to Kun Wu.

&quot;Shangri-La! Suppressive fire!&quot; She raised her hand while blood trickled down from her sword arm. The cannons took aim and started firing, not at Brandin, but at the area around him. It encircled him, preventing any Copper Knights from getting closer.

It was only him. And Jampo.

&quot;Milord, are you alright? Speak out?&quot; Rider then focused on what was most important to her, giving Kun Wu a shake and a pat on the chest. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

The belch of flame swirls about the monk, embers tinging his skin as Brandin&#39;s Knights fall under another onslaught, all to keep these two at each other&#39;s throats. This was a battle befit for titans...Jampo has no doubt in his mind Rider was more than capable of this fight. So too was Guan Yu. And Laura. And Kun Wu. This was but a roadblock, a passing thought...it should remain that way. Brandin&#39;s power should only ever be remembered that way...just as Jampo himself should be forgotten...

&quot;You had no intention of helping me, Brandin. I understand that now...&quot; he says, whispering the final words as through the curling smoke, Brandin&#39;s blade cuts through...

<strong>SHLICK!</strong>

&quot;Kurff...kaack...&quot;

Sage wisdom cuts itself on the edge of a fine blade, pooling itself around the length as it digs deep between his neck and shoulder. His body twitches, his hands feebly grasping and cutting themselves along the blade as the world grows dim.</span>

Slowly, the hands grip the blade...as Jampo pulls himself forward. The sawing of flesh ripples through the air as the Monk slithers along the edge, the cut going deeper through his body as it digs deep into his sternum, his body practically cut in half before his hands fall on Brandin&#39;s face. Softly caressing it, Jampo smiles weakly, tears streaming down his face...before they begin to evaporate.

<em>&quot;I told you, Brandin,&quot;</em> a spectral moan gutters out, the monk&#39;s eyes piercing through the veil as his hands claw and dig into the flesh of his face. Slowly, the smell of burning meat fills the air, and the sizzle of heat on flesh gives notice to the bubbling of the Copper Knight&#39;s visage. 

<strong>&quot;I said I would kill you...I would destroy you...and now...</strong>

<strong>&quot;THAT DAY HAS COME, COPPER KNIGHT!&quot;</strong></span>

Both of Ashura&#39;s hands alight in balls of flame, enveloping Brandin&#39;s face and wearing down the plated armor surrounding his neck, fusing it to his skin as Ashura lines up his palm with his chest, power surging around it. A brief moment later, an explosion knocks Brandin away, leaving a sawed gash behind on the bestial monk as its body sews itself back together, his chest heaving before it calls out to the air, pounding its chest...

<strong>&quot;RREEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!&quot;</strong> A wave of heat washes over all participants, like being trapped in a furnace as Ashura fully awakens, the Knights in question softening considerably from both it and Rider&#39;s blows. This was it. 

<strong>&quot;Wench. Bug. Be useful...destroy the rest...then I can eat his heart...</strong>&quot; it growls before launching after Brandin once more, throwing balls of concentrated Qi in to hold him down.</span>

The impact shattering the Black Knight’s armor to pieces. Gouts of flame spewed from the gaping holes in the armor, but Lancer saw something else as well.

The Black Knight was obviously very different from the empty automatons that were the Copper Knights, but Lancer could see something residing in that ebony armor. Some unknown, terrible, malefic entity beyond even Brandin’s control stared back at Guan Yu. And it raged.

The flames went jet black as waves of heat erupted from the Black Knight. The curse of Dolorous Gard radiated from the being as the street began to melt from the ever expanding explosive heat slowly consumed everything around the Black Knight. The reasoning behind this was immediate and simple to grasp. Kill everything. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the onslaught of the Copper Knights continued in the background, Kun Wu began to meditate. 

The gesture itself wasn&#39;t all that unfamiliar. To meditate in the middle of a battle, on the other hand, was something even he hadn&#39;t thought to rehearse before. Brandin was a menace, and his loyal subjects like cockroaches that refused to die. Powered by a seemingly bottomless well of mana, they encroached on the Masters and Servants, seeking to end their lives once and for all. Now was not the time to relax.

But Jampo&#39;s voice reassured him, and the palm over his forehead soothed him. As the old monk spun up a tale of his own, Kun Wu felt as if he had been transported back in time. He imagined the temples. The scent of incense and the rustle of bamboo rakes as young disciples gathered dry leaves in the courtyard. His old masters, too, liked sharing stories.

But...

&#39;That&#39;s not good enough.&#39; He muttered, feeling his strength restoring bit by bit. &#39;Acceptance is only the opening act. Becoming a giant is only the first step. What matters is what comes next. You&#39;ve got to keep the audience on their toes. To end a story so prematurely shows that you still have a ways to go in the art of show-and-tell!&#39;

He opened his eyes. Rider was kneeling by his side, checking for his vitals. He had been so focused on his reverie that he didn&#39;t even feel her approach!

...Or was it simply a case of exhaustion?

Even though Jampo had removed the effects of the curse, being put through the wringer thrice in short succession had drained him profoundly. He took Rider&#39;s hand readily and helped himself up.

&#39;That was...an experience.&#39; He squeezed some cheer into his voice to reassure Rider that he wasn&#39;t about to pass out on short notice. &#39;I should have heeded past me&#39;s advice and refrained from eating anything before we came here. But now that I got that out of my system&#39;—he tried not to dwell on the memory of puking in public—&#39;are you still good to go?&#39;

He reached for his iron fan and wielded it in the same fashion as a certain famous strategist, despite his clear lack of judgment on the current proceedings of the battle.

For starters, was he even aware of how his allies had been struggling under the collective might of Brandin and his lackeys? That Guan Yu was slowly losing his edge against the Black Knight, that Laura looked all but ready to pass out. Or worse, did he even realize how grave the situation was when Jampo, a <em>human</em> of all things, was the one confronting the lord of Dolorous Gard?

But for Kun Wu, the narrative was simple. Just as his allies had exhausted their resources, so did Brandin despite the expanse of his indominable fortress. Otherwise, he wouldn&#39;t have shown up in person. He would have long since drowned them in Copper Knights. Speaking of which, the Knights hadn&#39;t respawned - which was all the more reason to believe that all they needed was to keep holding on.

Fortunately, he was quite good at that.

&#39;I ask you again. Rider, are you good to go?&#39; He repeated his question. &#39;We&#39;ve still got a battlefield to clean up.&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Whoever that bald monk was, it seemed as if they had history with Brandin. Ching Shih could sense the palpable tension in the air the moment the monk approached his former Servant. Despite the man being a mere Magus, there was a certain sense of gravity that foreshadowed the clash between him and Saber.

Not that Ching cared. All that signaled to her was that she should stay back, which she gladly did in order to take care of Kun Wu. Her Master&#39;s breathing was weak and their circuits were overworked. He needed medical attention immediately.

She called out to him, both verbally and telepathically, before finally receiving a response. Kun Wu grabbed her hand, taking advantage of her care as he lifted himself up. Not only that, but he was making his usual jokes while ignoring the chaos around them. She felt reassured, but was less than thrilled when Kun Wu immediately proposed them to continue their attack.

She was shocked, wondering what had gotten into Kun Wu&#39;s head ever since they left the ship. He was acting far more brazen than she had ever seen. First the mana batteries, now his disregard for their current situation. The most effective solution would be to retreat and regroup while letting the monk sacrifice themselves to buy them time. Had Kun Wu&#39;s impulsiveness clouded his judgment.

No. She would have never fallen for someone so foolish if that were the case. She pondered on it a bit more, long enough to witness Jampo&#39;s transformation into the demonic Ashura. The beast called out at her, demeaning her as he demanded everyone else to stand aside from his fight against Brandin.

Whatever had awakened within Jampo was strong. Strong enough to potentially keep Brandin away for Lancer and Rider to eliminate the remaining Copper Knights. Retreating at this stage wouldn&#39;t be an act of wisdom, but pure cowardice.</span>

Kun Wu was the type of the person great enough to recognize that simple fact. However, Ching Shih would make a mental note to reprimand him once they got home. His attitude was getting on her nerves.

&quot;...Need you even ask? <strong>I&#39;ll stay by your side. Forever.</strong>&quot; She proudly declared, raising her arm as Shangri-La spared no quarter. This would most likely be its final barrage. There was no need to hold back any longer.

&quot;From rags to riches to gold and gunpowder. Listen to me, you curs!&quot; Ching growled with the fierceness of a tiger. Her confidence was so strong that the ship moved, ever so slightly, despite the lack of a captain. It was powered by Ching&#39;s own will.

But the intent was not to ram the knights, but to simply adjust the ship&#39;s aim as the Copper Knights would see various cannons pointed to their exact locations.

&quot;Remember my name when you die. Peace? Chaos? To hell with all that! This is the tale of a woman who devoured the seas!&quot; Ching laughed, using every bit of Kun Wu&#39;s mana to commence her final assault. She spared no expenses, specifically because it was her Master. After all, if she didn&#39;t trust her Master now of all times, then what good was she?

<strong>&quot;Gorgeous Flower Boat: Shangri-La. Release all cannons!&quot;</strong>

Cannonfire. Missiles. Harpoons. Railguns. Machinegun fire. An assortment of heavy armory rained down on the Copper Knights. No grenade could match up to it. No motorbike could elude it. It was a one sided slaughter, from a woman who had ruled it all with an iron fist.

Her cruelty was only rivalled by the deep love coursing through her body. Annihilate all that would oppose her and her beloved.

To top it all off, fireworks started to erupt from the ship. Images of roses, dragons and rabbits filled the now evening sky. They didn&#39;t seem to have any combat use and were likely inserted there by Rider herself. For what purpose?

Kun Wu could probably tell. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

The momentum from Black Knight being thrown off of him allowed Guan Yu to pull his weapon free from the chest plate. Once he was back on his feet, he was able to see what was hidden within the Black Knight&#39;s shell. 

&quot;So you aren&#39;t just an automaton, aren&#39;t you?&quot; He said as he stared at the abyss within. &quot;I wonder, were you actually someone who lived or are you simply just a product of Saber&#39;s twisted ambitions? It seems that I won&#39;t be able to get an answer out of you though.&quot; His guard came up as the rage within lashed out towards everyone and everything around them.

The heat was unbearable. If he wasn&#39;t careful, he was bound to pass out from the intense heat alone. If they didn&#39;t do anything about this soon...

<em>&quot;Gorgeous Flower Boat: Shangri-La. Release all cannons!&quot;</em>

The call to fire all was declared by the Pirate Queen. The cacophony of firepower painted the air as the ordinance rained down upon the rest of the knights.

&quot;Miss Hess!&quot; The man turned and ran towards his Master to embrace her in his arms so he could shield her from the incoming rubble and debris caused by Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm. There wasn&#39;t any possible way he could get near Black Knight without burning away himself. Besides, there was someone&#39;s safety that came first to worry about rather than figuring out a way to deal with Black Knight&#39;s meltdown.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Shangri-La opened fire on the Copper Knights once more, and Kun Wu felt his mana completely dry up. Rider was a woman of her word. This time, she truly spared no resources as she seized every drop of mana that Kun Wu had to offer and funneled all of it into her Noble Phantasm. 

It didn&#39;t matter that the Copper Knights were mobile. There was simply nowhere to run. The volley of cannons and missiles were so dense that even her allied were affected. As Guan Yu scrambled to protect his Master, Kun Wu collapsed on top of Rider, conveniently holding onto her well-endowed frame to keep himself from sliding back down the ground.

&#39;...Fireworks?&#39; He mouthed to Rider as the sky erupted in multi-colored explosions. &#39;Since when did you become a fireworks aficionado?&#39; 

Glittering lights adorned the sky. Cute rabbits, soaring dragons. Images of plants and animals alike danced across the sky, a stark contrast to the slaughter down below. What was their purpose? Why did Rider waste precious mana not on her cannons, but on frivolities like this?

&#39;You are no good at subtlety after all.&#39; Kun Wu smiled wryly. &#39;This is your way of telling me that this show is over, isn&#39;t it? You even made sure to drain all of my mana so that I can&#39;t keep summoning my familiars.&#39; He pouted, discontent written all over his face at the thought of being read like a book.

Plus, it took all of his natural mana regeneration just to keep Rider tethered to the world. He no longer had any mana to spare for Shangri-La. If he wanted to recuperate in peace, Rider would have to release the ship <em>and</em> her sword. With him largely out of commission, Rider had no choice but to defend the both of them with her bare hands.

He couldn&#39;t let that happen.

&#39;I suppose it&#39;s high time that I raise the white flag of doom?&#39; Kun Wu said jokingly as he reached for his waist sash.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With the full power of Shangri-La unleashed, it was impossible for the Copper Knights to find any shelter of note. No amount of defenses would be able to stand up against the sheer destructive power of Ching Shih, the tyrant of the seas. Guan Yu could only watch as the knights surrounding the area evaporated into thin air, as if they had never been there. Even the remnant of the Black Knight was looking far more ghastly than usual.

It was over. Saber was all alone.

&quot;Oho. So you noticed?&quot; Rider chuckled, admiring the sky herself before having her attention brought back below, towards her Master. Kun Wu&#39;s assumption was right on the mark. Perhaps Ching Shih spared no expenses in a serious fight, or perhaps the thought of being bossed around more got on her nerves. Either way, she had completely neutered Kun Wu, using every drop of mana in his body that wasn&#39;t essential to her summoning. The fireworks were a gentle way of snapping him back to his senses.

&quot;You? Giving up? I feel like there are far less ridiculous tales you could tell, milord.&quot; Ching laughed, stroking her chin as she stared at his waist. Kun Wu suddenly felt her sharp nails gently scratch at his throat.

&quot;That better not be a mana battery that you&#39;re grasping for. I predict that you will find it rather...<em>hard</em> to swallow. Why not just sit down and enjoy the fireworks? The main event is about to begin.&quot; Rider giggled, teasing and threatening Kun Wu at the same time as she pointed at her lap. She then turned her head, observing Jampo and Brandin from afar.

&quot;You may call this, the tale of Saber&#39;s demise.&quot; <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(194, 124, 14); background-color: rgba(194, 124, 14, 0.1);">@Castle Gang</span></span>

At that exact moment, the final Copper Knight was defeated and Brandin&#39;s power instantly left him. Brandin&#39;s face was one of shock and horror before was pummeled by Ashura&#39;s nonstop barrage of attacks. Without the power of Dolorous Gard, Brandin&#39;s body was destroyed.

&quot;You will always be so close...always right at the verge...but never making it over the finish line. Because, Brandin, you are a failure.&quot; 

The beast sits on its haunches, howling once more as the others are forced to watch the mad beast of a man tear Brandin apart. Smashing at his limbs, boiling his armor and throwing the remnants away like trash. He then brings his face close, snarling as he lights both hands on Brandin&#39;s face once more. &quot;Jampo says it&#39;s because you haven&#39;t moved past your own insecurity...you&#39;ll always compare your success to the massive failure that was your loss to the great Knight.

<strong>Brandin was dead.</strong>

Guan Yu stood up just in time to witness Black Knight&#39;s departure from this world. A short nod was given as they departed. The entity within the armoured shell earned his respect. Whether they cared for such a thing was unknown to him. He didn&#39;t need to know. 

Jampo delivered the final blow to their own servant. It was poetic. To be brought down by your own Master in the end. The thought of it caused a slight chuckle to escape his lips.

&quot;Lord Brandin. You were one hell of a fighter. May the Throne be fortunate enough to allow us to have a proper duel next time.&quot; A fist stuck his chest as if to pay respects to the fallen warrior. His gaze stared out into the sky as he watched the winds carry the fading mana away.

Thank you for allowing us the honour of fighting by your side.&quot; After he finished, he bowed before them to show his gratitude towards their actions. 

Red Hare returned to his side and the flames within their eyes glared at Rider. A few stomps were made as if to remind her that they still had a score to settle. He understood Red Hare&#39;s feelings so he attempted to calm them by stroking their neck. A silence befell him as he wandered through deep thoughts. Soon, he figured out what he wanted to say.

&quot;If we encounter each other again, Rider, let us fight to our heart&#39;s content! I would love to see if your ship can within the full blunt of our attack after all!&quot; Guan Yu&#39;s laughter filled the air once again. The man was bleeding from his side and yet he sought to laugh before seeking care. 

&quot;However, should fate be kind to both of us and we encounter each other after this whole City Grail War is over, please allow me the honour of buying the first few rounds. This time I promise I will go easy on your Master next time!&quot; Guan Yu had a wide grin on his face as he rubbed the back of his head. It was kind of his fault that things got out of hand last time so this was his way of owning up to that fact. 

&quot;Jampo. You held true to your beliefs despite the darkness that surrounded you. You make me proud to have fought against you as well as with you. You should join us. Having a fifth would be delightful! I&#39;m sure you have plenty of stories to tell at your age.&quot; Finally, the monk was addressed by the warrior. Their battle was finished. 

While the fight against Saber was over, that wouldn&#39;t be the end for them. There were still  other Masters and Servants to defeat. There was a war that still needed to be won!</span>

&quot;...57 years ago...I killed my masters and burned my childhood home to the ground.&quot; The words hang over the group much like the smoke from the fire of that day hung over Jampo&#39;s horror stricken face, his cries from before melding in with the crackle of flame as it licked at the charred and broken remains of those he cherished. &quot;I was told I was left there by my mother...I do not know her name. I was told she was from a dwindling magus line...and that I was an anomaly. Gifted.

&quot;My masters took me in and taught me the teachings of Buddha. They taught me to seek enlightenment and to curb desire. The ways of Buddha are tranquility; the Cessation of Suffering is the Cessation of Craving. Demons seek only to crave...denizens of the lowest pits of Hell build their lives in order to crave.&quot;</span>

The monk&#39;s head bows as he looks to his surroundings, watching as the shade of Dolorous Gard fades away, the warm glow of the afternoon sun falling over the group, bathing in its orange glow and basking in the pink skyline above. &quot;...I killed them because I was born a demon. There is a technical term for it...Spirit Origin. Mine came to be known as Burst...I discovered this after running from the destruction I left in my wake. Their only crime was loving me dearly...but mine was hiding what I truly was.&quot; 

He rises now, his gaze still on the horizon as the castle walls disappear into faint traces of mana, floating in the wind as they&#39;re carried away along with the remnants of their former Master. His body remains still as he folds his hands inward, a moment of reflection as a hand lays itself on his chest...and he feels a dark mirror press back. &quot;I have spent 50 years craving atonement rather than delivering on it. I have sacrificed countless lives for the sake of my own selfish desire. Any stories I have to tell are of shame and guilt.&quot; 

&quot;...Laura...Guan Yu...Rider and Master...I thank you all for aiding in this endeavor...but Saber was only one of countless sins I have to answer for...&quot;</span>

&quot;<strong>I will turn myself in to the Holy Church.</strong>&quot; He says it plainly while still taking in the majesty of not only the sunset, but even Rider&#39;s Shangri La. Its majesty...prowess was one befitting of the Queen of Pirates. And it only pained him with how unworthy he truly was to stand alongside a figure of her renown...but at least he knew people that truly could...

&quot;...I am in the company of heroes and stand as an outcast. Even if you should fail in this war...you have succeeded in attaining your own piece of Nirvana. I pray this war should not be the end of such company...and of such noble heroes walking amongst us.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Shaken to the ground, Laura had but a fraction of a second to gather part of her swarm and cushion her fall. Her breath cut short, coupled with the crippling exhaustion that took over her body, the only way to reach out to the warrior was through their link.

<em>&quot;Caref-&quot;</em>

But his body reacted before the words reached him, shielding the young girl from the flurry of debris that followed Rider&#39;s full-power artillery shots. 

Once again she laid in his arms, protected from the outside world. Soon, even the Black Knight fell to his demise, a consequence of the Copper Knights&#39; defeat.

Then the flames surged. Burning heat coming from both the Dark Knight and Ashura, coupled with Olympia&#39;s naturally hot weather—never had her sweat glands worked this hard to maintain a tolerable body temperature.

And finally, soon after the Black Knight&#39;s demise, Brandin&#39;s run was terminated. Dolorous Gard began to fade, much like her own consciousness started to. Relaxation started to settle, sleepiness showed its fangs and would soon take over her incapable body.

But her brittle mind still managed to pay attention to the words spoken by Jampo. Til the very end, he refused to see Brandin as an enemy but as a person to be <em>saved</em>.

Laura momentarily wondered how different things could have been between the two of them. If Guan Yu had shown them the same kindness he showed her, if she had overstepped her boundaries at their first encounter, if she had reached out sooner to Jampo or stopped Brandin while there was still time ...

That of having contributed to Brandin&#39;s growth, not acting until things almost got out of control. That of helplessly watching Jampo quietly leave the grounds, having brought a swift end to his counterpart with his own two hands. He wouldn&#39;t answer favourably to Guan Yu&#39;s proposal.

A bittersweet, unsatisfactory conclusion that will probably plague her mind for years to come. Regrets, regrets, regrets. But what had to be done had been done, at least. Had to move on, try not to repeat the same mistakes going forward. Cheering up wasn&#39;t so hard when you had someone who constantly smirked as he held onto you.

Laura felt the urge to speak up, not let the monk&#39;s words be the last spoken between them. Yet, she also felt that talking would ruin the established mood. Witty remarks didn&#39;t fit sunsets, nor did they serve as appropriate goodbyes.

Having somehow dodged death during the many fights he had gone through, a lady bug walked along Brandin&#39;s cut on Jampo&#39;s body, echoing the first encounter between him and <em>Bug</em> as non-enemies. It settled on the monk&#39;s shoulder, looking forward in the same direction he did.

If this little critter had any messages attached to it, no one would ever tell.</span>

&#39;You read my mind,&#39; he said blithely, not caring that Rider could easily overpower him in an instant. &#39;I was going for more mana batteries - what of it? You and I both need the mana, and you know it.&#39; He challenged her question with reckless honesty, as if daring her to slice his throat for an action that would benefit them both.

As the final round of fireworks went off in the sky, so did Brandin&#39;s ashes dissipate under his Master&#39;s own hands. Armor turned into mana, flesh receded, giving way to the battered remains of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame that once housed the fearsome lord of Dolorous Gard.

Saber was no more.

And Kun Wu was shook at the sight of Dolorous Gard retreating all around them. The castle walls collapsed as they restored Olympia to its former glory, and it only struck him then just how much of Olympia had been gobbled up by Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm. An entire district? Two? He couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom how devastating that must have felt for Olympia&#39;s citizens. How devastating that must have felt for Olympia&#39;s <em>Masters</em>.

So where were they?

Olympia was <em>this</em> close to being taken over by a single Servant, yet aside from him, Laura, and the old monk who had just revealed himself to be Saber&#39;s Master, none of Olympia&#39;s contestants had come to the city&#39;s aid even after the Church had placed a bounty on Saber&#39;s head. Did they not care for Olympia&#39;s demise? Or...

<strong>Did Olympia simply not have any Masters left?</strong>

&#39;Is Olympia out of the running for the City Grail War?&#39;

His thoughts turned into words, loud enough for Rider and his allies to hear. A cold, almost analytical question that felt strangely out of place after Jampo&#39;s heartfelt outburst. Rider would most likely be shocked. Was this still the same Master who had vowed to shoulder her burdens?

But Kun Wu wanted an answer, and he wanted it <em>now</em>.

How much do you know of the remaining Masters?&#39; He rephrased his question, impatience seeping into his voice.

His heart couldn&#39;t stop thumping. The Church&#39;s bounty had revealed more about the state of the CGW than they had intended. He had a feeling that he was close.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A peaceful, quiet end for the tumultuous tale of Brandin. Unspoken words that carried more meaning than anything else ...

But it seemed like someone didn&#39;t quite catch the memo. Kun Wu had tainted this moment by speaking up, not to pay respect to Jampo&#39;s tale nor to acknowledge his thanks or his praise. In but a few sentences, he managed to sound impatient, insulting and self-centred. <em>The timing couldn&#39;t have been worse to ask such questions.</em>

Having been thrown around and tasting the ground one too many times, Laura&#39;s frail body had all but ceased to answer to her directives. Retorting would take some effort.

&quot;Cool it,&quot; She answered, although not from her mouth. &quot;We just got out of a life-threatening fight that decided the fate of both Olympia and Delphi  and we <em>won</em>.&quot;

It was an eerie spectacle, that of Laura standing motionless in Guan Yu&#39;s arms, her head hanging loose, not looking at anyone in particular. Portraying such clear words with no emotions attached through her bugs while her actual mouth opened only to bring some much-needed oxygen to her lungs ... it didn&#39;t sit right. Almost as if her ghost exited her body to live on in the swarm.

&quot;Go apeshit, pump your fist in the air, do a post-victory collapse. I wish I could do all that, but I&#39;m not exactly capable right now.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Don&#39;t you worry about that.&#39; Kun Wu replied earnestly. &#39;Once this is all over, you&#39;ll be sure to see me do all of that and <em>so much</em> more. I&#39;m not exactly the humble type, you see.&#39; He grinned, brushing off Laura&#39;s prickly remarks with his trademark thick skin.

&#39;...But that is neither here nor now.&#39; 

Once the excitement of battle died down, fatigue was imminent. Just like him, Laura seemed to be completely spent. Though why she would choose to pump even more mana into her bugs despite her exhaustion was beyond him. Would it not be in her best interest to conserve her mana for her Servant?

Kun Wu was observant, but he was not infallible. Had he been a bit more attentive to what his sensory organs had picked up, perhaps he would have realized that Laura was trying to put a lid on their conversation. That what she needed wasn&#39;t long-winded inquiries, but a bed and possibly medical attention. 

Kun Wu saw past all of that.

If anything, Laura had shown that she was still capable of thought. Capable of speech. Before she collapsed - before Guan Yu took her away, he would get her to talk. 

&#39;The fact that you didn&#39;t challenge me to a duel right now can only mean one thing: that this CGW isn&#39;t over yet. But it can&#39;t be far. Not with how quiet Olympia has been during Saber&#39;s rampage. If there were any Masters left standing in Olympia, they would have rioted against Saber long before us. But that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.&#39;

Kun Wu laid out the facts and sifted through them with a fine sieve. Gathering intel wasn&#39;t his forte, but he was surprisingly adept at working with what he had been given in the moment. 

&#39;So I will ask you again. How many Masters are left standing? You must know. Your bugs are capable of speaking a few more names, aren&#39;t they? That is all I need.&#39;</span>

Even without Brandin&#39;s curse, her mana resources still stood at an all-time low. Controlling the insects to form coherent words, making sure that the bulk of the swarm stay under her command—those weren&#39;t effortless actions. Her forearms faintly sizzled as the insects spoke, the artificial circuits having reached their threshold. The pain would help to keep her awake, at least.

&quot;The fact that I didn&#39;t challenge you to a duel right now means <em>many things</em>, like ... you know, maybe I don&#39;t want to fight my ally right after we&#39;ve worked together to beat our common enemy? Maybe I&#39;m taking my Servant&#39;s feelings into account, cuz I&#39;m pretty sure he doesn&#39;t want to fight you guys right now?&quot;

Although the bulk of her army had either dissipated or died at this point, even a moderately-sized swarm was hard to keep under control. A slight hissing, meant only for Guan Yu&#39;s ears, came from the girl as the pain intensified.

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m taking <em>Rider</em>&#39;s feelings into account, too? I distinctly remember her being wary of me attacking you at your weakest should we win, and I distinctly remember me giving my word that I wouldn&#39;t do that. You trying to egg me into breaking that promise, I wonder?&quot;

&quot;... I will say that you&#39;re not wrong about Olympia&#39;s situation,&quot; The informant conceded. &quot;They don&#39;t have many Masters left, although I can&#39;t tell the reason why they haven&#39;t responded to Saber&#39;s expansion. They should have more than enough resources to fight back, yet they haven&#39;t reacted.&quot;</span>

Knowing that you have grown a soft spot for Rider does not get me closer to winning this War, but your intel on the other Masters just might.&#39; Kun Wu replied unflinchingly. &#39;My words are nothing but candid. How you wish to interpret them is up to you.&#39;

He extracted himself from Rider&#39;s arms, then reached into his pockets, skipping the blister pack that Rider had been so wary of and grabbed his phone.

&#39;You really <em>are</em> nice. You and Rider would get along swimmingly had we met under different circumstances.&#39; He added, curling his lips faintly as he did so, pulling up the unofficial leaderboard that fans from both cities had religious updated via human effort. 

Saber of Olympia remained near the top, though that would soon change once people catch wind of the recent battle that had occurred near Olympia&#39;s heart.

&#39;I have my suspicions.&#39; Kun Wu admitted. &#39;Either they have been too busy fighting their own battles, or they tried to contend with Saber but failed. In the best case scenario, this means all the Servants that are still active on this leaderboard are either inaccurately reported like Saber&#39;s has, or they are too wounded from their own battles to come and help. And that&#39;—a dangerous gleam flickered in Kun Wu&#39;s eyes—&#39;gives me an edge.&#39;

&#39;Have you ever heard of the saying &quot;<em>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the canary behind</em>&quot;?&#39; He asked the informant. &#39;To prey upon the predators when they least expect it. They would be too busy recuperating, certainly too busy to expect someone like me, who has just risked his neck in public for a noble cause, to strike them from behind.&#39; 

Kun Wu held up his phone and brought up his DelphiTube™️ channel for Laura and her bugs to see.

If their negotiations hadn&#39;t made it clear enough, his last words confirmed once and for all that he had drastically changed from the initial fame-seeking merchant he used to be. &quot;Making full use of my proposition to give yourself an edge for your upcoming fights. You weren&#39;t kidding when you told me that you were awfully greedy.&quot;

Ever since their negotiations, she had known not to underestimate him nor his Servant. Growth was a scary thing, and grasping its scope was a difficult task. Her greatest asset, information, turned into a blatant weakness when she had to confront people who had changed.

&quot;But I wouldn&#39;t take that advantage for granted, this edge might just be double,&quot; The swarm spoke. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you became Delphi&#39;s number one threat after you post that video. I really don&#39;t expect people to take me, the girl with bug powers, for a threat. You and Rider, on the other hand ... your moves were quite flashy. I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if the remaining Masters allied in order to bring you down, hero of Olympia or not.&quot;

As the words kept flowing, the swarm of insects grew thinner. Bugs kept slipping out of Laura&#39;s control, the swarm&#39;s coordination slowly deteriorated—Laura couldn&#39;t keep the facade for long. Had to be expeditious with her remaining words.

&quot;I&#39;ll have the memory cards delivered to your door soon, along with the files I got on Olympia&#39;s remaining Masters. This is not me being nice,&quot; A pause, the swarm collectively turned to take a good look at Kun Wu. &quot;.. or generous. It just so happens that your enemies are also my enemies, so I don&#39;t mind you taking them down. Less work for me.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Listening to Laura&#39;s bugs was like listening to the mechanical text-to-speech voice on his phone. The monotonous voice from their collective buzzing betrayed no emotion, while Laura&#39;s physical body remained in a state of disrepair, completely unresponsive to Kun Wu&#39;s proposal. 

He felt more reassured when the girl held the gun to his head.

At least he could gauge her reactions that way. The slight popping of her veins when he irritated her with words, the twitch of her muscles when she threatened to pull the trigger. Her smugness, her snark, her irritation. Responding to emotions was easy. Responding to a dwindling swarm of bugs was a <em>far</em> cry from that.

He had no idea what Laura would say next. Another jab at him and Rider? Refusing his proposal and riding off with Lancer, leaving him stranded with nothing to work with but to back off for the time being?

When the bugs finally relayed Laura&#39;s message and it wasn&#39;t a big fat rejection letter, Kun Wu felt like collapsing right back into Rider&#39;s strong arms. He let out the breath he&#39;d unconsciously been holding for way too long.

&#39;You really had me worried there.&#39; He told the informant, a grin finally breaching his face at Laura&#39;s approval. &#39;All this talk about me setting myself up for failure - for a moment there, I thought you had grown another heart and was going to deny my request.&#39; He took a jab at Laura, wiping metaphorical sweat from his forehead.

&#39;...But are you really giving away the intel for <em>free</em>? Or are you expecting me to pay up by doing the dirty work for you? I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter who gets the job done between the two of us. We did have a deal. Until then, I will happily play hitman for you. Just this once though,&#39; he wagged a finger at the swarm. &#39;Consider it a City Grail War special service.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite how prideful she could be at times, Rider hadn&#39;t expected the Saber fight to go so smoothly. Not only was Brandin a more manageable threat with the aid of Lancer, but the appearance of the mysterious monk had certainly turned the tide into their favor, ending with Saber&#39;s defeat.

Even better, Saber&#39;s former Master had decided to turn themselves in. They seemed to be sincere about it too, which meant another competitor out of the Grail War. The path to victory was close, which is what Kun Wu noticed as well.

Ching couldn&#39;t believe her ears, as she overheard her Master talking with Laura about future matters. Despite having won, relaxation wasn&#39;t on his mind just yet. He was thinking about the next opponents, and the ones beyond that. The removal of any obstacle that would block his path to victory.

She stared at him, flabbergasted and too shocked to even muster a reply. Even Laura seemed to have more common sense at the moment. Ching had never seen Kun Wu like this.

After he obtained the information he needed, he quickly turned to Rider. Not to praise her or even tease her as he usually did, but to order her to prepare their next ride.

Somehow, the thought of Kun Wu acting like this filled her with a bigger dread than the motion sickness of riding a train.

&quot;...As you wish.&quot; Rider replied, heading over to the station. If she wanted to confront her Master, she would rather do it when others weren&#39;t watching.

The two took a train ride home, one that was silent and lacking in warmth. Kun Wu was too busy meditating to recover some of his strength while Rider stared straight ahead to avoid feeling sick.
