Laurent heard his grandfather&#39;s words echo through his mind as he sat at a meeting with his personal council and board, eyes closed, deep in thought. The light within his body had temporarily faded, but he knew that once he had to fight, it would flare up once again. That, however, was insignificant to the businessman&#39;s current plight.

<em>&quot;Money is the lifeblood of the world.&quot;</em>

His grandfather was many things. Shrewd, smart, cunning, spiteful, harsh. A true genius of a businessman, on par with his grandson. However, there was one thing that Laurent had come to learn: <strong>his grandfather was wrong.</strong>

<em>&quot;Mr. MacKenzie...&quot;</em>

Money had value. It was, ultimately, a currency. Yet the true thing people worked towards was <em>expectation.</em> Things were only as valuable as one perceived them to be. This was the basis of money. 

Hope. Expectations. Dreams. These were the true lifeblood of the world. Where did they come from, and where did they go? Ultimately an irrelevant question. Solving it meant nothing.

<em>&quot;Excuse me, Mr. MacKenzie...&quot;</em>
Yet despite this acknowledgement, Laurent primarily focused on the physical desires of man. Money. He sold weapons, not dreams, gunpowder, not happiness.

Yet he was aware of the concept. It was how he managed to stay one step ahead of his competition. HR. 

Kun Wu and his Rider were now out of the way.  Two thorns in his side were finally gone, reduced to nothing more than stepping stones on the path to success. What happened to them now did not matter.

It was time to win a Ci—

&quot;<strong>LAURENT!</strong>&quot;

&quot;Hm? Sorry, repeat that.&quot; Laurent said, wiping off his glasses as he looked towards his HR and PR director, clearly confuddled.</span>

This is, if you&#39;ll pardon my language, fucking massive! How we handle this could change our company image the next several <em>years</em>!&quot;

&quot;I am acutely aware, thank you.&quot; Laurent said, placing his glasses back on his face. &quot;What is your proposal for dealing with this moving forward?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you asked, sir!&quot; Mr. PR said, wringing his hands. He snapped his finger towards a display board at the end of the room. The heads of the various departments looked down the meeting table with interest. 

Suddenly, a phrase appeared on the screen:

<strong>Ma-can-zee do it? Yes zee can!</strong> Mr. PR looked expectantly towards the rest of the board. &quot;Well?&quot; He asked.

Laurent and the CTO looked towards each other in a mix of befuddlement and embarrassment. The CIO turned away to hide his face, and several personal advisors sat stone-faced, completely unamused.

&quot;No.&quot; Laurent said, standing up. &quot;As amusing as puns are, this is not a light-hearted event. We need to tap into the emotions of Olympian citizens. Our workers. Ramp up Olympia nationalism. Make MacKenzie Industries and Olympia one in the same.&quot;

If Laurent won the City Grail War, it would be substantially easier to worm his way into a position of power, as well as help salvage Persepolis. Such a feat would earn him millions upon millions, and place him squarely at the height of the aristocracy in Olympia in terms of financial power.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Saber&#39;s assault on Olympia had caused shortages in several areas. Those who offered vital services, such as food and water, managed to shoot ahead. Laurent had managed to get ahead via selling his equipment to every family and business looking to fight Saber&#39;s minions. The catch: jacked up prices. In protecting themselves, many companies had drained their coffers. On their backs, Laurent was now comfortably one of the wealthiest men in Olympia.

But it still wasn&#39;t enough.

Yet in order to get more later, sacrifices would need to be made now. 

&quot;Bump the wages of the factory workers.&quot; Laurent said, walking to the head of the table, in front of the advertisement. Mr. PR quickly stepped aside.

&quot;W-what?&quot;

&quot;Why?

&quot;How will tha—&quot;

&quot;Silence.&quot; Laurent said bluntly, clearly annoyed. &quot;I have thought this over. My victory is on the horizon, and with it, Persepolis&#39;s salvage efforts. If I win now, nobody beyond our competitors will care. This is an <em>opportunity</em> to corner several markets.

&quot;Our employees must want me to win. It is the only way we will be accepted a future dominant superpower in both Olympia, and Delphi. When we win, Delphi must not be left out! Our presence, while sizeable, is still not enough! Am I not wrong?&quot;

Muttering filled the room, along with a few nods.</span>

—

Several hours later, Laurent stepped out of a meeting, suit billowing behind him. He did not bring Friedrich along. Laurent&#39;s respect for the small philosopher had increased ever since Laurent ascended to Servant status. While the two got along swimmingly, Laurent occasionally wondered if Friedrich was a friend of the Overman, or Laurent himself.

Laurent shook his head as he entered an elevator. There was no difference. They were one in the same now, anyways.

<strong>Ding!</strong> The elevator doors opened at Laurent&#39;s penthouse.

&quot;I&#39;m back, Friedrich.&quot; Laurent called out, before picking up a file on his counter. There was no need to stash it away while Friedrich was around. The information was not confidential, but it was Delphi&#39;s remaining Master. Laurent flipped it open, and his eyes brightened with light.

&quot;Gustave.&quot; Laurent muttered, before tossing the file back on the counter. &quot;He&#39;s still kicking. Delphian healthcare is either cheap or absurdly high quality if he&#39;s still in the game. Laurent took a seat on the couch. He needed to think.

They had come from good spirits, having spent time with the younger Renoir generations. Now to a bleak excitement of facing against Laurent Mackenzie for a third and final time. 

In the time between the battle in <span class="mention">#street-front</span> and now more news had been propagated throughout both cities of the final remaining pairs within the war. 

Representing Delphi: Gustave Renoir and Simo Hayha

Representing Olympia: Laurent Mackenzie and Friedrich Nietzsche 

More pressure was now placed upon both Gustave and Simo due to undergoing bonding. This was a small price to pay, for them to become a more effective unit in the battlefield. 

&quot;So... Just as we discussed. I&#39;ll take the scenic route, going quietly.... You place yourself upstairs, and distract caster.&quot; Simo spoke quietly to his master, as they continued to move through the streets. 

Then the sniper&#39;s voice chimed into the artist&#39;s head a smile coming across the servant&#39;s eyes. &quot;<em>And, we can always talk up here. Feel free to make it a constant lecture, if you wish. I for one will find it relaxing, like a.... Podcast? is that what they&#39;re called?</em>&quot; The Sniper tapped his brain, still bemused by this new psychic connection placed between the pair.</span>

The Philosopher was leaned over, back hunched, and pen in hand. Since becoming Laurent&#39;s servant, Nietzsche had grown accustomed to the MacKenzie penthouse; he no longer used his desk and wooden chair, instead he perfered to work in the cozy penthouse environment. 

Hearing the elevator ding, Caster would look from his work to see Laurent enter the room. Nietzsche took the moment break to shake out the aches in his hands. Nietzsche&#39;s pen had been writing more words than it had in a long time. The work he was forging would be something special, a gift to Laurent when the war was over. 

&quot;So Gustave is still in the game?&quot; Nietzsche thought allowed tapping his pen to his lips. Nietzsche did not know much of Laurent&#39;s rival, he didn&#39;t care to prod more into Laurent&#39;s life then necessary. Caster was however, interested in Gustave&#39;s servant, Simo Hayha. 

&quot;That servant of his is quite interesting Laurent. World War Two, it is an unfortunate event caused by the restrictive morals of the world... You know Laurent, I once said that the 20th century would be filled with a desire for conquest.&quot;

What they fought for, ultimately, is irrelevant. A pity that so many people died to prove you correct.&quot; Laurent responded in kind as he crossed the penthouse towards his Servant, eventually standing behind him.

Simo, Gustave&#39;s Servant, meant little to the businessman. He was a soldier who wielded weaponry produced by men like Laurent. The disinterest extended from this single idea. Laurent did not need to understand Simo, when hundreds of little Simos were running around right now.

Even if none of those individuals had fought in a global conflict.

&quot;You&#39;re famous, Friedrich.&quot; Laurent said, straightening his tie. &quot;Being the last Servant on Olympia&#39;s side has made you quite the household name. It&#39;s likely that many people will begin picking up your books.&quot; 

Laurent got a glint in his eye. It was clear he was wondering how to best monopolize and sell Nietzsche&#39;s works.

&quot;Additionally, I&#39;ve nearly doubled the wages of my workers in a bid to win this City Grail War.&quot; Laurent said ominously, clearly planning something. &quot;What&#39;re you penning down now, Friedrich?&quot; Laurent asked, peering over his Servant&#39;s shoulder.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche averted his eyes from his work, letting them wander as he processed Laurents words. Yes, war was business, Nietzsche knew this much. Caster, however, did not care about the people who profited off war, rather he cared about those who started them. 

&quot;I would have liked to be wrong.&quot; Nietzsche leaned back in his chair. He had been right about a lot, the new world had taught him that much. However, there was one more thing Caster enjoyed being correct about. &quot; Ah yes, so I am famous. I once said Some men are born posthumously, it would seem that I am &#39;some men&#39; &quot; 

Nietzsche wondered if Laurent would reckonize his quote. Had the businessman been brushing up on his Philosophy? Surely he must have been to achieve the state of Overman. 

The Philosopher gave off a nod closing his notebook and placing it under his coat. &quot;Do not worry about this yet. It will hopefully be my final and greatest work. Something that maybe you&#39;ll have the honor of printing after the war. If you&#39;d like to enter the literature business that is.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A battle was about to be had and yet all that was in Gustave&#39;s mind was the smiles of his children and grandchildren as they gathered around the table for dinner, chatting and playing with the one Gustave had originally hired to step down on the dreams of others. Yet there Simo was, chasing the same ideals of freedom and familial bonds that he had once shunned in the pursuit of fame and knowledge long ago. What they both desired more than any one treasure was that of a home where they did not need to hide from themselves or others. 

Or perhaps it was his mind&#39;s way of preparing him for the task at hand, the end of the City Grail War that had deprived others of dream and life. One man or perhaps a being that was once a man now stood in Gustave and Simo&#39;s way, one they had faced once as an ally and once as an enemy. Regardless of the fight, only one pair and one dream would walk away from the looming dark glass tower, that of avaricious dominion or that of artistic liberation.

&quot;Mhm, and remember, Laurent&#39;s supposedly taken on a power that puts him on the level of a servant so treat him as such. He&#39;ll only let you make one mistake after all,&quot; the old man tapped his cane against the ground to emphasize his point. His stride had recovered to the point where it was no longer necessary but its potential uses were too much to give away. 

<em>So this is the potential of the master-servant bond? Fascinating, truly fascinating. Give me a moment and perhaps I can start a little lecture for you, something to keep us both steady. It won&#39;t quite be a monk&#39;s zen state but its effect will still make itself known.</em>

Gustave nodded to his servant before simply walking into the building ahead of them and proceeding to stroll over to the closest elevator and pressed a button for a floor 3/4 of the way up the skyscraper.

They entered the building and Presence Concealment activated. Hiding the assassin from view. 

“<em>God Speed, Gustave Renoir.</em>” From their mental link Simo wished luck to his master. Before himself making the way to gain access to the elevator shaft itself. 

Readying himself for the climb that would be taken.

Since you have such a tendency to predict things, feel free to give me advise on market trends in the next quarter.&quot; Laurent said, raising an eyebrow at Nietzsche&#39;s quote. He seemed silent for a few moments, dampening Nietzsche&#39;s hopes that Laurent had actually read his works.

&quot;Indeed, and for some of us, &#39;that which does not kill us makes us stronger&#39;.&quot; Laurent smirked, firing a quote right back at him. So he <em>was</em> paying attention.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll do that. I can see it selling well in Delphi. They do love things like that.&quot; Laurent sighed, before checking his watch.

Several floors down, in the lobby...

A receptionist watched as an elderly man walked past security and into an elevator. MacKenzie Industries&#39; receptionists were trained with the eyes of hawks. There were valuable assets to be protected, and recognizing known faces was required.

Besides, it was hard <em>not</em> to recognize Delphi&#39;s finalist.

The receptionist picked up a phone call and began to dial...

Laurent picked up the phone, and his contented tone melted into an expression of resignation and acceptable. He whispered his thanks into the phone, facing away from Friedrich.

&quot;He&#39;s bold.&quot; Laurent whispered to nobody in particular, before turning back to his Servant.

&quot;Renoir is in the building. Let us end this, my friend.&quot; Laurent said, squeezing his Servant&#39;s shoulder in a gesture of comradery. It was the closest Laurent had ever come to something beyond a handshake.

&quot;I will deal with Hayha. It isn&#39;t healthy to focus on just one individual when there&#39;s more options to choose from, no?&quot; Laurent said, walking off to the elevator.

No one made a move to stop Gustave from reaching the elevator and it seemed no one stopped his ascension either. For the moment, he may have regained his old notoriety because of the Grail War, people parting for his way. A younger version of himself would have reveled in the attention and the potential to carry a whole city&#39;s fate on his shoulders yet all the old man wanted was to be free of it all and chart a path that left his family free of Delphi, Olympia and Lemuria&#39;s massive wakes. 

<em>&quot;Ascending to the penthouse now, how goes things on your end Simo?&quot;</em>  Gustave reached out as he made the rest of his path through a service stairwell that should bring him up to where Laurent and Caster were likely laying in wait. A few minutes passed and he found the door to the top floor locked. It was a pointless gesture, even if it were enchanted for Gustave simply used his craft to fold the space between the hallway and stairwell so he could walk straight up to the penthouse door and knocked three times.

&quot;Mr. MacKenzie, I believe we have one final appointment scheduled for today.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche raised an eyebrow as he saw Laurent&#39;s expression quickly change. The businessman’s words alerted Caster of potential danger. Nietzsche&#39;s suspicions were confirmed when Laurent told him of Gustave’s presence. 

Caster looked down at his shoulder, recognizing Laurent’s gesture of comradery. The pair&#39;s battle towards their dreams had inevitably moved them from a work relationship closer to something like friends. Nietzsche gave Laurent a firm nod standing from his chair.

“If you wish for me to go for Assassins master, then it will be done.” Nietzsche sat back down in his chair as Laurent made his leave. Caster didn&#39;t say much to Laurent before his departure. The Philosopher was confident in Laurent&#39;s ability to deal with a servant like Simo.

Just as Nietzsche had gotten comfortable and was ready to wait for Gustave to approach, he would hear a knock. It seemed Gustave had made his way up relatively quickly. Nietzsche very much wanted to talk philosophy with the Master, pulling more information about his Servant… However, Caster would have to show a fighting spirit as long as Laurent was still around. 

“Oh, our guest is here… Don&#39;t worry, Laurent, you go on your way still. I&#39;ll handle him.” 

Gustave would receive no response from the penthouse. Instead, he would see a large club slam against the penthouse door, sending both the door and the glass that accompanied it flying at him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Friedrich smashed the door open, blowing the doors past Gustave. Laurent casually stepped out, as immaculately dressed as always. It looked as if he had found a dead mouse at his doorstep.

&quot;<strong>You.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, suit billowing. &quot;A pleasure. Barging into my home. Typical of a snake. A pleasure, but I have some other matters to attend to. Where is your Servant?&quot; 

The hall leading to the penthouse seemed empty, and Laurent saw nothing. A sneak attack? This wasn&#39;t the best place to do it. There was no cover, and Laurent had the home-field advantage. The only reason Gustave would march up to Laurent&#39;s door meant that Assassin was close by.

&quot;<strong>So this is it. Playing dead was always your style, old man. As much as I would like to rip you apart like I did with Uther&#39;s Master, I think I will let Friedrich deal with you. Give him a proper MacKenzie welcome, Caster.</strong>&quot;

The sound of scraping wood could be heard was Laurent walked through the wreckage, and past Gustave. The two locked eyes for a moment. Both considered the other to be garbage. Yet now, there was a power in Laurent&#39;s eyes. A divine glow. No, something <em>beyond</em> divine. Were the rumors about Laurent&#39;s ascent true?

Laurent tapped the elevator, which cheerfully dinged open. He then proceeded to slam the ground floor button. He waited for a second. 

He tapped it again. Nothing happened.

He tapped it again.

...

He <strong>slammed</strong> his fist into the button, and the speaker dinged to life.

<span class="pre pre--inline">OBSTRUCTION DETECTED IN SHAFT. </span> A polite female voice called out, much to Laurent&#39;s annoyance. There was only one individual if Gustave was involved.</span>

Well, there was only one way to deal with an insect: <strong>by smashing it.</strong> Laurent looked up, and using his enhanced abilities, leapt through the maintenance hatch at the top of the elevator, where the elevator tether tautly held up the metal box. Tearing it apart would take too long, and would be extremely difficult. Besides, there was a far more efficient method...

A singularity appeared in Laurent&#39;s hand. There was nothing to absorb, but ultimately, that was irrelevant. Laurent clawed his singularity across the tether, mangling and shredding it.

<strong>Snap.</strong>  Laurent lashed himself to the wall.

The elevator began falling towards Simo, screaming as sparks of two different steel objects scraped against one another.

The climb was going to be a long one to reach the pent house, and a variety of issues could occur. The most dangerous were obviously the elevator cars failing and crushing him, or getting stuck in the cables themselves. 

Moments kept passing as the Sniper continued the climb. Then it was heard. 

<strong>SNAP</strong> 

The noise echoed downwards into the shaft, coming right from the top of the building. Then the sounds of metal grinding against metal soon followed. 

Simo stared upwards to see faint sparks become more and more clear. ‘<em>this is… unfortunate…</em>’. Assassin thought, his expression souring. 

He was getting close to the next set of elevator doors. But it would be a close call. 

Invisible soldier activated, as the sniper began to scramble at an accelerated pace. Before using some momentum to jump and scramble into the elevator door, to keep safe from the incoming object.

“<em>Laurent’s with me… he tried to crush me like an ant.</em>” Simo interjected in the lecture, alerting his master to the changes in the situation.

Laurent squinted, peering into the dust. Did he get Simo? Unlikely. He&#39;d need to make sure. The businessman walked down the wall, before tearing open a pair of doors partially down the shaft. Luckily, they weren&#39;t hard to open.

Laurent walked into the armory, casually arming himself with grenades and equipping himself with an automatic rifle and shotgun. The ammo orbited around his body, ready to be reloaded at a moment&#39;s notice. He whistled as he worked, tossing a few grenades down the elevator shaft.

A few seconds later, they exploded.

The work was somewhat slow, but Laurent&#39;s speed accelerated the process. After a few moments, he was ready.

&quot;<strong>Hayha! Let&#39;s get this over with! The sooner I win, the sooner I can take control of this city and the aristocracy. If you want to save your Master, you&#39;ll have to get through me.</strong>&quot; Laurent sneered, producing a machine gun as he waited for the dust to settle.

&quot;<strong>How wise of me not to ally with a third-rate Servant like you. Ever since our alliance, you&#39;ve been nothing but an unstable wreck. Mauling me on the Brobdingnagian... Shooting me during a peace talk. Scum. My luck with Assassins is terrible, but you aren&#39;t the first Assassin or Servant that I&#39;ve had to put down.</strong>&quot;

Soon enough his enemy would show themself. Perhaps the propaganda was right, Laurent Mackenzie had <strong>reached the level of a servant</strong>. 

A few explosions were heard from above, grenades were now in play. And here Simo was now placed at a severe disadvantage. 

Something the sniper might be able to work through. 

Their blood began to boil upon Mackenzie speaking through the shaft.  The White Death and Simo Hayha feeling a mutual rage. 

“<strong>I agree with you on the premise of ending this quickly, but I think the conclusion will be different.</strong>” The Assassin spat back, still invisible with his skill. 

“<strong>You’d find out that I’m no wreck, not after your caster helped set me straight. The White Death and I are one. And it’s been craving your blood.</strong>” The voice was almost a growl as it responded, before Simo took back to his ladder. Firing upwards , with one of the pistols Archer had left him, through the smoke from the grenades. Before ducking into another elevator door, and dropping Invisible Soldier.

You will fail here. You are a failure. Do you think listening to that voice inside your head changes ANYTHING?!</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed as the bullet cleanly dodged his body and slammed into the wall.

Right. He had an &#39;anti-projectile&#39; shield. He could stand there all day and Simo&#39;s bullets wouldn&#39;t even scratch him. He had to either get Laurent to drop his shield, or opt to rip and tear.

In the meantime, Laurent pulled out a machine gun and opened fire. There was no need to detect where Simo was. He could just fire until he got lucky with an automatic weapon, and the rate at which he reloaded was maddening. With his speed, he was capable of reloading his bullets as quickly as some of the best men in the Finnish Army.

Nonetheless, he continued his covering fire. All he had to do was continue to corner Simo until Friedrich could incapacitate Gustave. Nonetheless, it didn&#39;t matter. Laurent was a man fueled by spite and rage. He would absolutely take the chance to rip Simo apart, given the choice.

It would be like fighting a mirror. A twisted, corrupted version that lacked a sniper rifle, but a mirror, nonetheless.

Laurent stopped firing for a few seconds, before flinging a grenade towards Simo&#39;s hiding spot. There it was. That murderous intent.

Something the White Death was more than okay with doing... and so was Simo. &#39;<em>We need to get him close first... Yes, we need to get out of this shaft.</em>&#39; They thought together. 

But before they could even think about continuing an ascent towards Laurent, gunfire rained down the elevator shaft. The gaps between gun fire were so far and few between, the CEO was surpassing even some of the greatest of soldiers in terms of reload speed. 

Bullets dinged around the Elevator Door Simo was now taking refuge in, keeping the Sniper pinned to this singular location. <strong>Laurent Mackenzie had gone mad with power</strong>. 

Something which Simo almost fell into becoming if it were not for the intervention given  to him by Nietzsche. 

Then there was a break in the firing, longer than the pattern Laurent had made... 

And then the grenade landed in his perch.... 

<strong>BOOM</strong> 

The blast of the grenade sent The Finn flying back down the elevator shaft, out of the door he was using for cover.  Smoke again covered the elevator shaft, and began to billow upwards towards the CEO&#39;s location.

The white coat of assassin was all but dust, as he patted the flames off his body, and drug himself back into a crouching position. Then he made his way into another elevator door, and began to pry it open. 

Scrambling into whatever office space might be behind it, potentially having this be the space they can use to lure Laurent in.

A revolution it was at the time and there was one man who led the charge...</em>&quot; He waxed on before the door flew off its hinges and threatened to flatten him to nothing but a portrait.

With a flourish of his cane, Gustave charmed the rug below him into being, the whole floor raising up like a great cobra to strike against the interloper. It blew back, using the momentum to wrap the door into itself as it went, letting Gustave ride upon its back until he could see the servant responsible and the monster which he served. 

&quot;A pleasure, Mr. MacKenzie and our mutual friend is everywhere and nowhere. Seek him out at your heart&#39;s content,&quot; he gave a mock bow before his artificial eyes met with the divine orbs of his rival.

&quot;Caster of Olympus, we finally have the pleasure of meeting. I hear you gave my own servant quite the service, using a greek parable no less. Were you in older dress, I&#39;d almost want to call you Aesop! But I suppose I must keep you occupied while we chat so forgive me if I lose my wind briefly.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The businessman&#39;s face twisted into a frown as Simo continued dodging in between cover. He was like a fly. A fly Laurent was longing to swat. If a grenade wasn&#39;t enough, perhaps it was time to get up close and personal.

A ruler should be willing to get his hands dirty.

Laurent followed the screeching of elevator doors being forced open, and saw Simo trying to escape. Look at him go. &quot;<strong>Too hot, Simo?</strong>&quot; The elevator shaft lacked A/C, and it lead to a thin layer of sweat forming on his brow.

The room Simo had broken into was a showroom, used as a display for a 216:1 scale model of MacKenzie Delphi Offices, as well as a future upgraded building, eeriely similar to MacKenzie Tower? <em>This</em> eyesore is what Simo and Gustave would have to look at for the rest of their lives? The stakes were never higher.

&quot;<strong>Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</strong>&quot; Laurent said as he stepped out of the dust cloud, gun in hand. &quot;<strong>This is what Delphi has in store. A city to rival the splendor of Olympia. A brighter future. Once I run my Delphian competitors out of business, and you&#39;re out of my way...</strong>&quot; Laurent smirked. &quot;<strong>Both cities will be mine.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Lay down your weapons. One duo has already surrendered before me, and left Delphi. Surrender on Gustave&#39;s behaf, and I will let you both live. I&#39;ll even let him go back to painting. No muss. No fuss. What do you say?</strong>&quot;

The Assassin broke into the display room. Now faced with a scale model to the eyesore which threatens to take over Simo’s new home. A reminder of what is at stake if he and Gustave lose…

Laurent called out something from within the elevator shaft. Mentioning the heat that was building within it. 

The White Death wanted to topple the scale building, but was held back for now.  

Footsteps were heard, and the rat spoke again. Simo stayed hidden, slowing his breathing. The CEO was trying to draw out the assassin. 

Steps were getting closer. Laurent loved to hear himself speak. Then he was next to the sniper. 

Simo let the White Death take control. Muscles bulging as their strength increased, lunging upwards and gripping his neck tightly. Before slamming the man into the ground. “You talk too much, roach. We will not let you take away our second home. Gustave and We understand that stopping you is of utmost importance, even if we perish in the process.” 

As if it were a feral beast it bared down on the man, threatening to take a chunk out of the businessman’s throat.

That was the one thought rushing through Laurent&#39;s mind as Simo got the jump on him. He had expected a dialogue, but Simo was both an Assassin and a snake in the grass. When better to strike at an opponent too difficult to overpower then when he expected a conversation?

&quot;<strong>Hrrk... Gah!</strong>&quot; Laurent sputtered as Simo began to crush his windpipe. The sniper had gotten what he had wanted: Laurent had shut up. The machine gun was dropped, forgotten.

He tried pulling at Simo&#39;s arms, attempting to pry the White Death off of him in an attempt to retaliate. No dice. Single-minded determination kept Simo on top.

Death, however, would not stop Laurent today. Dying twice had taught him a lesson. He would not perish, and he would not falter. That was his greatest strength.

Simo would feel cold metal against his abdomen. Laurent smiled.

<strong>BANG</strong>!

Laurent shot Simo in the gut with his revolver. 

Acting quickly, Laurent used the shock of the assault to push Simo off of him, before struggling to his feet. He had to act quickly if he was to maximize the benefit of his sneak attack. Laurent rushed towards Simo, altering his gravity so that he would fall towards the ceiling.

&quot;<strong>Don&#39;t <em>fuck</em> with me, Hayha!</strong>&quot; Laurent snarled as he kicked Simo right as he began falling towards the ceiling, sending the sniper towards the back of the room. 

&quot;<strong>Why does nobody listen to me?</strong>&quot; Laurent ranted at Simo, who was now on the ceiling. &quot;<strong>Don&#39;t you people understand what I&#39;m offering you? Better wages, the elimination of the aristocracy... The unification of two cities. I offer you scum more and more, but NOBODY is grateful!</strong>&quot; With one fluid motion, Laurent fired his remaining bullets towards his opponent.

The CEO clawed and clawed but it did not release. Their grip only tightening in response. 

But then something was felt against their abdomen, then a gun fire rang through their ears. Blood splattering the ceiling above. 

A ringing stuck in their ears, as Laurent gave one final shove. Sending the assassin to the ceiling into its own blood. Then punted towards the further end of the ceiling. 

Almost unnaturally, The White Death rose from the ceiling. Stepping forwards, the bullet fire striking them. But not ceasing it’s forwards motion. Blood weeping from their wounds. 

It then summoned the rifle and stabbed downwards aiming to skewer the CEO. Magical coalescing, a chant was heard underneath its breath. Then fire right into his chest.

&quot; Mr. Renoir I am flattered to be compared to Aesop, but I am merely an admirer of the Greeks. Such a good job their art did at expressing human emotion.&quot;&#160; Nietzsche swiveled his office chair towards the Master looking him in the face. 

Caster felt little urgency to swing at Gustave once more. Nietzsche had observed the destruction his Mage craft was capable of and didn&#39;t wish to jump head first into a battle. If anything Nietzsche was fully relying on Laurent, he had crafted him into the Overman for this purpose. Laurents strength came from Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy afterall. 

&quot;To speak of Aesop in an era like this, you are classically educated yes?&quot; If Gustave possessed a classical education; Nietzsche thought perhaps it was possible that the master was aware of his philosophy.

<em>&quot;...And is in sculpture that Pablo Picasso found yet another way to deconstruct art, rendering it down to its raw essentials and seemingly reassembling them in a crude form, provocative in its disregard for millennia-old artistic tradition. You could call it a form of re-invention, to redefine an artform that had grown just as static as its raw material, now given a new surreal lifeblood.&quot;</em> 


&quot;And yes, the ancient Greeks were some of the first I learned about in my studies. It was practically required in a city with a name like Delphi. Though you may be disappointed in the lack of women with prophetic insight in the city. Though perhaps we as its merchants and tradesmen are its gestalt version of the great mystic, letting the invisible coils of the market guide our hands to a new future. I&#39;d argue its a better master than a tyrannical archon or foreign emperor. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, hmm?&quot;

Caster was of course on the lookout for an attack, however, he didn&#39;t expect much from Gustave. It would be considered suicide to attack a servant. Based on that fact alone Nietzsche felt he could control the pace of this meeting. 

&quot;Merchants and Tyrants are all the same Gustave. There is no world where a slave morality is healthy. From my short time in this world, I have seen businessman assume the roles of kings... But I digress&quot; Nietzsche leaned forward in his chair getting his face closer to Gustave. This man knew how to talk, this excited the philosopher. 

&quot;I&#39;d rather not fret over such philosophy, instead Gustave let me know of yourself. What art do you admire?&quot; Nietzsche could talk philosophy if he wanted to all day. However, for once he felt that philosophy was not the right move. Instead Caster wanted to learn of Gustave&#39;s interests. If he was as intune with the art world as he seemed to be; conversations of such could reveal many details of Gustave&#39;s person.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Naturally, Assassins were good at assassinating. Simo was shrewd and battle smart. Laurent was not. All he had was a large amount of power at his fingertips.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re on your last leg. Give up. Surrender on behalf of Gustave. What could you possibly want so badly that you&#39;d drag yourself to my door for?</strong>&quot; Laurent sneered as Simo prepared to shoot him once again. Stupid Servant. Suddenly, Simo plunged down.

Laurent would&#39;ve died, if not for his newfound powers.

His perception was contantly kicked into overdrive, thanks to Friedrich. Every action, every detail, every precise moment was ingrained into Laurent&#39;s mind. If he wanted to, he could count snowflakes as they fell.

Simo&#39;s maneuver wouldn&#39;t faze him.

Yet he wasn&#39;t fast enough.

Laurent caused Simo to lurch, falling towards the side of the wall. While that was able to stop Simo&#39;s bullet, which ricocheted around the room, before knocking over Laurent&#39;s miniature display of Delphi.

Simo&#39;s trusty rifle&#39;s blade, however, fell with its owner, tearing a gash in Laurent&#39;s chest as its original stab was interrupted. The White Death struck true.

If Laurent was in pain, he didn&#39;t show it, blindly moving forward towards his ultimate goal. He was <em>so</em> close to victory. He had helped kill a famous king, a bard, and the greatest traitor of the Roman Empire. To think that he would be stopped by some measly sniper was laughable. As such, he would not stop. Not yet.

He had to kill Simo. Then, he&#39;d kill Gustave.

Laurent&#39;s hand grasped the fallen Delphi replica, before flinging it towards Simo with a mixture of Magecraft and physical might.

Mid lunge, gravity shifted once more. The bullet going wide, thankfully the bayonet itself had landed true. Opening a gash into the Buisnessman’s skin. 

Simo took the reigns once again, while being sent into the wall. The Lecture from Gustave bringing a sense of peace to the assassin, his master was still safe. 

The Businessman continued forwards. Flinging what remained of the Delphi model towards The Finn.  Painfully he crouched and took aim with his rifle, shooting the incoming replica as if it were a clay pigeon. 

“Giving up isn’t something either myself, or Gustave like to do. How do you think we both survived this long.” Simo spoke as he swapped from rifle to SMG, firing a barrage of bullets towards the man. In an effort to overload his magical circuits.

All men should take control of their destiny or someone will decide for them. I suppose that is what you mean, yes? It feels almost like a generality or an old wive&#39;s tale to me at this point, though I suppose that&#39;s what we get in old age...&quot; the old man&#39;s synthetic eyes flickered for a moment, going over Nietzche&#39;s features.

&quot;What art do I admire? Hoho, sounds a tad bit like someone is trying to dig for information though my tastes are already known, Laurent has seen them many times already. Perhaps you&#39;d be surprised to discover that period of art which is precious to me is the very same that took inspiration from your work. It&#39;s what the old world called modernism though it&#39;s too broad a term to define anything beside the fact it was in a sense a revolution against the old masters of art: the Greeks, the Romans, the Renaissance. They were all too focused on portraying reality and not enough on the chaos of human emotion and motion. it should be the will of man that generates creation and not merely copying the world as we saw it. To break free of old traditions and forge a new perspective,&quot; Gustave could feel the energy surge through his limbs just from the words that rolled off his tongue and the passion that propelled them forward. His eyes glowed all the more brighter.

&quot;<strong>Luck. Luck and petty tricks. The only reason I failed to end this ridiculous game with you back in Delphi was due to sheer chance. And as for Gustave...</strong>&quot;

Laurent smirked as the bullets dodged him, hitting everything else in the room except for him. He had plenty of magical energy to spare. There was no reason for him to be afraid of a petty machine gun.

Yet his circuits <em>were</em> getting itchy. Fighting Ching and Kun Wu had taken a lot out of him, and in the three days, he had constantly been using his barrier to prevent attacks.

&quot;<strong>...he is just as lucky. He&#39;s one trip down the stairs from expiring. He should&#39;ve signed the contract with me when he had the chance, and we could have reaped the rewards of this ridiculous war <em>together</em>!</strong>&quot;

Simo suddenly found himself flying towards the elevator shaft, where he slammed into another set of elevator doors across from the room Laurent was now standing alone in.

&quot;<strong>But that is fine. He is unneeded. If I&#39;m feeling generous, I&#39;ll let his grandchildren live.</strong>&quot;

He walked forward carefully, yet clearly cautious. A grenade pin was pulled, and flung towards Simo. It would fall straight towards him, following him as if he were its center of gravity.

Each bullet harmlessly being sent in a wide berth around the CEO. Not having their intended effect of placing more stress upon his circuits. 

Then as if he were a puppet on strings. An invisible force flung the sniper through the elevator doors again, and sent him crashing into a pair of doors opposite. Knocking the wind out of Simo. 

‘<em>We need to move… he threw a grenade…</em>’ From within their mind the white death hissed, but Simo remained stationary. Still trying to get up. 

There was an image that flashed in their mind. Transported back in time, pain radiating from their jaw. 

Breathing was hard. 

The light was fading.

This was going to be it.

The Soviets would take over Finland. Assimilate it into the USSR. 

Depressing thoughts to die with. 

Noises were heard from above, how much time had passed? How much blood was lost? 

Snow was then removed from the false burial mound, encasing Simo. 

“<em>He’s alive!</em>” “<em>Simo!</em>” “<em>The bastard really made it.</em>” The Voices rose to a cacophony as light pierced through the snow. Revealing a figure which did not match the time period, an elderly man. Face obscured by memory, but voice unmistakeable. But also blurred through the filter of memory. 

The elderly hand reached down and pulled the assassin from his snowy tomb. Shoving them back into reality as the grenade approached ever closer. 

Simo and The White Death moved their arm, aiming the rifle at the last moment. Taking a shot exploding the grenade meters from them, shrapnel and heat still showering their body. 

Adding to the wounds which were already threatening to tear apart the Assassin of Delphi’s body. But they continued on, sliding their body up in the elevator door. “You’re getting sloppy, Mackenzie. Being on the front lines must not suit you.” They spat out blood.</span>

“<strong>Die already.</strong>” Two voices overlapped were heard, as the Finn was on Laurent. 

Accelerated speed from an invisible spot the bayonet jabbed. Once, twice, dozens of time, looking to make a pin cushion from the man before them.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche pulled his mustache hairs listening carefully to Gustave&#39;s words. It was as if the Master knew the perfect words to swoon Nietzsche over ideology. However, there was one problem. Gustave did not understand Laurent, at least not completely. 

&quot;Modernism... Yes I have read much about it since being summoned here. The movement of independence, it is something I truly yearned for in my age. To see such a movement fail... It pains my heart Gustave.&quot; Nietzsche sat back in his chair his eyes trailing to the floor and back up again. Humanities current state was a clear cause of pain for Caster. Nietzsche showed empathy for the human race. History had often depicted Nietzsche as a nihilstic man with little care for people; how misunderstood his writing was. 

Caster pulled forward once more placing his fists on the table, he carried a sudden vigor in his eyes. &quot;Despite that Gustave I do not fear the future, my destiny, the human destiny. There is still hope and I place that hope in Laurent. You dismiss him as tyrannical and evil, and although he may be those things he is true to himself. Laurent has achieved a level of self mastery that most philosophers would drool over. The Laurent MacKenzie you know is not the Laurent MacKenzie that I know. Do not speak ideas that you can not follow! Laurent is a man of action, of new ideals, he is the begining of the Overman, from this point on human independence will be realized.&quot; 

There was a burning passion on Nietzsche&#39;s soul. His words struck Gustave&#39;s ears with a stern compassion. Caster truly believed that somehow, a person like Laurent could make the world a better place.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;It is a bitter end but like anything, any art trend, no matter how great or encompassing it is, will eventually fade from the public eye, but it lives on through the people it has touched and inspires them to create new art. And thus the cycle continues and perhaps a revival is just around the corner? Who can say for certain but it&#39;s the possibility that keeps me going,&quot; the glimmer continues to shine in the old man&#39;s eyes. &quot;That&#39;s the one true gift I want to leave behind, art that will inspire the next generation to pick up the brush, take the lessons I learned to heart and make the world their canvas in a similar yet different way than I have done. The world is a subjective place and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&quot;

Gustave rapped his cane against the side of the chair several times as Caster spilled his own view on Laurent. He could not agree with the philosopher but he fed the words to Simo regardless. 

&quot;So he is this Overman you speak of? From what I have heard, he can give servants a serious competitor. I think he will find an equal match in my dear student Simo. He has refined his technique to a new form of art, even since our last encounter. There is a unity to his body and soul now that could not be shaken by a million men or the heavens above.  I have full faith that he will be the one to cast the last stone in this engagement.&quot; Gustave pulled out a cloth and cleaned his glasses while he spoke, exposing the artificial circuits that ran like sliver veins through his eyes and meshed among the fibers of his irises. &quot;Though Nietzche, answer me this. Would the &#220;bermensch collapse in on himself should the pillars on which he stands are swept away by a stroke of the pen or brush? It did not take much else to take down the monstrous misapplication of your own words after all and what is a gun but a pen that writes in lead and blood?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Simo was right. Laurent didn&#39;t belong on the front lines. He was a businessman, not a soldier. He moved men to fight, not himself. Laurent and Simo may have been equal opponents in terms of raw power, but in skill, Laurent was far outclassed.

Luckily, he had Magecraft.

&quot;<strong>Sloppy? Me? Nonsense. I&#39;ve simply calculated how much effort it will take to kick your ass.</strong> Laurent responded confidently as he marched towards Simo. The sniper couldn&#39;t have that much left. He was no knight class, nor was he a hero of myth. He was a simple man, given power by his Class Container.

Nothing more.

Laurent&#39;s eyes narrowed as Simo disappeared from sight. Where did he go? Where would he go? Laurent&#39;s eyes darted throughout the room. Staying in this room was dangerous. Laurent leapt through the door into the elevator shaft, before lashing himself to the wall. A hallway that Laurent could manipulate at will was far safer than a simple room.

However, an Assassin was good at one thing over all others: killing humans.

If killing humans meant being five steps ahead, then Simo would be too.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There it was again, that chill. That familiar freezing of snow. Laurent, with all his prowess, barely had a second to react before getting stabbed by Simo&#39;s bayonet. Again. And again. And again.

Blood fell down the shaft, though in Laurent&#39;s eyes, it was zooming away from him. Despite the copious, almost excessive jabbing, Laurent managed to use the blade&#39;s contact with his body to mark it, and send it and Simo flying in different directions. Brutishly, he spat blood into Simo&#39;s face, causing him and the White Death to let go of their beloved rifle as they slammed into the other wall of the shaft.

&quot;<strong>Die.</strong>&quot; Laurent said simply, madness in his eyes.

Laurent lashed the rifle towards him, before grabbing, spinning, and hurling it towards Simo&#39;s heart like a lance with the force of a tidal wave, fueled by absolute disgust for Simo as an individual.

It hit home. The snow was stained red with the blood of soldiers.

&quot;<strong>See, it&#39;s hard for me to die three times. I have no other &#39;get out of jail free cards&#39; to spend. And what were you, really? A soldier with a kill count. Go on, join them.</strong>&quot; Laurent said as he released the Magecraft holding Simo to the wall of the elevator shaft, leaving them to fall down to the ground floor with a sickening <strong>crunch</strong>. Their rifle quickly joined them.

&quot;<strong>That is that, then. I have a date with destiny.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, releasing all Magecraft with the exception of the spell holding him to the wall. There would be no need for projectile protection against Gustave, and he had to save his magical energy.

&quot;<strong>Try to hold on for a bit, Simo Hayha! I&#39;ll send the old man&#39;s body down to join you in a bit!</strong>&quot; 

Laurent&#39;s laugh rung in Simo&#39;s ears as he walked upwards, towards his penthouse.

Seemingly only needing contact of some form, even if that contact is a stab, to activate his control over gravity. 

Blood then entered their eyes, allowing for the CEO to wrench their rifle free. Sending Simo and The White Death falling backwards again. Their temporary blindness preventing the sight of the next attack coming their way.

“<strong>NEV-</strong>” 

Assassin of Delphi was cut off, the bayonet striking through their body. Pinning them to the wall. They attempted to claw free but soon enough their energy was quickly evaporating. 

Simo Hayha’s second body, fell limp. Invisible Soldier dropping, tears mingling with the blood and the snow below him. Before Laurent unceremoniously let his body fall, The Rifle coming loose, and more pain was sent through the sniper’s body. A hole was now visible where a heart should be. 

“<em>Gustave… I’m Sorry… he will… be up there… soon…</em>” Weakly Simo communicated through his mental link to Gustave. Disrupting the lecture.</span>

The only warmth coming from what blood trickled down from his face. 

In the peripheries a demon stood, patiently waiting. Both wholly consuming the space and not. 

“We have done well. You his shadow, and we his demons.” It spoke through a low growl, uncomfortably close to his ear. “Now is not the time to <strong>die</strong>.” 

“The master did say… that there would be more meals waiting for us, with the new family. We must ensure that both he and we are there.” 

Again voices were heard from above. Again light shone through, but this time the demon took the lead. 

Forcibly dragging the body of Simo out of the snow, meeting the light. The Elderly gentleman there once again. Taking the other arm of the man and lifting him up with help of the demon. 

Then The White Death transposed itself over Simo, before returning to the real world. 

Golden light was beginning to form but Wounded Demon finally activated keeping the soldier in one piece. Staving off the threat of dying once again. 

The face of Simo was not there in this moment. It was replaced by a hungry maw, two piercing red eyes, and other obfuscated features as if the face was being covered by a snow storm. 

Unnaturally the body drug itself into a standing position, almost as if it were a marionette. It’s arm reaching downwards and gripping the rifle, bright red blood still staining its barrel and bayonet. 

“<em>I can still… get him… just… stall…</em>” Then another voice spoke through the link, The White Death. “<em>We shall end his encroachment on Delphi today.</em>” 

The White Death, with its unnatural strides, began upwards. Moving slowly due to injuries sustained but still keeping on stride. It was going to catch up with Laurent Mackenzie one way, or another.</span>

Was he really so naive to believe the Overman to be a fragile idea? The Ubermensch was immortalized in the morals that created it. You can not kill an idea. 

&quot;Gustave you do not understand what the Ubermensch is. The Ubermensch is an idea, a state of existence. The pillars on which it stands are not tangible, you cannot undo it.&quot; 

Nietzsche stood up from his chair pushing it back rather violently his hands left the table falling to his sides, the Philosopher was done with the conversation. Gustave was not the man he had hoped. &quot;Gustave ideas and words can be twisted but our intentions are never lost. I am not afraid of hearsay, my own words are more powerful. You have greatly misunderstood the pinnacle on which philosophy stands.&quot;

Thus, the man of the hour appeared, stepping through the ruined penthouse doors, covered in blood. Despite that though, he was grinning.

&quot;<strong>That&#39;s that. Your Assassin can&#39;t last much longer, Gustave.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, wagging a finger gracefully. If he knew of Simo&#39;s survival, he didn&#39;t show it. It was more likely that he was aware, but didn&#39;t think Simo would make it up the shaft.

&quot;<strong>The City Grail War is at its end. How fitting for it to conclude at Olympia&#39;s future seat of power. How many wishes were crushed to make this reality possible? Dozens? Hundreds? Nonetheless, it does not matter. They have paved the way for a new age of splendor.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Admittedly, I was somewhat interested in what such a shriveled old man could want. I&#39;ve read your file, and yet I still cannot shake the lingering feeling that there is something... <em>more</em>.</strong>

Laurent slowly and methodically reloaded his revolver, clearly savoring the moment. His gaze lingered on Friedrich, before returning back to his primary opponent.

&quot;<strong>But now I realize something: I do not care. You do not have good values, like Lark and his Lancer, or like that street urchin and his Rider. You&#39;ve committed a far greater sin:</strong>&quot;

The safety on the revolver clicked off.

&quot;<strong>You bore me.</strong>&quot;

The old man knew what the tone in Simo&#39;s message meant and he had to suppress a shiver as he received it and a few tears as he responded mentally. He had the good fortune not to lose a child yet but his adoptive one believed himself to be short on time. Still he couldn&#39;t let himself fall to those emotions. He had stayed strong even when he lost his most precious sense and he would do so even under threat of losing both his life and that of his servant.

He shielded his eyes for a brief second so Caster could not see his efforts but was easy enough to do under the cover of cleaning his glasses. Though he shot up in his seat when Nietzsche slammed his arms back.

&quot;Mr. Nietzsche, I have to disagree with you on this. I know full well the fundamentals of philosophy, they run the same through my own profession. I do apologize, however if I have hit a sore spot. I see you&#39;re more sensitive about these things than most but I have gotten what I ultimately came here for. Unfortunately, I am afraid only one of us can leave this room. I can&#39;t have you going and influencing the fight further than you already have...&quot; Gustave stood up opposite of the servant, bringing up his cane and running it between fingers and palm. Nietzsche would watch as the wooden cane was molded into an old-fashioned cavalry saber, its reformed edge cutting the narrowest of slits on Gustave&#39;s palm. He moved to cut down the philosopher only to be interrupted by the intrusion of Laurent himself.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He stared in a mix of horror and admiration of the bloody canvas before him. The presence of Laurent did not bode well for Simo&#39;s likely fate and his immediate future. Yet what the Assassin had wrought on the Overman was a masterpiece of unabashed hatred and frenzied passion. Art need not be pigment and linen to be appreciated. 

&quot;And so it goes, Laurent. We are all approaching our end here today. I do not care if either Simo or myself leave here alive for we will do so regardless as free men, bound by nothing but our bodies and passions,&quot; the older man said with a stoic face hewn from rock and metal, the wooden saber at his side, its metal edge catching the same gleam as his glasses and the eyes behind them.

&quot;It is a tragedy that so many had to have their dreams snuffed out here for the wishes of one victor but the splendor it may bring will not last forever. Nothing material can ever hold to that dream. My family nearly drove itself to extiniction over such grandeur and it is not something we shall repeat.&quot;

&quot;I bore you? <strong>Good!</strong> An artist should always let his piece speak a thousand times louder than himself for it will be what he is ultimately remembered for!&quot; In an instant, Laurent&#39;s gun fired, letting forth a bullet, the same make as the one that should have ended his life on <span class="mention">#rooftop-park</span> a few weeks ago. Gustave&#39;s blade lit up in flame and the smoke billowed off of it in thick, sinewy ropes, beginning their ever-turning dance. As the bullet made its way towards the old artist and crossed through the smoke, the metals began to twist in inexplicable ways, turning a typical ballistic arc into a drunkard&#39;s walk. The end product was a leaden snowflake halfway imbedded in Laurent&#39;s floor, the collision doing nothing to stop its perfect radial symmetry.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche gritted his teeth as Gustave gave a rebuttal. Something about the old man hit Nietzsche in a sour spot. normally the philosopher would find joy in conversing with an opposing well-minded individual. But Gustave… Gustave was different. He claimed to stand for something that Nietzsche did not see in him. He did not want Gustave to say he was well versed in the pillars of philosophy, he wanted the old man to prove it! Renoir however, would not prove himself, instead, he would try to strike at the Philosopher.

Caster stepped forward ready to fight back, however, Laurent had different plans. Nietzsche turned his head to see a blood-covered Laurent MacKenzie burst through the penthouse doors. His words gave caster confidence that his Overman had won. After all Nietzsche expected no less.

A grin appeared across Nietzsche&#39;s face; Laurent addressed Gustave with harsh and honest words, a new battle was about to commence. Caster would excitedly watch as his Overman confronted their shared enemy. He would do nothing to interfere, a man who could slay servants should have no trouble with a Master.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent nodded, as if Gustave had finally said something intelligent. 

The first bullet he fired, aimed towards Gustave&#39;s skull, collapsed into fractal nothingness, going to a place Laurent couldn&#39;t even begin to comprehend. Nonetheless, Laurent was as fast and as strong as a Servant now. Gustave&#39;s meaningless party tricks were nothing more than hot air.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re right.</strong>&quot; He said, agreeing with Gustave&#39;s last statement. He held up a singularity, fueled by the magical energy saved from dropping his personal barrier. Into it went Gustave&#39;s bounded field. Laurent smiled.

<strong>BANG!</strong>

He shot Gustave in the knee faster than he could even process the thought, forcing the old man to the ground.

&quot;<strong>This is the finale of the City Grail War. There is no need for tired nonsense like a fight to the death.</strong>&quot;

Laurent stomped his foot into Gustave&#39;s wound, grinding away with it with his newly shined shoes. Each one cost as Gustave&#39;s housing.

&quot;<strong>You can die slowly, then. It can be a test of endurance between you and your Assassin. Who will collapse first, you, or him?</strong>&quot;

Blood pooled around Gustave as Laurent and his Servant watched in interest. Giddiness entered Laurent&#39;s mind like a flood as he realized the implications of shooting Gustave. Simo was dying at the bottom of the elevator shaft, and Gustave would bleed out. He was old. He could not last forever.

He had won.

&quot;<strong>But this is just the beginning.</strong>&quot; Laurent breathed, excitement in his eyes. &quot;<strong>Soon, every Polaris, every Dhruva, every Cynosura, every <em>Stella Maris</em> will know my name, and all will accept me as their rightful ruler! They will come to know Friedrich&#39;s ideals. <em>My</em> ideals. A world that serves me. A world that benefits me. A world of OVERME—</strong>&quot;

Blood was trailing them, the servant inching ever closer to their destination. It was painful but they still persisted. 

Eventually they arrived to the penthouse. Laurent Mackenzie staring down the now downed Gustave Renoir. Friedrich Nietzsche in the background, potentially about to join in fighting Gustave. 

&quot;<em>We... Were too late... Sorry master.</em>&quot; The White Death spoke as it came upon the scene. Arm now raised and magical energy collecting at the rifle&#39;s barrel. 

Their aim was less than ideal, but it would have to do. A singular shot was all it would take to end this. 

A chill would be felt, but for the self-absorbed Laurent it was too late. Simo Hayha and The White Death had come to undo the Overman. 

“<strong>VALKOINEN KUOLEMA! BULLET OF THE WHITE DEATH.</strong>” 

The trigger was pulled, and the bullet rang out. Tearing through the CEO.  Severing his torso from his legs as the projectile made easy work of his flesh and bone.

Their final task in this war was now fulfilled. The obscured face became human once more, with the maw of a demon still attached, as Simo fell down.

His legs flew forward, splattering Gustave and Friedrich with blood as Laurent&#39;s upper body crashing into a wall, causing him to slide down. and stare towards his Servant and enemy Master in a mixture of shock and confusion.

<em>This. Again.</em> Laurent thought dully as warmth seeped out of his body. Didn&#39;t he have his barrier up? Why did Assassin&#39;s Noble Phantasm pierce through it? He hadn&#39;t turned it off, had he?

Oh. Right.

&quot;<strong>THIS CAN&#39;T BE HAPPENING! HOW DID YOU SURVIVE? I KILLED YOU. YOU SHOULD&#39;VE LEFT THAT FRAME BEHIND. HOW DID I—</strong>&quot;

Laurent screamed, spittle flying from his mouth as he turned towards where Assassin would be standing...

Only to see him collapsed. The rage died in Laurent&#39;s throat as he saw the writing on the wall: Assassin had sacrificed himself to kill Laurent. Even if Laurent had torn every limb, every nail, every digit from his opponent&#39;s form, they would&#39;ve come to finish the job.

He had underestimated Assassin&#39;s capacity for malice.

&quot;<strong>This couldn&#39;t be helped, could it?</strong>&quot; Laurent sighed, voice losing the fullness of Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm. &quot;Business. People. Predictions. That&#39;s what I&#39;m best with. The thick of battle? Not so much. I guess that goes for you too. You should&#39;ve just signed that damn contract, and we could&#39;ve left this behind.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s eyes gazed at a painting on the wall, covered by blood. It was a group of people, though their faces were obscured.

&quot;This was a terrible business venture. I should&#39;ve abandoned this after my Assassin revealed himself. After I killed him. Chasing after shadows on the wall, hoping to make a difference. What a waste of time.&quot;

Despite the vindication, Laurent seemed genuinely satisfied. He looked over at his Servant. He tried to meet his gaze, before looking away. He couldn&#39;t even look the philosopher in the eye.</span>

&quot;And yet...&quot;

Laurent slammed his fist into the floor.

&quot;<strong>I was so close. I was going to change this city. The world. You all would&#39;ve been ruled for me, but that rule would not have been cruel. You see what I&#39;ve done with this company. Think about what I could&#39;ve done with a <em>nation</em>!</strong>&quot; Laurent bemoaned.

Then again, the Church would never release their hold on this city. He had seen what they had done to Lark and Lancer. There was no way they would simply hand the city over to him without leveling it to the ground.

That had been a reason for escaping onto Delphi, but in the end, this was his home. He could not simply abandon it.

His campaign had been a sham from the word go.

&quot;Friedrich... Next time you&#39;re summoned, I hope you find the person you&#39;re looking for. Please... don&#39;t let Claire see me like this.&quot;

Laurent&#39;s eyes glazed over as his glasses fell onto his lap. &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t want to die. Not again.</strong>

For one moment, his eyes gained focus, and he glared towards Gustave. &quot;<strong>I name you Victor of the City Grail War. Congratulations, Gustave. I hope it&#39;s worth the destruction of paradise.</strong>&quot;

He slumped over, dead.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With a brushstroke of smoke and flame, Gustave began to paint his defiance against the unconquerable force that was Laurent MacKenzie and his desire for dominion over all. A beautiful stroke it was, reshaping a lethal slug into inert art. Yet his opponent would heed his own words and mercilessly strike him down with the second, snuffing out his bounded field in an instant.

In that moment, Gustave got a glimpse of what it truly meant to rebel against those who had once controlled him. They operated on a scale that would humble any man, no matter how brightly his creation shone. His eyes may have flickered with a defiant light but already he could feel gravity bearing down on him, threatening to smother the artist&#39;s spark out completely.

<em>&quot;Simo... I need you... now...&quot;</em>  he groaned under Laurent&#39;s heel, crushing the ruined joint beyond repair and only increasing the rate at which his life spilled out.  He contemplated letting himself drown away in his own failures and dreams. He had done so much already. Simo and he had given their best and gotten farther than either expected, now brushing against the symbol of authority that had once quashed their own dreams in the past. What more was there to do. Would he not die a free man?

Yet even as he closed his eyes to conserve the fading energy, there was a light there, one that shone with a brilliance far beyond any spectacular demonstration of magecraft and rich in hues no painting could match. It was a treasure eternal, one that could not be snuffed by time or tyrant. He had created a family who cared for him and there was a family he had built over just the span of a few weeks with a wayward winter spirit. If he faded now, where would they be without him? Subject to torment from Laurent?

He opened his eyes again and spied the glimmer of snowflakes. His family had returned...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Finn did what Gustave could not and brought the full spirit of a small defiant nation against a conqueror many times over in strength and size, defying the odds for a spectacular short time. A moment condensed into a single bullet, one that would turn Laurent&#39;s office into an abstract tableau of humanity stretched to its limits and the price they paid: exhaustion, shattered limbs, blood and extinguished dreams...

And with his masterpiece down, Simo made his final bow and collapsed onto the floor, tragedy now infusing the piece, like any great work to be remembered for the ages.

With Laurent&#39;s last protests, Gustave took the chance to tear his coat to shreds and mend it into a makeshift tourniquet to stem the grievous injury. He then grabbed hold of his cane and made his way onto unsure feet, collapsing once before using furniture to hobble his way over to Laurent&#39;s body. 

&quot;You have crumbled the dreams of others to get to this peak, and I suppose I have too. Neither of us is perfect, flawed in our own terrible ways and our own dreams should deserve to crumble in point. But what about our children&#39;s dreams?&quot; Gustave said, his voice softer than before and with a bit of gravel in it.

&quot;I remember what you said on the garden. You will not carry out your design, but your daughter? I&#39;ll see fit she learns from your legacy and crafts something better from this mess we leave behind. She will not be without family either. Take that to your grave and hopefully it grants you some solace...&quot; 

 &quot;I do, as well, Laurent. But it is not up to me to decide.&quot;  With that, the grail war was finally over, though Gustave did not believe he had won the war. Was it not a net loss in the end, nothing but a cautionary tale to warn the future of the danger of pursuing a power which should not exist? It had already sundered his family and a city too. He did not know if Delphi and Olympia were next but there was one member of his family that may be taken away yet.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Simo Hayha lay there, rifle in hand still. Hole where a heart should be, another where a bullet had pierced his stomach, and various other injuries covering his body. 

It had been since the battle against Rider that The Finn had even looked to be in this bad of a condition. 

Within his mind he sat across from a demonic figure. Both staring one another down. Silence shared between them, before The Sniper broke it. 

‘<em>we did it, I suppose. Thank you.</em>’ 

There was only a pleased growl in response. The demon then slinking away into the recesses of their mind. 

Assassin was now left alone, while his body was about to fall apart. But something else was felt, something warm. Familiar in these past few weeks of being alive again. 

Simo’s eyes would faintly open up, and his mouth would crack a smile. “Gustave…” The sniper’s grip upon his rifle had loosened, and weekly he tried to pat the elderly gentleman on the back. “The… honor… was all mine… thank you… for considering me… a Renoir. Thank you… for being a good ally… and father… the soldier… look… suits you…” The arm fell limp again, and there was a small chuckle heard before a pause.  

“Did I… do well… as him?” The servant then asked, eyes losing their light. As tears mixed with the blood. Golden motes of spiritual energy began to drift off of the assassin.

You are the kind of son I could hope for and one my own will look up to for a long time to come,&quot; He brought an arm up to help fold Simo&#39;s over his chest. Gustave&#39;s eyes started to water over as he did so, realizing the extent of Simo&#39;s condition. &quot;Heh, you think this old man could fight still? Come on, you got a bit left yourself, trooper.&quot;

With the light beginning to transition from Simo&#39;s eyes to motes shedding off of his frame, Gustave managed to give the soldier abandoned by war a smile that he had once seen before, the elderly man that had once rescued him from the drifts. 

&quot;No Simo, you didn&#39;t do as well as him... you did better and now, you deserve your rest in a nice, warm cabin... free from war... free from struggle... free... among family...&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The Assassin’s eyes were now doll like, comforted in his final moments by his master. “Thank you… Gustave.” 

Another pause happened as the light began to drift at a faster pace. “That… sounds wonderful… perhaps… I can show you… what I fought for…” Thoughts of a warm cabin, surrounded by his master and others he cared for comforted The Finn. 

A final message was sent through their mental link, it’s voice more similar to a growl. “<em>Be proud, Gustave Renoir. Of who you were, and who you have become. It is cause of both that we made it to this point.</em>”

Then by the time Gustave had made a look at Simo’s body, it was now just the metallic frame. Remaining behind was a pair of pistols, and a blood soaked bayonet.
