                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Masters came and went. Servants swore allegiance to new lords and ladies, and cities burned. Yet despite it all, the cogs of business still turned. Impressive, in a way. Greed was an excellent motivator. Even if that greed was the simple desire to pay for next week&#39;s rent. 

At the forefront of this was Donovan, the de facto head of operations in Delphi. He had been selected for his prowess in HR and management. He was not much of a salesman, but he didn&#39;t need to be. In a way, he was nothing more than a messenger between MacKenzie Industries of Delphi and corporate back on Olympia.

&quot;Places, everyone. Places! Mr. MacKenzie will be here shortly!&quot; He shouted, checking his watch as he waved about at the two dozen employees working along the office space. All were hired from Delphi, as part of the CEO&#39;s plan to incorporate both cities. 

&quot;A united MacKenzie Industries&quot;, he had said, before quickly rushing out of the conference room due to the appearance of a heavily mustached man. 

Rumors were about. Rumors of Laurent MacKenzie&#39;s participation in the City Grail War. Rumors that him rushing to save his workers was actually a farce, and that his main goal had been to defeat the Servant invading the premises. Whispers of an Assassin.

One that was never seen again. The common rumor was that Laurent had lost, but a video uploaded to DelphiTube™️ was making the rounds that challenged this perspective.

All these thoughts flew through Donovan&#39;s head and more as he stood attentively at the elevator, which opened with a resounding <strong>ding!</strong>

Laurent MacKenzie and a mustached man stepped out of the elevator. Laurent was wearing a blue polo shirt and slacks. All twenty four employees, along with Donovan stood at attention as Laurent&#39;s gaze met theirs. His face split into a smile.

&quot;Thank you all for your hard work. Take an extra paid break. I&#39;ll speak with all of you after talking with Mr. Donovan. Then we can have a quick meeting together, and I&#39;ll be on my way.&quot;</span>

A cruel man who had sunk several other Olympian families into the muck, before swallowing their respective industries. Yet right now, he seemed to be nothing more than a lax manager. 

They dispersed, and Laurent put his hand around Donovan&#39;s shoulder, before guiding him through the office. &quot;I saw that you&#39;ve already made copies of our paper records, and that your staff is almost done linking our records from Olympia&#39;s CWW with Delphi&#39;s. Excellent.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Donovan said, easing up at the praise. &quot;The warehouse has been stocked, as well. The contract with Delphi about repairing their rooftop garden is in place.&quot;

&quot;Good, good...&quot; Laurent said, before trailing off, turning towards Caster. &quot;This is an associate I&#39;ve been meeting in Delphi, Fredrick.&quot; The manager introduced himself to Caster.

&quot;Take a load off with the others. You&#39;ve earned it. Go.&quot; Laurent said, shooing off Donovan.

&quot;What do you think, &#39;Fredrick&#39;?&quot; Laurent said, spreading his arms as Donovan retreated towards the break room. &quot;Is it not magnificent? This is the first step towards our goals.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster’s eyes stuck to the floor of the Delphi offices as he and his master made their rounds. Nietzsche was physically next to Laurent; however, mentally, he was in a world of thought. He was reflecting on his encounter with Assassin. Simo Hayha was an anomaly of a man, two sides of the same soul fighting for control. The philosopher couldn’t help but be excited at the idea of meeting more interesting characters.  To Nietzsche, the Holy Grail War was not just a test of might; it was a competition of wills and philosophies spanning millennia, it was a place for him to prove his work to the world, a place to show how much of a genuine revolutionary he was.

Nietzsche jolted his head up, breaking his concentration,  as Laurent introduced him to Donovan. The philosopher looked lost for a moment before realizing what was going on. He let of a nod towards his Master’s employee before turning his attention to Laurent. 

“Do not conflate anyone’s goals with your own ‘Laurent’’” Nietzsche replied, returning his Master’s use of his first name. “I will, however, admit that your web has spread quite far. Surely our time will be much easier within this place of operation.” As caster spoke, he strolled up to the office windows peering down at the Delphi streets. He considered taking time to visit the integrity bureau now that he was in town. Although he had very few memories of the place, they were all fond memories at that.

“Master, I am curious... Assassins Master, Gustave was it? What is your history with him? I’m sorry to pry, but the more I think about your lack of humility, well, the more interested I am in hearing your story.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Gustave?&quot; Laurent felt a flash of irritation and rage as he heard that name, before quietly disappearing behind a thundercloud of emotion. &quot;When I lost Assassin, I elected to toss my lot in with the Master I found most suited to not ruining Olympia. He was my choice.&quot;

There was far more to it than that, but Laurent wasn&#39;t going to tell Caster that. If he told Caster about how he planned to kill Gustave for his Servant, Caster&#39;s circumstances would become even more suspicious. 

&quot;I&#39;m in a pickle, see. Nobody from Olympia can win, aside from myself. If some nobody wins, they&#39;ll most likely strip people like me of power. If another aristocrat wins, they&#39;ll use it to suck Olympia&#39;s wealth to fatten their accounts.&quot; Laurent explained. Despite all his eccentricities, he did seem to care for Olympia in a twisted sort of way.

Even if it was the type of care that would result in the city being under Laurent&#39;s thumb.

&quot;As part of our agreement, I gave Gustave all of my company in the result of my death. He would then train my daughter to inherit the company. It was to be signed by geass scroll. You saw that a short while ago.&quot;

Laurent looked up, his voice dripping with irritation. &quot;<strong>But he betrayed me. His Assassin tried to kill me during a confrontation with Rider.</strong>&quot; The anger was genuine, but it also housed something else. The fact that he had been beaten to the punch by Assassin hurt.

&quot;I gave him everything he needed, yet he holds moral superiority over me like a dark shadow. He is no wise individual. He&#39;s hypocritical slime.&quot; Laurent said as he walked over to the windows.

&quot;However, I don&#39;t need or care for his opinions. I will claw my way over a mountain of corpses with new insight, new vision. Delphi and Olympia deserve a good leader. One who can elevate people to new heights. That is my goal.&quot;

Laurent looked towards Caster. &quot;Even if, in the end, that is selfish, is it not honorable?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche nodded along with Laurents explanation of the Gustave drama. Laurent was a brilliant businessman, however this deal has not gone his way. Even the best of the best are destined to fail every now and then.

&quot;Honorable no, selfish yes. Do not disguise your desires with Honor master. Honor is the morals of dead men, selfishness is the desires of ourselves. Rejoice in your selfishness it&#39;s how we find happiness.&quot; 

Nietzsche just as usual took a small question from Luarent and turned it into a short lecture. Nietzsche believes that selfishness is not evil as many people would say. Selfishness is our way to happiness. People should live for their own purpose and not others.

&quot;You are not truly selfish Master, I don&#39;t think you live for your own goals. Am I right to assume that much?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;<strong>Every person is selfish.</strong>&quot; Laurent abruptly said as he looked out over the skyline of Delphi, clearly deep in thought. &quot;Every person is fueled by selfish desire. Even those that help people on some level feel good to do so, meaning they get something out of helping others. True selflessness is a sham.&quot;

Speaking bitterly, Laurent reflected on his past. His father did not want him to become a mage for the good of the family. He wanted it to justify all the time he spent burning the family fortune. He wanted to die convincing himself that he had been doing things for a good reason, a selfless and noble one. Whether or not that was the case was never known.

Perhaps he himself was just jaded. Laurent snorted. 

&quot;I want to give the people of Olympia and Delphi value. If I run this city, everyone in Delphi and Olympia will live better lives. Our two cities compliment one another. I get to feed my own ego, and they get to worry less about scraping by.&quot; Laurent turned to Caster. &quot;Do you think the other aristocratic families of Olympia genuinely care about their workers? They work, they breed, they die.&quot;

Laurent took a deep breath as he turned to face his Servant. &quot;My purpose, Caster?&quot;

&quot;My purpose is to rule the world, and return it to something more than a shadow of its former self. Get rid of the Church. Get rid of the Republic. Rule it all myself. No more conflict.&quot;

People of Olympia and Delphi living happily as if Laurent knew what they wanted. Nietzsche scoffed at his Master&#39;s ignorance. To think he knew the happiness of anyone but himself is an absurd sentiment. 

&quot;No one person&#39;s happiness resides in the goals of another.&quot; The philosopher replied. He gritted his teeth visibly agitated, his cool exterior cracked for a moment. He had tried so hard to explain to Laurent in what little time they had. Laurent didn&#39;t get it, he just didn&#39;t understand. Nietzsche <strong>needed</strong> him to understand. If the Caster could not get Laurent to understand himself… then Nietzsche&#39;s goal was in danger.

&quot;Destroy the churches, rule the world, it does not matter. There is no progress to be had living under the grip of old morals. What wisdom do you, Laurent MacKenzie, possess that could possibly make the world a better place.&quot; Nietzsche&#39;s words were full of irritation, his voice letting out each word with a distinct sharpness.

As soon as the philosopher finished doling out his words he would manifest his wooden chair sitting on it with a thud. He looked straight at his Master almost not wanting to hear a response.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster was right about one thing. Laurent did not know the happiness of others, and he did not care to do so. 

He was justifying his own happiness. While he could simply perceive it as shamelessly taking over the world, it was easier to state that he was doing it for the betterment of others, even if he himself had admitted that this was not entirely the case. He was a self-conflicting sham.

That would never change.

Laurent looked at Caster, and sighed. Fine, he&#39;d play along with Caster&#39;s little charade. Seeing his Servant irritable gave him flashbacks to Assassin.

&quot;I am a businessman. I am also a tyrant. While one provides for others, the other cares little for them. My wisdom comes from the ability to juggle the two. For a while, I tried to juggle the two in order to move forward. However, I learned something.&quot;

As the two stared at each other, Laurent&#39;s face flickered into a smile. &quot;<strong>Something else moves me, Caster.</strong>&quot;

It did not matter to Nietzsche if Laurent cared about other people&#39;s happiness. He did not care for the lies of a businessman.

&quot;What is it that moves you then? What is this motivation that you have found in life?&quot; Caster asked his question leaning forward in his chair. For once he was curious as to what his master would say.

Laurent&#39;s confession was not revalatory. Who didn&#39;t want to be happy? And yet, he had killed so many people? Crushed the dreams of so many others? Caused so much misery... For this? It was so selfish, so arrogant, so...

Human.

&quot;I do not know what moves other people, besides food, shelter, and amusement. I do not care. They can figure it out themselves for all the difference it makes. I know what I want, and is that not what you&#39;ve wanted to know? It&#39;s such a simple answer, yet one so overlooked... Does that not satisfy you?&quot; Laurent asked his Servant with interest.

It seemed he was getting somewhere. Maybe all hope wasn&#39;t lost, perhaps Laurent MacKenzie wasn&#39;t as lost as Nietzsche had previously assumed. 

&quot;Yes Laurent happiness, so simple, so primordial, yet the idea calls to all of mankind. I am satisfied knowing that you have found purpose but what means do you have to achieve that purpose?&quot; Nietzsche shuffled in his chair, visibly excited by the direction Laurent had brought the conversation in.

&quot;I ask you this question assuming you have no answer. Purpose, happiness, power, are all things that can only be taught to us by ourselves. Learn yourself Master, just as you have learned to carry your business. Mastery over yourself is hard, perhaps impossible… However, to overcome the human boundary we must exceed the impossible. Continue learning of yourself Master and I promise we shall have victory.&quot;

He would treat them well, if only to keep himself in power. Ultimately, however, their desires were trivial. He wanted to remain in control, and that made him happy.

Because...

Laurent shuddered as he looked away from Caster, before chuckling. &quot;That remains to be seen. My methods are cruel, but you don&#39;t seem to have anything capable of slaying Servants. We&#39;ll have to focus on Masters. However...&quot; Laurent said, before sighing and polishing his glasses. He grumbled slightly, before sighing once again. &quot;<strong>I owe you an apology.</strong>&quot;

&quot;I should&#39;ve ordered you to kill Assassin, instead of merely incapacitating him. If you had done so, Gustave would&#39;ve been eliminated. Instead, he slinked away.&quot; The truth was a bitter pill to swallow, and Laurent seemed to be choking on it. He grimaced. &quot;I expected you to fail, so I did not order you to kill Simo. That was my mistake. I am...&quot;

However, Nietzsche did not care. The past was set in stone, and just as Nietzsche was a weapon to Luarent, Laurent too was a weapon to him.

&quot;Is that honesty I hear Master?&quot; Nietzsche asked, teasing the businessman. &quot;Do not dwell on it, I accept your apology. I cannot kill servants...not directly. I will let you in on a secret Master. My philosophy, continue to learn it well, I have a secret weapon, and ace in the whole you could call it.&quot; 

Nietzsche stood up, speaking no more of his secret weapon. If he told Laurent of his trump card then he would not learn Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy for the right reasons. 

&quot;Oh and by the way Master&quot; Nietzsche turned to Laurent as he stood having one more thing to let out. &quot;When I intercepted Assassin he was pulling the trigger to execute a kill shot. Gustave had no intention of stalling your death, I thought you&#39;d want to know.&quot;

Caster&#39;s hint piqued Laurent&#39;s interest. A secret weapon? What could a philosopher have that would be capable of turning the tables? A Noble Phantasm, obviously, but what would it be? As much as he wanted to theorize, it would be trivial. Laurent shrugged.

&quot;As you say. Make sure to actually pull it off. If I die, that&#39;s it. No second chance, unless you want to go ally with someone else. Not that I&#39;d blame you.&quot; Laurent&#39;s death, while tragic, would not matter in the grand scheme of things. If his existence ended, he wouldn&#39;t need to consider the consequences of his death.

&quot;I must address my workers, Frederick. Stand off to the side, and I shall do my work.&quot; Laurent whistled, and Donovon poked his head out of the break room. Laurent nodded and mouthed <em>break over</em>, and Donovon retreated back into the room. Several seconds later, all the employees came spilling out.</span>

&quot;First, I must humbly thank you for working with us here at MacKenzie Industries. You grace me with your presence, just as I grace me with mine. Once again, I thank you.&quot; Laurent met each employee&#39;s gaze. all of which nodded or smiled lightly. All, except for one, who looked away.

&quot;Today, we are making history for both Olympia and Delphi. Olympian businessmen are cushioned by generations of prosperity. They were born into it. They lack true business sense. Delphians could never hope to enter such an ironclad market. In exchange, Olympians could never risk their assets in the cutthroat business world of Delphi.&quot;

&quot;Look around you! You are the ones who made this happen. You were the ones that were chosen! This was your calling!&quot; Laurent made a fist. &quot;Would you accept Olympian workers taking your jobs in a Delphi office? No! That&#39;s insulting, and it&#39;s why I hired you!&quot;

&quot;So I thank you. Thank you for tying the best of our two cities together. As long as you all work here, as long as you make progress, you will continue to shape the future of Delphi.&quot;

&quot;Please keep working hard, even after this City Grail War ends. Even when my visits become infrequent. Please.&quot; Laurent bowed his head and stepped back.

Some awkward applause filled the room. The type that came from years of dealing with office pep talks. Laurent was a good speaker, yes. Yet a few employees felt awkward. One didn&#39;t clap at all, instead staring him in the face.

&quot;Mr. MacKenzie, I have a question.&quot; She piped up, wearing traditional office garb. Is it true that you&#39;re participating in the City Grail War? We&#39;ve all seen that story video on DelphiTube™️.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Silence filled the room, and Laurent raised an eyebrow. <em>That</em> video. Even after all this time, Kun Wu and his concubine continued to be a thorn in Laurent&#39;s side.

&quot;Ah yes. That video. The video where I, one of the busiest men in Olympia, muck it up on an abandoned ship with a bunch of Servants?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but it doesn&#39;t directly mention you by name, so you&#39;re admi—&quot; She replied boldly, startling her fellow employees. Donovan&#39;s face flickered into a frown. Laurent cut her off.

&quot;But it was obviously targeting me. The glasses. The suit. Come now. In that video, don&#39;t I set fire to an orphanage, steal an old man&#39;s cane, and pull on the boy&#39;s hair? Kun Who, was it?&quot; Laurent seemed so bemused that he couldn&#39;t help but relax the employee. Out of his mouth, it seemed so ridiculous. This man wasn&#39;t some fighter. He was just some businessman trying to make the most out of a City Grail War. With his successes, there was no reason to compete.

And yet, with that mysterious person beside him, the female employee couldn&#39;t help but shake the feeling...

&quot;I must depart. Speak with me for a moment, Donovon. Come along, Frederick.&quot; Laurent said, waving to the mustached man and the office supervisor. 

&quot;<strong>Promote that woman.</strong> Once Olympia separates from Delphi, we&#39;ll need to be completely autonomous. Someone that suspicious will be excellent as a supervisor. Do a background check and walk her through the training.&quot;

&quot;H-huh? Yes, of course, Mr. MacKenzie.&quot; Donovan seemed relieved to be training the person who would take his job, though it was more likely that he didn&#39;t want to be left behind on Delphi when this City Grail War was over.

Laurent MacKenzie and Caster left the building.</span>
