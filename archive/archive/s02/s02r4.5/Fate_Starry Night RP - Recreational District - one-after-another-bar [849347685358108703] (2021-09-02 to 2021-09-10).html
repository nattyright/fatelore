Alone in the corner sat a metronome. Each second, the arm completed a trip only to start it again. There was a clock in the room, but that was silent. It would require precious attention in order to remember the time, seconds needed elsewhere. If it were not for the metronome, the single person in the room might not have had any idea what time it even was. 

Lark was sat down at a desk, shoved into the corner and out of sight. It was a simple desk, which normally only held a cup for pencils and pens, a notebook, and a coaster. However, not it was the home for a rather large number of documents, ledgers, folders, all sorts of information-packed pages that kept track of every single penny in Lark de Allegro’s name. 

Within that mess of papers, there would be a very large number at the top of a page. The start of this madness, one could argue. From there the number was modified and subtracted, slowly but surely decreased in size. Reduced until it was a mere pittance of wealth, pocket change for a bum on a street. A few times it even dipped into a negative, a blemish added to the front. From there, more math was conducted in order to bring it back up until it was a comfortable amount. 

Then the guilt from the battle wormed its way back into his heart, and once more the amount fell.

The musician was in deep concentration over the digits, pencil and pen hard at work to do the math and produce funds for the effort ahead of him. It was never enough. Much like the amount of sleep he got, which was sporadic at best. His body would give in to the desires of unconsciousness, and a nightmare would bring him right back. A mug sat to the side, refilled and emptied about two dozen times since he started. His bottom ached, his legs were stiff from inactivity. Dark circles clung to his eyes like leeches, which sucked away all the life once there.</span>

He pulled the mug from its home, a needed break from the sloppy digits etched into the paper like a machine, only to find it empty. 

“Geeves,” he called, “can you--”
He sighed his soul out and gripped the pen tight. Another mark joined six brothers on a tally.

The coffee machine sat a few feet away, ready for his command. With the speed of a sloth, his dragged his legs back and pushed against the carpet. With a wobble in each step, he approached the lifeline and popped open the top. The old filter was removed, tossed into the plum full trash can that reeked of wet grounds. A fresh white one was inserted, and a bag of ground beans was--

Empty. Really? How long had it been? 

Great. Now he would have to step away from his meticulous work, his spot surely to be forgotten. But what other choice did he have? Without coffee, he might fall asleep. And with sleep brought bad dreams. Besides, he needed to make a phone call anyway. That sat in the kitchen as well. He could kill… knock out two birds with one sto-roc- ah, forget it!

So, the bag of bones left his room. Not the first time, but to go anywhere besides the toilet it had been three days. Just a quick venture into the kitchen, it wouldn’t take longer than ten minutes hopefully. As long as no one was there to greet him, there shouldn’t be many problems, right?</span>

Lancer leaned against the kitchen counter, arms crossed, and looking stone faced as usual. “You need to go outside, you’re looking pale, the human body requires sunlight to remain healthy.” Uther and Lark hadn’t talked too much about what had happened, neither were really any good at sharing their feelings. Although, it would be heartless for Uther to say he didn’t have an inkling of what his master was going through. His own brother died in his arms, while the other one lead a war against him. The loss of someone close, especially one that is considered almost family can be exceedingly heart breaking. Regardless, they were still in the middle of a war and they couldn’t afford to get complacent now. “I’ve set your violin aside for experts to come and repair it, any sort of enchantments that you wish to maintain or add will have to be supervised by yourself lest they not be up to your standards.” Uther would reach over and pull out a small cup, place it on the island counter in front of them, and would begin to pour tea for his master. Lancer was not Geeves, but he intended to do what he could to help Lark get back on his feet. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Oh. Great. Lancer. Wasn’t he supposed to be… uh, doing something else? He was probably waiting for him all this time, at least in some capacity. The fact that he had tea set out might’ve been a coincidence, but the timing was too perfect for him to think it was anything but. The news about the violin was nice, in the sense that it was in the process of getting fixed.

Yet the idea of using the thing ever again put a sour taste in his mouth. If it weren’t for that thing, if it weren’t for him, then maybe Geeves would still be around. For all he cared, the instrument could rot in production hell. 

But for now, Lark simply grunted in acknowledgement before he walked straight past Lancer and the nice aroma of the tea. Instead, he reached straight for the phone. It was a bit old fashioned, with a dial that spun to the number in order to input it. He thought it was cute and a nice throwback to ye olden days, before the floods and the advent of boat cities.

He grabbed the talking part from its holster and started to dial a number. The circle spun and creaked for each one, until a full nine digits were imputed. However, he paused on the last one. “*Was it a six for the last one, or was it an eight? It was eight, because it was 2-4-6-8… but I put in a 5 for the last digit. Or was it 1-3-5-8?”

Lark would sit there and fail to put in whatever number he was trying to remember. If Lancer didn’t step in, this would go on for a few minutes. Each failed attempt would domino into each other until Lark wasn’t even sure who he was even trying to call. The force with which the dial would be turned would increase as well, until it threatened to come off entirely.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Uther grabbed upon Lark’s wrist as he was nearly about to smash the phone entirely. He’d grip it just tight enough to have relative control of his master’s motions. Lancer stared blankly at him, not caring that the fresh tea was slowly growing cold. Lark was a mess, Ither could see it, many a time whenever his soldiers had that lost look in their eyes, he’d put them to work, make them useful until they were more worried about their sore backs then the visions of bloodshed that fell before their eyes. Yet the king felt that was not the right thing to do here. Lark was angry, and he didn’t know how to take it properly, or at least he was afraid of what might happen if he did. 

Repositioning his hand, Uther began to ball Lark’s fingers into a fist and with a sudden jerk he’d force his master to strike his face. “We need that phone for business, if you intend to take your anger out on something, take it out on me. Hit me, cut me, do what you need to. However, do not silently sulk in melancholy by yourself. Your time and body are far more valuable than that. So master, if you must hurt something, hurt me, I’m barely considered human as it is.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lark stood silent for a few moments, a few too many to be comfortable. When he did break the silence, it was with a whisper. “When I was younger, my father had a Servant himself. Don’t exactly remember their name, but it was fun talking to them about their past life. Something to do with Europe. However, something happened and they were sent back to the Throne. Father managed to resummon them, but they didn’t remember a damn thing.”

Only then did he make eye contact with Lancer. Eyes filled with sorrow met those perfect golden orbs. “The only thing that makes you inhuman is the fact that you can technically come back from the dead. Even then, you’re a whole new person every time. You might not remember that, but I will.”

He pulled his arm away with force, fist balled tight. White knuckles clenched hard as he freed himself, only to go back to the phone. “But I appreciate the thought. Helped me remember something important.”

With quick, agile movements he dialed the number. It took one try. He held the receiver to his ear and waited patiently. As if a statue was on hold with someone. The seconds crawled by as he waited, and waited. 

Eventually, someone picked up. The phone was quiet, but the person on the other end seemed relieved. “Yes, hello… no, I’m okay… yes, thanks… no, I have some business I need to figure out. Is there any chance you could come here, to my place? There’s a favour I need to ask of you, and it would be better to do it in person… no, I don’t plan on--yes, I’m sure. Don’t worry, if I were to do that, I wouldn’t call. Yes… uh huh, alright. See you soon.”

Clockwork. The receiver was placed back upon the holster. “As a heads up, this isn’t the business phone. That would be downstairs.”</span>

In front of the tea cup, he lifted the mug to his lips and sipped quietly. He winced and put the cup back down before he fished out two sugar cubes from a glass container in the middle. They were thrown and mixed into the liquid before he took one more sip. Perfect.

Lancer could hardly count on his hand the amount of times the boy even mentioned his father. This was a different side of Lark that Uther had yet to see, it was only appropriate after all they went through. Taking a seat opposite of his master Lancer began to pour a separate cup of tea for himself. He had no interest in the sugar cubes preferring to drink the brown concoction as is. There seemed to be a measure of calm after what the king had said, perhaps further conversation might spark something more in him. “That is one of the unfortunate traits of being copies of a heroic spirits identity. Each time you receive in their prime, but yet they do not retain what they’ve learned. A cruel thing to think about as a warrior, a king, or a person. We only learn and grow through experience, to weather new challenges and figure new ways to improve oneself is erased away. Though I suppose that’s what makes it worthwhile.” 

There was a brief pause as Uther stared into his drink. “Moments and memories are only valuable because they are fleeting. True if I died and was brought back I would be the High King of Camelot, Uther Pendragon, but I wouldn’t be this version of me. It’d be a whole new life and a different experience. That’s why here and henceforth no matter what happens with my spirit origIn in the future,</span>

I likely won’t always be around, at least not forever, so when I am gone I want you to look back on our time with fond memories through the good and the bad. At least that’s what I’d want from you.”

Uther took another sip of his drink and smiled brightly at the young man before him, Lark did not think much of himself or at least felt that his natural ability was no consolation for true success in life. He wants to struggle, he wants to feel like he can suffer through something and make it through to the other side. That’s a sentiment they both shared, one of seeking the next challenge and the brighter horizon. Crossing his arms Lanext spike once more. “Do you recall anything about the old servant, what they looked, a potential Class? Perhaps they were a contemporary of mine.” It was a measure of small talk, but it also served a function of getting his mind off his own lost friend. For once Lark could tell that Uther wasn’t being commanding or critical of the musician, he was merely talking to him man to man, like a normal person.</span>

If he had anything to say about that little bit about Lancer being his, then it stayed firmly within his mind. If anything, his shoulders slouched even more after Lancer finished his miniature speech. 

For the next minute, any and all attempts at conversation would be shot down with one-liners and simple responses. No follow up, no questions for the other man. Not even a single lick of information about their surprise guest. He was good at starting conversations, yet it sounded like he was just as good at stopping them.

Finally, something changed. He looked even more tired than he did when he walked inside the kitchen. “Tell me, Lancer,” Lark said from nowhere. His eyes were glued onto the brown liquid sat in front of him. “Do you pity me?”</span>

To answer your question, before I do feel sorry for your loss, however I do not think it is something that you are not strong enough to get through or to overcome. When we first met, I believes you to be a fool, now I see a man who simply wished for his ideals to be seen and appreciated. I recognize those aspirations of yours, to want a better place to live in. At least that’s what you’ve projected to me so far, if I’m mistaken than perhaps I merely observed you from the wrong angle.” He’d stand up putting his own cup away into the sink. “Have you made mistakes, yes. Do I feel they were necessary for your growth, also yes. Is there a place in my heart where I feel like you are not worthy of your aspirations, absolutely not. However, you’ve hardly ever taken much weight to my opinion, so it’s curious you ask for it now. Most of the time you do what you believe to be the course of action for yourself.

However, his response is exactly what the musician expected. Honesty without any sort of tact. Some would call it the worst kind, yet he couldn’t help but feel the tiniest of bits better. If he had responded with a lie or with a yes, there would’ve been dire consequences. To be pitied would be worse than death itself.

Perhaps, “... you aren’t too bad yourself, Lancer.”

And from there, they waited. Minutes passed by, either with small talk or silence. Before long, there were noises from downstairs. The guest! Oh, goodness, what will they do! Did they even have something ready? Quick, throw some tea onto the--

Too late, they were here! They ran up the stairs, each stomp more rapid than the last. No announcements, no warning. A door was swung open, and a woman stepped inside. A full head of rosy red hair greeted them. She look flustered, face red from her frantic pace. She wore the standard cut and dry shorts and short-sleeved shirt, the only smart thing to wear in Olympia. In her hand was a brown lunch sack, held so tight that it threatened to tear where she held its neck.

And she was very familiar. Lancer and her had met before, for sure. But from where?

“Hello, Rose.” Lark weakly waved a hand in greetings. 

Without a word, she stormed towards the man, only to stop right before him. A flurry of emotions passed through her muscles, but she finally settled on a mix between sadness and frustration. 

“That’s the best you got?” she asked. “Just a ‘hello’? After what happened?”

He shrugged, “Sorry. Haven’t gotten too much sleep recently.”</span>

As she entered the room Uther stood up, placed a fist to his heart, and gave a light how. “It is pleasure to be seeing you once again Lady Rose. I apologize for any pain my inadequacy has created you and your family. I have fresh pot of tea made, although it might be rather cold at this point. If you wish I can set it back on the stove to heat up.” He wasn’t certain why Lark had contacted his sister, but he could only imagine it was for some form of business. Regardless, she was family to Lark which meant that his favor served her as well by extension of his master. He’d glance over to the distraught man and would stand tall like a proper knight. “Is there anything I can do for you master, while I am here or would you prefer to have a conversation with your family?” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

“Here. Don’t say I never did anything for you.”

He tentatively took the bag. It took a few seconds to get the thing open, for Rose thought it proper to strangle the paper. He took a peek inside, only to see something wrapped up in a few layers of thin plastic. A brown muffin with a frankly disgusting amount of chocolate chips baked in.

“Oh, thanks. I’ll be sure to eat it later,” he said. He tossed the bag onto the island, no longer on his mind. Rose’s shoulders sank down. 

“That’s all I get for bringing you one of your favorite foods? I know you haven’t been eating, but I thought something that sugary would make you… I don’t know. Happy?” She crossed her arms.

“Not hungry.”

“Like hell you aren’t.” She turned on the Servant, finger pointed straight at him. “Lancer, was it? Quit the performance and make some food for this guy, if you want to be useful. Not that I’m not thankful for the appreciation for my presence.”

She walked around her brother and took a look around the room. She seemed to be inspecting every nook and cranny of the space, to make sure not a hair was out of place. “Wow. I’m surprised this place hasn’t rotted from the inside out. Well, I guess it’s only been…”

She never finished that thought. Whether because she thought Lark would grow upset from the reminder, or if she herself still wasn’t over the fact of Geeves untimely demise, instead she went back to Lark and <em>punched</em> him. Right after, she wrapped her arms around the man.

“*I know he’d strangle you if he saw you acting like this. You can feel sad about it, instead of feeling empty trying to keep your emotions bottled up,” she whispered.

“Later,” he wheezed. “Busy struggling to breathe.”</span>

“I’m supposed to say that,” Rose deadpanned. However, she wasted no time and freed another chair from underneath the island. “And Lancer, you aren’t allowed to call yourself inadequate. I already have one family member who does that, I don’t need another. Take a seat whenever you want.”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Family?” That was something he did not expect to hear. Uther had a strange history with his own family. Aurelius died alongside while fighting for Britainia against the Saxons, and his other brother opposing him every step of the way. He had a wife and two children, although he didn’t think much of them. In truth they were more a means to an end for the betterment of Camelot. Although after recent research the High King found that both his daughters went on to carry on their own renown, despite being at odds with one another and allowing Camelot’s eventual fall. To most men this might have been infuriating, but Uther did not like to dwell in regret of the past. He understood certain things could have been more properly prepared in his time, but he was not going to blame himself for matters that did not involve him. All he could do was aspire to bring about the growth of a new kingdom. However, he will recognize his shortcomings when things occur in direct result of him, such as Geeves being on that battlefield. He might not say it aloud, but Lancer did feel partially responsible on his demise. 

Going over to one of the nearby cabinets Uther pulled out what appeared to be can of chicken soup. It was likely not too substantial, but Lark did not keep much food in the bar and one could not fill an empty stomach on liquor alone. Pouring it into a pot, Uther turned on the stove allowing the concoction to boil. “Your meal should be ready soon enough master. I’m curious what business you wish to discuss as well. If it is in concern of how we proceed from here, I’m anxious to hear what your thoughts might be. As always, my Lance is ready in defense of you and your ideals.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

With the speed of a snail, he returned back to his lair of sorts. Rose glared at his backside, unsure on whether he actually planned to come back or if this was his way of wasting her time.

However, it was the rustle of papers that intrigued her. The commotion drew her eyebrow up as the parchments were hurried into a large pile. It took half a minute for the source to make itself present, in the form of Lark. He carried at least two dozen papers in his hands, the thick stack stacked neatly on top of each other. With a flourish, he dropped the pages directly in front of Rose. 

“I see you’ve been busy doing… math?” She started to shuffle through the papers as Lark sat down opposite of her. As she sorted through more and more, her concern increased dramatically. Before long she looked at each stroke of the pen, each calculation with exasperation. She held her free hand to her forehead, as if that would make the madness go away.

“Lark… Lark, this is your entire life savings! What in the blazes are you throwing it away on?” She looked back up to her brother. 

He did not meet her gaze. “Well, you know how there was that whole siege against that castle? Well, there were a lot of men, poor souls in every way who bet their lives on our victory. Since we… you know, I wanted to help out their families and those who lived by donating some funds in order to help them get by a little longer since half of their income was lost.”

“And you want me to help fund this fool’s errand?” she asked.

“If you are willing. It wouldn’t be much--”

“Much?!” She slammed a fist on the table. “Jesus, do you <em>see</em> how much this is? How much you’re going to give out? How do you plan on keeping this place afloat when you toss out almost all of your money on this farce?”</span>

That’s not nearly enough!” Lark said, finally showing some emotion that couldn’t be described as hollow. 

“How many people are you giving money to then? How many people were there at that fight you guys had?”

Lark looked away, teacup lifted to his lips, “<em>About… seventy-five or so…</em>” He said into the cup. 
Rose shot up, both hands now slammed down onto the table, “What the actual <em>fuck</em>! You got that many people and couldn’t figure out a way to beat that clown? You’re joking, right?” 

“Lancer,” she looked towards the Servant with begging eyes, “Please talk some sense into my brother. I’m on my last thread here.”</span>

Even so seeing the look in her eyes, he took a deep breathe and faced his master once more. “He has only a handful of times heeded my warnings, it would be an exaggeration to say I have a great influence over him. However, I shall still ask you Lark. Is there no other way to appease your conscience over the lass of life. No way we can offer some form of reparations that doesn’t involve you handing out what you’ve worked so hard to collect and save.

“Look,” she started, “Great idea you have here. Soldiers got paid for their time in the war, but they also got paid by fighting for what they thought was right. I’m not going to say that you <em>shouldn’t</em> throw away your money, but I’m afraid you won’t find me trying to support your outlandish ideas. Well, this outlandish idea.”

Lark scoffed, “This isn’t outlandish. It’s what is right.”

“Right for who?”

“Right for--”

“Your conscious?”

Silence filled the room. Lark knew in his mind that she was wrong. This was not up for debate, he stood on the side of morals and ethics. All it would take is an explanation of his side and Rose would surely see what he meant.

But when he opened his mouth to try, no words came out. Not even an utterance of logic escaped past his chapped lips. His eyes locked with hers, the piercing gaze that stared directly into his soul. She was inside his head and was living rent-free in the empty space. There wasn’t a single thought he had that she hadn’t seen already. 

“Lancer,” she turned to the Servant, “During this battle, he probably mentioned not being responsible for all those people, right? Something among the lines of ‘I’m no leader, just a guy with a funny violin’?</span>

There was little debate on that front, the amount of times he complained on the way over to keep, him disregarding any of the militia that asked him for advice, how he would order retreats while figuratively and literally running into the flames of battle. He may not be a leader, but he certainly acted the part of a reckless hero. “In truth it’s not entirely his fault, he had never experienced combat on that scale before, he can not be blamed for being ignorant of how to act when in cross fire with the enemy. If I had been a touch more prepared and equipped with better wares and more tactically trained men than the battle potentially could have turned an entirely different way. Despite the bare bones of equipment Mackenzie gave us, we were able to push our enemy to the limit. I can only imagine how it would have turned out if he actually helped us. Instead of dropping off basic swat gear, give us actual military grade supplies. The closest thing we had was that sonic device and it barely did anything. Most of the militia simply used their own work equipment in the fight.” There was a look of disappointment and shame in Uther’s eyes, it was unclear if it was towards Mackenzie and or himself. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

Realization lit up Rose’s face a moment before she mentioned that particular name. “Wait… you said Mackenzie. Like, the Arms Dealer. You know, one of the biggest names in this city, if not this section of the ocean? He put you up to this?”

Lark nodded, “And I let that blasted ‘alliance’ happen. If only I had fought harder against it. There’d be a lot more living people.” 

Rose didn’t immediately respond. Instead, she thought of that bastard. Of <em>course</em> he would put Lark up to it. He probably had no idea about that stupid contract she and Geeves had made her brother sign but with the butler who had wanted him to try and actually win and a Servant who had only known war, it was the perfect scenario. Not only that, but she had heard rumors about that man. Whispers in the night about how he was in the war previously, and how he might still be in it. 

Above all else, the battle held little risk for him. If it failed and Lark died, then he was one step closer to victory by either nabbing Lancer or having his own Servant in the background. This rabbit hole could be a few inches deep, or it could span the entire underground. However, if nothing else was certain than at least she knew the real deal behind what had happened.

Now, there was only one realistic course of action. “Revenge,” she finally said.

“Excuse me?” Lark asked. 

“Isn’t it obvious? That Megalomaniac sent you on a doomed expedition.”</span>

Not even enough to equip everyone you brought, based on what Lancer said. What kind of sponsor would send their ‘champion’ out if they don’t stand a chance?”

The answer was obvious to him now. He was right from the start and no mistake. Now, the musician had lost one of the most influential and important people to him and without anything to show. MacKenzie didn’t care in the slightest about them, and they had paid a heavy price for that.

“So get your spirits out of the gutter and direct that hatred somewhere more beneficial. I know it might not be what Geeve’s would’ve wanted, but he’d take that over the sorry state you’re in any day of the week.”
Lark stared down into the remnants of the tea, lost inside the murky brown left at the bottom. Was this really right, though? Two wrongs seldom made a right, and an eye for an eye left the world blind. Even if that elitist prick had been the cause for all these problems, it didn’t change the fact that his own actions had caused Geeve’s demise. And killing the man would not bring the manservant back.

Rose, meanwhile, glanced towards Lancer. She nodded her head towards Lark, an indication that he needed to say something. Seal the deal, so to speak.</span>

Taking a seat across from him, Uther pulled out a small locket from the inside of his robe and placed it onto the table. Opening it up in front of Lark, the man could see there was a cracked and blood stained frame inside the locket with a picture of a woman and a small child. “This was recovered off the body of the one Excavator that charged after my Noble Phantasm failed to fully crumble Dolorous Gard, he believed in what we were fighting for. They all did. You and I fought as hard as we could and tried to protect them to the best of our ability. However, no matter how strategic or strong we may be, the man who put us up to this did not provide the resources we needed. Before this all occurred I requested more, I believed we needed more, but he drew his involvement at the bare minimum. A good portion of blame does fall on us for not being crafty enough to get through their defenses, but Laurent Mackenzie is not innocent either. He’ll claim that he was not there, and that it’s our fault for not making the most of what he gave. However, those are the words of a coward who did not want to get his hands dirty. Regardless if it’ll carry any benefit to us or not, this carries a deeper weight to it. Mackenzie is just as much a threat to Olympia as Brandin is. I will not tell you what to do, but whatever you decide I shall stand with you.” <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

And MacKenzie. That bastard had rigged the game from the start. Violence to end the violence was a road he didn’t want to go down, but… it would stop more wanton bloodshed in the future. A few more people would die, yet the chain could hopefully stop there. After that, he could figure out some better way to make amends for his stupidity.

Besides, what other option was there? 

“Fine,” he muttered. “But how do we get to him? I doubt he’s going to make an appearance if we ask nicely.”

“And that’s where I come in,” Rose said. “I happen to know that there is a new HQ in Delphi, started by the person in question. Odds are that he’s there, making sure everything is going smoothly. If you wait for him to come back…”

An ambush. A fitting way to get back at the sneaky devil. 

“We sneak attack MacKenzie in his own tower, and we get in there by,” he waves his hand in a circular motion. 

Rose shrugged, “Figure it out yourself. Get creative. I can’t hold your hand for everything.”

Hmmm. A look around the building would grant them an optimal entry point. Probably enter through the front door and figure out a path through the building. 

“Well, Lancer,” he grabbed the locket off the island and held it out to Servant, “what day works best for you?”</span>
