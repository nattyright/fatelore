As the knife that Laurent had used to do it faded away into dust, Laurent felt his satisfaction turn into wrath.

&quot;Worthless.&quot; Laurent snarled, kicking the frame aside, despite its massive weight. All it did was hurt his foot and scruff up his shoes, which added to his rage.

&quot;Your one job was to defeat Berserker, and to gather intelligence on his identity. You couldn&#39;t do either.&quot; Laurent continued kicking at the discarded frame.

Even with Assassin&#39;s skills, its abilities were worthless if one knew it was coming. It hadn&#39;t taken long for Laurent&#39;s assault on his factory to blow up in news around both docked cities, and there were already rumors that Laurent MacKenzie had contracted with an Assassin class Servant.

Combine that with Brutus&#39;s lack of effectiveness against Berserker, and the solution was simple: <strong>get rid of Assassin.</strong>

And so he had. That left him with one question. Now what?

Leaving the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame in its original occupant&#39;s former room, Laurent sulked off to his room to undress and rest.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Several floors below the penthouse, Laurent stepped out of a meeting room. A few investors smiled, nodded, and patted him on the back as they left. Laurent inclined his head with a tired smile. Several assistants, advisors, and scribes filed out as well.

The intent of the meeting had been to discuss MacKenzie Industry&#39;s position after having one of its factories shut down for several days. People had known that the factory had been attacked—it had spread across both Olympia and Delphi alike, much to the amusement of Olympia&#39;s 1%, despite their uneasiness that the same might happen to them.

The public, however, was <em>loving</em> it.

A factory being stormed by its owner in an attempt to rescue the workers inside sat well with the working class of Olympia, and even Delphi was beginning to take interest. In fact, it was likely that Delphi would look into signing a few construction contracts with the company once this City Grail War was over and several city blocks had presumably been leveled.

Laurent had played both cities like a fiddle, and all it had cost was Assassin.

Our gains are <em>booming</em> Mr. Mackenzie, sir!&quot; A bubbly secretary gushed.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m aware. We were just in the same meeting together. Did you sleep through it?&quot; Laurent joked, looking somewhat bemused. Internally, he was just annoyed. There was a lot to do.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing more on the schedule? Good. Thank you, Felicity.&quot; Laurent said, leaving his secretary behind. A good boss should always remember the name of his employees.

Laurent entered the elevator, and went up to his penthouse.

As soon as he entered, Laurent immediately went to his personal office, and sat down at his computer. This past week had been a blur of activity on all fronts. Olympia and Delphi had both become a battleground, and reports from the dozens of the informants in Olympia were flowing in. Delphi, on the other hand, remained relatively dark, excluding one pair.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent looked out the window and scowled. From his current position, he could see most of the downtown area. A typical urban sprawl, not overly noteworthy, outside a few Church offices and holdouts. Something stuck out like a sore thumb, however.

Olympia&#39;s Buddhist temple. Or at least, what was once the Buddhist temple. Now, it was beginning to morph and change. A Caster, most likely. Laurent had heard rumors of Territory Creation&#39;s capabilities. Apparently Perespolis&#39;s Caster was capable of similar feats of reality warping. Their Rider could, as well.

This, however, had overstayed its welcome. Caster would need to be dealt with in the future. His Master, an old man apparently named &quot;Jimbo&quot; was a wanderer. Little information. Unreliable. Not worth the hassle. Not by Laurent, though. He needed someone else to deal with it. He&#39;d mull it over. It wasn&#39;t going anywhere.

Apparently it had been attacked by Delphi&#39;s Lancer, and the Master was apparently someone of note. A nonissue, Laurent would find out her identity eventually. He should really get in contact with someone from Delphi about all this...

The group that finally piqued Laurent&#39;s interest was the group that had threatened to turn Memorial Park into a smoking pit. This group, he had information on that was actually worthwhile.

Several informants were frequent visitors of Olympia&#39;s bars and restaurants, and had whispered that a local daredevil performer named Lark had summoned a Lancer. An extremely famous one: Uther Pendragon. How did such an unimpressive hack summon such a powerful Servant? Laurent made a mental note to have someone go and bug his hideout. Maybe he&#39;d do it himself. Olympia barhopping was a delightful experience.

Their foes were... an old man and a sniper.

Wee.

As Laurent&#39;s eyes narrowed at a hastily shot photo of the old man, he nearly fell out of chair.</span>

The boy watched as his grandfather, whittled with age and a shadow of his former self, let his family&#39;s future drag through the mud at the hands of his son. He was old. Too old to take over the company. Too old to anything but offer counsel which fell upon deaf ears.

As the family business whittled away, so too did his grandfather&#39;s health. He eventually decided to cast it all away and leave the family like his son&#39;s wife before him.

Before he left, he turned to his grandson, who played with a toy cash register. The boy looked back at him.

&quot;Money is the only ironclad contract in the world. As such, it is the blood by which society thrives. The routes upon which it is transferred are the arteries of civilization.&quot; 

The boy cocked his head in confusion.

&quot;If that is the case, then that from which all money flows must be the heart of our species. These facts are what forged mankind, and one day, our family&#39;s century obsession will allow us to hold the heart of mankind within the palm of our hand.&quot;

&quot;We were not chosen to be great mages, we can only dabble in powers that were once in-numerous. <strong>We were not chosen, like those wielders of True Magic.</strong>&quot;

The old man vented and raged and mourned the fate of his house, which his son had sunk into the mud in an attempt to chase after intricacies of Magecraft that would take centuries of careful cultivation to establish.

&quot;All I can do is hope that your father doesn&#39;t do too much damage before you inherit the business. Make the MacKenzies proud. Turn Olympia into the heart that keeps the world running.&quot;

&quot;And when you are finally ready...&quot;

&quot;Hold it in your hand...&quot;

<em><strong>&quot;And stop it from beating.&quot;</strong></em>

The boy screamed in fear, and run down the hall, banging on the door to his father&#39;s study. The door didn&#39;t open. His father didn&#39;t come out. The old man left, and died a year later.

Those words were engraved upon the boy&#39;s heart, just like the nightmares that followed.</span>
