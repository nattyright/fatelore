            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A detective office repurposed into the workspace of a certain intelligence magnate. The dim lighting procured by the ancient incandescent bulbs coupled with the damp and dusty air serves to give an oldish feel to the office. The floor is in disarray: Various folders, binders and files are scattered everywhere and crumbled sheets of paper serve to punctuate every corner. Various shelves and drawers are placed across the walls, each so full of portfolios and papers that they threaten to collapse if touched the wrong way. A cork board stands on top of an expensive-looking desk, littered with photographs of famous faces and various places that are interconnected with red thread that looped on thumbtacks. Looking at the chaos and lack of organisation, one would have thought that this place has been stolen or ransacked by burglars.</div>

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Laura answered, taking notes in her notepad. &quot;I didn&#39;t think <em>the</em> Laurent MacKenzie to be this charitable towards his employees, going as far as to visit his own factory to check for trouble.&quot;

The old man laughed lightly at that remark. &quot;It&#39;s true, he&#39;s always been cold to us. Doesn&#39;t show his face very often in his factories.&quot;

&quot;Any other details? Did you see any other Servant besides the one in golden armour?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so...&quot; Answered the man, unsure.

&quot;I see.&quot; Laura stood up from her chair, presenting her hand to the old man. &quot;Thank you for your testimony. If you have any juicy titbits about your boss, be sure to contact me through the phone number I gave you. You <em>will</em> be generously compensated for everything you tell.&quot; 

&quot;Erm, sure.&quot; The man stood up and shook the young girl&#39;s hand. &quot;As long as the boss doesn&#39;t know about all this...&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t.&quot; Answered Laura with a curt and confident smile. &quot;We put a big emphasis on protecting the identity of our providers, so you can rest easy. Everything that is said here <em>stays here</em>.&quot;

And the dude must&#39;ve had an amp plugged in, cuz his violin was as loud as a god damn aircraft taking off!&quot; The young man spoke, lightly shaking. &quot;And it felt like... it made me want to do <em>stuff</em>. Violent stuff. And right after that, we heard the first gunshot. Shit was fucking <em>crazy</em>, get what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I get what you&#39;re saying.&quot; Replied Laura, monotone.

&quot;Olympia&#39;s fucking crazy, man... You go there expecting to relax, and first thing that hits you: Everything&#39;s hot as fuck. Motherfuckers got weather domes, but it&#39;s to make things <em>hotter</em>, like it wasn&#39;t hot enough to melt your god damn skin off. The food costs an arm and a leg to buy, ya can&#39;t find one place without those damn worker strolling around in their dirty outfits—and if this wasn&#39;t enough, some crazed lunatic starts shooting in a fucking park filled with people!&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; She lifted a pencil to her mouth, trying to make sense of what the young man spoke. This is what I get for trying to get testimony from a Citynet forum user that claimed to have seen a &#39;battle between Masters&#39;, Laura thought as the man kept blabbering, filling her head with useless details and crude words.

&quot;Right after, some blond haired dude ran to the painted dude and he was wearing a fucking armour out of nowhere. He had to be a Servant, right?&quot; The young man exclaimed, awaiting for an approval from Laura before he went on.

&quot;Erm, yeah. Maybe.&quot; Answered Laura, a bit disconnected from her interlocutor&#39;s speech. There were like a bazillion Servants that fit with his description. Blonde hair, armour wearing and sword swinging. Not the most precise of descriptions, but it was <em>something</em>.

But the painter fucking vanished out of thin air, it&#39;s like he teleported or something. The violinist dude spoke to the Servant before he started running towards <em>my</em> general direction. This was my cue to get the fuck outta here, ya know what I mean?&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Laura sighed. &quot;And what about the man who fired those bullets, did you see him?&quot;

&quot;Erm,&quot; The young man stopped for the first time in his frenzied speech, taking a few seconds to reflect on the events. &quot;No...? I think he might&#39;ve been faraway, cuz I didn&#39;t see shit.&quot;

&quot;Alright. Great.&quot; 

&quot;You said that if I talked to you I would appear on tomorrow&#39;s newspaper as a witness of the &#39;Memorial Park shooting incident&#39;, right?&quot; Spoke the young man, sheepishly. &quot;Are you gonna photograph me then censor my eyes with a black strip? I didn&#39;t shower for a while, so my hair might look a bit weird...&quot;

&quot;I said that you <em>might</em> appear on the newspaper. And our interview is done, thank you for your time.&quot; Spoke Laura as she stood up from her seat, extending a firm hand towards the man.

&quot;What?&quot; Exclaimed the man, disappointed. &quot;I didn&#39;t give you my opinion on this whole mater yet—&quot;

&quot;<em>Thank you for your time.</em>&quot; Insisted Laura, a tired smile on her lips.

&quot;He bewitched us with his <em>thick</em> and <em>heavy</em> smoke,&quot; Sighed the girl, a complex expression on her face. &quot;He made the moon look so beautiful, so romantic. I felt like I was gonna faint at any moment...&quot;

The eyes of the young girl were closed as she reminisced, a deep blush on her cheeks. She was a wearing a mask with an iron fan logo etched onto it. Her clothes all screamed <em>negligence</em>, except for the shirt she was wearing that depicted Kun Wu&#39;s face. The fact that it was her only article of clothing spared from the sloppiness made it shine even brighter. It also emphasised her strong attachment towards the man.

&quot;You, uhm, really like Kun Wu, don&#39;t you.&quot; Commented Laura, trying her best to hide her disgust with a sloppy smile.

&quot;Well <em>duh</em>. I&#39;m his biggest fan.&quot; Retorted the girl. &quot;He&#39;s so adorable with his silky smooth hair and his little kimono. The way he shines when performing, putting in all his hard work and his spirit into creating the best experience possible for his public. Everything about him is just... so <em>lovely</em>.&quot;

&quot;Lovely.&quot; Laura echoed her, stoic. &quot;Besides his little performance, did you see anything unusual? Any weirdos talking to him, perhaps?&quot;

&quot;Weirdos talking to him...&quot; The girl squinted her eyes, making a theatrical <em>hmmmm</em> noise as she pondered. &quot;The <em>white haired she-wolf</em> was still by his side. That annoying little pest can&#39;t understand that Kun Wu is like a delicate flower, meant to be enjoyed from afar and never to be touched or approached...&quot; 

—And that would be Rider, Laura thought. Her brief description matched what she had seen the various videos detailing his summoning on DelphiTube™️. Nothing surprising on that front.

&quot;Uhm. Just before he started performing, a man in black suit with a huge moustache briefly talked to him and the she-wolf. The she-wolf didn&#39;t seem too pleased. Then a purple-haired girl dressed in black cut in, and the she-wolf looked even more pissed. I think she was with the man in the suit.&quot;

Laura nodded as the somewhat clumsy descriptions rolled, taking notes in her notepad. It seemed like the girl really insisted on calling Rider &#39;she-wolf&#39;.

&quot;My theory,&quot; The masked girl whispered, leaning in closer to Laura, looking more serious than ever. &quot;Is that the she-wolf wants to keep Kun Wu by her side, and her side alone. She&#39;s a greedy bitch that won&#39;t hesitate to haggle my cute little Kun to herself. When those two people came in, she looked really defensive. I&#39;m sure they were just fans trying to get a few words with him, but she looked like she was <em>defending</em> him from them.&quot;

&quot;Defending him, you say...&quot; Responded Laura, pensive.

Were those two Master and Servant? 

The description of the man didn&#39;t ring any bell. The girl on the other hand—a purple-haired girl dressed in black. There was one person that seemed to fit with that description. A person she knew <em>too well.</em> She&#39;d have to pull a few strings to gain access to the camera footage from that day, just to make sure.

She had no need to take notes as she could perfectly memorise every bit of dialogue he had said, but it served to deeply ingrain her persona in their minds. Appearances were <em>important.</em>

She took a deep breath, stroking her bandage-covered arms delicately. They hadn&#39;t fully recovered, despite having had five days of rest. The pain in her head hadn&#39;t completely subdued either. Talking with people, <em>mostly dumb people</em>, didn&#39;t make it any easier to endure. She reached for her desk&#39;s drawer, taking out two white pills that she swallowed immediately. They would make the pain <em>bearable</em>. At least for a few hours. 

Being a Master wasn&#39;t a good enough reason to neglect one&#39;s duty. You can&#39;t go a day without working in a competitive market such as Delphi&#39;s, or else you&#39;ll be left in the dust by your competitors.

&quot;Heeey, big maan.&quot; Laura called out to her Servant waiting in the garage, her voice muffled as she buried her head in her elbow. &quot;I&#39;m done with the interviews, you can come out now.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To help pass the time, Guan Yu was sat in the middle of a partially cleaned garage and read from his book. A good portion of the garage was returned to a normal state. It was still quite a mess, but if one looked at it from right angle then the rest of the room wasn&#39;t noticeable! Though, that&#39;s mainly because it would be out of sight, but that&#39;s besides the point really! 

His body was healing quite well from his battle with Saber. The recharge of mana allowed him to touch up his clothes so he looked proper and presentable. 

The sound of his Master&#39;s voice pulled him out of his book. Oh, right! He&#39;s in the middle of a war! He left a marker on the page he left off on and placed the book back inside of his robes for safekeeping. 

The door opened shortly after she called out for him. The large figure soon covered the doorframe as Guan Yu made his way into the room. He took his usual spot on the chair and examined his Master. It seemed that she was recovering quite smoothly from their last fight!

&quot;How did the interviews go? Did we acquire any new information regarding our opponents? Also, how are your arms feeling, Miss Hess?&quot; Right after she finished her interviews, it seems that she was immediately placed right back into one when he started to ask questions about her. 

&quot;I hope they won&#39;t affect your ability to play our next game!&quot; Guan Yu had a smug look on his face while he stroked his beard when he said that. Even though he was on a terrible losing streak, the way he acted spoke a different story altogether.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her head perked up as she saw the big man struggling to walk through the door frame. Seeing that reminded her of the ravine that separated them, both in terms of physique and in recovery. Servants really have it easy, she thought as he sat on his chair, seemingly unscathed.

&quot;I feel like I&#39;m underwater whenever I move them, but it&#39;s getting better. And I can totally play with my feet if my arms don&#39;t feel like moving. The only thing that <em>may</em> affect my abilities is how much pity I feel for you whenever you lose.&quot; Retorted the young girl, matching her Servant&#39;s smirk with one of her own.

She reached out for a half-empty cup of ramen that laid to the edge of her desk, thoroughly mixing its contents with the chopsticks. She wasn&#39;t particularly hungry, but nutrition was mandatory to recover from injuries, even if it meant having cold and rubbery noodles every few hours.

&quot;They went okay...ish.&quot; Answered Laura, slurping up a mouthful of ramen. &quot;Lots of gibberish and fucking around, but that&#39;s to be expected. This whole City Grail War business makes people <em>excited</em>, and excited people end up romanticising and exaggerating the things they see, consciously or not. I guess it&#39;s hard to separate reality and phantasm when you&#39;re faced with so much excitement.&quot;

&quot;About our opponents, I&#39;ve got a few trails. Nothing too crazy for now, but I have a vague idea of the people we will be up against.&quot; 

The chopsticks she gripped in her bandaged hand suddenly slipped out of her fingers, noisily clattering on her desk. She sighed, gripping them one more time before continuing to eat. If Guan Yu paid close attention, he could see that her hands twitched every now and then.

&quot;...I would&#39;ve done some investigation work to confirm the veracity of their statements, but I&#39;m not in the <em>mood</em> for it. Maybe another day.&quot; Spoke the young girl, staring fiercely at her noodles. 

It didn&#39;t take a bright mind to understand that her last statement wasn&#39;t entirely true.</span>

The jab towards him losing told him all he needed to know about her recovery. &quot;Glad to see that your recovery hasn&#39;t dulled your tongue, Miss Hess!&quot; A laugh came shortly after he finished his sentence. It was hard to dull the mood with such laughter filling the air.

&quot;Nothing solid to determine their identities I presume? That doesn&#39;t surprise me. It would be rather foolish of them to brazenly reveal their name when others could be listening in.&quot; They couldn&#39;t have gotten that lucky after all. At least they have the name of one of the servants so far. They will have plenty of time to figure out a proper plan to deal with them in the future.

The chopsticks falling out of her hand caused him to pay more attention to her hands. The damage must have been deeper than he thought. 

Her last statement caught his attention as well. There was fire in her eyes. Though towards what, he doesn&#39;t know.

&quot;May I ask why?&quot; A simple question came from him after the silence lingered for a bit. &quot;You usually aren&#39;t so hesitant, Miss Hess. Could it be that our fight with Saber is on your mind? Or could another issue be plaguing your thoughts? It would be wise to remember that as your servant I can prove to be more than just your blade. I can be quite the listener should you need to speak your mind.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A mental pillar was going to be necessary if she wanted to get through this war with her head still in one piece, and that was the thing Guan Yu had just offered her. Laura couldn&#39;t help but smile at her Servant&#39;s concern. Having someone that cared nearby felt almost better than if she were to actually talk things through. Her previously intense stare relaxed, turning into one of contemplation.

&quot;You may ask why, but you&#39;ll be disappointed by my answer.&quot; Replied Laura, gulping the last of her noodles before setting the box aside. &quot;I guess I&#39;m just... exhausted. Frustrated, maybe. Didn&#39;t expect our first fight to be this tiresome nor troublesome. I think I might&#39;ve underestimated how hard this war was gonna be. It just dawned on me that we went through all this trouble in our <em>first fight</em> and that there was much more in front of us, y&#39;know?&quot;

She collapsed on her desk with a sigh, her arms extending outwards in a deep stretch. 

&quot;But oh well, there&#39;s no point in bitching about that.&quot; Spoke Laura with more confidence, showing a carefree grin to her Servant. &quot;I guess my mood improved, &#39;cuz I suddenly feel the urge to go out there and do something—&quot;

<em>Bzzzzzt.</em>

As if to answer that last statement, the smartphone on her desk vibrated. She took the phone in her hands, looking at the source of said vibration. As soon as she got it between her fingers, the phone vibrated <em>ten more times</em> in quick succession. 

&quot;Fuckin&#39;...&quot; Swore Laura as her phone&#39;s screen lit up, showing dozens of notifications from the same number. She stared at the screen, squinting her eyes in consternation. <em>Who the fuck poked someone thirty times in ten seconds?</em> 

She slowly tapped a message on the text box, gripping the phone carefully with her weak hands.</span>

A reply in all caps arrived not even ten seconds later, followed by the beaming selfie of a young man whom Laura had just seen on one of her interviewee&#39;s shirt. He even struck a peace sign with his other hand and added bunny ear stickers to his head...wait...no, those weren&#39;t stickers. He was actually wearing those? In public? 

The bank was in the background, clear as day. Yep. Definitely in public.</span>

To him, this was just another battle to add onto the hundreds he experienced previously. But to her, it was her first real taste of war. She was completely out of her element.

Without so much of a word, Guan Yu got up so he could kneel by her desk and rest a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. 

&quot;I would start having doubts about whether or not we could make it to the end if you weren&#39;t as frustrated as you are now.&quot; Said Guan Yu with a calming smile on him. &quot;For someone like me or Saber, this is simply another day of the week for us. We both came from ages of strife and conflict and I&#39;m sure the other servants summoned to this City Grail War are similar. For us, this is normal. So, I understand why you&#39;re so frustrated. Something like this isn&#39;t normal for you. To be so out of your element can be frightening. However, you have showed that, despite all of that, you possess a warrior&#39;s spirit inside of you. Not many would make the same risks you took during our battle with Saber. Most would have fled and ran for the hills, but you stood tall and fought despite being outclassed. And that, Miss Hess, is what truly makes a Warrior.&quot; For that last part he stood up and slammed his fist onto his chest.

&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad you are feeling better. Now, about our next oppon-&quot; Before he could finish his thoughts, the device she used to request for food vibrated. Is it time to eat already? The interviews must have took longer than he thought. &quot;Are they unable to deliver? I could go pick it up myself if that&#39;s the case.&quot;

A photo?

She double-tapped it, revealing the man himself—Kun Wu—in robes bunny ears making an incredibly tacky peace sign. She couldn&#39;t help but snort, trying her best to restrain the laughter before it got out of control.

&quot;Check out this dork!&quot; She spoke half-laughing, showing Guan Yu the picture she was sent. &quot;Fucking cat ears, black robes literally sticking to his body, and the little peace sign—fuckin&#39; priceless!&quot;

The picture was instantly saved. A unique, exclusive picture of Kun Wu might come in handy to get favours.

She rapidly tapped on her phone, opening a video from DelphiTube™️ before turning her phone towards Guan Yu. The video showed Kun Wu standing on a crate, talking with much panache to a crowd of curious on-lookers. He was performing a summoning ritual.

&quot;Kun Wu. <em>He&#39;s a Master</em>.&quot; Laura spoke over the video, raising her voice to be heard over Kun Wu&#39;s shouts. &quot;Calls himself a Feng Shui master. Heard that he sucked at it, despite having a respectable pedigree and strong magical circuits. He&#39;s sort of a travelling merchant and... magical entertainer, I guess?&quot; 

She turned the phone back towards herself and skipped a large portion of the video, stopping right at the moment Rider appeared to showing her to the bearded-man.

&quot;He has summoned a Rider known as <em>Ching Shih</em>. You both come from the same place, although she was born <em>way later</em>. Her ServantPedia™️ page was a stub, so I don&#39;t know much &#39;bout her.&quot;

She had already expected this scenario: A Master fighting in the City Grail War, looking for intel on his opponents by calling upon her services. What she didn&#39;t expect was him, the carefree idiot from the market square, to be the first to call her. And he wanted to meet, too? 

That was suspicious.

She snapped a photo of her cup noodles, sending it to the young man along with a friendly message.</span>

The sight of Kun Wu left him a bit shocked. Just when he thought he understood this era&#39;s sense of fashion he is shown something like this. Though his Master&#39;s reaction told him that this wasn&#39;t normal, which was good. Something like that shouldn&#39;t be normal after all.

The next thing he was shown was a summoning ritual of the same man, this time in a stylish blue outfit. &quot;Are all the Masters in this war as eccentric as the last?&quot; He spoke while he scratched his head. He seriously doubted that they would witness the appearance of a &#39;normal&#39; Master at this point. 

The servant on the other hand was a different story. A Rider. &quot;A Miss Ching Shih, huh?&quot; The Throne gave him some knowledge of her, but it was incomplete at best as well. He was pleased to hear that they are from the same nationality however!

&quot;Are they openly declaring war against us? Perhaps their message is a formal warning?&quot; The basis of the message was still lost on Guan Yu so he assumes the option that makes the most sense given their relations as Masters in the same Grail War.

Kun Wu marched down an ordinary-looking street, phone in one hand and a bulging grocery bag in the other. He stopped halfway down the street, squinting as he compared the BoobleMaps™️ photo on his phone to the aged building on the other side of the street. 

A detective&#39;s office, smack dab in the middle of the most boring part of the town, looking like it could go out of business any moment. The impression of the building fit well with the photo of the half-eaten ramen cup he had received from the property&#39;s owner. A workaholic and a misanthrope, alone in his office with nothing but case files and empty ramen cups, perhaps haven&#39;t even showered for a day or two...Why, he could almost picture the rest of the office with his imagination alone!

&#39;How are you holding up, Rider?&#39; He asked his queasy assistant. &#39;I doubt this place has good ventilation inside. If you still have something to let out, now is the time.&#39;

After another puke session in a cramped alley, thankfully without Kun Wu watching, her Master led her to a quieter part of town.

Their destination was a rundown office, with Kun Wu complaining about the place&#39;s appearance, while still insisting that they head inside. Perhaps it was the nausea clouding her mind, but Ching Shih definitely started wondering if there was any purpose to the two&#39;s visits today. They had been to a shopping mall, a bank and now a rundown office. Her Master had taken her to all sorts of places, yet she failed to see why.

The more she thought about the boy, the more he sounded rather spoiled. Regardless, this was hopefully all part of a greater plan. One designed to win the Holy Grail War. Perhaps this building would reveal that secret?</span>

&quot;I am completely fine.&quot; Rider replied nonchalantly, still lost in thought about what Kun Wu sought to accomplish here.

&quot;A Servant&#39;s stamina is far superior to that of a human, milord. A few minutes is all it takes for me to be back to full strength. So long as we don&#39;t board a train again.&quot; She said with a groan, still feeling embarrassed at that little incident.

&quot;...How about you, milord?&quot; She asked abruptly. &quot;You&#39;ve certainly wasted quite a bit of time today. Not only did you fail to have your grand performance, but you spent time at the bank just to tone down the neighboring city&#39;s weather. You do realize that it&#39;s been several hours since we left your home, yes? Are you sure you&#39;re fully prepared for the Holy Grail War?&quot;

Her questions were inquisitive, and for good reason. Ching never had a huge amount of confidence in Kun Wu, but he had earned some degree of respect after his ballsy maneuvers back at his apartment. Now, however, it was looking more and more that Kun Wu didn&#39;t have the skills required to be the leader in this alliance.

&quot;What is your plan? Answer me.&quot; There was a certain coldness to her words, nothing like the soft and caring individual he had encountered at the bank. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

I regret with each passing minute that I didn&#39;t perform a divination before we left for the day.&#39; Kun Wu ruffled his hair in frustration. &#39;Maybe the bridge was secretly a magnet for bad Qi. I should&#39;ve known better than to perform in a new place without thoroughly investigating it first.&#39;

&#39;But what&#39;s done is done. There&#39;s no point in dwelling on past mistakes, so let&#39;s just get this small visit over with and be done with our day, what do you say?&#39;

He gave Rider a pat on the back as encouragement, but the woman did not reciprocate. Her attitude seemed to have taken a turn for the worse ever since the consecutive train rides. She interrogated Kun Wu like a warden, dropping even her usual playfulness as she shredded him and his lack of organization like some spoiled brat.

Kun Wu was taken aback. He had never pegged Ching Shih to be a warmonger. Was this the pirate side of her speaking? That at the end of the day, he was still dealing with a Servant who couldn&#39;t help but live by pillage, plunder and crime?

&#39;Are you questioning my leadership?&#39; The youth squinted his eyes. &#39;I thought I&#39;ve made it clear that rigging Olympia&#39;s weather dome is essential to my performance. I can&#39;t possibly set off fireworks in scorching heat and expect people to appreciate it, can I? They&#39;ll probably blast me out of the city with a pressurized waterjet.&#39; He folded his arms, looking pensive. Just imagining the scene made him shudder.

&#39;But thankfully the bank had a few connections on hand. With that out of the way, I just need to find out where the Olympia Masters are hiding and get the jump on them. Simple as that. Do you really need a better plan than this?&#39;</span>

The plan was, at best, a skeleton. Whether by accident or by choice, Kun Wu conveniently left out all the details such as strategies against specific Servant classes, or Masters of different schools of magecraft. He certainly seemed confident, but was that his skills or foolishness talking?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s apologies started feeling more and more like snake oil. Initially, Rider was content with letting the boy make a fool of himself with his repeated excuses. However, she had noticed a bit of a pattern: For the past few weeks, it was kind of a cycle. Kun Wu proposed some foolish idea, Ching complained, Kun Wu apologized and acted like a stray puppy, causing Ching to feel pity and give him another chance.

....

Was she actually the <em>fool</em> in this scenario? Maybe she was the one being conned after all.

In fact, the moment Rider was showing any degree of criticism or autonomy, Kun Wu immediately attempted to shut her down and reinforce his own motives. It was absolutely <strong>necessary</strong> to weaken the weather dome. It truly was!

At least, that&#39;s what he insisted.

Maybe Kun Wu wasn&#39;t as innocent or na&#239;ve as Rider had thought.

She was done playing games with a spoiled brat, especially when she had a dream to achieve. Rider opened her mouth, about to deliver cold and harsh words...

...Until she realized that they were still far off from their destination. While they had arrived at a rundown office, it seemed like the entrance was blocked by two burly men dressed in black. Guards, no doubt.

She glanced at Kun Wu, eyeing him suspiciously before deciding to go along with his plan. This was his last chance: If whatever lurked beyond the office was something actually useful to Rider&#39;s cause, then she would forgive the boy.

<em>&quot;Sigh.&quot;</em> Ching groaned, cursing herself for her softness. Why couldn&#39;t someone older have summoned her? At least she would get them out of the picture with no remorse...</span>

This time, even with sunglasses to match! Was it just him, or had Delphi&#39;s collective fashion sense taken a serious hit these past few weeks? 

&#39;I don&#39;t recall ever making an appointment with them, if that&#39;s what you meant.&#39; He shrugged, sizing the men up. It wouldn&#39;t take a genius to figure out who had employed them, but, well...he thought back to the sad-looking ramen photo again. Was this informant of theirs so poor that they couldn&#39;t even afford to hire an actual mage - or better yet, a Servant to stand guard? Were they not aware that a City Grail War was happening right under their nose? 

Either the bank had duped them, or this informant was craftier than they had let on.

Of course, all would soon be revealed once they set foot into the building.

&#39;You speak my mind, Rider.&#39; Kun Wu went and pointed at the guards from across the street. As if they hadn&#39;t already loitered long enough to be suspicious! &#39;It wouldn&#39;t be fair to the rest of the world if I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s ever borne witness to your, ah, display of power. Why don&#39;t you take out your pent up frustration on those guys instead?&#39; <em>And spare me the forehead flicks later,</em> he thought.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Judging by Kun Wu&#39;s response, it seemed he hadn&#39;t accounted at all for the men guarding the entrance to the shady building. In other words, the other party probably didn&#39;t expect him at all. Did he even book a meeting? What was that thing about communicating with his informant? Did they even communicate in the first place?!?

It was small details like this that caused her to lose faith in the reckless youth. She wondered if the same thing would happen once they entered the building. Would Kun Wu ask her to do other unreasonable things? Who could say.

What Rider knew was that she wanted a way to release. Kun Wu so kindly directed her towards the guards, as if implying she should treat them as playthings.

&quot;Milord, please. My love taps towards you are merely a sign of affection. I&#39;ll be happy to oblige with some more once we get back home, since you clearly miss them.&quot; Ching replied in a sarcastic fashion, causing Kun Wu to shiver a bit as he wondered whether his Servant was joking or not.

On the bright side, he could tell that her attention was now focused elsewhere.

There were various ways to tackle these two men. They didn&#39;t seem to be mages, nor could Ching sense a threatening presence from them. They were simply normal guards. The type that was most vulnerable against Ching Shih. All she needed to do was to whisper sweet, honeyed words and they would let her pass through.

But that wouldn&#39;t satisfy her darker urges. The feeling that she had been played all along by this annoying brat. The fact that she didn&#39;t seem to be any closer to her goal. The thought of failing to obtain the wish of her dreams...

It was enough to turn her from a peacock to a tigress.

&quot;Ahem, gentlemen?&quot; Ching said with a warm smile as she cracked her knuckles. Her beautiful body, feminine and elegant as always, was now in conflict with her surprisingly toned arms.

&quot;You look like you would make for some fine chairs.&quot;

Without wasting a moment, she immediately lunged at one of the two and sucker punched them in the face. Blood spurted out of their nostrils as they failed to even see their assailant&#39;s fist land. Their head knocked on the wall, knocking them unconscious as they slid off the gray surface and left a bloody streak behind them.

The other guard was given extra seconds to react. Their first instinct to run, but they realized that it would result in showing their back, which meant death. Their will to survive kicked in as they instead attempted to overpower Rider...who immediately grappled the man and put them in a gorilla vice grip. Her nails were even poking into his eyes!

Kun Wu would witness the entire spectacle from a safe distance, albeit he had no idea that his Servant could be <em>this</em> violent. Ching Shih kept crushing the man&#39;s head as blood oozed from their nose and mouth. Even more sinister was the fact that she kept staring at Kun Wu while committing such brutal acts.</span>

He wouldn&#39;t like that implication.

Once Ching Shih had her fill, she suddenly released her grip, saving the guard&#39;s eyesight as the nails stopped from digging further. He lied on the ground, unconscious, while the other guard groaned as well. Both of them had sustained heavy injuries, but she had left them alive. Kun Wu dreaded to think about the months of recovery needed after this type of torture.

&quot;Satisfied, milord? I assume I performed within your expectations~&quot; Rider played coy as she sat on the body of one of the downed guards. She then tapped on it. 

&quot;Sit. It&#39;s surprisingly comfortable.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Like a tiger that had been let out of their cage, Ching Shih pounced on the two guards and made short work of them before they even had a chance to yelp. Blood spurted freely, painting the pavement a dark shade of crimson and turning the detective&#39;s office into a fresh crime scene.

There was only one witness. 

Kun Wu felt his eyes twitch in sympathy with each deliverance of Rider&#39;s mighty punch. He <em>almost</em> felt bad for the guards, but then he remembered that if he didn&#39;t give Rider her fix right now, he would very likely become her next stress relief target, and that would not be ideal. 

<em>Your sacrifices would not be in vain,</em> he thought, clenching his butt as he sat himself down on the sidewalk and reached for his inner zen. There was almost a rhythm to Rider&#39;s punches, like a Mokugyo&#39;s drumming his old masters were so fond of during their lengthy meditations. If he pretended hard enough, he could almost take Rider&#39;s gaze for that of kindness and imagine that she was punching those guys for his own benefits!

Eventually, the two guards collapsed like sacks of rice, perfect for Rider to mold into her new seat. She was even generous enough to offer a spot for her Master!

But Kun Wu shook his head.

&#39;I&#39;ve rested enough.&#39; He said, his back prickling with unease. It had been easy enough to set the tigeress loose, but how to rein her back in? Rather than satiating her hunger, it seemed that the guards had only worked up her appetite more. 

Thankfully, the perfect distraction was just on the other side of the wall.

&#39;Now that you&#39;ve had your appetizer, how about the main course?&#39; He dodged her piercing gaze with a question of his own, making sure to give her seat a wide berth as he made his way towards the building&#39;s entrance. He placed both hands on the door then paused, twisting around to study Rider&#39;s new throne one more time.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sight Kun Wu would be greeted by was that of a barrel, pointed directly at his forehead. It&#39;s owner, a slender-looking girl sporting loose clothing, with white porcelain skin and short blonde hair, didn&#39;t look pleased in the least. Her pale blue eyes screamed <em>resolve</em>, making him understand that she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to pull the trigger at the slightest misstep. 

The sight of the gun might&#39;ve also distracted the youth from the <em>mountain of a man</em> standing next to him, guandao in hand. He, too, didn&#39;t look pleased.

&quot;How about <em>I</em> arrange a play starring a dead kid right now, instead?&quot; Spoke the girl with a tang of enmity.

Was <em>she</em> the shady informant they had heard about? An oddity, seeing how young and frail she looked. But if she was, it seemed like even girls had their fair share of fights in this business, looking at the bandages she was wearing on her arms. 

The gloomy office behind her was even more of a mess that the picture had transpired. If Kun Wu dared to look away from the gun, he could see that a board game had been placed on the ground besides the girl, standing out from the other things by virtue of being somewhat spared from the surrounding chaos. 

Adding to that, an ominous hum could be heard from inside the office. It didn&#39;t get any shadier than that.

&quot;For starters, how about you tell me what the fuck happened with my two boys over there.&quot; The girl said, briefly pointing the two bloodied guards behind him with her barrel before returning to Kun Wu.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To say that he had stirred up a wasp&#39;s nest would be an understatement. No sooner had his eyes adjusted to the dimly lit interior than his body reacted to the tiny instrument poking out of the dark. Or, he <em>would</em> have, had he not realized that he was being held at gun point by a frail girl who looked barely past her teens.

Did they get the wrong address after all?

Kun Wu quickly dismissed the idea. If anything, he should be the last person to judge someone by their appearance. Not to mention that she had clearly come prepared, <em>waited</em> even, for him to step into the beast&#39;s den without suspecting a thing. The two chumps outside may as well have been the perfect bait to lower his guard. And it had worked! To no one&#39;s surprise. If this were a game of chess, then Kun Wu may have just suffered the world&#39;s fastest checkmate to date.

Fortunately for him, the world was a lot more complex than a checkered gameboard.

&#39;How about I reject that proposal?&#39; He said after some serious consideration. &#39;On the grounds that you aren&#39;t going to make a profit with such a drab premise. No one&#39;s going to pay to watch you puppeteer a corpse on the stage - we have Servants for that, and the spectacles they generate, on average, are much more exciting.&#39;

&#39;Besides, I doubt it&#39;s in your best interest in shoot down a client.&#39;

Kun Wu opened the door a few inches further to let more light shine through the passageway, conveniently blocking the mountainous shadow of the Office Guardian from view and sparing himself a would-be jump scare. Instead he scoured the messy room beyond, eventually spotting the ramen cup that had had the honor of being cached into his phone storage.

It seemed that the shadowy man would have to relocate to reveal himself once more...

Not that Kun Wu would&#39;ve minded, though!

&#39;Oh and I&#39;m here to make that appointment. For...right now.&#39; He added cheekily, not even bothering to acknowledge the two sad heaps outside, whose fate he had narrowly missed. If out of sight, out of mind weren&#39;t one of his mottos, then it was now. &#39;If you&#39;ve been waiting for my arrival all this time, then surely you don&#39;t need me to explain any more than that?&#39;

For someone who was greeted with a gun first, he appeared to be taking this introduction quite well. <em>Fearless.</em> Or simply just stupid. Either or. It could be both actually. Not that he had the time to ponder on this any longer than he already has.

Guan Yu was just about to step forward and place himself between his Master and Kun Wu when, with a clever use of the door, Kun Wu managed to stop his advance before he could even make the first move! Perhaps his foolishness was merely a fa&#231;ade to hide the true Kun Wu within...

He would have to play his cards carefully around him lest he fall prey to another one of his traps.

Once the door was open, Guan Yu stepped out into the light and revealed the mountain of a servant clad in green robes that he is. The gentle breeze made his silky magnificent beard flow ever so slightly in the wind. &quot;If not, then you may simply just say the word and I will gladly remove our &#39;guests&#39; from the grounds.&quot; It seemed that simple hired muscle wasn&#39;t the only thing the informant had protecting her.

Being outside gave him a proper view of the two of them. Kun Wu and his servant, Madame Ching. His gaze stayed on her the longest. It was almost like he was examining her, trying to figure out who she was, or at the very least trying his best to pretend to do so. &quot;Unless my eyes are playing tricks on me, you must be the famed Prostitute-turned-Pirate-Queen herself, Madame Ching! I must say it is an honour to meet you.&quot; Guan Yu said with a slight bow to pay his respects to her. Did this man just discern her identity by merely observing her? Also, he didn&#39;t mean for his words to sound as insulting as they did but he definitely could have chosen better words, especially given she was sitting on a throne of two broken bodies already...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Disappointment filled Ching&#39;s eyes as Kun Wu repudiated her generous seat offer. Well, someone else would have to appreciate the finely shaped posterior of the guard she was sitting on.

Of course, they weren&#39;t here to toy with a pair of burly men. The true person of the hour decided that it was time to show themselves, as Laura opened the door to see what all the ruckus was about and noticed Kun Wu. She was quick to point a gun at his head, keeping him in check while asking him about his motives.

Kun Wu was nothing but fearless, opening the door and further revealing Laura as the informant behind those cryptic texts and photos. Not only that, but he revealed a man standing right beside her. A giant with a shapely beard and a body bearing fruits of rigorous battles.

Ching&#39;s attention was piqued, especially when said Servant addressed her by name specifically. A person from her time period? No, she never met a man of this stature. His clothing also looked old. Far too old for her own time period. They seemed to be traditional outfits, the kind that she had seen in stage plays and performances in the past. A famous actor? No, they had a dignified aura to them, unlike the Caster from a few days ago.

An uneasy sense of dread started filling Ching&#39;s mind. She left her seat and walked closer, giving the man a closer look. Despite how delicate and polite Guan Yu sounded, it was hard for him to hide his unnerving presence. As Rider stared further at the ginormous man, she felt like she was gleaming into the eyes of a crimson phoenix...

There was no person in China who didn&#39;t know of his legend. A tale as old as time, constantly repeated throughout generations. That outfit. His stature. His beard. His eyes. There was only one person who matched this image that Ching had seen.

None other than one of the fiercest warriors from the tale of Three Kingdoms: <strong>Guan Yu.</strong></span>

Her legs trembled as a shiver ran down her spine. Someone this old and this well-known had been summoned as a Servant. A Servant that would most likely become her opponent in the next five minutes.

...Could she even beat him in a fight?

...

She had no answer to that. Instead, she looked back to Kun Wu, who was still fully confident in his approach and wearing a shit-eating grin. He most likely hadn&#39;t notice Guan Yu yet, since Laura was pointing a gun at his head.

<em>&quot;...There is no possible outcome where I defeat Guan Yu with my own physical strength.&quot;</em> Ching Shih shamefully admitted in her head, strategizing at the speed of milliseconds while observing the condition of the current battlefield.

<em>&quot;Enemy Master. Owns a firearm. Trained at Kun Wu. Kun Wu can handle it, I&#39;m not his mother. The problem is if Guan Yu steps in.&quot;</em> She bit her lip out of frustration. Anytime she came up with a plan to turn the tables on Laura and assume dominance, Guan Yu blocked that line of thought like a brick wall. All sorts of schemes and plans led to the same destination: A swift end at the hand of the phoenix&#39;s lance.

Was this how it felt to be hopelessly outmatched? It was as if Ching Shih had finally woken up from a long dream. She hadn&#39;t been summoned to cater to a child&#39;s silly performances or tease them like a baby. She had been summoned for a Holy Grail War. A war designed to fulfill a person&#39;s wish.

And she had a wish. A very important one. Guan Yu was standing in her way.

It reminded her of the past. When she had been forced to surrender to Bai Lang. Her measly 24 ships against 226 ships. An opponent ten times stronger than her. That&#39;s how imposing Guan Yu felt.

Three seconds had passed since Guan Yu spoke to Ching Shih. In those three seconds, Rider had fully calculated her chances of victory if she misspoke.

<strong>Zero.</strong></span>

&quot;Oh my!&quot; Ching replied with a warm smile, taking care to wipe the blood from her gloved hands. &quot;I am honored that a hero from the fabled Three Kingdoms knows of a humble pirate such as myself. Your reputation precedes you, Lord Guan Yu. I certainly cannot say the same of myself.&quot;

It was terrifying. To be forced to play docile just to avoid a one-sided stomp. Yet this feeling was all too familiar. It was the same as training herself to reply courteously to esteemed clients at her brothel.

&quot;So I am rather curious. How exactly did you know of me? Have I perhaps caught your eye, my fabled general?&quot; She asked with a giggle, before looking back to Laura.

&quot;And I see that you&#39;ve settled on good company. It is rather refreshing to see two Masters at each other&#39;s throats like this.&quot; Rider smirked, knowing that it would take more than a gun to silence people like Kun Wu. If it were that simple, she would have done that already.

&quot;But I&#39;d hate for our first meeting to be spoiled by such events.&quot; She glanced at the unconscious guards. &quot;So, how about we call it a draw for today and let our Masters discuss? I feel like they have met each other already. Maybe not in person, but definitely in spirit.&quot; She said, referring to Kun Wu&#39;s mystical phone screen. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;You&#39;d hate for our first meeting to be spoiled by such events, huh.&quot; Spat Laura, her eyes briefly drafting from one guard to the other. &quot;Those words would sound a lot more credible if they didn&#39;t come from the eye-gouging lunatic who almost iced my men in cold blood. Didn&#39;t even give the poor guys a chance to talk.&quot;

The feats of the she-pirate didn&#39;t escape her vision. The tremors the worms felt underground with each hit, the vibrations that the flies captured through their sensible hairs, the impact that was showed through the innumerable windows of her arachnids—she had felt every blow intensely, almost as if she had been the one on the receiving end. If Ching Shih&#39;s blows didn&#39;t mean to kill, <em>they came dangerously close to it.</em>

Putting an end to her introspection, her focus returned to the little troublemaker in front of her. Kun Wu.

He was no pushover, one of the Masters she wanted to avoid if possible. Serious money went into finding out about his background—about potential weaknesses she could exploit to bring him down. But other than his exuberance and self-assurance, nothing came out. The guy was supposedly a talented martial artist, a great fire Magus and had all the magical circuits in the world to support him in his endeavours. What was there to do against something like that?

Coming across freaks was starting to get old. Escaping from the clutches of the crazed bipolar monk just to fall into genius wonder boy&#39;s mouth. Couldn&#39;t they just, come across a normal dude for once?

Either way, her bugs captured an interesting reaction from the boy&#39;s Servant, subtle enough that she would&#39;ve completely missed it if not for the countless windows that were monitoring her every movement.

<em>It was the shakiness in Ching Shih&#39;s legs in reaction to the emergence of her Servant.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Thinking about it, that reaction made sense. With his friendliness and boisterous laughs, you could almost forget that Lancer was so strong that he was considered <em>divine</em>. Ching Shih had technically met one of her gods. It&#39;d be like meeting Jesus H. Christ in person, only he stood two meters tall, had an enormous weapon in hand and was ready to pounce on you at the slightest mistake. <em>Anyone</em> would feel pressured in this situation.

&quot;Seems like everyone knows about you &#39;round here, big man.&quot; She spoke to her servant, a slight smirk finding its way to her lips. &quot;You asked me if those guys were my clients. Well... I dunno. My mood turned real shitty when those two came in. And honestly? I&#39;ve had my share with idiots for today, I don&#39;t know if I can take one more...&quot;

As things stood, they had the advantage. Even if Kun Wu was to neutralise her, Guan Yu was right behind her back to salvage the situation. If she wanted, she could easily diffuse the situation and make their opponents leave. Hell, she was confident she could take them on, looking at the current situation—

&quot;...You know what?&quot; Spoke the young girl as her index finger bent slightly inwards, <em>teasing</em> the gun&#39;s trigger. &quot;I&#39;m feeling hella generous today.&quot;

—But why not push ahead and see what comes out of it? Stopping at a stalemate would be satisfactory, but one couldn&#39;t win a Holy Grail War without taking additional <em>risks</em>. <em>Don&#39;t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great</em>, was it?

&quot;After all, those two came a long way from the bank just to bring us groceries, it&#39;d be a shame to turn them down so easily. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in their <em>little bag</em> before deciding, yeah?&quot; The young girl spoke, a daring smile on her face.

She was obviously not referring to his bag of groceries. Hopefully, Kun Wu would catch on the meaning of her words.</span>

She is the fabled Pirate Queen. Perhaps she has her entire fleet in reserve for her to use. The numerical advantage would put him on the backpedal, especially on the ocean. Maybe it&#39;s her most precious treasure she acquired as a Pirate Queen. Given her illustrious background, the possibilities are vast. Too many for him to feel comfortable towards. 

It certainly didn&#39;t make the tension around them any thinner.

Whatever the case may be, she must be pretty confident with her abilities to barge right up to their door like this. She didn&#39;t even back down after figuring out his true name.

&quot;You&#39;re far too kind! There are only a few historical figures out there that could lay claim to the title of Pirate Queen after all, Madame Ching!&quot; He responded with a loud laugh despite the high tensions with one of the Masters being held at literal gunpoint.

Death was primed and ready to claim their first victim out of the situation and the man simply laughed.

&quot;The Throne had gifted us with some knowledge as servants after all! That, and my Master showed me a video on her magic tablet that she said was becoming rather popular on something called DelphiTube™️.&quot; He said while pretending to hold the general shape in his hand and pointed to it. It seemed that her Master&#39;s public summon spread quite far around the city if he was able to acquire her identity through the video. 

Who knows how many potential candidates of the CGW also knew of her were out there because of the video!

You know, besides the usual bodyguard details.&quot; He revealed while stroking his beard. 

She did hear that right. Guan Yu was the informant&#39;s acting bodyguard. It makes one wonder just how much she spent to acquire such a famous servant as a personal bodyguard.

&quot;A draw? I wasn&#39;t aware we were dueling! If I knew, I would have called for Red Hare to join us! I am merely making sure that my Master is protected. Can never be too safe with these masters running around.&quot; He replied with a smile as he continued to carefully watch the situation between the two masters unfold. 

&quot;It is as you say, it seems that I cannot hide my true name even if I tried, Master.&quot; He remarked to his Master. He would be genuinely surprised to find someone who <em>didn&#39;t</em> know about him at this point.

Kun Wu rummaged in his grocery bag and produced...a beautiful daikon radish. He spun the plump vegetable on his finger for all to see, then continued.

&#39;Hotpot is on the menu today. Care to join? It&#39;s a meal best shared by a group. I&#39;ve got other veggies too, and meats, if that&#39;s more of your thing.&#39; He shook the grocery bag, showing Laura the numerous square edges poking through the bag from all sides. There must be at least a dozen packaged items in there, enough to feed a soccer team&#39;s worth of Lauras. &#39;My grandmama always told me to eat a balanced meal at least once a day. Nutritional imbalance is a serious matter; I&#39;d hate to see you miss your shot because your fingers got all twitchy, see-&#39;

Whether Laura saw the wisdom in his words or not was no longer important, because Kun Wu&#39;s eyes were already drawn to the immense shadow that had finally unwedged itself from behind the door. A booming voice followed by the illustrious frame of a General from a long time past, crossing over the threshold into the realm of light. Verdant robes swayed in the breeze and so did his magnificent beard, only to further accentuate the rugged, inhuman and indominable frame underneath. 

Unlike the two chumps standing guard outside the building, this mountain of a man exuded authority, as well as the strength to back it up. 

Ching Shih was right. There was not a single person of Chinese descent who <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> recognize this man even if they tried.

Yet this legend of a war general was willingly playing bodyguard for the little girl.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If this man&#39;s merely existence wasn&#39;t already suspicious enough, then the drastic change in Ching Shih&#39;s attitude completely eradicated any doubt Kun Wu may have had. An ingratiating servitude she hadn&#39;t displayed even in front of that government official and their sharply dressed Servant...was she trying to manipulate this Servant in a way that she had deemed fit? 

This would mark the second person she had tried to charm off the bat, the first one being her own Master. Yet even as Rider laid on her honeyed words, Kun Wu couldn&#39;t help but feel that something was amiss. The way she carefully cleaned her gloves, the coy inflection in her voice, usually reserved only for when she really, <em>really</em> wanted something go her way, and not to mention...

...She was willing to settle for a <em>truce</em>, no strings attached. 

What a <em>reasonable</em> proposal! It almost felt like something Kun Wu himself would suggest! But coming from the infamous pirate queen, captain of the Red Fleet?

Kun Wu was taken aback. Rider was <em>yielding</em>. He had never seen the woman act so submissively before.

The air was taut with tension. The slightest misstep could result in something completely unsalvageable. Kun Wu&#39;s head wasn&#39;t so big that he believed he could take on another Servant at full strength when his own was having second doubts. The little Miss also sounded more prickly than he&#39;d given her credit for, not even falling for Ching&#39;s antics. Either that, or it really was as they said in sappy romance dramas that similars repel. 

Who&#39;d have thought that romance dramas could be so educational?

Still, it would be in his best interest to rid of this tension. Even though neither Guan Yu nor Ching Shih seemed intent to fight, with a potent enough trigger - he eyed Laura&#39;s gun - things could still get ugly at a moment&#39;s notice.

Kun Wu decided to leverage his thick skin.

I used to doodle mustaches on your face when I was a wee little kid and get spanked for it, but now you&#39;re here sporting one of your very own! I was right all along!&#39; He shook his head with a pout, as if the memories still pained him greatly. 

&#39;Seems like you&#39;ve taken on quite a lush job though. Do you still guard doors, or have you dedicated yourself to protecting your Master? Not that it matters either way, because it&#39;s just like you said, you can hardly call this a duel when only one of us has bared her fangs.&#39; 

Kun Wu shook the daikon radish in his head to further drive the point home.

&#39;Even as a Servant, a famous legend such as yourself still has principles to uphold, right? Guan Yu, Guardian of Doors and Persecutor of Evil Spirits. On the other hand, you would allow unrestricted passage for benign spirits who bear no ill will.&#39;

&#39;Well?&#39;

As if to further test his theory, Kun Wu took a step forward, officially planting one(1) foot inside the building and further diminishing the gap between the muzzle of the gun and his forehead.

&#39;All I&#39;ve got are good looks, good talks and good food from a reputable market. I don&#39;t even have free hands to grab my weapon.&#39; He tilted his head and motioned towards the iron fan strapped to his waist. &#39;What, do you expect me to spell cast while holding this spicy vegetable? You think much too highly of me.&#39; He heaved a dramatic sigh, as if wounded by the other pair&#39;s insensitive words.

&#39;Besides, it&#39;s not like you don&#39;t already know why I&#39;m here. Why else would you register yourself at the bank if you aren&#39;t ready to dole out some juicy intel for an exchange of favors? I think I&#39;m worth a lot more as I am, without an extra hole between my eye sockets.&#39;

You can&#39;t stroll at night without having one of these laying around, <em>especially if you&#39;re a weak and vulnerable girl like me</em>. I&#39;d call it common sense to aim it at a dangerous boy&#39;s head, even more if he brings his Servant to an &#39;appointment&#39;.&quot;

Her loose t-shirt dangled as she repositioning her head, observing the vegetable he had taken out of his bag. An urge to snort came upon her, but she kept it at bay. Putting his cocky and suicidal tendencies aside, she had to admit that he had a sense of humour. Diffusing the tension to make room for negotiations, hinting at his bargaining chips for the exchange—little guy was more than just a mere street performer, <em>he was a real Delphi business owner.</em>

&quot;As for your supposed worth... I&#39;ve got an unused stove-top and a few cooking utensils laying around that you could use.&quot; The girl spoke, nodding towards the interior of her office. &quot;Your hotpot better taste good, cuz it&#39;s gonna take some gourmet shit to liven up my mood.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and you might want to give up your <em>weapons</em> before entering my office, just in case. We&#39;ll put them in a cute little bag that you can retrieve upon leaving. Sounds good to you?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If Ching could sigh, she would. Laura&#39;s short fuse was spent as she pitied the two fools who came knocking on her door without a care in the world. Rider would have to thank Kun Wu for his unfaltering tendency of saying idiotic things even in dire situations. This type of strategy had its charm, especially when used against foes that could crush you in an instant.

Rider would love to retreat and call it a day, but the opposing Master insisted on taking advantage of Kun Wu&#39;s vegetables and making a stew. No doubt as a way to keep an eye on the boy and his Servant. Ching wasn&#39;t in the mood for eating, in fact she could barely stomach the thought. After vomiting twice and being humbled by Guan Yu&#39;s presence, she wished she could just disappear.

&quot;...Do as she says, milord.&quot; Ching nodded, suggesting Kun Wu follow Laura&#39;s orders. &quot;Though, I think my partner would very much appreciate it if a weapon weren&#39;t pointed at them too.&quot; She stared at Laura.

Guan Yu didn&#39;t seem to be the least bothered by the exchange between the two Masters. If anything, he seemed pleased. Cheery, even. The man was so mighty and strong, yet just and virtuous as well. That&#39;s what made him so scary: A figure so pure and noble could <em>only</em> exist in myth. Ching Shih could not hope to defeat a man that worked on a completely different wavelength than hers.

All she could do was bide her time and make sure that her enemies didn&#39;t see her as a threat. It was the only road to survival.

&quot;And if you&#39;re worried about me, well,&quot; Ching Shih stepped forward, lowering her hands and acting submissively.</span>

&quot;If you really want to make a proper meal, then surely you have no issues with me helping? I am a woman too, you know.&quot; She pointed out. &quot;And you will be able to keep an eye on me at all times while I&#39;m in the kitchen. A fine agreement, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;

She smirked with confidence as she inched closer and waited for Laura to let the Rider team inside of her office. There was no reason to refuse Ching&#39;s offer, especially since it would lessen the workload.
