Mass rapid transit, commonly known as subway or the underground by most, was one of humanity&#39;s greatest achievements. Affordable and expedient public transit was a revolutionary invention, allowing people to go from one portion of a city to another in a matter of minutes.

Such an invention would never reach Ching Shih&#39;s eyes, for she had died just a decade before the first rapid transit system released in London. As a woman of the seas, she could only dream of how metropolitan trains looked like.

Kun Wu would feel rather relaxed, satisfied that his fame had already attracted the competition of other Masters. The man in European clothes and the lady that reminded him of the men in black were fearsome, but they paled in comparison to Rider. Who knew that she was such a natural at costumes? Ching&#39;s bunny ears had practically moved on their own! The boy couldn&#39;t help but feel like the woman&#39;s talents were being wasted. Instead of participating in a Grail War, she should simply become his stage assistant!

Of course, proposing that idea would be suicidal, so it was best to relent on that. Instead, Kun Wu focused on his Servant, who was idly sitting on a train and staring at the window. Ching&#39;s senses felt overwhelmed: The rocking of a train moving at high speed, the passengers hanging on to their seats and nearby rails, the dim background of Delphi&#39;s underground transit being visible to her eyes. It was an entirely different feeling compared to riding a ship.

She liked it.

&quot;Milord, do you take the train often?&quot; She asked out of the blue, catching the boy off guard. He vividly remembered his Servant flying into a rage once the performance had ended, blabbering something akin to <em>&#39;Don&#39;t you ever <strong>DARE</strong> make me perform on a stage again.&#39;</em>. He had left her alone after that, but now his own Servant was sparking conversation. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu heaved a heavy sigh, casting a forlorn look out the subway window and at the pitch blackness of the subway tunnels...only to find his own reflection staring right back at him.

<em>Damned lights,</em> he cursed inwardly at the brightly lit subway car. Couldn&#39;t even let him sulk properly. 

The show had been a total bust. He had expected the local law enforcement to show up somewhere around the middle of the performance to tell him to tear everything down, but to run into a government official - one that he had shared history with - right from the get-go? How unlucky was that?

Not to mention that he had to ignite all his fireworks just to cause a scene and shake them off. In the end, he had sabotaged the show with his own two hands, without even leaving a proper explanation for the crowd he and Rider had gathered. What were they going to think? That he was a fraud? Rider must have thought so, since she was <em>this</em> close to strangling him for standing her up on their first collaborative work. Her impression on his showmanship must&#39;ve fallen to an all time low. Did she think that he had been toying with her feelings?

Kun Wu felt like screaming. And so he buried his face in his hands and started crying <em>inwardly</em>.

<em>He was so frustrated. So embarrassed! So angry! The shopping center! The heart of the CBD! How dare he waste - no, *ruin</em> - a magnificent chance like this!*

He kept bawling in his head, until Rider&#39;s words slapped him back into reality.

Right. The train. He had almost forgotten why they&#39;d gotten on it in the first place.

Kun Wu rubbed his face and tried to concentrate. <em>It&#39;s just one show,</em> he told himself. <em>You&#39;ve done worse before. Way worse.</em> He took deep breaths to calm his feelings. <em>Look on the bright side. You didn&#39;t sniff out any Olympian Masters, but you found one of your own!</em> He slapped his own cheeks, pumping himself up. 

<em>More positive thoughts. More positive thoughts to tide him over!</em>

<em>She still hadn&#39;t taken them off.</em>

That observation alone saved him. Rider may have been close to tearing his face off after that disastrous &#39;performance&#39;, but the bunny ears were proof enough that she hadn&#39;t totally burned the bridge down. That, plus the fact that she looked rather pleased, sitting in her cushy seat and rocking along with the subway train.

For the majority of the time that she had been summoned, Rider had only ever been coquettish or cruel. Seeing her display such a lackadaisical of her - in a crowded train no less - was a rare treat. Enough to perk him up some.

Kun Wu found his stride again.

&#39;Weird question.&#39; He said, patting the free space on his own seat. &#39;It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything else to take. The train is all we&#39;ve got.&#39; He looked thoughtful for the moment. &#39;Why do you ask? Are you getting trainsick? I don&#39;t have a doggie bag with me, just so you know.&#39;

She wasn&#39;t wrong, considering how she could manhandle him like a gorilla with just one hand. Nonetheless, her attitude was still odd. Her bunny ears perked up like miniature antennas, as if her curiosity had been piqued by the metal transport that the two were currently riding.

&quot;But you take this often? Daily, even?&quot; She asked with a look that betrayed her. Her usual, smug gaze was replaced with an inquisitive one. She wanted to know. More about this train. More about the daily life of the modern world.

&quot;Back in my time, our transport was limited. Covering such large distances in a metal tomb never crossed our minds.&quot; Ching lightly tapped at the subway walls with her elongated fingernails, looking ecstatic with each sound caused by her gentle strokes. She was smiling, something that confused Kun Wu greatly. This boring old train ride was something she...enjoyed?

Indeed, Rider felt some sort of happiness brew within her. Something that was far more potent than a storm or an enemy fleet. The gift of learning something new. The realization that she knew more now than she did before. Even Servants could learn...She felt lucky that she had been summoned.

Unfortunately, something else was brewing within her. Something far more sinister.

It started in her stomach and started gradually rising. Her bright, rosy cheeks suddenly started looking blue. She turned to Kun Wu and abruptly hugged him, catching him off guard while alerting the envious gazes of men nearby.

&quot;M-Milord...Milord! Milord! Milord!&quot; She exclaimed while pouting and sweating. The air around Kun Wu was hot and steamy. His Servant&#39;s cries were panicky and he started wondering what was going on. Even her rabbit ears were flopping up and down repeatedly. What had gotten into Rider? She was acting so flustered? Could it be...his <em>chance?</em></span>

He realized what it was once Rider raised her head, allowing him to take a good look at her face.

She was suffering, her cheeks puffed as she was holding back something vile inside of her mouth.

&quot;M-M-Milord...Bag...Please.&quot; She whimpered. So much for being sturdy. Even a Servant of the seas had their weaknesses... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Kun Wu went through the five stages of grief the instant realization dawned on him. Ching Shih clung to him, not out of affection, but out of necessity. She was like a volcano that was set to erupt at any moment. If only he hadn&#39;t taken a jab at her! Who&#39;d have thought that he had quite the knack for (mis)fortune-telling?!

&#39;I told you, I didn&#39;t bring a doggie bag!&#39; He hissed, sweating profusely and frantically turning all his pockets inside out to look for something that remotely resembled a container of some kind. Cold sweat rolled down Rider&#39;s face as the woman convulsed ever so slightly with every hitch of the train. She was pushing herself to the absolute limit to fight back the rising bile... 

But some battles simply weren&#39;t meant to be won.

The train pulled to a stop. Kun Wu could sense the inertia setting back in, feeling his body, his <em>guts</em>, pushing him from side to side and front to back, making him sway gently on the spot. An otherwise completely ordinary, physical phenomenon, yet the youth&#39;s heart sank when his arm nearly broke under Rider&#39;s brute strength as she reacted violently to the train brakes. 

<em>Something</em> was coming! His face paled upon realizing that Rider had caught him in a vice-like grip, effectively forcing him into the front row seat to the most awful and tragic event in human history: becoming someone else&#39;s puke bucket.

&#39;Hold on, hold on!!! Hold my hand, anything! We&#39;re getting off!&#39; He almost squeaked in a panic, hauling Rider out of the train the moment the doors opened. But even that motion was too much for the woman to handle in her current state. Kun Wu felt sharp nails digging into his shoulders as rippling spasms rocked up Rider&#39;s frame, and he knew that his time was up.

&#39;Oh, fuck me,&#39; He ripped his overcoat off and held it in front of Rider&#39;s mouth, then closed his eyes.

Out of sight, out of mind. A golden saying that had stood the test of time. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t applicable to the current predicament. Ching had smartly retreated to a dark alley near the train station, but the sound of her vile puking was enough to make even Kun Wu feel sick. Who knew Servants could puke? Kun Wu felt as if he was missing something, since he never heard tales of Servants throwing up their lunch.

And he would be correct. Servants don&#39;t puke. They rarely feel sick, even. Most of the issues that plague modern life do not affect them. Of course, this begged the question: Why was Ching Shih vomiting in the first place?

The sound of puking stopped as Ching grabbed a throwaway handkerchief from her spacious pockets, wiping away any traces of vile bile from her pristine face. A trail of puke remained in front of her, but she did her best to ignore it lest she throw another fit.

&quot;...Damn you, Throne of Heroes.&quot; She snarled, talking to herself upon realizing why she had puked. While most people glorified the pirate queen in their historical reports, they were unaware of her true origins. She had been cursed since birth to live at sea, being born on a junk boat of all things. Therefore, it was only normal for the Throne of Heroes to make the land her natural enemy.

She was also lucky, having been summoned in a future where humanity lived on wandering cities that hovered on the sea. This prevented her from getting landsick, but public transit focused on the underground, such as trains, was capable of reminding her of her curse and weakness. She made a mental note of that for the future.</span>

Now came the other problem: Should she tell this to Kun Wu? Despite stating that they were equals in their relationship, she had already been hiding several details from him. Sometimes out of necessity, other times because of embarrassment. How would her Master feel if they knew that she had such a ridiculous weakness? Not to mention, they probably didn&#39;t know of her true origins...

Nobody did. There was no <em>&#39;Shi Yang&#39;</em> in the history books. There was only <em>&#39;Ching Shih&#39;</em>. A wife of someone popular. Just remembering that made her blood boil.

She would erase it. All of it.

But for now, better act inconspicuous. Kun Wu didn&#39;t need to know this, so it was best to forget. She left the alley and encountered her Master, a grumpy look on their face as they squatted next to an open fire that smelled like...you guessed it. There was also no sign of his coat.

&quot;I-&quot; Ching opened her mouth, attempting to apologize, but she relented at the last second. Not only did Kun Wu looked pissed, but she wanted to avoid the topic altogether to prevent him from prying more about her condition. 

&quot;...I think we should start moving, milord. The Delphi bank should be a three minute walk away from the station, according to your mystical screens.&quot; She was still calling phones that? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Clothes doth make the man, it seemed. In the absence of his fluffy coat, Kun Wu looked about one - no, <em>two</em> sizes smaller, clad in dark, form-fitting robes that were originally meant to bring contrast to his flamboyant coat. But now the coat was gone. Without it, Kun Wu looked unassuming as ever with his dark hair and dark robes...deep within a dark alley. He could <em>almost</em> pass off as an assassin in his current getup!

Had Rider chosen to compliment him as such, it would surely break the poor boy&#39;s heart.

Of course, as a sensible woman and a social butterfly, Rider knew exactly when <em>not</em> to push buttons. Instead she tactfully swept all past issues under the rug, then carried on with their day&#39;s itinerary as if nothing had happened.

&#39;It&#39;s <em>your</em> mystical screen now...&#39; Kun Wu&#39;s voice sounded as hollow as he looked. He dared not face Rider, even when she finally mustered up the courage to break the ice. Right now, her voice alone reminded him of the unspoken atrocities he had been trying so hard to forget for the past few minutes. Quite the impossible feat.

<em>Curse you, functional brain.</em> Kun Wu wished he could be a smartphone right now and selectively delete his memories. He fanned the fire, making it grow bigger and hotter, then bigger and hotter still...he stared at it in a trance, until it finally consumed what remained of his defiled coat.

It was a bit shoddy for a cleansing ritual, but it would have to do.

Kun Wu got up mechanically, still shaken from the loss of his favorite item of clothing.

&#39;Three minutes. Three minutes...&#39; He repeated Rider&#39;s words a few more times like a mantra, as if doing so would help anchor himself in the cruel, coat-less reality. &#39;That&#39;s not far at all. Should we...pick up some doggie bags on the way?&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider hadn&#39;t known Kun Wu for long. It had been a few weeks at most, but even she felt a bit sorry for his current state. A Kun Wu without his coat was a shell of his former self, looking far less flamboyant and theatrical than he normally would. If anything, he looked like a normal person, one that would probably shank you in a dark alley, but she didn&#39;t need to mention that.

His reply correcting her about who the owner of the phone was made her feel even worse. Ching Shih, feeling guilty? That was a first, especially with a person that she had only met recently. Granted, Kun Wu did a good job at selling his displeasure by how empty he sounded. He completely lacked any humor or cheeriness in his voice.

&quot;I, I won&#39;t do it again.&quot; Rider attempted to defend herself from Kun Wu&#39;s question, which felt like a half-insult. However, upon carefully gauging her options and realizing that the return trip home would require the metro, she adjusted her response.

&quot;...Just buy a few, just to be safe.&quot; She said in a defeated tone. The two then stayed silent, focusing instead on the trek to the bank. For once, there was no small talk between them as they arrived at their destination in a matter of minutes.

The bank was spacious and resplendent, its surface being more reflective than even piles of coins or gold. Truly the epitome of wealth and one that almost triggered Ching&#39;s distant memories. She wondered if the bank held more money than her fleet&#39;s treasury.

However, they weren&#39;t here for cash. They were here simply for a favor. Apparently, Delphi was a society that functioned on favors and contracts, something Kun Wu had told her about during her stay at his apartment. A very innovative system, yet Ching couldn&#39;t believe that it worked in practice. She couldn&#39;t believe the fact that people could actually keep their word.

&quot;So, what now, milord?&quot; She looked at Kun Wu in anticipation, waiting for him to perform his duties. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">One does not simply cure their train sickness.

Likewise, train sickness wasn&#39;t exactly a disease that ascribed to only a select few. <em>Anyone</em> may catch it. Even Kun Wu. Even the buddha themselves, had they decided to hop on a wobbly train after having a big meal. As such, it was impossible for Kun Wu to truly pin the blame on Rider.

But that wasn&#39;t to say he wasn&#39;t miserable.

He felt naked without the coat. Naked. Ordinary. <em>Replaceable.</em> The worst possible feelings to have right before a new battle.

He hadn&#39;t even realized that they&#39;d made it to the bank. The past few minutes had gone by in a blur; he didn&#39;t even know how he managed to navigate the streets in his disheveled state. Muscle memory, perhaps? Or was it Rider with her mystical screen?

He glanced at her, and found her staring back at him expectantly. 

Kun Wu raised both hands and slapped himself in the cheeks.

What the hell was he doing, moping like a kid who&#39;d lost his favorite toy? His misery even seemed to infect Rider, whose confidence usually preceded her. They both looked like cats who&#39;d been left out in the rain for too long, even though they were in the presence of one of the most prestigious buildings in all of Delphi!

The youth slapped himself again. 

&#39;<strong>Sulking does not suit you!</strong>&#39; He yelled at the street, surprising Rider and a few passersby. Not that he cared, because he then took Rider by the shoulders and shook her. Right outside of the bank and in the vicinity of a few bored security guards.

&#39;What now?&#39; He repeated the question and shook Rider again. And again. &#39;What you and I need to do right now is <em>wake up</em>, before we get caught with our pants down! I need you to purge everything that has transpired in the past hour from your memory. <strong>Can you do that?</strong>&#39; He questioned - no, <em>ordered</em> her.

&#39;Oh and, I do need my mystical screen back.&#39;

Kun Wu&#39;s self-confidence took a hit after being kicked out of his shell. His coat was gone and his true self was revealed. He looked even more boyish and childish without an oversized outfit hiding his small stature.

Ching had noticed that, yet she hadn&#39;t said a word. It was not her duty to cheer up her Master, especially since she was the one who had caused this incident in the first place. If she tried to help, it would be like rubbing salt in the wound.

At least, that&#39;s what she thought, but perhaps support was what Kun Wu needed all along. He was mentally distant throughout the trek to the bank, not even bothering with any amount of small talk. Once they arrived, he just absentmindedly stared at the bank entrance. His demeanor was rubbing off on Ching, causing her to act more passive as she waited for her Master to make the first move. Guilt was a powerful deterrent, and Ching Shih definitely felt guilty.

But Kun Wu was strong. He may be short. He may be small. He may be foolish. But he never let negative thoughts cloud his head for more than a short period of time. He kept receiving an influx of self-conscious whips to his confidence, before forcibly snapping himself back to reality.

His screaming surprised Rider, causing a brief commotion that attracted stares and curious gazes, before people decided to get on with their lives. He then gripped Rider and started shaking her like a coconut, gathering her attention as she was caught off guard by his sudden change in demeanor.</span>

&quot;Forget everything?&quot; Ching repeated, surprised by his request. It wasn&#39;t a suggestion, it was an order. He wanted both of them to get out of this rut, since there was no point in sulking. He would rather have the confident tigress from before than a meek kitten who acted apologetic in front of him.

While she didn&#39;t like being manhandled, Rider smiled in response to her Master&#39;s request. For a child, he exuded an aura of confidence that was beyond that of the most hardened of pirates. He was pathetically weak, yet never let his own weakness bog him down. If Rider were a kinder person, she would have most likely praised him there.

&quot;...What are you talking about, milord?&quot; Ching replied with a smug grin. &quot;I have no idea what even happened in the last hour. Pray tell what you could possibly mean?&quot; She said cheekily, having heard his order loud and clear. The past incident would be their little secret.

But it wouldn&#39;t end there. Out of respect, Rider decided to further bolster the boy&#39;s confidence. &quot;The screen? Of course.&quot; Ching said, handing over the phone to the boy, before softly caressing his cheek.

&quot;Also, if it makes you feel any better, milord, I find you handsomer with your coat off. It hides far too much.&quot; She said with a smirk, stroking his lips before carefully releasing her grip. &quot;Now, how about you discuss business? I do not intend on loitering around banks all day. Unless you give me permission to rob a few, that is.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was like a switch had been flipped. Rider slid back into her old self effortlessly and gracefully, with a command of words and expressions that were eons ahead of what Kun Wu could achieve. She needn&#39;t rely on callous methods such as yelling at pedestrians to regain her stride; before Kun Wu knew it, the woman had once against assumed the role of a fleet captain, attacking Kun Wu at his weakest and enticing him with sweet words.

Kun Wu had known Rider long enough to realize exactly what she was playing at. But he decided to fall for it anyway. And why shouldn&#39;t he? Rider was looking out for him in her own way, and he wasn&#39;t one to overlook such kindness.

Even if said kindness resulted in his face burning up again.

&#39;How come you&#39;re so good at giving compliments? This doesn&#39;t make sense.&#39; He retorted with much difficulty, while Rider continued to pinch his cheeks. &#39;Every time <em>I</em> do it, all I get is a death glare coupled with a flick in the head. Are you allergic to your own compliments?&#39; He squinted or, as much as his facial muscles were allowed to move in Rider&#39;s hands. 

&#39;Now, if you&#39;re done handling my face like a stress ball.&#39; He accepted his phone and started pulling up menus. &#39;I put in a request with the bank earlier. Remember our little talk about Olympia&#39;s weather? Well, it turns out the bank can hook us up with someone who maybe knows someone who can help us hack it, all at the cost of a measly favor...&#39; 

&#39;...But they&#39;re not here yet.&#39; He squinted at the mosaic profile picture of their mystery informant. What was it even supposed to be? Modern art? He pressed on the message button to open up their chat log, then started spamming chat alerts that made phones vibrate even on silent mode.

<em>Bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt-</em>

&#39;This is kind of fun.&#39; He held the phone up to Rider. &#39;Wanna try?&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was fun to tease those with no experience, especially a boy as young as Kun Wu. However, he was knowledgeable in other ways, being armed with a silver tongue and sharp wit. Despite being embarrassed by his own Servant, he was quick to call her out on her hypocrisy.

Such a rebellious attitude only made Ching want to tease him more. Alas, that would have to wait.

&quot;Maybe if you listened to your own compliments in a mirror, you would understand.&quot; Ching replied with a warm smile, making sure to squeeze his cheeks extra hard for that remark before letting him go. They got back to business immediately, with Kun Wu briefing her on the purpose of their mission. He then started messing around with those advanced screens. They were called, telephones? Mobile phones? Something called apps too. Ching had knowledge of the modern world thanks to the chip in her frame, but some things were still a bit hazy in her mind.

But tapping buttons around awakened a primal instinct in her. Similar to how one would enjoy poking bubble wrap.

&quot;So generous, milord.&quot; She laughed, tapping at the phone repeatedly with her elongated nails. Kun Wu would feel the phone vibrate in his hands, switching from silent to vibrate to random notifications every few seconds. Plus, she was somehow opening and closing various folders and apps without realizing it. Some of the contents were fairly interesting.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; She pondered out loud. &quot;What&#39;s this, milord?&quot; She tapped at a folder on the screen with a suspicious looking title. It was simply titled <em>&#39;Outfits.&#39;</em> The name alone caused Kun Wu to stare back at Ching&#39;s bunny ears. Perhaps it was best for her to not sift through those files just yet... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

I do use a mirror for practice, believe it or not!&#39; Kun Wu massaged his face for the umpteenth time of the day, glad that Rider had taken the bait and started abusing his phone screen instead. He laughed when the phone started vibrating. 

&#39;You really should trim your nails, Rider,&#39; He peered over her arm, trying to see what settings she had enabled by accident. Instead he got an eyeful of random apps, some of which he had no recollection of downloading. Rider must&#39;ve done that without realizing it.

For a Servant who had only been force-fed the bare minimum knowledge of the present day, Rider was sure quick to learn her way around using a smartphone, even if her methods were as haphazard as they come. The phone started heating up, struggling to keep up as she tapped at the screen with her inhuman speed...

...Until she suddenly stopped, fingers hovering over a peculiar folder labeled &#39;Outfits&#39;. But before she could make up her mind, the youth stepped in and snatched the phone away. 

&#39;That&#39;s <em>quite</em> enough for now!&#39; He covered up his tracks with a forced laugh, sweating bullets. &#39;Don&#39;t want you to get addicted to the phone. It&#39;s a very serious issue, I&#39;ll have you know!&#39; He lectured Rider, while simultaneously locking the folder behind a password he made up on the spot. &#39;I&#39;ll let you have another look when you&#39;re ready-&#39;

<em>Bzzzt-</em>

The phone vibrated one more time, accompanied by a curt message from their anonymous informant. Kun Wu squinted at their pixelated profile picture.

&#39;They exist,&#39; He said, glad to have an excuse to escape Rider&#39;s inquiries. Not the most articulate individual in existence, but &#39;shady&#39; about sums up most people in this line of work. That was how you could tell they were the real deal. Or at least, that was how most informants had chosen to market themselves.

A crime that Kun Wu, self-proclaimed Fengshui master and local celebrity, had been subject to for a whole <em>ten</em> minutes.

By the third minute, he had already finished replying to his DelphiTube™️ comments. By the fifth, he had cleaned his Amazones™️ shopping cart. Then he set about organizing his photos, messages, and all the random apps Rider had downloaded onto his phone. When the seventh minute rolled by, he had already finished everything that was there to do on his phone, and thus had to the spend the next 180 seconds doing nothing but waiting like a normal, bored human being...

Only to receive a dismissive reply along with a photo of a ramen cup at the end of that slow torture.

The young Master was not pleased.

He pulled a wallet out of his waist sash and pressed it into Rider&#39;s hands.

&#39;Go fetch some doggie bags from a convenience store while I have a nice chat with the bank. It&#39;s time to make another excursion,&#39; He stashed his phone, then headed up the stair leading to the bank with a scowl on his face. &#39;I think this informant of ours is a little bit shy.&#39;
