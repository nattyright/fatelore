This structure sees only one visitor due to the long and winding path to travel on. Jampo makes it his mission to travel to this temple each day after his work to pray and cleanse his soul, and to bite back the rising tide of Ashura that the work day brings out. Due to the secluded nature, Jampo has decided that this might serve as the best possible candidate for a Master&#39;s Workshop, and has decided to remain here for the rest of the coming War between Delphi and Olympia.</div>

A few days had passed since Saber had been summoned. To the untrained eye, it looked as if the temple hadn&#39;t changed at all since then, but subtle differences were beginning to stand out. Paintings and stained glass windows of European origin. Patches of stonework scattered across the grounds. Strange rooms and corridors that appeared where none were before. The most telling change of all however, were the Copper Knights.

The cold automata stalked the grounds of the temple with silent robotic motions on the orders of their master. Ever since Saber had been summoned, more of the Copper Knights had crawled their way out of that well. Now their numbers were twenty strong but the well had stopped producing them, for now at least. That cursed Well of Blackness lay stewing deep withing the inner sanctums of the temple. There, Saber weaved the strange magicks from its depths to fortify and construct his fortress. But progress was much slower than Jampo might&#39;ve initially thought. A week had passed and much magical energy had been expended, but there were only the foundations of Saber&#39;s great project in place. Those foundations however, were quite great indeed.

Jampo meanwhile, has found a rare moment of solitude. When not with his Master, Saber had one of his Copper Knight accompany Jampo. &quot;Protection&quot; he called it. The silent guardian would shadow Jampo, its strange inhuman nature always a little unsettling. Today however, neither Saber nor Copper Knights were to be found nearby. Perhaps Saber had some matter to attend to and didn&#39;t think that Jampo needed to be looked after. Regardless, for the first time this week, Jampo was by himself. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

A breath in to condense thought. 
A breath out to purify. 

The small stream and waterfall by the temple always fascinated Jampo; in a city so devoid of any true passion toward faith, this temple had an actual facsimile of nature running next to it. A soft tumult of water crashing into a rock bed, a fine spray sprinkling against his bare knees, followed by a sluggish babble as water rolls past. 

The morning air lays a thin veil of condensed vapor across the surface of the stream, coiling against Jampo&#39;s toes as the monk sits beside it on the river bank, meditating. It was the first morning since he first summoned Brandin that he was alone, and the fact hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed. He decided this would be the perfect time to properly meditate, to truly be alone with his thoughts as he mulled over the expanding borders of Dolorous Gard. 

The temple was changing. Very slightly, to the outside looking in, but Jampo tool great notice of the castle&#39;s slow invasion of the Holy place. Was invasion the right word if it was his servant? Was &quot;holy&quot; the right word if it was Olympia which hosted it? Regardless, he found it brought more solace to rest away from the construction. 

But this solace must end.</span>

Jampo&#39;s eyes flutter open. The morning light, orange and dim, bleeds through the thin shoots of the forest around the temple. Slivers of light paint his body, patches of warmth streak across his chest. He feels truly alone...and after having a Servant for a few days, he found it difficult to stay that way. 

-- 

The path to the temple was indicative of its slow transformation; patches of cobblestone had sprout from the loose dirt of the Temple grounds, providing the ample opportunity for Jampo to lightly hop from one to the other. The old man found that humbling oneself was the key to suppressing the ego. Truly nothing was more humbling than finding a game in the simple act of walking. 

&quot;Hmm? Not even on guard?&quot; The absence of the Copper Knights was indeed a strange sight. Jampo found the familiar sight of this old temple alien now without the symbol of his Servant&#39;s presence roaming the perimeter, almost missing the lifeless gaze they use to follow his movements to and from the stream. In fact, Brandin himself felt absent in particular... 

&quot;...&quot; His eyes trail along the outer rim of the Temple, noting the European spires and battlements forming from the once worn woodwork, sighing heavily as he makes his way inside, towards the center of the enterprise. The void by which he and his Servant were inexplicably drawn, though for different reasons. <strong>The Well.</strong></span>

His chest tightens as he wanders through he increasingly unfamiliar corridors, keeping his gaze focused and away from the foreign paintings and patchwork of light that bleeds through stained glass. The air feels stale here, his breath feeling more labored as he approaches the screen door erected to separate the Well from the rest of the temple. His hand rests against it, curling slightly as he debates whether to face what was inside. Even now, he can feel his strength waning. His hand trembles, sliding down the length of the one thing separating him from the encompassing blackness that extends in on the other side. The tunnel of inconceivable darkness, yawning on the other end, waiting to devour...everything... 

&quot;Saber. Are you in there? I wish to speak to you.&quot;</span>

In the darkened chamber in which that bottomless well lies, there was no sign of Saber and his minions. Just the ominous well and the strange streams of magics that flowed from it. Wherever they were, they weren&#39;t in this part of the temple.

<em><strong>Clang. Clang. Clang.</strong></em>

The sound of shifting armor emanated from a corner of the room. It wasn&#39;t Saber and at first Jampo thought it to be one of the Copper Knights. But he quickly realized the horrible truth. An enormous figure slowly emerges from the darkness. Clad in twisted black armor with a helmet adorned with two great horns and two burning red eyes. In it&#39;s hands it wields a massive greataxe, but most strange of all was the metallic key hanging from it&#39;s neck.

The creature appeared similar in nature to the Copper Knights but stood head and shoulders above them. The most terrifying thing however was the sheer might the being radiated. Instantly, Jampo could tell that this being was several magnitudes stronger than the Copper Knights and it was even stronger than Saber himself. The power was great enough to get Jampo to second guess if his own demon could stand up to this one.

The Black Knight spews out a small burst of fire like a facsimile of breath as it stomps towards Jampo. Stopping several feet before him, the creature stares at Jampo intensely with it&#39;s soulless burning eyes. Like a predator sizing up prey. The light from the outside catching the wicked edge of the creature&#39;s greataxe. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

Jampo&#39;s chest catches as he watches the figure emerge, his mind swirling as his hand clutches at his chest. The silence in the room increases, magnitudes at a time with every step the creature takes towards him, the surrounding darkness suspending both in a pit that leaves only its red eyes piercing through. Jampo steps back, finally breathing but in ragged whispers, watching the thing size him. 

In the midst of that darkness, he can hear a whisper. Not from the creature, The Well, or even Brandin...from within... 

<em>Let me out.</em> 

&quot;No...&quot; 

The monk falls on his back, the size of the creature now towering and absorbing the space as it peers down. Jampo&#39;s body shakes, from manic fear and from exertion as he bottles something back down.

It pierces his body and seeps into his very core. There it strikes at the rising Qi within him and drives it back down. Leaving Jampo drained, but centered once more.

The hand then gives a friendly pat on Jampo&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;There you are Master.&quot; The familiar voice of Saber spoke out in a friendly tone. He pulls Jampo to his feet with a friendly smile on his face. The Black Knight then turns away from the two and begins to patrol the room, in an almost protective manner toward the well itself. But it does not pay much attention towards Saber and Jampo.

&quot;I&#39;d just finished some drills with my Knights and was looking for you.&quot; Brandin continued. &quot;I see that you&#39;ve met the Black Knight, but pay him no mind. He will not harm you as long as you do not endanger the Well. There are some things we need to discuss with regards to tactics. I know that you said that you are not one for those types of things but there are some important matters to keep in mind, especially for these opening moments of the war.&quot;

Saber then turns Jampo away from the Well and motions with his hand back toward the halls of the temple. As if to lead him away from the inner sanctum containing that endless Well and the monster that patrolled it. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

The monolithic knight turns from both, patrolling the room robotically, surrounding the Well that belched forth black void.

His mind is still distracted when Brandin brings up their tactics, the monk nodding absently, half-listening as he follows his Servant  

&quot;Tactics, right...what did you have in mind, Saber? Speak and I&#39;ll listen.&quot; The monk&#39;s hushed tone indicates he was still thinking back to that room, and how it nearly brought out the worst.</span>

There he sits down with Jampo at one of the tables and snaps his fingers. One of the Copper Knight then comes and places cups before the two and pours them some tea. Saber then thoughtfully sips the tea before speaking.

“Now Master, while I am now fully staffed and construction is proceeding well. It’ll take much more time before we are fully ready. Therefore, it is imperative that we avoid conflict in these early stages.

I have taken measures to hide our presence but I have no doubt that keener eyes have detected me unleashing my Noble Phantasm. So there is a possibility that we may be investigated by other Master-Servant pairs. In that case, I will be relying on you, Master.

No one should notice at first glance that anything is out of the ordinary but it’ll be up to you to maintain the illusion. That this place is nothing more than a normal temple of worship. However, under no circumstances should anyone be let into the inner sanctum. 

If they are not fooled, but seem to be a reasonable sort, you have my permission to negotiate an alliance. Having an ally would be greatly beneficial for us. I will not be able to physically assist you in either of these tasks however, due to… the nature of my magecraft.

Should they be hostile… our battle plan will depend on our enemy. If they are of the Calvary classes, between my Knights and the advantage of our home territory, we should be able to drive them off.

If they are of the Knight or Berserker classes however… the fight will be much more difficult. We may be forced to rely on the Black Knight. Unfortunately, he is less of a loyal minion and more of an ‘automated defense system’. We would have to lure the enemy right to the heart of Dolorous Gard.

Do you have any questions Master?”</span>

Jampo sips from his own cup, using the herbal fragrance to settle the last of his nerves from his encounter with the Black Knight. An interesting flavor...he had never known flavor quite like it. It was almost intoxicating... 

&quot;Hmm, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t lie, Saber.&quot; The monk says simply, enjoying the aroma wafting through his sinuses before rejoining Saber in reality. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t do well for a monk to be a fibber, hehe. Though, I do like the idea of creating an alliance, although I have to wonder if we&#39;ll be the ally sorts. I find it&#39;s human nature not to ally WITH the indomitable wall, but work together to break through it. Rest assured, I will do my best to establish a peace, but should matters need to be taken, you may count on me. Have faith in your Master; for I think you may be surprised just how much fighting this monk knows how to do, heheheheh.&quot; 

Jampo stares out into the courtyard, noting the Copper Knights on guard around the slowly morphing cobblestone space. It was humorous seeing such empty shells imitating nobility, while also surrounded by the still standing Eastern structures. A fish out of water out of the ocean... 

&quot;How useful are these Copper Knights, Saber? I&#39;ve seen them deliver tea...fine tea, if I might add...but I&#39;ve yet to see their capabilities. Can I trust your automatons?&quot;</span>

“In terms of strength… I would quantify them as equal to a D-rank servant. In a one on one battle, they would be on equal footing with a skilled human but easily dispatched by a capable Servant. However, they compensate this with their numbers. Part of the reason why I suggest we hide our true nature for the moment.”

Saber’s face turns a little grim.

“Should a powerful, combat focused servant discover us this early in the war, we risk being the first ones eliminated from this war. I recall an old saying from an Eastern general, ‘All warfare is based on deceit’.” <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

Sure enough, the sentry went to fetch the kettle, the monk smiling softly as he turns back to his servant. 

&quot;Ah, Sun Tzu. You should also know, Saber, that the rest of that quote delves into how to treat your enemy. I was not raised on war; I was raised, instead, on knowing the enemy and learning how to avoid confrontation. Especially against those that underestimate me.&quot; 

As if to demonstrate this, Jampo brings his hands together before once extending his Qi, encompassing both he and Brandin, but also the Knight as it approaches. As if possessed, the Knight seems to lift slightly and float to the table before the kettle does the same, lighting itself on the table between them as Jampo catches it, smiling even wider. 

&quot;Hihihihihi, I can see myself having fun with these. Never forget, Saber; as it stands now, I am your best protection. Have faith in me, just as I have faith in you. The truth often makes us seem far or near to our enemies, after all.&quot; <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span></span>

Sometimes, building a wall together brings people much closer. Ah, it reminds me...&quot; Jampo rummages through his robes before...pulling out a cellphone, an odd sight considering the man&#39;s more rustic and ancient attire. Of course, it was akin to a brick, so perhaps it isn&#39;t too far off...

&quot;...here we are. It is a poem, Saber. One I think, perhaps, you could learn a bit from. Sun Tzu is a valuable resource for war, but none is as valuable for alliances as Robert Frost. It is called <em>Mending Wall.</em> Perhaps you could learn something from it.&quot; 

Without giving Saber room to respond, Jampo rises from the table and walks to the courtyard, casting one more glance at the inching darkness down the corridor that leads to The Well before tearing himself away. &quot;I must meditate, Saber. Dolorous Gard continues to take so much from me. Think about what I&#39;ve said, though. &#39;Something is there that doesn&#39;t love a wall&#39; and &#39;Good fences make good neighbors.&#39; Think about both...consider it one of the only times I&#39;ll act as a teacher with you, hehehehe.&quot; <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span></span>
