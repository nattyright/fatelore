                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Air conditioning was mankind&#39;s most powerful invention, and Laurent was about to leave its embrace.

It was all over DelphiTube™️ and Olympimeo™️. Laurent MacKenzie, CEO of MacKenzie Industries, was a Master representing Olympia. The comments had been flooding in on citywide net.

<em>&quot;Are you kidding me? THAT&#39;s the guy representing Olympia?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Why didn&#39;t he help fight against that big castle guy if he was a Master?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Apparently his Servant is super weak LMAOOOOOO&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;But he IS kinda ho-&quot;</em>

Laurent turned off his phone as he stepped out of the lobby of his Delphi office building, a disgruntled look on his face. His Servant, Caster, had been with him long enough to recognize that thinly veiled annoyance:

<strong>PR troubles.</strong>

&quot;I knew this wouldn&#39;t last forever.&quot; Laurent said as he straightened his tie. &quot;I had hoped to capitalize on it until the War had ended, however. My PR team is working overtime to explain my sudden appearance of a new Servant. Hopefully nobody recognizes you.&quot;

Lancer had, in a way, saved him. Killing Lark would&#39;ve snapped whatever allegiance the people of Olympia had for him. The only goodwill he had retained was his saving of employees, as well as being one of Olympia&#39;s finalists. 

Laurent flexed his hand, testing his strength. As a Master, and one of the wealthiest men in Olympia, Laurent&#39;s health insurance was impeccable. It was far easier to heal a wounded body then it was to repair a body fried by Magic Circuits, after all. All it had taken were a few Noble Phantasms, and Laurent was good to go. Caster was healed as well. A few mana batteries and he had been ready for action.

&quot;Our goal should be the elimination of all remaining Delphian Masters.&quot; Laurent said as his phone continued to vibrate with notifications. He finally snorted and turned the thing off. &quot;The worst case scenario is a Delphian Master winning, and running off with my demolition and salvage contracts.&quot; Laurent stopped.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Laurent pestered Nietzsche with questions, he would notice the Philosophers unusually slow reaction. Normally Caster would be quick to speak his mind, however, today was different. He had spent his time starring at the street, watching vehicles pass by; his thoughts pulled at him more than usual. The war was shaping up quite nicely and in Nietzsche&#39;s favor as well. Now that his presence was public knowledge he didn&#39;t have to worry about coming in contact with other servants. He should have been happy about this, and he would have been delighted had it been just a few weeks prior. 

The Philosopher took a deep breath the bristles of his mustache waving about. He turned his head towards Laurent raising and eyebrow, now realizing that he had been asked a question. &quot;Oh forgive me Laurent, I was in a world of my own.&quot; 

&quot;I do not know much, but before joining you I did encounter one team from Delphi. The Master&#39;s name was Kun Wu. I spoke directly with him and his servant to try and negotiate an alliance but our negotiations broke down.&quot; 

Nietzsche remembered his encounter with Kun Wu rather well. The Delphi group had made a strong impression on Caster, especially Kun Wu himself. &quot;That boy is a free spirit master. If we are to ever encounter him it would be in our best interest to rid of him. Arrogance is a formidable weapon, in my short time with Kun Wu I saw such a trait in him.&quot; 

Caster had spent his whole life trying to break the world of it&#39;s painful morals. There are people who naturally stray from those very ideas. Laurent, Kun Wu, and Caster himself are just a few. In the mind of Caster it is those people who make way for change in the world.

&quot;I&#39;m aware of who they are.&quot; Laurent said, thinking back to the time he almost drowned near Olympia&#39;s shoreline. It was not a pleasant experience, nor was it one that he was interested in experiencing again. &quot;The brat is fine. It&#39;s his Servant that infuriates me. It&#39;s like looking into a funhouse mirror, and seeing what <em>could have been</em>.&quot; Laurent sighed, gaze softening for a moment. Quickly after, it sharpened.

&quot;Go back to your mental zone. I didn&#39;t mean to drag you out of it. I&#39;m thinking about what to do, once this war is over.&quot; Laurent said, slowing his pace so that Caster, in his internal thoughts, could keep up.

What would he do once this War was over? Liquidate the Aristocracy and their assets? Take over their companies? Oversee the salvage of Persepolis? He had too many wishes, and only one could be granted. Perhaps he could request a seat on Delphi&#39;s governing table, and continue his plans for the expansion of his business.

Maybe it was time to finally bring his daughter home.

&quot;Caster. Let&#39;s take a break for the rest of the day. I know an excellent hole in the wall in Olympia that you must experience. We won&#39;t reach our respective goals if we run ourselves into the ground. In the meantime, I&#39;ll have my men search for Kun Wu and Rider.&quot;

It was subtle, but Laurent had begun treating Caster with more and more respect after the fight with Lancer. Caster was climbing the corporate ladder very quickly, from being treated as an employee to a business associate to something more... casual.

He hadn&#39;t expected his Master to make a friendly gesture towards him, nor for that gesture to involve a break. In their couple of weeks together Nietzsche had never seen a version of Laurent who wasn&#39;t working, and since the war had started Nietzsche had not taken a moment to rest his thoughts. 

&quot;Yes Laurent, I think a break is well earned at this point.&quot; The Philosopher let out a deep breath, he didn&#39;t need to catch up to his thoughts he needed to let them go. Things had begun to change and rather fast. Within a month he had moved from one home to another, fought a veteran of a world war, and helped slay a King. Ontop of this Nietzsche had other combatants to worry about all while trying to complete his wish. The world was just as harsh as Nietzsche remembered.

The ride to the CBD was fairly short. But after taking into account Rider’s unique condition and the relative proximity of the district, Kun Wu decided to forego the convenience of public transport and opt for something a bit less conventional.

A glowing white tiger ran across the rooftops of Delphi’s skyscrapers, leaping from building to building with power and grace. On the beast’s back sat Kun Wu and Rider, with the latter keeping an eye on the city streets down below while the former controlled the beast with his iron fan.

‘<em>We’re almost at the CBD,</em>’ Kun Wu told Rider through their telepathic link, his ears full of wind. ‘<em>Mackenzie’s new office is right ahead. There!</em>’ He gestured towards a rather plain-looking building among other much more gaudy giants, looking as if it was still trying to decide whether it wanted to stay or not.

‘<em>I didn’t even know he had enough money to purchase a building in the CBD. They charge exorbitant prices for even a single bathroom tile!</em>’ He said jokingly, then shifted to a more serious tone. ‘<em>I’m going to park a few buildings away. See if you can spot him through a window, or anywhere else. If not, I’ll switch buildings and try again. With any luck, we can catch him signing papers from an office window or on the way to one of the subway stations.</em>’

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Very well, F... Friedrich.&quot; Laurent said, tasting the name and letting it roll across his tongue as he checked his watch. It was difficult placing a name upon a Servant.

Saber, Archer, Lancer, Assassin, Caster, Berserker. Laurent referred to Servants by their class, even as a Master, because they were not human in his eyes. Shadows, fueled by Magecraft. They were not worthy of being individually recognized by the businessman.

That, however, had changed.

Laurent didn&#39;t know what happened during the fight with Lark and Uther. It had been something terrible. Terrible enough to instill a lingering sense of dread on the businessman. He had a feeling, however. Now was as good a time as ever to ask his Servant.

&quot;Friedrich.&quot; Laurent stopped before turning to his Servant. &quot;What happened to me back at MacKenzie Tower? I feel...&quot; <em>Aware? Paranoid? Absolutely insane?</em> &quot;...something important happened.&quot;

Unfortunately, standing in the middle of the CBD speaking to his Servant made Laurent a very obvious target for Kun Wu and his fan-propelled tiger. Instead of signing contracts, yelling at subordinates, or reading documents, he was just standing there in the middle of the road.

Menacingly...

Ching had ruled the seas, but had she ever experienced the skies? Soaring through the air and bouncing from rooftop to rooftop was an exhilarating experience, especially when she had the privilege of hugging her Master from behind while doing so.

<em>&quot;Hmm. Are you jealous?&quot;</em> Ching prodded in Kun Wu&#39;s mind, replying to his joke with her own. <em>&quot;We could always buy our own building once this war is over. Didn&#39;t you say you wanted to expand once?&quot;</em> She teased before realizing that they were getting closer to their target. Her jovial tone was quickly replaced.

<em>&quot;...Someone is standing in the middle of the road. Doing nothing. Nothing at all. Their suit looks familiar.&quot;</em> Ching clued Kun Wu in. Were he to turn as well, he would notice a sharply dressed man standing outside of a building, about to cross the road and reach the sidewalk. Their outfit was iconic. Iconic enough for Kun Wu to remember them.

There was no doubt of it: They had found their man. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

He had never utilized Eternal Return before his battle with Uther so he was unaware of any possibile side effects. However, it seemed that Laurent&#39;s soul had still carried the burden of death. 

&quot;Very well Laurent... I will enlighten you on what happened that day.&quot; Nietzsche took in a deep breath, using the time to gather his thoughts. How do you tell someone that they had died without shocking them? Perhaps being brutally honest was the play. Nietzsche was often one to dance around answers with unnecessary verbage. This time he saw no advantage in breaking the truth lightly. 

&quot;In our last battle I had attempted to break Uthers will. In doing so I only strengthened his resolve. Using his new found strength Lancer used his Noble Phantasm to kill you and I used my own ability to turn time backwards. I brought you back to life and with the knowledge of the future I let you know how to survive the encounter.&quot;

Laurent stumbled for a second, before composing himself. His palms felt sweaty. His breathing, labored. It was like a shadow had spun his insides around like they were the contents of a bowl. Nausea. Discomfort.

Fear.

As his vision faded in and out, Laurent&#39;s hands became pale and clammy. Friedrich&#39;s proclamation had hit him like a brick. He, Laurent MacKenzie, had died fighting Uther. He had died, presumably pierced by his spear.

What had his last thoughts been? Those of disappointment? Apathy? No. It couldn&#39;t have been. If it was, why would he be so nervous now? What had it been like when he died? What had happened after? Laurent did not want to know.

Ever since he inherited MacKenzie Industries and began his power struggle with the rest of Olympia, Laurent had skirted over the concept of death like one would dodge a puddle on the side of the road. You were aware of it, you acknowledged it, but it didn&#39;t affect you.

If he had died, nothing would matter. His goals: nothing. The consequences of his actions: nothing. His daughter: nothing. He had always been somewhat carefree with his life, with that in mind. It was why he had entered the City Grail War, aside from the massive profits.

With knowledge of what happened after, it changed Laurent&#39;s perspective considerably. 

&quot;I see.&quot; Laurent said simply. &quot;Well, I am lucky you are capable of doing it multiple times.&quot; Laurent said hopefully, unaware of Eternal Return&#39;s restriction. Still, the flurry of emotions, feelings, and possible outcomes of this new knowledge left Laurent adrift, aimless. He was not as sharp as he normally was.

If there was a time for Rider and Kun Wu to strike, it was now.

Despite the late hour, dazzling electric lights and illuminated advertising still shone brightly against the nighttime sky, fostering an illusion that the city never slept. Under the city lights, two men stood out in the middle of an empty street, dressed in dark colored suits that reflected not a speck of the light pollution around them. Of course, that was only from Rider&#39;s point of view. To Kun Wu and his normal, 20/20 vision, two pea-sized dots were as much as his eyes could discern. 

&#39;I trust your eyes.&#39; He said over the wind with a slightly raised voice, testing his vocal cords after a period of silence. &#39;If you believe that&#39;s him, then the one next to him must be his new Servant.&#39; 

He slowed his tiger, parking it at the edge of a building that was nearly right above the two men. He slid off the tiger and held out his arms to Rider; if she let him, he would hold her as she dismounted. 

&#39;Let&#39;s go say hi.&#39; he barely suppressed his excitement at the prospect of getting the drop on someone. &#39;We&#39;re talking about someone who managed to outlast all the other Olympian Masters! I think he deserves to be spooked a liiiiittle more than our usual guests.&#39;

In other words...

&#39;Get the drop on them.&#39; He phrased it quite literally. &#39;The CBD is a ghost town at night. Use your biggest cannons.&#39;

Understood?&quot; She said so in jest, but part of Kun Wu believed her words to be true.

Ching waited for her Master to land the tiger at a safe place, before he dismounted and held Rider around her waist as she followed suit.

&quot;You&#39;re shaking.&quot; She said. &quot;But I can&#39;t blame you: It feels refreshing to make the first move for once. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot;

As she oversaw Laurent and Nietzsche from afar, she vividly remembered how abrupt the attack on the Brobdingnagian was. There was no better time to pay him back than now.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, milord. I never intended to take my time with this fellow. Not only did they try to maim you in our last encounter, but also,&quot; She placed a palm over her face as she yawned. &quot;it&#39;s rather late, isn&#39;t it? And I&#39;d much rather spend a night with you than with someone else.&quot; She said so brazenly that even Kun Wu would feel embarrassed. 

&quot;A warning, however. Please make sure your mana reserves are sufficient.&quot; She raised her arm and looked at the sky, as if expecting something to appear.

Kun Wu blinked.

<strong>CRASH</strong>

A deafening noise crumpled his ears, followed by his body feeling fatigued and empty. A severe, yet familiar drain of mana. He opened his eyes and witnessed a gigantic ship falling from the sky...right on top of the two men in the CBD.

Shangri-La was like a falling star, threatening to crush the two with its sheer mass alone.

&quot;Cannons are wasteful for insects such as these, so I went ahead and squashed them instead.&quot; Ching exclaimed in delight, patiently waiting for her ship to land and crush her targets to death. &quot;This shouldn&#39;t be any problem.

Frankly, that was not the surprising part. The weather didn&#39;t agree with him, and despite his constant grumbling about Olympia&#39;s smog, he found himself more comfortable in its embrace when compared to Delphi. Or, more accurately, his air conditioned penthouse.

This was different. This was an actual chill of the weather, a lack of heat. Wind? No, the air was still. Which meant it was overcast. However, it was late. Why would it be...? Laurent looked up, before blinking once as his lips tightened.

Huh. That <strong>would</strong> explain it. 

A mix of a groan of exasperation and a scream of terror crawled its way out Laurent&#39;s throat. Despite that, he remained as composed as ever as he grabbed his Servant by the wrist. &quot;Friedrich, you <strong>dunce</strong>! They&#39;re right on top of us! Come on!&quot;

Laurent and Nietzsche were flung upwards at an angle, avoiding Rider&#39;s Shangri-La by the tip of Nietzsche&#39;s mustache. 

The ship crashed into the CBD with a resounding <em><strong>CRASH!!!</strong></em> that rattled in every party&#39;s bones. Laurent, who was lashed to the wall of a nearby building, stumbled to the ground with the vibrations.

The building the two were standing on began to crack, before tipping over. Laurent and his Caster flew through the air, before landing atop a sturdier building. Laurent huffed, before scanning the rooftops.

&quot;I&#39;m getting sick of boats.&quot; Laurent said, checking all the buildings, before getting a sudden feeling of vertigo.

That sense of dread was back, and this time, it had a friend. Kun Wu and Rider. Wonderful. &quot;Speak of the devil, and they shall appear.&quot; Laurent sneered as he looked over at the building he and Friedrich had leapt from. The cracked plaster and concrete began to rattle.

&quot;I&#39;m going to need you to refrain from your psychoanalytical urges. Kill them by any mean&#39;s necessary.&quot; Laurent said as his Crest glowed brightly as he flung the ruined building towards Ching and Kun Wu. Massive chunks of rubble filled the sky as they rushed forward.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Oh you are mistaken I cannot d-&quot; Nietzsche was just about to deliver some disappointing news to Laurent, however Kun Wu and Ching Shih had different plans. The Philosopher let out a small yell of surprise as Laurent pulled them away from the boat. Nietzsche shook his head trying to focus in on his surroundings. It appeared Caster&#39;s Master was right. Speak of the devil and they will appear. 

Caster pulled at his mustache a deep breath leaving his lips. No psychoanalysis... That meant no talking... And that meant no philosophy... Nietzsche gritted his teeth at this thought. In front of him stood the first Servant he wanted to speak too and here he was presented the chance. Nietzsche had never handled Eastern philosophy first hand and wanted to converse with Ching. However, Caster wouldn&#39;t ignore his master&#39;s orders. 

Left of Nietzsche and behind Laurent a familiar taking the form of Greek archer Philoctetes would appear. Caster almost panicked at the thought of not using his mental trickery. However, perhaps Laurent had a point. If Nietzsche reserved his Noble Phantasms for later in the fight, he might be able to catch an opponent of guard. 

Nietzsche looked straight ahead with a fighting spirit. The archer besides him would draw his bow firing off multiple shots towards Kun Wu and Ching.

Of course a cockroach like Laurent wouldn&#39;t keel over so easily, especially considering the punishment he endured during their first encounter. If she truly wanted to be rid of him, she needed to treat him like a mortal enemy.

&quot;Milord, I know that I may sound quite greedy right now,&quot; She turned to her Master, giving them one last warning. &quot;but my next attack will be even more taxing on your circuits. Tell me whenever you feel tired: I will retreat you to safety immediately.&quot;

It was hard, to willingly drain Kun Wu of mana while still guaranteeing his safety. Considering the stunts the boy pulled off against Saber, she was worried he would overload himself with mana if he kept relying on batteries. Which is why she hoped she could end the fight quickly.

The volley of arrows in the distance did nothing to faze her. She had already planned her next attack.

&quot;Shangri-La. Open fire.&quot; Rider didn&#39;t waste a second, as the ship anchored to CBD floors was at the perfect position to take aim at Nietzsche and his archer. Hundreds of cannon shells were immediately fired at Caster and Laurent&#39;s general direction, devouring the arrows like stars in the sky. Nietzsche couldn&#39;t even tell the projectiles apart as he was assaulted by a mixture of cannonballs, missiles and modern artillery.

The building they had used as refuge was already crumbling, being destroyed by Shangri-La&#39;s concentrated fire as they felt the structure collapse. A pair of missiles exploded in front of Laurent&#39;s floating rubble, eliminating any further line of defense as Caster witnessed a cannonball almost land on him. It grazed his arm instead, causing him to feel immaculate pain as he realized that this was truly a fight to the death. His opponent was pulling no punches.

If Laurent and Nietzsche stayed at the same place any longer, they would no doubt become swiss cheese.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">They were hopelessly outmatched. This much was certain. In a competition of physical might, Laurent and Nietzsche would lose every time. This had been true for Simo, Uther, and now Kun Wu&#39;s Rider. They had only won through trickery and a disregard for common decency for morality.

It was the same, once again. Except this time, the foe was just as immoral as Laurent.

Laurent looked between his Servant and the opposing team, gears obviously spinning. Should they retreat? This was a terrible situation to be in. Death was likely, but if Laurent fled...

No. He nor Friedrich would be pushed out of their future territory. Besides, he had Eternal Return on his side. He was effectively indestructible.

&quot;Friedrich!&quot; Laurent bellowed as concrete cracked and metal groaned. Whatever he was going to say after that was drowned out by Ching&#39;s incoming fire. Rubble made for an excellent barrier, and there was always more of it.

Rubble fell towards Laurent&#39;s feet as he leapt from the building, forming a makeshift platform when stone met shoe. He moved quickly towards Ching and Kun Wu, closing the gap by lashing himself forward. Laurent left just enough room for his Servant to follow, although the rubble trail was already collapsing once Laurent stepped away from it.

Any cannonballs that flew Laurent&#39;s way seemed to slightly curve off course, as if being caught in the businessman&#39;s gravitational pull. 
Laurent tapped the bullets in his revolver. Ching and Kun Wu recognized that dull glint from the Brobdingnagian. Wasn&#39;t he the owner of a munitions empire? Using the same gun every time felt like a waste.</span>

The first left a very unfashionable groove in the storyteller&#39;s hair, while the other missed by a large margin. That was, before the two bullets looped back around, aiming to bury themselves in the back of Kun Wu&#39;s head.

An admittedly old technique, but a reliable one. Such a manuever put Laurent several meters ahead of Kun Wu. Risky, but also allowed Laurent to line up a point blank shot on the Master.

Laurent pulled the trigger.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu felt the familiar drain on his mana as soon as Rider raised her arm. Shangri-La dropped liked an anchor and crashed into the two men below...but of course things didn&#39;t end there. This was a CGW. <em>Any</em> Master who made it this far must have a few tricks up their sleeve.

Laurent was no different. Zipping away as if pulled by a string, he and his companion narrowly dodged the ship&#39;s hull before retaliating with steel and concrete. Taking the fight to the sky, where Rider and her Master looked down upon them like a queen and their midget king. 

Well. <em>One</em> of them did.

As rubble and missiles traded blows in the sky, Kun Wu tore his gaze away from Laurent and stared Rider in the eye. Without breaking eye contact, he produced a small blister pack with some skillful sleight of hand, seemingly out of nowhere. 

&#39;It&#39;s okay to be greedy.&#39; He told Rider, lips curving into a smile. A small crinkle sounded as he popped open the aluminum foil. &#39;But let&#39;s not be too hasty. The CEO of Mackenzie Industries has shown again and again that he has quite a knack for slipping out of trouble. It&#39;s difficult to checkmate him in one move.&#39; 

He pinched the pill between two fingers, holding them up.

&#39;You know this is the sensible option.&#39; He insisted. 

At the edge of the building, Laurent emerged with his trusty gun before promptly firing a few shots in Kun Wu&#39;s direction. But Kun Wu hadn&#39;t so much as flinched. He was holding himself as hostage: would Rider rather stop him from taking the pills, or defend him against Laurent&#39;s homing bullets?

He wasn&#39;t leaving her with a choice.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster seemed to be no match for Rider&#39;s assault, which resulted in Laurent taking desperate measures and purposefully advancing towards the raging storm of cannon fire and debris. He was doing a good job at keeping stray projectiles away with his gravitational force, but how long could he keep that up? All it took was for Rider to pay even the slightest attention to him and he would be toast.

That timespan was relatively short.

While Ching was doing her best to protect her Master, one could say that Kun Wu was taking her assistance for granted. Being madly in love with Rider had caused him to come up with the riskiest of plans as he brazenly showed off the mana pill between his fingers. The implication was clear.

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot; Ching exclaimed, feeling ready to slap the pill out of her Master&#39;s hands, before noticing two bullets whiff past them and turn around, headed directly for the boy&#39;s cranium.

He had predicted this all along.

<strong>&quot;&amp;%$&#163;!@!&quot;</strong> She screamed various insults, some so archaic that not even Kun Wu could tell what she was saying. All that he knew was that seeing an angry Rider up close was both scary and exhilarating, particularly so when she couldn&#39;t vent her frustrations out on him. Rider shoved him aside, blocking the bullets for him and taking them head on. It was akin to a light breeze to someone with her body, thanks to the numerous boosts she had received from her skills.

Her attention turned back to Laurent, their main target. Get him out of the picture and Kun Wu would stop killing himself.</span>

&quot;Keel over and die already!&quot; Ching snarled, Shangri-La&#39;s cannons tilting as they aimed towards Caster&#39;s Master. No amount of gravity Magecraft nor human weaponry would be able to withstand this much firepower. Missiles erupted from the ship&#39;s hull, homing on Laurent with precision far greater than any modern machine. They would not stop until they collided and splattered him into a fine mist.

As if realizing she couldn&#39;t persuade him with words, she chose to do it with actions: she commanded Shangri-La once more, forcing Kun Wu to funnel even more mana into her as the ship let loose another volley of cannon fire. 

It <em>almost</em> felt like a challenge. As if she were telling him to either keep up...or suffer the consequences of her wringing his body dry. The last time he&#39;d seen Rider this agitated, Laurent had been her prime target. But this time, she was merely using the businessman as an outlet. An outlet to relieve her frustrations with <em>him</em>.

It was almost like throwing a childish tantrum. 

But the same could be said for Kun Wu, who had shoved the mana battery into his mouth in spite of Rider&#39;s warnings. Without wasting a single breath, he unsheathed his favorite weapon and started his long-winded chant, hoping to beat the inevitable nausea that would 100% result in him puking his guts out once again.

Meanwhile, the flame tiger he had conjured earlier idly prowled the rooftop, regarding Laurent and his companion with its lifeless eyes. It didn&#39;t seem so keen on shielding Kun Wu...But with Rider having his back, did he really need to go out of his way to protect himself?

&#39;A sequel of the giant and the nest of chaos seems quite fitting for the show.&#39; Kun Wu snapped open his fan and started kindling a new fire in the presence of Laurent, Caster and his new friend. The proximity to Rider had drastically enhanced his magecraft and reduced his casting time. Within breaths, what started out as a small candle fire had already grown to the size of one of Shangri-La&#39;s cannons.

And it kept expanding.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;What the...?&quot; Laurent muttered as Kun Wu produced a pack of pills. What was he planning? A counterattack? Not like it would matter. He&#39;d have a bullet between the eyes in a few moments.

Unfortunately, Rider&#39;s interception had shot that idea and left it to bleed out in a ditch. It was barely even a scratch. How was she so durable? Why? If bullets couldn&#39;t even cause her to blink, what did the Laurent and Friedrich even have?

Eternal Return. If Friedrich could return Laurent far enough to the past, they could stop this fight before it even began. Explosives on the roof. Grenades. They would have time to prepare.

Ching swore like a sailor. Wonderful. That narrowed her identity down substantially, if the massive boat violating every law in Delphi didn&#39;t. If he hadn&#39;t been so focused on Dolorous Gard, Laurent would&#39;ve done a field check on her.

&quot;I knew you were no good from when I first met you on that ship. It&#39;s good to know that your language matches my expectations! Wash your mouth! And by the way...&quot;

Laurent unloaded a bullet into Ching&#39;s face. It was nothing substantial. She would shrug it off, but the insult was there.

&quot;<strong>...I&#39;ve died before.</strong> I don&#39;t need your help with that.&quot; Laurent sneered as Kun Wu began his pyrotechnic storytelling. The businessman&#39;s Artifical Circuits began to ache as the fire grew. Phantom pains from the Brobdingnagian.

Already, a small void was growing in his palm, preparing to snuff out Kun Wu&#39;s blaze before it consumed everything.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Then, he caught Ching Shih&#39;s gaze.

That expression gave rise to one emotion:

Fear.

She knew exactly what he was capable of, and that he would do absolutely anything to leave her Master dead on the pavement. The very idea of him killing Kun Wu meant that he deserved the full attention of the China&#39;s Pirate Queen.

He had only lived as long as he had because Rider had been focused elsewhere. Now? He had her full attention. That expression of anger and protectiveness gave Laurent a sense of deja vu.

Had Uther looked like this after Laurent had caused Lark&#39;s death? It didn&#39;t matter, all it took was Ching&#39;s death glare, heralded by the sound of Changri-La&#39;s cannons, to cause Laurent to retreat, lashing his way back towards Caster.

He wouldn&#39;t make it.

Cannonballs and other artillery pieces rained from the heavens, far too many to count. The toll it must&#39;ve been taking on Ching and Kun Wu... Laurent could&#39;ve fathom it, but only because he was desperately trying to make it to safety.

A massive ball of iron slammed into Laurent&#39;s back, causing him to fall haphazardly into the side of a building. &quot;Why...?&quot; Laurent croaked in surprise, before it dawned on him: the cannonball was heavier than Laurent. His Magecraft would not deflect it.

In a fit of desperation, rage, and fear, Laurent made a mountain of rubble appear around him as he slid down the wall of the building. As the cannonballs struck Laurent&#39;s makeshift rubble barrier, it cracked even more. He had made himself a tomb to die.</span>

&quot;<strong>CASTER! Use Eternal Return! We can still get out of this! We can still get out of this!</strong>&quot; Laurent screamed, voice muffled by stone. Yet time did not loop. There was no sense of deja vu, or returning back to zero. Laurent was left there as artillery crashed around him.

He tried to move. Pain exploded in his spine. Had he broken his back? It wouldn&#39;t surprise him. Ching&#39;s Shangri-La was not to be underestimated. His vision was swimming.

&quot;Why?&quot; Laurent murmured as life left him. Why was he cursed to lose, over and over? He had lost against Kun Wu and Ching before. His victory against Gustave had felt like a defeat. His defeat of Lark had been his single victory, and the man had been a wreck of conflicting ideas and no real desires. Why was he being dragged down to the level of lesser men? What did they have that he didn&#39;t?

&quot;I just want to rule. Not for the people, but for myself. If that&#39;s the case, then...&quot; Laurent closed his eyes as the last remnants of his Magecraft faded.

&quot;<strong>I should&#39;ve risen above them. Now I understand.</strong>&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In front of Nietzsche, a battle raged on, a struggle that he was not in control of. Nietzsche had used his abilities to stall every fight, to hold Servants hostage so Laurent could flourish on the battlefield. Nietzsche did not have that option; for once, Nietzsche had to be a combatant. The philosopher gripped at his arm, holding in the blood as Rider’s artillery grazed him. His familiar fell dead from the cannon fire, a minotaur now taking appearance to block the canons with its body. Laurent called out for Nietzsche to enact Eternal Return; however, there was no answer. Caster stood still, watching his Master suffer the scars of battle. Nietzsche could feel Laurent&#39;s tie to life weakening… It seemed to Nietzsche that amidst the chaos, he had only one choice. He didn&#39;t know if Laurent was ready, but he had little time to think.

Nietzsche stepped forward, getting closer to his dying Master witnessing Kun Wu’s magecraft adding to Rider&#39;s destruction. Laurent would die if Nietzsche wasn&#39;t quick, so he would make this process fast. However, before Caster could take action he needed to be sure. 

Caster’s voice would travel into Laurent&#39;s mind chiding him to stay alive.  “Stay awake Laurent do not falter, we agreed to overcome the human limit, and I will not let you die!” Nietzsche’s voice was full of vigor. The Servant emitted an intensity and a bloodlust that Laurent hadn&#39;t seen from him before. In Caster’s arm rested a book, one of his works, one he had not used before.</span>

Whatever he was planning on casting was bad news. 

“Now, quick Laurent, tell me of your resolve! Before you die, let me know all you have fought for; prove to me that you are not the same Laurent MacKenzie I knew weeks ago! Prove this to me, and I will give you the power to win this battle!”

The ideals of the masses are nothing but chains.

It was time to embrace a new perspective.

Now was not the time for despair, nor the time to give in and accept one&#39;s fate. It was time to rise beyond those confinements, and forge a future that would inspire others to follow suit.

Rubble rained down from within Laurent&#39;s bubble, drowning him, burying him in stone and dust. His lungs were dry, his voice muffled, but somehow, Caster would hear his proclamation. 

&quot;<em>My belief stands above all else. No god, nor the ideals of others shall mettle with my grand design.</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>What I do, I do for myself. If I rule, I rule for myself, not for others. If I fail...</em>&quot;

&quot;<strong>...I will take responsibility for my own actions. If I must fall, if my wings must be clipped, I will rise again a Greater Man.</strong>&quot;

<em>That is my resolution given form, Friedrich.</em> Laurent thought as the last remnants of touch and sound abandoned him. <em>I certainly hope it is enough.</em>

The rubble finally collapsed, burying Laurent MacKenzie alive. There was one thing that Laurent found amusing as his life slipped away for the final time:

He wasn&#39;t afraid.

It&#39;s not that she wasn&#39;t checking for Caster and more so that there was no need to: With so many projectiles whizzing through the air, it was inevitable for the latter to be caught up in the crossfire.

A bullet struck her skull, right between her eyes. It would have killed a mere human, but it effortlessly bounced off her face. Laurent was staring at her, trying to brave her storm of cannonfire with a confident smirk on his face. He muttered something about dying.

&quot;You&#39;re delirious.&quot; Ching replied. &quot;If you really want to die again, I&#39;m more than happy to oblige!&quot; She snarled, as an additional 5 percent of ammo was dedicated specifically to blow Laurent to smithereens. As if reacting to this, Laurent went from confident to frightened, much to Ching&#39;s delight. She had no idea that it was actually due to Caster&#39;s words.

Laurent&#39;s luck had run out. Rubble buried him and Caster both as the onslaught of the Shangri-La continued. It seemed all but certain that the two had perished.

A lesser Servant would have left it at that. But Rider knew better. She had seen just how resourceful Servants like Assassin, Saber and Lancer could be.

&quot;New target.&quot; Rider snapped her fingers and pointed at the pile of rubble that hid Laurent from view. The ship obliged, firing a flurry of missiles at that direction and blowing the rubble to pieces. She wouldn&#39;t stop until she could confirm Laurent&#39;s corpse.</span>

&quot;Keep an eye out, milord. I suspect our opponent might try to use the fog of war against us.&quot; Ching turned to her Master while still keeping her eyes trained on the rubble. Indeed, a side effect of firing her entire armory was that a thick blanket of smog had formed around them due to all the gunpowder. She was still angry at him, but it was reassuring to see that she was still counting on Kun Wu&#39;s assistance!

&quot;And please, refrain from uttering such embarrassing things in public.&quot; Ching scoffed before turning away. It took a few seconds for Kun Wu to realize she was talking about his choice words a minute ago. In fact, he could almost see a blush on Rider&#39;s face, that was unfortunately hidden by the smog.

Your anger, your embarrassment...I accept them <em>all</em>. I know you&#39;re concerned about me, but&#39;—he hooked fingers with Rider and stole a peck from her cheek—&#39;Your Master is not so frail.&#39;

Heat radiated from his body. The fingers that latched onto hers felt warm, almost <em>hot</em> to the touch despite being protected under a layer of leather gloves - evidence that his artificial circuits were running at full capacity, trying to process all the raw mana from the pill. At one point in time, Rider would have chalked up the youth&#39;s unnaturally high body temperature as a side effect of his active lifestyle and flame magecraft. But now she knew better.

Like an engine that had fully warmed up, Kun Wu exercised his excellent motor control and started his fan dance near the edge of the rooftop, his footwork swift and firm despite the tremors caused by Shangri-La&#39;s explosions. Rubble and artillery fell like rain, underscoring his performance like crude percussion instruments. Drunk on the atmosphere, the youth tore through the smog with his fan, using the runes inscribed on its blades to pull the heated air from around him and Laurent&#39;s resting place.

Smog and dust followed the air currents back to Kun Wu, clearing both Rider&#39;s vision and ridding the Caster pair of their hiding place.

&#39;Smoke is a fine spice for my flames. Why waste it on our opponents when I can use it to introduce my babies?&#39; Kun Wu laughed in the face of Rider&#39;s worries. He controlled the heated air around him with large, circular motions. A blanket of smoke wrapped around his flame like a cocoon, betraying nothing from the inside other than a faint, hazy glow...and a horrendous mana signature that only seemed to strengthen with each passing second.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu went back to his storytelling, pouring vast amounts of mana without reserves into both his creation and Rider&#39;s futuristic galleon. It seemed that he had employed some strategies of his own to combat the nausea from ingesting a mana battery: by expending the mana as quickly as they were processed and forcing his circuits into labor, he was hoping to cycle through the raw mana before it started to poison his body. 

It was a simple strategy, really. One that could only be carried out thanks to his high grade circuits. He was taking his privileges for granted.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As rubble and canon fire covered the field, Nietzsche did not fear death. The opponent focused all of their munitions on Laurent, but it did not matter. Caster had heard the answer from Laurent he needed. A mad laugh would echo from the smoke and chaos; how could someone laugh so confidently in the face of demise? 

“At last, it has arrived!” The Philosophers voice called out, fighting against the sound of canon fire. Nietzsche glared down at his book-running his fingers across the title. It read “<strong>Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch f&#252;r Alle und Keinen</strong>” (Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None). 

The smoke cleared, and amidst the rubble was Caster. He stood alone, a deep laugh still coming from his throat. The servant was bloody and battered, his luxurious suit torn to shreds. Tears streamed down his eyes. The Philosopher seemed like he had lost it. In reality, it was anything but that. Nietzsche was as sane as possible. In fact, he was better than sane; he was right. Yes, Nietzsche felt validated; a sense of power filled his mind, his ultimate work was soon to be realized.

“Man is something to be overcome, and so man has been overcome! Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman, a rope over an abyss. Today we have climbed from that abyss! RIder rejoice because today you and your Master will bear witness to the evolution of mankind!”

He had lived the brutal assault, his body somehow intact. Laurent, however, was not the same man who had been buried. The ground beneath the battle would shake. An intense flare of mana erupted from Laurent, clearing the rubble he was buried in. From his stone coffin, Laurent would rise as someone new, something more than human. He would feel an influx of strength run through him. Everything seemed to move slow; his body would feel light and his steps heavy. Laurent MacKenzie had been reborn in Nietzsche’s visions: <strong>The Overman.</strong></span>

Delphi shook once again, down to the runes that kept it afloat. Shangri-La rattled, the vibrations of Caster&#39;s masterpiece rattling into their souls. The activation of Thus Spoke Zarahustra blew away the cloud of smoke produced by Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm, leaving the pair in view.

Caster&#39;s, half defeated, continued to laugh in the face of annihilation. His wish did not require Delphi, Olympia, the Church, or even a Holy Grail to manifest.

All it required was a man.

The rubble next to where he stood exploded in a massive pillar of light, atomizing the rubble that had become Laurent&#39;s tomb. In that light, a silhouette of a man could be seen.

<strong>Step.</strong>

<strong>Step.</strong>

Rubble formed a stairway, and a figure stepped out of the light, descending down towards Friedrich, facing in the direction of Ching and Kun Wu. The amount of magical energy being exuded made the skin tingle, the true ferocity of a Caster&#39;s most powerful Noble Phantasm made real.

Laurent MacKenzie stepped out of the light. However, all it took was one passing glance to realize that there was more than just that. The light within him shined with a harshness comparable to that of a star. It was not the gentle glow of the divine, but something harsher, more cruel.

&quot;<strong>Twice.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>I have died twice.</strong>&quot;

Each word was like a proclamation of doom, heralding the end of something, and promising the beginning of something terrible. Yet there was something more to it. The man <em>oozed</em> magical energy. Far more than any comparable mage. Almost like...

<strong>A Servant.</strong> Laurent MacKenzie had become something comparable to a Servant.</span>

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Laurent paused as his Servant continued to laugh. &quot;An idiotic question. This has been your goal from your summoning, hasn&#39;t it? You are ecstatic.  <strong>I am glad.</strong>&quot; 

Laurent flexed his hands, watching a miniature singularity spin within it. He grasped it shut, before smiling. &quot;See, I&#39;m also glad. Hysterical, even! I haven&#39;t felt anything this strongly since <em>he</em> passed away.&quot;

The businessman nodded, self-satisfied. &quot;You have allied with me. Even if this was your only reason for allying with me, it shall be excused. Rest. Friedrich Nietzsche. Watch what you have created!

It was clear that this was not some godlike version of Laurent, who had his personality altered into Friedrich&#39;s ideal individual. It was Laurent with copious amounts of energy at his fingertips.

It was like giving a chimp a machine gun.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Suddenly, reality resumed. Ching&#39;s ship continued to rain death from above. Laurent looked up, towards where Rider and Kun Wu were perched. Kun Wu was creating something massive. That much was obvious to the enhanced businessman. It was like his perceptiveness had been enhanced a hundred fold.

Without a moment to spare, Laurent rushed forward, weaving between Ching&#39;s artillery barrage. He was fast! Each step was like lightning, each leap nothing more than a blur. 

Laurent lashed himself to the side of the building that housed the Rider team. &quot;Face me, Rider! You barely considered me a threat back on that ship, eh? I&#39;ve come leaps and bounds. Face me, lest I snap your Master&#39;s neck like a twig! Now that the tables have been evened, I will gladly rip you apart, just like I did with Lancer and his Master!&quot;

It was good to know that some things never changed. At least this time, he seemed willing to let Kun Wu go if Rider faced him in combat. Lucky her. He had nothing that could hurt he—

Laurent reached the top of the building, where Kun Wu&#39;s fire bubble and Madame Ching awaited him. Faster than one could blink, a bullet was loaded, the safety unlocked, and the click of the trigger signified the release of ammunition.

<strong>Splatter.</strong> A single hole appeared in Rider&#39;s finely woven dress. Blood poured out, despite Rider&#39;s numerous defenses. Friedrich had enhanced Laurent&#39;s gun, as well. It was no longer an airsoft gun, but an actual weapon of war.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu&#39;s silver tongue was a troublesome foe to beat, perhaps even tougher than Laurent and Caster combined. No matter how cold she seemed, all of Rider&#39;s worries seemed to melt away the moment her Master got closer and kissed her cheek.

&quot;Please let me focus.&quot; She replied sternly, but a blush betrayed her feelings, followed by wrapping her fingers around Kun Wu&#39;s. Her grip was tight, and Kun Wu doubted that she would let go. Like a moth drawn to flame, so did Ching Shih covet her Master&#39;s warmth, albeit she was surprised by how high his temperature was.

It didn&#39;t take a genius to put two and two together. Kun Wu was preparing something special, which he clearly demonstrated as he twirled around his fan. A zoo was coming. Most likely to redirect the influx of mana to his entire body, instead of letting it sit and poison him from within.

Ching would have reprimanded him then, but something came up. The pile of rubble she had bombarded exploded to pieces, revealing a half dead Caster and a strange looking Laurent. He looked the same, yet he wasn&#39;t. His mana signature was off the charts for a Magus, surpassing even the likes of Jampo and Kun Wu. It felt more like a Servant than anything else.

He started to rant on, overflowing with confidence while Rider silently prepared the next session of artillery fire. He jumped straight ahead, gradually closing the distance between him and Rider as he took out his pistol. Ching hadn&#39;t feared bullets in a hot minute, but she should have: The moment she heard the shot, a bullet hole appeared in the middle of her stomach. Blood oozed out of it, dirtying parts of her silky dress.

&quot;Hnnng.&quot; Ching bit her lip, holding in the pain. A mere flesh wound wouldn&#39;t be enough to make her scream. Laurent kept ranting on, talking about how he would go after Kun Wu unless Rider intervened. It was obvious that he was trying to split them up, in order to let Caster go after her Master.</span>

Well, she couldn&#39;t do much about it. Firing the Shangri-La would be suicidal, since Laurent was now just meters away from her, and by extension, her Master. Kun Wu would get caught in the crossfire.

She had to push him away. Far enough so that Shangri-La could do its job. However, this meant leaving Kun Wu behind...

That decision alone made her freeze for a few seconds. It was like a hen leaving its eggs, or a tiger leaving its cubs to hunt. In the past fights, Kun Wu&#39;s safety was her primary concern. At first, out of pragmatism. But now, out of something far stronger.

<em>&quot;Your Master is not so frail.&quot;</em>

Come to think of it, it was always her problem, wasn&#39;t it? Her desire to have control over the brothel she worked at. Her desire to have control over her husband&#39;s fleet. Her desire to have control over China&#39;s seas. Her desire to have control over <strong>her life.</strong>

If she wasn&#39;t running the ship, she would rather drown. That is the life Ching Shih lived. That is the absolute fact that she could not escape from. Even if she were a saint who never killed anyone, or a gluttonous murderer who enjoyed the sight of bloodshed, that wouldn&#39;t change the fact that she desired control above anything else.

But was it truly love to shackle her beloved?

...

Four seconds passed since Laurent fired his pistol. Enough time for him to reload.

Enough time for Ching Shih to make her decision as well.

Without warning, she wrapped her arm around Kun Wu and dragged him closer, resting his head on her chin as she hugged him tight.

&quot;Kun Wu.&quot; She spoke his name for once. &quot;You drive me mad. I&#39;d gladly give my life to you if I could, so I hope you know why I have to leave. Caster will no doubt attack you while I&#39;m away, and I won&#39;t be here to protect you for that. But...&quot;</span>

<strong>&quot;You are strong.&quot;</strong> She exclaimed. &quot;You are the strongest person I&#39;ve ever known. So I order you to survive. Die, and you won&#39;t hear the end of it from me! If you&#39;re really intent on sinking, then you will have to take me down with you!&quot; She shouted, both encouraging him and reprimanding him at the same time. Her passion was more tempestuous than any storm.

She kissed him on the forehead before abruptly shoving him away. Far, far away from Laurent. Her eyes turned back to the latter, peering into his soul with a maddening glint. The businessman felt like he was being hunted down by a starved tiger.

&quot;...What has it been now? The third time I&#39;ve pummeled you to the ground? It&#39;s always the same with men like you. Trying to act high and mighty like lions. But you should always remember,&quot;

Ching took a step as the floor beneath her started to crack. She accelerated towards Laurent at a speed beyond what she had demonstrated so far. He was incredulous.

<strong>&quot;insects will remain insects.&quot;</strong>

Before he could aim his gun at her again, Rider elbowed him in the face, cracking his precious glasses and exposing his visage. She followed it by attempting to claws his eyes out. These vicious attacks had fury and bloodlust behind them, enough to push Laurent further back and distance him from Kun Wu even more. As he groaned in pain, a thought infiltrated his mind.

Had Ching Shih been holding back against him this entire time?! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If Caster&#39;s maniacal laughter hadn&#39;t alerted him, the massive pillar of light did. Rubble exploded from where Laurent had fallen, and the businessman himself stepped out of his grave, radiating a mana signature that was leagues above what Kun Wu had sensed before. In fact, he hadn&#39;t felt this kind of pressure from any Master he had come across in the CGW: not Laura, not Gustave, and most certainly not Jampo, even with a lifetime&#39;s worth of training under their belt. The last time he&#39;d experienced something like this was when he recorded Guan Yu showing off his famous Guandao in <span class="mention">#the-underbelly-b1f-b5f</span>. 

That&#39;s right. A <em>Servant</em>. That was what Laurent felt like to him. Even Caster, his own Servant, had been overshadowed in the heat of the moment. Laurent closed the gap between him and the Rider pair with ease, before promptly firing a single bullet at Rider - and pierced her flesh with ease. The gun had been enhanced too. 

Strength and speed on par with a Servant, with plenty of mana to spare. Caster was no fighter, so he powered up Laurent to fight in his steed.

So <em>that</em> was how they operated.

A little chuckle escaped Kun Wu. Despite the ridiculous situation unfolding before him, despite his own Servant having shed blood once more against a cockroach who refused to die, Kun Wu found it hard to truly hate the man. After all, Laurent had just done something incredible. Something <em>novel</em>, something never before seen in Delphi&#39;s history of City Grail Wars: a Master who fought in the front lines while his Servant provided support.

&#39;Your spirit is admirable, but your strategy is not. Say, how much does it take to rent your Caster for a day-&#39; Kun Wu began his sales pitch to buy time for Rider to recover, but Rider was healthy - and quick enough to put a stop to his clowning, pulling him aside and into her bosom for some quality alone time...right in front of their bespectacled killer.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu squirmed, but Rider was dead set of restraining him until she gave him a piece of her mind. Her selfishness made manifest, she laid her heart bare and <em>commanded</em> him to live...lest he drag her down with him. 

&#39;That&#39;s a tall order.&#39; Kun Wu exhaled loudly. Then he smiled. &#39;But rest assured, you aren&#39;t the only one making demands.&#39;

He patted Rider on the back, feeling somewhat peckish after having received the first genuine compliment from Rider. He could use more of that instead of forehead flicks....Or being tossed around like an abandoned puppy, it seemed.

With strength on par with a battering ram, Rider shoved - no, <em>flung</em> Kun Wu away. Determined to keep him out of immediate danger, she was planning to send him flying across at least a few rooftops, a safe distance away from Laurent, enough distance for her to block Laurent&#39;s path should he attempt to chase down her Master.

...But Kun Wu had different ideas.

&#39;I haven&#39;t even said anything yet!&#39; He yelled. &#39;The deal&#39;s on hold until you hear <em>my</em> end of the bargain!&#39; Taking full advantage of Rider&#39;s throw, the youth raised his fan and pulled hard as he soared through the air in a large and not-so-graceful arc. 

The smoke-clad cocoon burst open.

Fire heeded his fan and poured into the air around them. With each slash of his fan, a portion of it split off from the rest and started morphing as Kun Wu pushed and pulled from afar. Wings sprouted from one ball of fire. A pair of claws protruded from another. The process was almost like watching a baker knead dough into animal-shaped breads, except that these animals were far redder, larger, and scarier than what a baking oven could produce.

With a mighty roar, the body of an oriental dragon stretched itself onto the rooftop. It slithered to the edge of the roof and dived towards the rubble below, intent on devouring <strong>Nietzsche</strong> with its maw...or simply crushing him under its sheer bulk alone.

It glided towards Kun Wu, catching him on its back before transporting him to the rooftop of an adjacent building. 

Oh no. He wasn&#39;t done signing Rider&#39;s contract yet.

<em>&#39;I think chances of me surviving is infinitely higher when I can see where you are!&#39;</em> He yelled at Rider...inside her head. Did a volume down button of sorts come with their bond?

<em>&#39;The last time we separated, you almost killed yourself looking for me. Well, I&#39;m not going to let that happen again. I&#39;m staying</em> right here, <em>where you can see me and hear me loud and clear, as if I&#39;ve never left!&#39;</em> The youth beamed at Rider from across the building, his face barely visible even with the flame bird at his side. At least he was loud! Hopefully he got the message across.

And, well, if that didn&#39;t, then his actions surely will. As Ching Shih invited Laurent to a bloody tango, Kun Wu took it upon himself to continue expanding his army of forest friends. Tens, dozens, <em>tens of dozens</em> of fireballs split off from their source; controlling so many creatures at once was difficult, if not downright impossible, so Kun Wu opted for something simpler. Something that he had learned from watching Laura while she operated her bug swarms.

When the numbers were large enough, even a simplistic hivemind would become a formidable army.

<em>Boing!</em>

A fireball-turned-rabbit hopped onto the rooftop. Rider would be reminded of a certain episode...

<em>Boing!</em>

Another rabbit joined the first.

<em>Boing boing boing boing boing boing boing-</em>

Rabbits poured onto the platform, a sea of glowing red-orange lights. They were slowly taking over the rooftop.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s glasses shattered as Ching struck him, causing him to hiss in rage, contorting his features.

He had seen it all. Ching&#39;s desire to protect her beloved. Her act of affection. Her proclamation for love, and her order for Kun Wu to survive. Pointless. Tired. Cliched. Ultimately boring. A love story like this was older than the ocean itself.

And yet...

There was no need to kill Kun Wu. If he was struck down by Caster, then that was the will of the world. Laurent had no say in it. After murdering Lark, there was no need for pointless cruelty. He was beyond such fanciful notions. Murder was pointless. 

&quot;<strong>Don&#39;t look down on insects, woman!</strong>&quot; Laurent sneered as he wiped his bloodied face, voice finally filling up, matching a true Ubermensch. &quot;<strong>They&#39;re far stronger than they look, and when you swell one up to your size...</strong>&quot;

Laurent smashed his enhanced fist into Rider&#39;s face as she clawed at his eyes. It wasn&#39;t enough to stop her. Luckily, there was more to the plan.

&quot;<strong>They bite.</strong>&quot; Laurent slammed his foot into a piece of smoking debris, sent there by the various explosions. The rubble flew upwards, slamming Ching in the chin, finally freeing Laurent from getting his eyes clawed. He blinked incomprehensibly for a moment as his eyes adjusted.

Laurent quickly capitalized on the opening, stuffing his hand into his pocket, and throwing a fistful of ammunition into the air. It orbited around him ready to be grabbed and reloaded at a moment&#39;s notice. He had effectively cut his reload time in half.

Ching was strong. Stronger than Laurent, even in this powerful form. If the scars on his eyes from her attempt to claw them apart was any indication, she would beat him in physical might every single time. If a bullet did not stop her, she was presumably far more durable as well.

A force of nature formed from love.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laurent&#39;s one benefit was his speed. He was <em>fast</em>. His perception and reaction time were the only things stopping him from getting torn apart. While Ching couldn&#39;t easily keep up with him she only needed a few lucky, or preplanned strikes to finish Laurent off.

The two superhumans locked gazes as they exchanged blows, Laurent with Ching&#39;s maddening glare, fueled by protectiveness, love, and an increasingly expanding capacity for violence. Ching with Laurent&#39;s <em>desire</em>. No matter what happened, Laurent would keep marching forward until he won. He <em>needed</em> this win, just as Kun Wu needed Ching, or the crowds to keep cheering him on.

Perhaps Laurent wanted this win more than her.

&quot;<strong>Fighting for that boy won&#39;t change anything!</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed as he unloaded his entire revolver towards Ching. &quot;<strong>If you love him so much, why don&#39;t you <em>marry</em> him?</strong>&quot; He taunted. What were they, twelve?

Several bullets blew past Ching. It was clear what he was going to do. A web of gunpowder and metal. They would blow past her, before piercing her at various angles. Laurent was already reloading his gun, grasping bullets from his orbiting stash.

The initial exchange of blows had Caster practically vibrating from excitement. Laurent had become everything he wanted, all of the time he had spent in this era was worth it. Nietzsche was ecstatic his eyes glued to Rider and his Master. 

Nietzsche however, would not get to watch for long. To his great disappointment Rider decided to move with Laurent making it difficult to see the fight. Even worse than that Kun Wu had the nerve to attack Nietzsche during such a beautiful moment, he could not allow that. 

Nietzsche set his glare forward eyeing down Kun Wu&#39;s dragon. He clenched his teeth bewildered at the boys actions. Nietzsche did not understand how someone could try and interfere with such greatness. 

&quot;Boy! Do you understand what you are witnessing!&quot; Nietzsche yelled up to Kun Wu as he flew high above. Caster let out a loud hmpf, summoning a winged horse beneath his legs. The familiar would flap it&#39;s wings pushing itself off the ground just ahead of Kun Wu&#39;s dragon. 
Nietzsche raised through the sky tailing Kun Wu, the beast of flame right behind, undoubtedly coming to consume the philosopher. 

Caster ,however, wouldn&#39;t approach Kun Wu without a plan. He had a second book tucked away at his side ready to activate yet another Noble Phantasm. As Nietzsche reached the top of the building, Kun Wu&#39;s dragon ready to goble him up, a barrier would admit from his body engulfing a large area around both Kun Wu and himself. 

The Noble Phantasm was known as Beyond Good and Evil, any mage craft or Noble Phantasms within it&#39;s range should be nullified. It was an attempt to disable Kun Wus mage craft leaving him out of the equation.

Kun Wu heard Nietzsche and looked down.

A magnificent flying steed took to the sky. It resembled the Pegasus from ancient mythology, but to see a man in a modern suit and tie seated on top of it was rather jarring. Kun Wu at least <em>dressed</em> the part, looking like a Taoist shaman whenever he commanded his flame familiars in public. But what to make of Nietzsche?

&#39;That&#39;s an awfully inspiring combination you&#39;ve got there!&#39; Kun Wu yelled back at Nietzsche, completely missing the man&#39;s point and taking his question as an invitation to judge Nietzsche&#39;s hastily put together ensemble. &#39;You seem to be a pretty modern Servant. Were you a fan of the Greeks in your previous life?&#39; 

With some quick maneuvers of his fan, Kun Wu pulled the dragon up into the air, chasing after the philosopher in an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Nietzsche barely kept himself out of the dragon&#39;s maw while making a mad dash for the street performer, no doubt trying to close the distance so he could drop a few more Greek heroes on him and turn the tides of battle.

But Kun Wu would hardly lose in a game of numbers.

In fact, he <em>welcomed</em> it. The more he got to populate the field with his flaming beasts, the more the battle felt like a grand festival. Fire, light, noise, heat. All he needed was an audience and, well, Nietzsche was just about to provide that with his familiars, wasn&#39;t he?

Not that Kun Wu would make it easy. As Nietzsche approached the building he perched on, Kun Wu sent his flame bird gliding off the building to meet him head on, forming a pincer attack with the dragon still on his tail. With two creatures coming after him, Nietzsche would find his flight a lot more turbulent than before.

But that wasn&#39;t all.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu took off from where he stood, building speed, measuring his steps, eyes on the glowing visage of his bird. Timing his strides perfectly, he leapt from the edge of the building and propelled himself through the air, fully intent on landing <em>onto</em> the bird&#39;s back and challenge Nietzsche to a battle for air supremacy!

&#39;Welcome to the late night show!&#39; He bellowed over the head of the philosopher and his steed. &#39;Tickets for two? A crowd? Why don&#39;t you call them over and we can negotiate a discount-&#39;

His boots touched the back of the bird and fell clean through. Instead of landing on his bird, he landed on top of <em>Nietzsche</em>. Meanwhile, his own magecraft fizzled out, as if someone had pulled the plug and severed the connection between him and his flame creatures. And that certain someone was currently being used as his cushion, holding onto a glowing book: Nietzsche had just activated his Noble Phantasm and disabled Kun Wu&#39;s magecraft.

It was certainly a much swifter solution than pitting their familiars against each other. Without his magecraft, Kun Wu was no more special than any of the guests who came to watch his show. No charm, no pizzazz, and worst of it all...

<strong>No ability to control the very flames he had conjured.</strong>

The bird and dragon swelled up like giant balloons, no long able to contain their mass. Their temperature shot through the roof, granting the fire an intense heat and causing ripples of heatwave to clash against Kun Wu and Nietzsche&#39;s exposed skin. 

Nietzsche&#39;s Noble Phantasm had disabled Kun Wu&#39;s magecraft. It had also prevented him from dumping copious amounts of mana into keeping it <em>tamed</em>. And now the fire burned simply and freely: hot, wild and lethal, a menace that couldn&#39;t tell friend from foe.

&#39;Oh no-&#39;

His dragon, his bird, his tiger, and the hundreds of rabbits crowding the fights on the rooftop. All of it. Every single one of his carefully crafted familiars had burst back into scorching flames that could almost give Laurent&#39;s grenades a run for its money. They rolled across both sky and rooftop like wildfire, threatening to burn everything to a crisp.

&#39;Consider this, uh, a proof of my burning passion.&#39; Kun Wu&#39;s voice, sheepish and a little panicky, rang in Rider&#39;s head moments before disaster struck.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;I&#39;ll look down on whoever I please.&quot; Ching replied, caring not for Laurent&#39;s justifications. &quot;And you will do for now.&quot;

One of her nails almost stabbed at Laurent&#39;s eyeballs, but he thankfully closed his lid on time. He instead felt a prickly, terrifying sensation on his eyelid, causing him to retaliate with a fist towards Ching&#39;s face.

Blood squirted from her nose, but this was nothing. She didn&#39;t stop. Compared to the pain she had sustained in her previous life, it was insignificant.

Unfortunately, her determination could only carry her so far, since Laurent&#39;s strategy with the rubble succeeded in shaking her footing. She lost her balance, which gave Laurent enough time to free himself and temporarily step back. He started tossing ammo in the air, reloading his pistol with his newfound swiftness.

He unloaded his entire barrel at once. Not without saying a few choice words about her relationship with Kun Wu, of course.

&quot;That is exactly what I intend to do.&quot; She seemed unfazed, bullets whizzing past her as they turned around, planning to penetrate her from multiple angles. &quot;I&#39;ve already planned out our wedding, our honeymoon, our life insurance and our familial roles. Of course, there is but one problem: <strong>You.</strong>&quot;

If Laurent thought he was quick, he would need a doubletake. He reloaded in an effort to assault Ching with continuous fire, but soon started to realize that the bullets were never hitting their mark. Instead, something flashed in Ching&#39;s hand.

&quot;Did you forget about the time period I am from, or was my ship not a big enough clue?&quot; She taunted, holding the Madam&#39;s Rose in her hand. &quot;In my heyday, pistols were quite common in close quarters combat. I courted death every day by engaging against fusiliers. They all fell to this blade.&quot;</span>

Bullet shells fell down to the ground, neatly sliced in half. It was clear that Ching was no amateur of the blade, as she had displayed throughout the entire Grail War. Her swordsmanship lacked technique, but made up for it in elegance, for she had figured out how to slice all of the bullets without breaking a sweat.

All that was left was to impale Laurent, but Ching Shih was no fool. She knew that she wasn&#39;t a good enough swordswoman to stab him with his newfound speed.

Yet she lunged at him all the same.

Laurent would almost chuckle in response. It was an idiotic maneuver, no different than how Ching had behaved back at their first meeting. Once rage had blinded her, she had left Kun Wu unchecked and allowed Assassin to interfere, resulting in her defeat. The same was about to happen here.

Or was it?

&quot;Since you&#39;re comparable to a Servant now, <strong>do you wager an anchor might work?</strong>&quot; Rider grinned. Laurent had no idea what she was talking about.

&quot;Oh? I guess you didn&#39;t see it. Shame. But it&#39;s fine! Men love surprises.&quot;

<strong>THONK</strong>

She stopped mid stab, revealing the fact that her lunge was a decoy. Even if Laurent had tried to dodge, it was too late, for he had dodged in the wrong direction.

<em>An anchor had struck him from behind.</em>

<em>whirrrr rattle rattle</em>

The chains wrapped themselves around him like snakes, coiling with a will of their own. He instinctively attempted his Magecraft, but they didn&#39;t react to his gravitational pull at all. This wasn&#39;t a case of the anchor surpassing his body mass. It was more akin to him trying to use Magecraft on Magecraft...

A Noble Phantasm.

<strong>&quot;Sink into the abyss of bottomless despair!&quot;</strong> Ching gloated, kicking him while he was down and launching him towards Kun Wu&#39;s flaming rabbits. His arms were completely trapped and despite his newfound strength, he felt about as weak as he was moments ago.</span>

<em>&quot;Male. Rich. Almost a Servant. You are the perfect target for my Curse of Shui Gui.&quot;</em> Ching thought in her head, feeling rather satisfied at her quick thinking. Laurent watched in horror as various malevolent spirits started to emerge from the chains, gnawing at his body and choking his neck. Their faces looked familiar: The faces of all those he had swindled. All those he had eliminated for the sake of his future. All those that he had eliminated out of money and corruption.

<em>Lancer&#39;s Master was there too.</em>

The sight was horrifying and also accompanied by a sizzling sensation as Kun Wu&#39;s rabbits grinded on his body. His clothes felt like they were about to catch on fire, but so far nothing had happened yet. The chain was his biggest threat, yet he had no idea on how to break it.

<em>&quot;Master, if you may.&quot;</em> Ching gave the okay with her telepathic link, waiting for Kun Wu to go ahead with his plan. <em>&quot;And please, refrain from screaming aga-&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Consider this, uh, a proof of my burning passion.&quot;</em>

Wait, something was wrong. Ching knew that tone well. It was the tone Kun Wu used against her whenever he had puppy eyes or was trying to avoid the blame for something. What had he done n-

<strong>BOOM!</strong>

<strong>BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!</strong>

It was like watching popcorns pop. The swarm of familiars Kun Wu had summoned had now exploded in magnificent, fiery fireworks. All courtesy of Caster.

Of course, this meant the various buns as well.

<strong>&quot;YOU GODDAMN BRA-&quot;</strong>

Kun Wu considered himself lucky to be unable to hear Rider&#39;s words through the explosions, not even through telepathy. If he had heard the curses directed at him on that day, it would have most likely broken his pure, delicate heart.</span>

A wall of smoke emerged from the remnants of the suicidal bunnies. Laurent had been catapulted elsewhere by the explosion, landing right on top of the Shangri-La as his clothes had been completely burnt off, leaving him in ashen undies. His flesh and skin was also partially singed. Clear signs of second and third degree burns.

Ching Shih wasn&#39;t fortunate either. She had managed to avoid being catapulted away, but still took a fair amount of damage. The smoke was obscuring her fully, but it eventually dissolved. Both Kun Wu and Caster managed to catch a glimpse of her from afar.

Kun Wu&#39;s nose started bleeding.

Her clothes had been completely fried, resulting in her willingly taking them off to conserve mana. Ching Shih was butt naked, a fact that she wasn&#39;t pleased about at all, judging by her reddened face and terrifying glare. She twirled with her sword before casting a stink eye at Kun Wu from afar.

<em>&quot;You know, there are a lot of ways of showing your passion towards me.&quot;</em> She was too tired to speak, but her thoughts were being clearly directed to him via the telepathic link.

<em>&quot;Sunbathing at the beach. A nice dinner outside. A trip to the hot springs. A calm night at home. And yet...&quot;</em> She raised her sword and pointed it at him.

<strong>&quot;YOU PICK THIS OF ALL THINGS?!</strong> What happened to stopping me from killing myself, uuhhhh? Does that mean you plan on killing me <strong>yourself?!?</strong>&quot; A storm of thoughts and emotions blanketed Kun Wu&#39;s mind, causing him to shiver at the thought of being within hugging distance of Rider.

&quot;Tch. Whatever! We&#39;ll talk about this later.&quot; Ching regained the use of her voice, addressing Kun Wu with ten times scorn and equal times love. She couldn&#39;t wait to teach him a lesson like the respectable woman she was.</span>

But for now, Laurent held priority. He was burnt and still trapped in chains, but was still the biggest threat there. Ching bounced from rooftop to rooftop, before landing on the Shangri-La with her proud body on display.

&quot;Savor the look, you piece of trash. At least it will be an angel who sends you down to hell.&quot; She taunted, raising her sword as she prepared herself for a clean kill.

Greedy, too. I want everything in Olympia. In Delphi.</strong>&quot; He spat out a globule of golden blood. 

Ching slashing apart his bullets meant little. He had more, and they were extremely simple to reload. In the blink of an eye, he would reload. &quot;<strong>Your origin means nothing. Who you were means nothing. I do not care about the Rider of the past. I care about the Rider of now!</strong>&quot; Laurent reached for another bullet, reloading his gun.

It did not matter how untrained Ching was in the traditional art of the blade. She was trained. He was not. Laurent was unarmed, and had no training for close combat. He had raw power, but raw power would not defeat a talented foe.

That was respectable.

A frown. &quot;<strong>An anchor? Why would an anch—</strong>&quot; Suddenly, a massive tumor of karma  smashed into Laurent, coiling him in dark chains of iron and grudges. He tried to move it, only to fail, leading to his frustration. His face was a mixture of frustration and wrath. Rage and disgust. Spirits bellowed from the chain, as if the very Noble Phantasm was alive.

Laurent did not care for the various people that had caused him harm. They, ultimately, had simply lost their lot with bad business. The ones he had killed, failures. And yet the karma continued to weigh at him, and until eventually...

&quot;<strong>No...</strong>&quot; He croaked as the face of Lark glared at him, before attempting to tear at his neck. However, it continued to get worse. Another form was taking shape. Long hair, beautiful, even as a pale imitation. All radiating pure malice.

His wife.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Even as he was dragged away, Laurent felt himself fill with a primal anger, akin to Ching when Kun Wu was in danger. A dark void appeared in his palm, sucking away the spirits attempting to tear him apart. Shockingly, even the anchor keeping Laurent down began to rattle, threatening to be swallowed up by Laurent&#39;s Magecraft. Had that been enhanced as well?

Suddenly though, he stopped as Ching cornered him. The void kept spinning, swallowing up rubble and the remaining flames from Kun Wu&#39;s fantastic display. He looked tired, but not beaten. He watched Ching&#39;s volatile mouth demean her Master, as if annoyed and amused. There was only one way he&#39;d escape this: <strong>words</strong>.

&quot;<strong>I hate you.</strong>&quot;

Laurent sighed as Kun Wu&#39;s display was interrupted by his Servant&#39;s counterattack. Was that it? A last rebuttal before being struck down by Ching, who had prepared to strike.

&quot;<strong>I hate looking at people like you, with a mindset akin to mine, but warped and twisted. It&#39;s nothing more than a funhouse mirror. The idea that other people could even hope to compare to me is...</strong>&quot; Laurent trailed off.

&quot;<strong>No. I hate seeing myself in others.</strong>&quot;

Why was he like this? He had hated Ching from the moment they had met back on the Brobdingnagian. Was it because she was a woman using her body? No, it wasn&#39;t that simple. In a moment of surprising personal digging, Laurent had come to a starting conclusion about himself. Perhaps the face of defeat made for an excellent motivator.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re a failure of a businesswoman, Rider. Nothing more than a stupid woman, going on and on about your superiority over me. Lording your body like it means anything. It is not special. I could summon a dozen Servants that make better angels than you.</strong>&quot;</span>

He couldn&#39;t blame Rider though, despite his utter hatred for her. If he was in her shoes, he&#39;d flaunt his body as an advantage wherever he could.

&quot;<strong>Expectation is the purest form of currency. In the Old World, there was a form of currency known as a penny. Nearly worthless, but one time, a factory misprinted one of these pennies, and it became worth many thousands more. Despite that, it&#39;s only still a penny.</strong>&quot; Laurent chuckled, as if the idea was extremely stupid in retrospect. He sounded like someone in on a secret but continued to lord it over others. Where was he going with this pointless fact?

Ching had to resist the urge to step on him.

&quot;<strong>You love him.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, eyes pointing towards where Kun Wu stood, drained from his Magecraft, threatening to die at a moment&#39;s notice. &quot;<strong>I do not. Yet despite this, his value as an &#39;individual life&#39; does not change.</strong>&quot;

Shut up.

&quot;<strong>Why do you want to win this City Grail War?</strong>&quot; Laurent asked, eyes slit like a snake&#39;s in the glint of Ching&#39;s blade. &quot;<strong>I assure you, I want it more than your Master and you combined. The more he struggles against my Servant, the more likely he is to die. I certainly hope your wish is worth the risk. </strong>&quot;

Shut up.

&quot;<strong>What is your wish, Pirate Queen Ching Shih? What is your wish? TELL ME!</strong>&quot; Laurent bellowed her True Name as the inner light of Friedrich&#39;s Noble Phantasm strengthened him.

<strong>Clink.</strong>

Laurent Singularity exuded everything that it had sucked up, knocking Ching&#39;s blade with its force, sending it spiraling into the distance. His poker face was excellent. This was his element, business deals, lies, and cruelty. Yet all it would take was a brutal beatdown from Ching to finally kill him for a third time. Besides, he was a total sleezebag. Laurent would find a way out of this, and continue to engage Rider.

In the meantime, Kun Wu would die. In that case...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche let off a large grin as Kun Wu hopped down towards him. Once Nietzsches NP activated Kun Wu&#39;s familiar would disappear and he would undoubtedly fall to his doom. &quot;Unfortunately there will be no sho-&quot; Before Nietzsche could taunt the falling Kun Wu he landed smack into the Philosopher. Unlucky for Nietzsche, the worst was yet to come.&#160;

Caster had wrongfully assumed that Kun Wu&#39;s familiar would fizzle out upon activation of his Noble Phantasm; however, he did not understand that the familiars were made of real fire. Kun Wu&#39;s mana was only needed to maintain their shape.&#160;

A large explosion sent Nietzsche and his opponent hurtling through the building beside them. Caster would lay flat on the floor for a few moments, dazed from the explosion.&#160;

Nietzsche&#39;s hands pressed flat against the floor slowly pushing himself up, his arms rapidly shaking. What was left of his suit had pretty much been burnt up, leaving black patches of fabric covering bits of his skin. He shook his head still dazed from the explosion, one hand reaching up to put out a flame singing his mustache.&#160;

&quot;I seem to have miscalculated...&quot; Caster exhaustedly stated raising to his knees with a deep breath. His body was scorched from the explosion, multiple burns covering his flesh. Now looking out towards Rider, Nietzsche could finally get a grasp for what was happening in the battle. He rubbed his teeth together seeing the state of Laurent. Rider was still giving him a decent amount of trouble. Perhaps targeting Kun Wu was a mistake. In retrospect it might have been better for the philosopher to catch the enemy servant in his range. It was too late for that now.&#160; At least he had successfully excluded Kun Wu&#39;s mage craft from the fight... In a way.</span>

Despite Caster&#39;s attempt to completely remove Kun Wu from the fight, the same explosion that blasted him had also made contact with both Ching and Laurent, leaving mostly everyone in an unclothed state. 

Being stuck with Kun Wu did have it&#39;s upsides. Even if Laurent did lose, Nietzsche would still be able to sit idly by and watch his Ubermensch go to work. In the end that&#39;s all he wanted. Laurent was performing wonderfully… However, one thing was distracting the Philosopher from his viewing experience.

&quot;Ah! Kun Wu, tell you Servant to have some decency!&quot; Nietzsche moved his eyes from the woman, ignoring the fact that both him and Laurent were in a similar naked state.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The force of the explosion spitted Kun Wu out of a large smoke cloud and sent him flying into the building. This was fine. It <em>would have</em> been fine, if he still had his familiars to cushion him! Kun Wu tried to channel his mana and summon a few more, but Caster had obviously done something to him, rendering him incapable of conjuring even the tiniest of flames. His magecraft was as good as dead.

<em>CRASH!</em>

&#39;Ow-&#39;

<em>Skid skid skid-</em>

&#39;Owowow-&#39; Kun Wu landed on the rooftop and was sent rolling down the concrete floor like a burnt sushi roll. When he finally came to a stop, he spent a good while staring at the fire-tinged sky while trying to collect himself, much like the philosopher who was lying a few meters away. 

His head hurt. It buzzed, but not because he knocked it against something hard. If he had to describe it, it felt as if he had just been brutalized with words. Being yelled at with a voice so loud that it made his ears hurt.

Nietzsche didn&#39;t feel like a screamer. Could it be...? He turned his head and caught Rider in her full, naked glory.

His face burned. It wasn&#39;t because of the fire.

And their eyes found each other. Kun Wu&#39;s, wide with confusion, then a solemn understanding of the spectacle his fire had caused; Rider&#39;s, cold with scorn, and a realization that once again, she had been duped by her Master against his better judgement.

She was butt naked. Kun Wu was not.

For what was a street performer who danced with fire if he couldn&#39;t <em>fireproof</em> his outfit beforehand? Why didn&#39;t Rider ever think to ask? Was it because she had gotten so used to Kun Wu&#39;s gentle flames that she had forgotten how much of a hazard fire can be?

Kun Wu blinked slowly, savoring every moment that Rider spent flaunting her immaculate figure and threatening him with - what was that about a romantic dinner?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">From Laurent&#39;s perspective, it looked like Ching&#39;s sword was a few inches away from his neck. He had no idea that Ching herself was facing her own struggle against an unlikely opponent: Her own Master.

<em>&quot;...Really?&quot;</em> Ching groaned in her mind. Her blade stood still as she focused on Kun Wu over her opponent. Laurent would be dead by now otherwise.

<em>&quot;You ask me that after all of *this?!</em>&quot;* Kun Wu could feel her irritation in his mind. <em>&quot;How would you feel if I stripped you out in public and tossed you at Laura or Guan Yu? Would that feel great? Exhilarating? Like you&#39;re at the top of the world? *I feel the exact opposite right now.</em>&quot;*

Her anger was palpable, to the point Laurent could notice a slight frown on her face. The conversation in her head was affecting her outward appearance.

<em>&quot;And don&#39;t even *dare</em> to sweet talk yourself out of this. No amount of praise or compliments will save your skin this time.&quot;* A tiger was clawing at Kun Wu&#39;s brain. <em>&quot;Once this is over, you better say your prayers. I&#39;m not letting you go until you have fully repented for this. *Fully!</em>&quot;*

Laurent started talking, but received no reply. To him, it looked like Rider was too shocked and impressed by his words to reply. In reality, it was just her channeling her rage somewhere else.

<em>&quot;But to answer your original question: *Did you even need to ask?!</em> I feel terrible. I&#39;ve been feeling that since after our fight with Saber. Were you too dense to catch the signs or what? If only you were as good as thinking as you were at kiss-&quot;* She stopped herself there. <em>&quot;My point stands! If you wanted to ask me how I felt, you should have done it hours ago!&quot;</em>

...

There was a brief moment of silence after that, almost as if Ching&#39;s own inner thoughts had taken a deep breath.  <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He couldn&#39;t even gloss over it, because each syllable was imprinted deeply in his mind thanks to their bond. He couldn&#39;t turn it off if he tried.

<em>&#39;It wasn&#39;t-it wasn&#39;t accounted for! My magecraft stopped working. Caster used one of his spells on me. I want to know if it&#39;s affecting our bond-&#39;</em>

Compared to Rider, his own voice felt tiny and insignificant. Losing her clothes had emboldened Rider in more ways than one; in contrast, Kun Wu, in his layered robes, felt like a disturbed rabbit cowering from her scorn. 

The youth shuddered. He could almost feel Rider&#39;s sharp nails on his neck.

<em>&#39;...Don&#39;t strip me in front of Guan Yu. Anything but that!&#39;</em> He surrendered in a pleading voice at the prospect of clowning himself in front of his childhood hero. <em>&#39;I&#39;ll make it up to you. I will!

Regardless, her Master rarely lied to her, so she let it slide. <em>&quot;I can sense your mana just fine. Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m more worried about the man in front if me.

Kun Wu had his own suspicions whenever Rider told him that. But considering she had ever so passionately compared him to a dead man just now, he doubted that she was trying to hide her conditions from him. If she felt normal, then that meant Caster&#39;s spell only extended to his magecraft.

Just to make sure that he wasn&#39;t too far off the mark, Kun Wu flexed his circuits again, and felt nothing. Yep. His flame magecraft had been completely sealed.

<em>&#39;I&#39;m glad.&#39;</em> He replied with audible relief in his tone. <em>&#39;And don&#39;t you worry about me. I think we are both aware that defeating Caster wouldn&#39;t get us anywhere to taking Laurent out of the War. He&#39;ll just find a new Servant with a dead Master and contract with them instead. If you can knock him out before Caster knocks me out-&#39;</em>

He paused. A sense of deja vu struck him. Laurent was giving some grand speech? A man who held others beneath him, sparing words for the woman he had once deemed to be utter trash?

As someone who often employed the art of talking nonsense to buy time, Kun Wu heard alarms ring in his head.

<em>&#39;Rider. Finish him off!&#39;</em> His voice rose with sudden urgency. &#39;<em><strong>You of all people should know that nothing good ever follows men who talk too much!</strong></em>&#39;

However, it was too late. Laurent had already released his strongest Magecraft yet with the time that Kun Wu&#39;s probing had bought. A gravitational pull homed in on Rider, dragging her sword away as it threatened to suck her whole. Kun Wu managed to warn her, at the very least.

<em>&quot;I&#39;ll remember that for posterity.&quot;</em> She replied cheekily before Kun Wu felt the connection weaken. Rider&#39;s mind was focused elsewhere and he should most likely follow suit.

&quot;After saying all that, you&#39;re still going to keep going?&quot; Ching muttered in disappointment, watching Laurent do one last ditch attack in order to prove his dedication towards the Holy Grail War. He truly wanted to win, with all of his heart. His eyes disgusted her. Eyes that she had seen in her suitors and former husbands. People who craved power above anything else, to the point it affected their perception of people. She had no doubt that Laurent saw himself in her, while they could not be any more different.

The fact that was he was so focused on her wish and comparing it to his own was what offended her the most.

&quot;My wish is for you to shut up.&quot; Ching replied, raising an arm as she punched the vortex in front of her. She was trying to brute force a gravitational pull? Insanity at its finest. Yet she made it work, as the power behind her fist was firm and strong enough to obliterate Laurent&#39;s Magecraft.

Not without great effort, of course, as Laurent would notice ripped off flesh and the noise of broken bones around her left arm. She had done all that without a single grunt of pain.</span>

Ching Shih lunged forward, grabbing him by the neck while her anchor still coiled around him. Her fingers dug at his flesh, threatening to snuff his life out.

&quot;You think you own an empire? You think that winning here will give you satisfaction? Delphi is but a dot on the map compared to my life. I owned the seas. I owned Macau. Even after my empire had long ended, I lived a far richer life than yours.&quot; She snarled in his face while ghoulish apparitions from her chains kept dragging Laurent down.

&quot;Yet I was empty. I had all the gold and power one could wish for, but life was as dull as sand. I struggled to even find the desire to breathe. But here, I finally found my dream.&quot; 

<strong>&quot;There is no wish here that could surpass what I have now.</strong> Not even a Holy Grail could beat it.&quot; She triumphantly declared, releasing her hold on Laurent as she instead tossed him forward with all of her strength. He crashed into a building wall, shattering the glass as he found himself dangling from a window, trying his best to avoid plummetting to the ground due to Ching&#39;s anchor. They were around 20 stories high, so a fall from that height would hurt for sure.

Surprisingly, Ching didn&#39;t pursue him further. She remained at Shangri-La, almost as if she had a realization. Someone like Laurent was not worth her time.

Instead, she turned around, trying to catch any sight of Kun Wu in the distance. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

If he had to make a wager, Laurent had just about finished his tirade, as well as whatever hidden tricks he had prepared against Ching Shih. Ching Shih wasn&#39;t this patient before. Did being with him raise her tolerance with nonsense? 

Somehow, he felt responsible. 

A dull rumbling in the distance followed the momentary silence. Kun Wu sat up with a grunt, just in time to see two figures clash against each other on top of Shangri-La.

Kun Wu felt violent urges stir up inside of him. Rider was right. Seeing her naked form on display in front of another person made him want to commit violent acts. He should call her back, and give her his coat-

<em>&#39;Ah! Kun Wu, tell you Servant to have some decency!&#39;</em>

His head whipped around just in time to catch sight of Caster rising from the ground as well. It seemed that both of them had taken their sweet time recovering from the shock of the blast, though the philosopher was in a decidedly worse state, not having had the foresight to fireproof his clothes much like the rest of the group. Though his status as a Servant preseved his life, his clothes were barely enough to cover him...

Yet he still had the gall to accuse <em>his</em> Servant of public indecency!

Kun Wu felt his blood boil.

<strong>&#39;AIYAH! THEN JUST DON&#39;T LOOK, YOU PERV!!!&#39;</strong>

He ripped off his coat and flung it over Nietzsche&#39;s head, shutting out his view of Ching Shih, his glorious human experiment Laurent, as well as his surroundings. He then lunged at Nietzsche, not even caring that they were a Servant and he was not, or that they had a whole spellbook at their disposal while his magecraft had been sealed. It didn&#39;t matter in the slightest, because the only thought on his mind was that he must not let anyone gaze upon his Servant.

I haven&#39;t attempted to kill your Master once since my ascent. Others will not be so generous!</strong>&quot;

Laurent struggled against the chains, which rattled and groaned at having magical energy drained from them with Laurent&#39;s Singularity. If he used it again with intent, it was likely that the chains would shatter against his enhanced strength.

&quot;<strong>Olympia needs this victory! Persepolis&#39;s resources could push both it and my company into something more than a mere dot on a map. Delphi will not be forgotten!</strong>&quot; Laurent continued to struggle, thinking over measures and countermeasures and countercountermeasures. Friedrich had to hurry up. If there was no leverage in this fight, it would return to brutal warfare, until one side simply imploded. Kun Wu was prone to self-destruction, but that did not matter if Laurent and Friedrich were caught up in the crossfire.

&quot;<strong>I need this victory. I cannot change. If you continue to insist upon making my life miserable, something you are <em>very</em> good at, then go. According to you, ruling will make my life miserable as a result.</strong>&quot; Laurent chuckled in the face of Ching&#39;s past life. &quot;<strong>That just means you weren&#39;t capable of handling the crown. Your life seems just like the one I want.</strong>&quot;

He needed this. The desire for domination was a continuous screech in his ears. The reason had almost been forgotten, but Ching&#39;s life made him recall that he was as empty now as she was during ruling.

Since his wife...

Laurent could not change. Friedrich&#39;s ideals had been cemented within him. Change could result in an alteration of the Noble Phantasm, leaving him weak and powerless. Despite all his flaws, despite being a disgusting person:</span>

Once he controlled Olympia and Delphi, everything would be all right. Friedrich would be satisfied, his daughter could come back, and the void would be sated.

But what if it didn&#39;t?

It had to. There was no other choice.

However, one thing was clear. Laurent MacKenzie was beyond salvation, and Ching&#39;s words wouldn&#39;t change his path. His obsession and will were as ironclad as a hero of old. Despite that, he had become twisted. He had been one of the greatest chosen Masters, next to likes of Kingsmade, but he had collapsed inward. Perhaps that was what Friedrich had been looking forward to see.

Ching, using her superhuman strength, flung Laurent towards a building, before leaving him dangling.

&quot;<strong>If you want to keep the &#39;happiness&#39; you&#39;ve gained, then run, Madame Ching!</strong>&quot; Laurent taunted as another singularity appeared in his palm, causing the chains to blur. &quot;<strong>Run like the wind!</strong>&quot;

Now then, this chain had dredged up too many memories. It was time to formally deal with it. Unfortunately, &quot;dealing with it&quot; meant struggling against it until he could find a way to shatter its chains. Yeah, good luck with that.</span>

&quot;<strong>Ah, he&#39;s going to tackle a Servant? That takes guts. Do you think he&#39;d do it against a Saber, or a Berserker, perhaps?</strong>&quot; Laurent sneered as Lark&#39;s ghost tore into his arm. &quot;<strong>Friedrich, lower your center of gravity! Catch him like a grounder! Aim for the neck!</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>You know, it&#39;s funny. I can&#39;t help but respect the both of you. The fact that you haven&#39;t exploded due to his arrogance is amusing, plus your help with dealing with Saber. Of course, if you surrender, skip town, and I never have to see you again, I can make it very worth your while. Maybe I&#39;ll even put a statue or two in Delphi in your honor.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, voice underlined with pain. His mouth moved quickly, attempting to say as much as possible before he was formally shut up. &quot;<strong>In Persepolis&#39;s Holy Grail War, only one Master died. I have personally killed two. making me twice as adept as the average Master from that backwater dump. At this rate, I will be three times as adept. Assuming you let me count Kun Wu&#39;s suicide attempt towards my score, of course.</strong>&quot;

Luckily, Laurent was distracted by another mobbing of ghosts, causing him to go silent, yet his eyes never left the battle. He wanted to, HAD to see it. He just had to.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The glorious realization of Nietzsche’s Ubermensch, oh how badly he wanted to witness it. The Philosopher cringed, knowing that he had willingly adverted his eyes from such a glorious sight. He wanted to hear Laurent’s super <s>hero</s> villain-like monologues. Maybe just a peak couldn&#39;t hurt… after all; this was Nietzsche’s greatest work. He wouldn&#39;t just miss it for some nude woman. Yes, Caster had decided; he would look no matter what. Kun Wu, however, had other plans.

“I&#39;m not trying to look, you buffoon!” Nietzsche cried out. Even though he planned on looking back, he hadn&#39;t done so yet. 

Nietzsche recoiled back as Kun Wu’s garb covered his face. What was this sudden darkness he was experiencing? Could this be the work of magecraft? Impossible. Nietzsche had disabled Kun Wu entirely! “What is this trickery!” Nietzsche called out, pulling at the cloth. However, he had realized the contents of his blindfold too late. 

Kun Wu would crash into Nietzsche, making him hit the floor with a thud. The Philosopher let out a deep ‘oof’ the air escaping his lungs. “I don&#39;t want to look at your Servant’s gross body!” Nietzsche retorted by calling Ching’s figure gross. In reality, he thought the opposite; however, compared to the Overman, anything was ugly.

Nietzsche then raised his hand into the air wielding his book <em>Beyond good and evil</em> bringing towards Kun Wu’s face. Caster was determined to see his creation, so swinging his leather-bound book frantically at Kun Wu was his only option.

A small part of his brain wondered why Nietzsche hadn&#39;t grounded him to dust by now, but a strong sense of duty overtook him. He must see to it that no one laid eyes on his Servant. Not over his dead body!

But Nietzsche was determined to win his argument. He continued to wield words as his greatest weapon, this time bringing down the brick-like volume of Beyond Good and Evil on Kun Wu in hopes to crush him under its sheer weight. That ought to hurt. Hard covered books made for fine murder weapons after all!

&#39;So that&#39;s your plan, eh? Lure me in so you can crush me with your Noble Phantasm?&#39; If that was Nietzsche&#39;s plan, then Kun Wu wasn&#39;t going to die without putting up a fight. Instinctively he launched his hand, intercepting Nietzsche by catching his wrist and-

<em>Huh? He caught him?</em>

That surprised him more than anything, and it froze him. Nietzsche&#39;s book came slamming down on him regardless, and Kun Wu felt a sharp pain on the side of his head. Nietzsche raised his book a second time-

But this time, Kun Wu was ready.

With ears ringing and stars dancing in front of his eyes, Kun Wu followed his instincts and lunged at Nietzsche&#39;s arm. He put his entire weight on the philosopher&#39;s arms, aiming to pin it down and wrestle the book from his hand.

&#39;Books are meant to be read!&#39; He educated Nietzsche.

Untrue to Kun Wu&#39;s assumption Nietzsche had no plan after casting his Noble Phantasm. Caster had only wanted to watch Laurent and Kun Wu was getting in the way. 

&quot;Of course books are meant to be read! I didn&#39;t write them to be used on your thick skull!&quot; Nietzsche yelled at Kun Wu his voice full of irritation. 

The Philosopher then held back his head bringing it up towards Kun Wu&#39;s with a smack. The head butt was made in desperation and probably hurt Nietzsche as much as it would hurt Kun Wu. Even though Caster was a servant strength was not his forte. Even in life he had never come across a physical altercation. 

&quot;I have put my entire life into this work. I will not let some brat rob me of it!&quot;

Nietzsche&#39;s forehead connected with Kun Wu&#39;s own, making his brains rattle and seeing more stars than Delphi&#39;s night sky ever had to offer. Unsurprisingly, Kun Wu recoiled from the pain. He arched backwards and gasped in pain, and Nietzsche would be relieved. He could probably shake the boy off him now and finally get back to admiring his handiwork-

&#39;That&#39;s a damn short life you&#39;ve had then!&#39; Kun Wu retorted wildly, grabbing Nietzsche&#39;s arms and pulling himself forward to face the man. Forehead red, eyes shiny, he looked like he was biting back tears. 

&#39;Unfortunately for you, I plan to live to a ripe old age.&#39; He spoked through clenched teeth, the identity of the Servant finally dawning on him through his book. &#39;Older than you. More accomplished than you! You won&#39;t be able to summarize <em>my</em> life with words alone. <strong>And that makes me worthy.</strong>&#39; 

Worthy of <em>her</em>. 

&#39;I know who you are now. Friedrich Nietzsche was never known for having a thick skull. And that&#39;s why you&#39;re so bad at it. But worry not, because I can show you how it&#39;s done. <em>Properly.</em>&#39; 

With that he retaliated, smashing his forehead into Nietzsche&#39;s in an almost sulky display of &quot;I can do it better than you because I have experience and you have not.&quot; Was it going to conk Nietzsche out? Most likely not. But was it satisfying to do regardless? Hell yes.

After all, he lived for the drama.

Nietzsche had no doubts that Kun Wu would go far in life. Nietzsche had designated Kun Wu as a free spirit when they first met and he was rarely wrong about that sort of thing. 

&quot;I&#39;ll have you know fifty five years is a perfectly long time for that a-agh!&quot; Caster closed his eyes wincing in pain. Kun Wu&#39;s skull certainly was as thick as it seemed. 

Caster shook his head around regaining his composure after the blunt force attack. &quot;I did not write for myself, I wrote so future generations could make meaning out of life! To make of life what you the individual wants!&quot; Nietzsche scolded Kun Wu on his aspirations then pulling his head back and once again smashing it into Kun Wu&#39;s. Why did Nietzsche do this? Simple, he couldn&#39;t let some circus clown upstage him.

<strong>&#39;I don&#39;t need a book to teach me what I want.&#39;</strong> Kun Wu bit back at Nietzsche through hazy eyes. &#39;Meaning is what I make of the road under my own two feet. If I can&#39;t walk, I&#39;ll crawl. If I can&#39;t crawl, I&#39;ll use my teeth. And if I can&#39;t chew my way through this life I&#39;ve been given, then I&#39;ll make god damn sure to drag whoever holds me back down with me. You are a smart guy. You should know that some mistakes are meant to be experienced, not learned.&#39; 

Swiftly, he returned the favor, his head swinging back down on Nietzsche&#39;s for another headbutt. Stubbornly and myopically the two proud men continued to fight with their foreheads. It wasn&#39;t the most elegant solution. Certainly not the best way to go about a fistfight, but at this point, neither of them were willing to back down!

Little did she know that both him and Nietzsche were perched on one of the numerous tall buildings that surrounded the CBD.

If she wanted to find them, she would have to start climbing rooftops herself. Before she could commence, however, Laurent made sure to make his presence known as he desperately attempted to fire Magecraft at her to no avail. Instead, he resorted to words to wind her down.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to see that no matter the era, scum like you never change.&quot; Ching replied out loud, not even deigning to look back at Laurent while doing so.

&quot;Keep your crown, then. Let it burn you completely. Tyrants come and go, mister MacKenzie. I&#39;m sure you will experience it first hand.&quot; She scoffed. &quot;But you are right about one thing: <strong>Your two cities have nothing to offer.</strong> Nothing that essential to me, at the very least. I certainly don&#39;t see the point in risking my neck for all of this.&quot; She twirled her finger around, encompassing all of Delphi in her gesture.

The war&#39;s cash prize was alluring, but since when had Ching struggled in terms of finances? She had been blessed with a shrewd Master. One capable of big earnings with just a show or two.

Fame? She had plenty of that, thanks to Kun Wu. It got to the point that her email (which Kun Wu had so graciously setup for her) was constantly being barraged by desperate emails from prospective employers, who thought that she was an actress for hire.

What else could she want really? All she needed to preserve her current status was to protect the one she loved.

Speaking of, she started feeling odd. Embarrassed and heated, despite having grown accustomed to her naked state. It felt more like she was hearing someone else&#39;s invasive thoughts...

...Someone who was currently trying their best to prevent others from even glancing at her current, vulnerable state. Someone very familiar.</span>

&quot;Thank you for the tip.&quot; Ching replied nonchalantly before jumping with all of the strength in her legs, landing on a nearby rooftop. Laurent was now by himself, patiently waiting for his chains to rip apart. It seemed like Ching&#39;s departure had started to gradually weaken them. One chain popped, the rest slowly followed suit.

Ching hopped from building to building, trying to remember where she had left her Master, before hearing more suspicious noises. She chalked it up to invasive thoughts due to their volume, but then realized that it was her Master <em>screaming.</em>

&quot;Milord, are you-&quot; She was about to attempt a telepathic link, before she finally found them: Kun Wu and Nietzsche duking it out, with the boy himself saying some rather interesting things about Ching&#39;s current condition.

She stared at the two in awe, not knowing whether to find it embarassing or endearing. Kun Wu was fighting so valiantly to defend her pride, willing to clash with even a Servant.

Albeit it started to look less like a fight and more like a performance. Ching sighed, almost feeling pity for Laurent. Almost.

&quot;Master?&quot; She jumped down, landing on the rooftop the two were on, just a few feet away from their confrontation. &quot;Did I miss anything?&quot; She asked, still staring at the two with incredulous eyes. It reminded her of children playfighting.

While Ching had descended to assist her Master, she ironically had made it harder for Kun Wu. Perhaps she had grown too used to being naked, since she was casually standing with her beauty in full display. Kun Wu would find it hard to hide her resplendent figure at this rate... <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magnugget</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was little left to do. Ching&#39;s words fell upon deaf ears, obsessed with the idea of victory. Laurent could almost taste it. He did not need to kill Kun Wu, he just needed to remove him from the equation.

As far as Laurent considered, Ching considering the City Grail War to be a waste was good enough for him. She would convince Kun Wu. All Laurent had to do was give a nudge forward.

As Ching hopped away, Laurent fel the pressure the chains were exuding weaken. Finally, a chance to get rid of these ghouls. A vein appeared in the businessman&#39;s face as he strained against the chains.

<strong>Pop! Clatter!</strong>

The chains exploded off Laurent, much to his enjoyment. He flexed a hand, checking to see if it was still functional. Pain. Good. That meant his arm, and his body, were working properly. Laurent lashed himself to the walls of buildings, making his way towards Nietzsche and Kun Wu. He arrived shortly after Ching, only at his Servant&#39;s side.

The fact that Nietzsche had failed to defeat Kun Wu meant little. His Servant had created something spectacular, and had performed admirably up until this point. This misdeed, no matter how annoying, would be excused. The philosopher&#39;s track record had been faultless so far.

Besides, killing Kun Wu would send his Servant into a rage. Could Laurent and Friedrich survive a Ching with nothing to lose?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;<strong>Enough, Friedrich.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, looking down at his Servant. Despite his burns and various injuries, Friedrich finally got to look upon his masterpiece, and it was <em>beautiful</em>, despite the only clothing the man had were smoking silk underwear. &quot;<strong>Don&#39;t waste your time wrestling the brat. You have done well, my philosopher.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>We are leaving. A business deal has been forged, even if isn&#39;t in pen.</strong>&quot; Laurent said, caressing his Servant&#39;s shoulder. &quot;<strong>This fight will end in self-destruction. As enjoyable as it would be to see you two—</strong>&quot; He jerked his head towards Kun Wu and Ching— &quot;<strong>Dead on the pavement, I wouldn&#39;t like to join you.</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>If you were serious about protecting him, Rider, get out of Delphi. Submit a formal resignation or just skip town, I don&#39;t care. Never come back, at least for a while. This city needs to be a wonder if it is be under my thumb, filled with art, wealth, and possibilities. When that happens, it will never bore you, should you elect to return.</strong>

Suddenly, Nietzsche was hoisted to his feet. Gravity. Laurent put a hand to his shoulder, before walking past him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche was just about to return with a headbutt of his own, his attack however, was disturbed by Rider. Nietzsche looked over to the servant asking if they missed anything. His face turned bright red at the baked sight, Caster quickly averting his gaze. Before Nietzsche could even get a word in Laurent was there by his side as well. 

Caster looked around now realizing that his Noble Phantasm had turned off in the middle of his dispute with Kun Wu. That explained how the other two combatants were able to arrive at his side. 

Nietzsche let out a slight &quot;wahh&quot; as he was lifted by Laurents abilities. The feeling of gravity pulling oneself up was bizzare to say the least. Nietzsche gave off a slight nod following his Master. 

&quot;Good luck in your future endeavors Kun Wu, I&#39;m sure the future ahead is bright.&quot; Nietzsche gave Kun Wu a farewell trying to pretend the embarrassing altercation between the two never happened.

&#39;...when did you get here?&#39; 

No. That wasn&#39;t it.

&#39;How long have you been standing there?!&#39; He peeled himself off of Nietzsche and instead attached himself to Rider. Well. He tried his best to shield her well-endowed body from the philosopher, but it wasn&#39;t working so well. His coat had been blown away during the scuffle with Nietzsche; it&#39;d take hours, if not days, to sweep the damaged city streets looking for it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ching was given almost no warning as Kun Wu went from headbutting Caster to lunging at her in a panic. He grappled her, hiding her bosom with his own face while shielding her groin with a pair of legs, tightly wrapped around her own. The lack of a coat had caused him to resort to rather...desperate measures.

Measures that were ridiculous, and especially embarrassing.

<em>&quot;Milord, stop embarrassing yourself. It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m all yours! So stop acting like I&#39;m about to vanish at any second!&quot;</em> She screamed at him telepathically, daring not to do so outloud in front of Nietzsche and Laurent, for her pride would crumble otherwise.

As she attempted to calm her preoccupied Master, Laurent took advantage of the situation and freed himself from his chains. He then approached Nietzsche, telling him to stand down while the two men witnessed the sight in front of them. No comments were given, except for a cryptic warning from Laurent. One that Ching could reluctantly agree with.

&quot;You are lucky that we are in agreement. I could care less about this city, and least of all you. Feel free to splurge and indulge in your fantasies, boy.&quot; She talked down to him, seeing nothing but a childish fantasy in his ideals.

&quot;But you better keep your word. Or my vengeance shall be swift.&quot; She glared at him. The message was clear. If Laurent ever tried to lift a finger against Rider, or even worse, Kun Wu, he would lose more than just Delphi.

&quot;However, keep in mind that I am <strong>not</strong> the one who should sign this treaty.&quot; Ching sighed as she turned back down to Kun Wu, who was still hugging her like a scared animal. 

&quot;Milord, what are your thoughts?&quot; She asked for his opinion. &quot;If you wish to continue, then I&#39;ll follow your dream to its natural end. But be honest with yourself.&quot; There was a tinge of inquisitiveness in her words, as if she were asking Kun Wu to reflect upon his decision carefully. What did he care more about right now? The war, his wish, or something else?</span>

To the point that Rider even felt bad for him and asked him to stop...diplomatically, in his head. She maintained an icy demeanor on the outside, addressing Laurent and Nietzsche with twice the distain.

The battle of words was far from over, but the tension in the air had all but dissipated. Laurent picked up his Servant like a dog on a leash, while Ching fished her Master for an answer. An answer that she wanted to hear from Kun Wu&#39;s mouth, one that she&#39;d been looking for a long time.

Ching Shih looked fatigued; it wasn&#39;t because of the fights. 

<em>&#39;What did he say to you?&#39;</em> Kun Wu shot her a question telepathically. <em>&#39;If it&#39;s anything like before...no. What did you say to him? You seem to have made up your mind already. What do you want to hear from me?&#39;</em>

She flashed him a smile as she hugged him tight. The message was clear.

Descending upon the shipping crate in the middle of the <span class="mention">#market-square</span>. Pressing him into the wall, cruel words on her lips and sharp nails over his neck. Lying bruised and battered in the healing bath. Dragging him around the city collecting riches. Looking at him with pity. With disdain. Mirth. Guilt. Humiliation. Wanting. Passion. 

Rider had never revealed her wish. A greedy woman through and through, she didn&#39;t settle for just a <em>singular</em> wish. Kun Wu understood that part about her. He sided with that part of her. Made it his own. Made it his law. If it was for Ching Shih, then it was for him.

He truly believed that. 

<em>&#39;I want-&#39;</em>

&#39;I want both.&#39; He said quietly. &#39;I want you. To win this War. I want to-&#39; He trailed off, his words sounding thick and distorted in his throat. He swallowed hard.

&#39;I want to make things right for you.&#39; 

<em>It&#39;ll be the first time I did something right.</em>

After all, he had been calm and collected throughout the entire day. She vividly remembered his pragmatic and stoic attitude back during their fight against Saber. Ruthless, even.

Yet, Kun Wu had cracked. It wasn&#39;t due to his age, nor due to his inexperience of naivety, but because he could sense his journey coming to an end. He was at a crossroads and given the option to choose, but he would much rather take everything than leave something behind.

He had started this war with the intention of spreading his techniques far and wide. To make the name of Kun Wu eternal. Something that would be repeated for generations to come. Of course, this mindset lasted until Rider came into the mix.

What was <em>his</em> goal again?

Ching could see it in his eyes. He had changed his original dream, for it no longer suited his ideals. He could not see a future without Rider, and likewise Rider could not see a future without him. They were in agreement, therefore...

&quot;Milord.&quot; She stopped using telepathy, gently caressing the back of Kun Wu&#39;s neck instead. <strong>&quot;If that is what you wanted, then you&#39;ve already achieved my dream.&quot;</strong> She said with utmost sincerity. Kun Wu would feel like crying.

&quot;...Do you want to go home?&quot; Ching then proceeded to ask, sensing his storm of emotions. She would rather not see him be humiliated in front of despicable individuals like Laurent. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

<em>&#39;You&#39;re not just saying that,&#39;</em> he demanded, albeit not so convincingly. <em>&#39;You&#39;re not just telling me what I want to hear.&#39;</em>

He pressed his face into her neck, and Rider felt dampness. Briefly, his shoulders shook. But then he drew a deep breath and bellowed.

<strong>&#39;My coat is gone.&#39;</strong> He said, pulling back from Rider and showering her with a smattering of emotions, for her eyes only. &#39;Caster trashed my coat, and now I don&#39;t have anything for you! I&#39;m no longer in the mood,&#39; he clasped his hand around Rider&#39;s. &#39;We shall go back for a change of clothes.&#39;

He started leading her away, but then glanced back towards the not-so-sharply-dressed men.

&#39;Do tell me when you strike it big with the fortune telling business, Caster.&#39; He said over his shoulder with a nod. &#39;Because for once, you are correct. My future is going to be great, whether you&#39;ll be there to witness it or not.&#39;

And he began to walk. In the opposite direction of the Caster pair, of course! Rider&#39;s beauty was for his eyes only.

&quot;Fine. Your wardrobe is all coats anyway.&quot; Ching teased, enjoying his embrace as she let him take the lead while she followed. She cast a glance at Laurent and Nietzsche behind her, showing no ill intent nor respect either. She was simply acknowledging their existence, as if giving them a good last look before they disappeared from her life completely.

Of course, her Master took this opportunity to brag. She simply laughed and continued on, poking at his shoulder with her elbow.
