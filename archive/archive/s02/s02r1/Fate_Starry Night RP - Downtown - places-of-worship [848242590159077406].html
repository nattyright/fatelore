            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">The Church funded the construction of temples and churches within Olympia, allowing for free worship of any religion still remembered in the world, regardless of its origin or culture. This allowed for the workers to form strong bonds and camaraderie, not only through their tough, demanding work hours, but through their similar beliefs and ideals as well. These places of worship are also considered safe havens, to the point that the small homeless and low class population of Olympia is allowed to take refuge in them if needed.</div>

The room, blinding in its darkness, is saved from the void by the light pulsing from the flickering candles that wreathe smoke from their burning wicks. They curl, coalesce, and then finally, dissipate into the ebbing shadows that faintly dance on a perceivable edge of a known universe that lies within the confines of this small room. Amidst this void, which steadily claims a place in reality thanks to the altar painted in the orange glow of the two candle wicks, a soft brush runs itself against treated wood. Deep purple rolls off of the bristle and slathers the ground in careful geometric shapes, held in the grip of a hand that shares more than a few similarities with the rough stone thanks to its dried age and callused palms. 
Eyes from the portrait on the wool adorned altar stare at the figure painting these careful shapes, trailing along with each careful stroke as muscles ripple and stretch with the gentle artistry. Carefully planned, carefully lain, as if this is not a practiced occasion. The care comes from a desire for perfection, or rather, a fear of mistrial. 
This has to be done right. 
<em>They may not want us talkin’ about it, but honestly, this is our one chance for something different in our lives!</em>
<em>Sure, and they’re gonna willingly let some factory floor workers join a Holy Grail War.</em>
<em>It’s not a grail war, it’s a city war, and it ain’t about allowin’! If we can summon a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. in time, they have no choice but to let us join!</em>
<em>Yea, and where are you gonna get the cash for something like that? Or any of us for that matter? We got enough problems just trying to live comfortably. Nobody complains, but I worry all the time what happens when I’m not useful anymore. You think they’re gonna keep around a worker that’s trying to mess around with somethin’ like this, I’ll be kicked to the curb!</em></span>

“Phew,” a lone sigh of relief adds a presence in the swirl of shadow, the darkness giving way to the concentration of the figure in the center as they look down upon their craftsmanship. A circle, faded slightly from the use of bygone acrylic paint, adorns the floor. While it certainly wasn’t the most beautiful, he smiles softly as he looks to the various shapes woven and finely pasted within. Letters and characters, the same kind that stand out from the portrait on the altar, dance around the edges, within the center, and even expand far outside of the confines of the circle. The teachings of his own masters…his family, the one that smiles back, etch themselves into the practice he has set himself to undertake. A concept foreign to him, but a purpose that he could not refuse. 

<strong>A summoning ritual.</strong></span>

<em>Please…Jampo, will you help us.</em> 

The shuffling of cloth and wool makes way to the crumpling of paper, as Jampo rummages through the folds of his humble swaddling of robes to retrieve a folded up letter, yellowed slightly from age, from its confines. Words scribbled messily in the interior parcel out a form of calling, the chant uttered by the thamaturgical mages from a time long before now; not quite when the world still had countries, but before the nomadic cities were something to grow used to. A chant, one that Jampo slowly mouths as his finger trails behind the verse, collecting a slight dusting across the tip as he relishes the work placed within. 

One of his coworkers had come from a family of mages…not inherently powerful, but they were established in the old world as having a connection with the magecraft associations, one that could grant them a family aria to pass down. As Jampo rises once more, he retreads the words carefully while he rummages through the small space of the inner walls of this Buddhist temple, a place where his peace of mind could concentrate solely, combining spiritual prayer with the duty at hand. His hand rubs against the cool, smooth surface of plastic, interwoven with the new scent of metal work that came with the slight movement of the frame. The S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame.</span>

<em>We all pitched in and managed to get this frame for you. It’s secondhand, but that won’t really matter if you manage to summon a powerful S.E.R.V.A.N.T.</em>

<em>Don’t argue, just take it…and good luck.</em>

Only a slight grunt escapes Jampo as he lifts the frame, his muscles hardly needing to bulge against the weight as he walks back to the circle, the floor of the inner temple creaking slightly from the pressure. Carefully placing the frame in the center, Jampo arranges it in such a way as to prevent any mishaps during the summoning, moving its joints in place, correcting its posture. 15 minutes pass in this fashion, Jampo repeatedly over correcting himself before he feels satisfied enough that the frame would remain in place, the man himself deciding to rest on the floor, legs crossed as he stares at the scene. 

It is almost haunting, seeing an alabaster figure devoid of any signs of life in the midst of thamaturgical symbols, symbols that would grant life to the object in question. Or, perhaps that isn’t the best way to describe it…</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo scratches at his cheek, recalling the little knowledge he has from his old teachings regarding the subject. The Heroic Spirit…it isn’t so much born as much as inhabiting the shell, twisting it into its image. His masters had taught him of the intricacies that the old world paid to these heroic spirits, the old Holy Grail Wars and the bloody conflicts therewithin. Such violence…it was the roadblock that sat heavily in the back of his mind. He wrestled with the idea once he had taken the time to prepare for the ritual, spending most of the time up to the summoning day in prayer and meditation. Once his floor manager had discovered that he would be attempting to summon a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. for the coming war, he was fired on the spot, which was perfectly fine. It gave him more time to reflect on the task at hand…

“I don’t suppose you could have foreseen a student participating in a war such as this,” he says to himself, his voice hushed out of respect for the statue atop the altar as well, the golden Buddha creating a glint that reflects itself in the back of the plastic’s Frame’s surface. Another rustling from Jampo’s robes punctuate the stillness before the clacking of wooden beads creates the steady rhythm of attentiveness. Jampo pulls the beads from his robes, closing his eyes as he rubs them against his palms, his thumb steadily pulling in and counting each bead as he looks inward. 

To create a new world for those that desire it…Jampo will descend into the depths of the realms of Hell.</span>

Reaching to his right, Jampo grips a steaming porcelain saucer. The scent of tea reaches his aged nostrils as he pulls it close, his mouth clamoring for a taste as he gently blows at the curling steam before taking a deep draught.

The gates have closed. 

His neck stiffens slightly, his free hand twisting into a gesture of tranquility as the air around him shimmers. A force expels itself, gently, overtaking the inner sanctuary of the temple, below ground so as to prevent any interference. His mana…his Qi. And with a shuddering breath, he begins. 

<em>”Silver and steel be the essence.</em>
<em>Stone and Earth is the foundation.</em>
<em>Let the colour I pay tribute to, the dharma, be the path that guides you.</em>
<em>My fate shall be your sword.</em> 
<em>My blood shall be your binding.</em>

<em>Or guide us through the Joyless Realms as we travel through them.</em> 
<em>I swear this oath to you here.</em> 
<em>Attended by these words of wisdom,</em>
<em>Break the cycle of restraint and come forth!”</em>

The air shimmers. The light flickers. 

<strong>Power emanates.</strong>

Crackles of electricity surge through the sanctuary, thin purple whisps licking at the form of Jampo as he sits unflinchingly through the maelstrom, focusing intently on guiding the shape from the faltering Throne. 

<em>Heed my voice. Follow my prayer.</em></span>

As the smoke begins to clear, Jampo can see a figure standing in the summoning circle. They take in a deep breathe and slowly exhale.

&quot;Well now.&quot; A gruff male voice emanates from the smoke. &quot;What an interesting time I find myself in.&quot;

The smoke begins to part and Jampo gets a clearer look at the being in the circle. They are an older gentleman wearing a suit of intricately engraved copper armor in the style of a European knight. He has the air of nobility about him and stands proudly in the circle before Jampo. From his attire and sword, Jampo could come to the conclusion that he had summoned Saber, the most powerful class in the Holy Grail War. However, the servant before Jampo was much weaker than one would expect of the Saber class. He could feel the lackluster power from the Servant.

The Servant then looks at his surroundings, hand to his chin as if in deep pondering or observation. After a while with a bit of muttering to himself, the Servant looks somewhat satisfied.

&quot;Yes, this location will do.&quot; The Servant then turns his attention to Jampo and stands over him, hands behind his back.

&quot;Tell me Monk, are you the one who has summoned me?&quot; The Servant cordially asked Jampo. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

His robes whip around him, all the while he holds his face high to welcome the Heroic Spirit into his fold. 

The explosion subsides as the monk takes a breath, silently grateful that he could relax his posture against the influx sensations, peeking from one eye to gander at the potential success of his summoning...

<em>&quot;Well now, what an interesting time I find myself in...&quot;</em>

The knight&#39;s copper armor reflects the light of the candles, giving the effect of radiance as the he stands tall amidst the inner sanctuary of the temple. It was enough to illuminate the inner sanctum completely, revealing the tapestries that hung from the walls and the instruments of prayer collecting dust among the shelves of the inner walls, from Dorje&#39;s to bells to ward off the evil spirits that might recoil at the holy orders found within. Jampo might consider it poetic were he not a bit more knowledgeable on the nature of Heroic Spirits in general, and the purpose by which this chance meeting is occurring...

&quot;Ooooh, how lucky. I may not know much, but I believe...you are of the class Saber? Heheheheheh, that is quite fortuitous, quite fortuitous...&quot; Jampo says, though even he can&#39;t help but ponder at the mana output from this figure. From what his masters told him and what his coworkers were so keen to divulge, to summon the Saber class put one in the most advantageous of positions. Spirits of this cast manifest themselves into powerful S.E.R.V.A.N.T.S., capable of immense demonstrations of ability and strength...

But to say this figure was...disappointing...well, such a thing might be a tad rude to bring up. One can&#39;t balk at the help one is given.</span>

&quot;Hmm...Yes, I am the one who summoned you, Saber. Quite fortunate I did not find myself in the company of a Berserker...but, these are but musings. Come, take a seat. We must discuss a few things before we begin this partnership.&quot; 

Rather than a chair, the figure would find nothing but the mat on which Jampo himself now sat, cross-legged. Closer examination might find that there was not much in the space between them, naught except for a pot of tea and two cups. One obviously for him.

&quot;Come, come; the best of conversation is made over tea, as well as that of understanding between people. As I have said, I have a few things to discuss with you, primarily to discern whether or not we are compatible with each other.&quot; Jampo takes a sip from his cup, breathing in deeply the herbal fragrance before letting out a sigh of contentment, seeming secure enough in this spirit&#39;s presence to lower his projection of Qi...slightly. 

&quot;I wish to know who I&#39;m aligning myself with, Saber. Their goals, their passions...how they calm themselves, and what breaks them from such calm. Of course, this means I require a true name. I understand it&#39;s something to keep secret, but if I am to be a Master and you a Servant, we must not have barriers between us...transparency into the heart is key for such fated partnerships.&quot;</span>

Behind the cup, Brandin began to size up his Master. His cooperation was absolutely necessary if Bradin was going to reclaim his glory. He was definitely different from a normal Magus, having initiated this kind of negotiation instead of treating him as a mere tool. But Brandin was no stranger to these types of talks. 

&quot;I am Brandin, Lord of Dolorous Gard.&quot; The Servant introduced himself. &quot;But I&#39;d prefer it if you would refer to me as Saber from now on.&quot;

&quot;While we are on the subject of transparency, I would like to know who you are. You don&#39;t strike me as the typical Magus and you must have an important reason to...subject yourself to this war.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Mmmm, Brandin, eh? You have the regality that your armor would infer, so I&#39;ll take your word as a Lord. Well, welcome to the new age, Brandin, hehehehehe,&quot; Jampo says as he chuckles lightly, taking another sip before pouring another cup for himself. Steam wafts from the tip of the spout, bringing with it a fresh wave of herbal scent along with the pouring of the tea. Jampo swirls the beverage before taking another tentative sip, burning his lips enough to quickly pull the cup away before setting it down, fanning his tongue before turning back to Brandin. 

He rubs his chin thoughtfully at the question, realizing in a way this might be diversionary tactic by his Servant to avoid discussing himself too in-depth. Many Servants might play their cards close to their chest; it shouldn&#39;t be too unexpected. The monk decides to play along, smiling wryly as he gazes into Brandin&#39;s eyes, catching the Lord&#39;s sight within his own. 

&quot;Ooooh, you wish to know about me, eh? I suppose it&#39;s only fair, Brandin...or Saber, I should say. Don&#39;t worry, I know how to hang on to a secret. I&#39;m old, not naive. Well now...

&quot;I am Jampo. A lowly monk, as you&#39;ve surmised. Although I don&#39;t teach, and I won&#39;t insult you by trying to teach. That might just embarrass the both of us, wouldn&#39;t you think? Hehehehe,&quot; He says, chuckling once more, a bit too deeply as he lightly pounds on his chest, clearing his throat before taking another sip of tea to calm his nerves. The palms of his hands twitch slightly, and he grips his beads a bit tighter before relaxing his posture once more and continuing. &quot;At any rate...my life story isn&#39;t important, at least not for now. We&#39;ll have plenty of time to learn more about each other, Brandin, but it&#39;s important now just to state what I&#39;m fighting for...&quot; 

Jampo sighs inward, closing his eyes once more as he ruminates over the best means of explaining. After all, it wouldn&#39;t be an easy topic to broach...it would require opening the doors slightly...</span>

&quot;This city is one built on excess.&quot; He starts, tone hardening as he reflects on his past years working amongst the lower classes of Olympia, witnessing the disparity that levels itself thanks to the single driving force of the nomadic city: money. &quot;I have seen what excess does, and it tears my soul to watch others subjected to its whims by others. I wish none ill will, but I can&#39;t bear to see needless suffering disguised as contentment and freedom...&quot; 

He shifts slightly, stretching his body and flexing the exposed muscles on his body to prepare himself for what comes next, already picturing the gates inside opening slightly, beckoning to the thing that lies on the other side. &quot;I was asked to participate, Brandin. Not by aristocrats, or a leader, or out of some divine duty. I was asked by my co-workers...none had the chance to try and participate, and with the level of magis likely participating, they wouldn&#39;t be able to stand against whatever comes. I enter this war not for myself, but for them...for you see, Brandin, this is not a Holy Grail War. This is a war based on human indecency and ignorance...a chance to feed that excess that spills from both cities. I do this to grant a wish for those that have no means to even dare to wish.&quot; 

The silence between both sits heavily, Jampo&#39;s brow darkening as he reaches once more for his cup, taking another draught. Steadily, the air around him changes; what was once a light shimmer stretches like skeletal fingers as they warp the shadows and tapestries around him. A screen of power emanates and obfuscates the imagery, surrounding both as an aura materializes around the monk. His features sharpen as his eyes level on Brandin once more, any semblance of the kindness from before shifting away.</span>

&quot;As I said, Brandin: I&#39;m old, not naive. I know there are Servants on the throne that have no use for benevolent aspirations. There are Servants that would tread on others for their own interests. And therefore, I need to know what you aim to do in this war...for if it would trample on my goal and the wish of those that need it most...

<strong>&quot;I will destroy you here and now.&quot;</strong>

The aura seems to wave violently around Jampo now, a demonstration of strength that would pose a threat to one such as Brandin considering his weaker stature. But more than that, this was the words not of a monk giving alms to the weak. This was a promise by a man of utmost principle. There was no mistaking it: he would destroy Brandin if his next words were not the correct ones.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Brandin&#39;s small smile turns dour as Jampo&#39;s explanations turn to threats. He slowly picks up his cup and finishes his drink.

So, Jampo was one of those types of people. This relationship was going to be troublesome in the long run, but that was problem to be dealt with later. All Brandin had to do was convince Jampo to keep him around long enough to start constructing Dolorous Gard.

Brandin puts down his cup and sighs.

&quot;Must we engage to such unpleasantries so early in our relationship?&quot; Brandin said in a dour tone. &quot;Tell me, do you resort to such barbaric tactics because you believe me to be weak? It&#39;s alright if you do, it is plain to see by anyone with any sort of magical talent. I have no doubt that you have a good chance at defeating me in my current state. However, I have more than a few tricks at my disposal.&quot;

Brandin then motions to his body.

&quot;Take for example this...what do you call it...S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame. Quite a remarkable piece of mystic code. Allowing for the summoning, albeit limited, of heroic spirits even while the magic of this world is in such a state. The frame you used to summon me however isn&#39;t in the best condition is it? You yourself admitted to joining this war purely &#39;pro-bono&#39; which means that you have no significant backing. It would be a simple matter for me to destroy this frame beyond repair. I&#39;d imagine it wasn&#39;t simple for you to obtain this was it?

Brandin tinged the last with the same aggression that Jampo showed him before returning to a more calm and cordial tone.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;But this exchange of threats gets us nowhere. I would retire from this war before it even started and you would have the unenviable task of trying to obtain another Servant on such short notice. Why bother with that when we both stand to benefit from a mutual relationship? You see Master Jampo, I want to reestablish the glory of my once great keep, Dolorous Gard. You want to help the common folk and put the unruly nobles of this land in check? Then our goals easily align. I can offer you what few other Servants can against the upper levels of society, leverage.&quot;

&quot;You see, when such greed runs rampant in the upper levels of society it usually ends in one of two ways. Appeasement, in which the upper class acquiesce some trifle to the masses to appease them while maintaining their grip. Or Rebellion, which is incredibly messy and inevitably results in the same system but with new faces in charge. I can offer something even better, a seat at the negotiating table. I can offer a power that the nobles of this land won&#39;t be able to ignore. You would be able to make demands for the common folk of this land and act as a force to keep the greed of the nobles in check.&quot;

Brandin gives a sly smile as he takes the teapot and refills both his and Jampo&#39;s cups.

&quot;You help me establish Dolorous Gard and my power base, and in return I will use that power to assist you in your philanthropic endeavors. Are these terms agreeable to you Master Jampo?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo listens quietly and intently, easing back the flow of Qi as he takes in Brandin&#39;s proposal. True, the destruction of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame would put him in a tight spot, especially after his co-workers went to such trouble to scrounge enough for it. He might put himself in a further bind if he were to allow Brandin to destroy it in such a way. He supposes that&#39;s simply the nature of summoning a Heroic Spirit, even in such a limited capacity; these were bonds that were made permanent, for better or worse. 

&quot;Hmmm, my my, Brandin. I suppose it&#39;s not unexpected to have such negotiation from a lord such as yourself. Hehehehehe, even in the face of such power you stand firm; I&#39;m quite fortuitous indeed.&quot; Jampo says, joviality returning as he drinks from his cup once more, his aura pulling back fully into himself. Straightening, he looks back to his servant with a measured warmth, extending his hand out for a proper combining of strength. 

&quot;I suppose the wisest move to make would be to align with an aristocrat; if you should help in the negotiation process, I will do my best to reconstruct your Dolorous Gard, as you call it. A monetary wish is still a wish, but frankly I wouldn&#39;t begin to know what to ask for. I suppose until this war is over, I&#39;ll be helping you to achieve victory, Brandin.&quot; 

Jampo&#39;s smile broadens as he looks about the temple, taking in the rich woven tapestries and sights once more before turning back to his servant. 

&quot;I suppose now I should quit my teasing, Saber. So, tell me, how do we begin constructing your Dolorous Gard? I may have the strength, but if it&#39;s only the two of us, the labor might be quite intensive and time consuming.&quot; Once his good side was shown, Jampo&#39;s posture and demeanor overall betrays the power that he was hefting only moments prior. One might even forget in that time just how much he was harboring within...at least if one were foolish.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo scratches thoughtfully as he surveys the inner workings of the sanctuary. It was a fine temple, to be sure, but it wasn&#39;t something that might fit the description. His masters had taught him about the conduits of the Earth itself, the Mana that, while not as prevalent due to the dwindling of mystery, was still very much alive in the world. The western world dictated this through leylines, while Jampo knew it better as...

&quot;Ah, I believe I can help with that. European magecraft has honed their Aura to create amazing miracles through the expelling of their mana. Of course, where I come from, mana goes by another name, Saber. Life Energy, that not only do I possess, but the planet does as well...&quot; Jampo says, standing before Brandin before leveling his arms before him. 

The old man breathes deeply, his chest expanding as once more, his Aura expels around him in a field, encompassing Brandin himself and bathing him in a warmth similar to a sunbeam caressing his cheek. 

&quot;Eastern Magecraft focuses on transmuting that aura, using it in conjunction with ourselves and the world around us. We shape it, mold it, and feel with it. 

&quot;<em>Qi.</em> This is what we denote it, though this also simply means we have different uses for mana...such as discerning the Lung Mei lines,&quot; he states, gazing at the floor. For Brandin, it was as if the monk was simply staring at a (slightly dusty) floor, but for Jampo, a thin white line flowed from their position, ebbing like a tide in a river as it flowed away from the temple...

&quot;It appears this spot will not do for your needs, Saber. However, I believe I know one such location that will suit us both; I had a suspicion, but you can never be too sure, especially when your senses aren&#39;t quite what they used to be, hoohohoho,&quot; the old man chuckles as he walks to the stairs leading outside. The breeze from the crack below the entrance door beckons him, his approach to outside making the white line flourish as he treks closer to nature.</span>

&quot;We have a bit of a walk ahead of us, Saber; it might do good to catch up and ask anything else. I have all I need to know from you, though I&#39;m sure your side of the interview isn&#39;t over, hehehehehe.&quot;</span>

Sadly, I never had the time to investigate further into their practices.&quot; Saber responded as he followed Jampo. As he observes his Master, he thinks back to the violent aura that leaked from the Monk not moments before. &quot;I am a bit intrigued in your display of power back then. I only caught a glimpse, but the well of power you hold is enough to give even the most formidable Servant a second guess. Is it related to the Qi of which you speak?&quot;  <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span></span>

Jampo grows silent as he follows the trail, the wisp overtaking and tangling amidst a series of blue lines, showing a constant ebb and flow across the ground. 

Sunlight bathes over both as Jampo slides the entrance open, both Master and Servant basking in the glow of an evening sunset, the purple blanket of twilight approaching. 

&quot;Hmm, we should continue this way,&quot; Jampo says, shorter as he turns his attention back to the Lung Mei line, breathing steadily to maintain his composure. 

&quot;...I suppose there is still some honesty that much be broached, Saber. Qi only denotes a different manner of conceiving mana and magecraft....emotional stress and states contribute to the effectiveness of certain spells and magecraft. The same is for the practice of Qi...&quot; 

Jampo pauses, the two having already trailed far enough from the temple that they were surrounded by flora. Trees blocked out the last vestiges of light from the trail, yet the monk still knew where to go. Saber himself might even notice the various stone statues dotting the forest. Some denoted small houses or nooks, while others showed various figures that stood watching over the two of them. 

&quot;If one has a dark heart, Saber, then their Qi reflects this. This is true for all mages...but especially for myself.&quot; Jampo whispers, his voice hoarse as he grabs at his chest. The heat near his heart fluctuated, ever so slightly, enough for pause before he continued on his path. 

&quot;I call it Ashura. It...it&#39;s a part of me, no matter how much I wish it were not. It happens whenever I open the gates inside, Saber. It unleashes something uncontrollable...&quot; 

Jampo quiets himself as they continue, not wishing to loose himself too deeply to the memories that enforce that uncontrollable nature...</span>

&quot;It&#39;s not far now, Saber. It should be a square structure, much larger than the last temple. If you&#39;d like to scout ahead, it&#39;s in that direction,&quot; the monk says as he points north west, the forest not denoting any one path. &quot;I shall be along shortly, but the temple rests comfortably between the positive and negative forces denoted by the Lung Mei lines. It should suit the needs for your Dolorous Gard.&quot;</span>
