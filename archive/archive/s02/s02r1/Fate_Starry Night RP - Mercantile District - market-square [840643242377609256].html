            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A busy marketplace that could rival even the largest shopping center in the CBD. Made up of alleys lined with stalls and traffic that spreads in all directions regardless of where one is coming from, it&#39;s incredibly easy, but not totally unpleasant, to get lost within the market square. Fresh produce is the market square&#39;s biggest draw. Not only does Delphi source directly from its own indoor farms, it also uses its favors to strike up deals with farming-oriented cities for a variety of imports. Small businesses also set up shop here due to the cheaper rent and sell all kinds of exotic, handmade goods. It&#39;s not a stretch to say that the market square almost resembles the market in the Old World.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Shadows stretched as the sun began to sink, but the market square was bustling as ever as the evening rush hour quickly approached. Locals started filling the narrow streets as they browsed produce to bring home after a lengthy day of work, while shop owners yelled over each other&#39;s voice, racing against time for that last wave of customers before the curfew kicked in. 

The market was loud. It was frenetic. It was an utter <em>war zone</em>.

<strong>ROAR!!!</strong>

Flames leapt up at an intersection without a moment&#39;s notice, tinging the sky an even deeper shade of orange as heat radiated from the fiery shapes. Alarm glazed the tourists&#39; faces as they dropped what they were doing to back away from the site of the fire, but when it was clear that the flames had no intention of spreading beyond the intersection, curiosity got the better of them and they started approaching it, trying to see which unlucky shop owner had set fire to their wares.

Meanwhile, a collective sigh could be heard from the nearby shop owners, while the locals shared a knowing look that clearly meant &#39;<em>oh boy...</em>&#39;

&#39;<em>...here we go again.</em>&#39;

&#39;<strong>WAH HAH HAH! THAT&#39;S IT! TAKE A STEP BACK OR THREE IF YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO GET HURT!</strong>&#39;

A villainous(?) laugh permeated the air. A shadow emerged from the heart of the flames, clad in dark robes and a brilliant blue coat with a fluffy white collar. The coat was tattered, but tastefully so, almost as if it had been slashed deliberately to add that extra flair. 

Dark hair fluttered wildly as the wind surged from the sudden rise in ambient temperature, revealing a youthful face brimming with confidence. Flames surrounded the youth, yet wouldn&#39;t leave a single scorch mark on his clothes as he stopped to survey his surroundings.

<em>Mm! Not a bad haul!</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The youth was pleased with the crowd that had begun to gather around him: not only had he managed to attract curious onlookers from multiple venues, the road was now jammed enough that even the locals were getting roped into his antics.

Of course, causing a traffic jam was not his sole intention. Now that he had generated an audience, it would only be rude to keep holding them up without putting on a good show.

The youth unsheathed an ornate folding fan from his side and shook it open with a flourish.

Behind him, the once unruly flame seized up, then rose into a blazing pillar as the youth brought the fan over his head in one swift motion. Predictably, the onlookers raised their heads to goggle at the spectacle. A mischievous grin spread across the youth&#39;s face; he held his pose for but a fraction of a second, then brought the fan down in one huge swing.

The pillar of flames came crashing down with his motion. Panic ensued as the uninitiated tourists screamed and scrambled to get out-

-but then from the head of the pillar burst forth an oriental dragon, bright blue scales shimmering in the light as it flew over the crowd and lazily circled above them. The flames subsided as well, dispersing into wisps of smoke long before they could reach their audience, leaving behind nothing but a gentle warmth much like the afternoon sun.

Was that all...a stunt?

As the crowd recollected themselves, a few of them felt brave enough and reached out to touch the dragon. But every single time, the cunning creature would lift itself just high enough to be out of arm&#39;s reach, instead teasing them with an occasional swipe of the tail. Meanwhile, the youth weaved his fan through the air in tightly choreographed motions, generating bursts of flames with each flick of the wrist whenever the dragon circled back to him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Soon, the intersection was back to a scorching mess. Yet whenever the flames came dangerously close to the crowd, the heat would fade in a flash and leave behind nothing but a warm breeze.

It didn&#39;t take long for the crowd to catch on. What they had been witnessing was not a prank but a performance, and an exquisite one at that. The youth seized the momentum and retreated a few steps into the center of his makeshift &#39;stage&#39;, where a human-sized wooden crate had revealed itself ever since his first stunt. The youth climbed up the crate to gain some height advantage, then, as all eyes were on him, brought his hands together for a single clap.

&#39;Ahem, ahem.&#39; He coughed meaningfully and kept up the clapping motion, until his audience finally realized that that was the end of the performance and started showering him with cheers. 

The youth was clearly enjoying this. He beamed at the crowd and bowed once in each direction. Then, right as the cheering reached its peak, raised his hands and motioned for people to stop.

&#39;THANK YOU, THANK YOU!&#39; He yelled, giddy from the atmosphere. &#39;Those of you who know me, I hope I&#39;ve met your expectations! Those of you who don&#39;t, I hope to see your faces here next week as well. Same time, same place!&#39;

&#39;Now, normally, I would charge a fee for the show. But today is a special day. It&#39;s so special that I&#39;m giving it to you for free out of the generosity of my heart. And why is that, you may wonder?&#39;

He paused for dramatic effect.

&#39;<strong>Because I, Kun Wu, summoning specialist and Feng Shui master, am going to try my hands at performing a Heroic Spirit summoning ritual for the City Grail War!</strong>&#39;

With nimble footwork, the youth named Kun Wu hooked one foot to a latch on the side of the crate and kicked the lid open. He reached down and dragged a pristine, humanoid chassis out of the cushioning foam. 

It was a brand new S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Right here, right now, I want you all to bear witness to the legendary moment where the victor of the City Grail War summons his very first Servant.&#39; 

Kun Wu brought out his fan once again. As if on cue, the small dragon ceased its mindless wandering and flew back towards its owner. It circled above the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, chasing its tail like an ouroboros while Kun Wu dragged his folding fan through a series of circular motions. It wasn&#39;t long until people noticed that the dragon was steadily growing in size. Its body stretched and stretched until it resembled less a dragon than a glowing blue ring.

The street performer was turning his familiar into a summoning array. He was actually going to summon a Servant in broad daylight!

&#39;Get back...!&#39; 

&#39;Doesn&#39;t he need a catalyst?&#39;

&#39;Maybe he doesn&#39;t have one?&#39;

&#39;Maybe he doesn&#39;t need one?&#39;

...

Kun Wu&#39;s sharp ears were quick to pick up the rampant gossip around him. This was <em>exactly</em> the kind of reaction he was going after. The youth bit back a smug grin, then worked glyph after glyph into the dragon-turned-summoning-array with record-breaking speed and precision, generating some <em>ooh&#39;s</em> and <em>aah&#39;s</em> from the crowd for the novelty of transforming a familiar into a summoning array. He then lowered the array onto the ground and carefully laid the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame down in the center.

With the prep work done, Kun Wu straightened up and took his sweet time stretching as curious onlookers craned their necks, trying to get a better look at the summoning array. 

It wasn&#39;t exactly hard to obtain a copy of the array in this day and age, but to see one on such blatant display, in the middle of a common market no less, was an act that felt incredibly sacrilegious. So much so, that by the time Kun Wu finished his stretches, the air was practically dripping with anticipation and the crowd had almost doubled in size.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Cameras flashed, video cameras rolled. Kun Wu kneaded his face into that of a solemn magus who was about to perform a grand ritual, but a few seconds later his mask was broken, as the youth was barely able to contain his excitement.

&#39;Alright, here I go-back up a bit more, you guys!&#39; He flapped his arms at the eager crowd. &#39;I don&#39;t actually want to see you getting hurt if I mange to summon a really powerful Spirit, okay?&#39; 

&#39;Who are you kidding? You don&#39;t even have a catalyst!&#39;

&#39;Of course I do! It&#39;s right here!&#39; Kun Wu thumbed himself in the chest, grinning like an idiot. &#39;You&#39;ve already got <em>me</em> as the summoner, what more is there to ask?&#39;

The crowd responded with a mixture of laughter and cheering. Kun Wu bowed one last time and finally, swiftly, spun around to face the summoning circle.

The voices behind him faded into an incomprehensible buzz. It was now just him, the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, and the faintly glowing array.

&#39;<em>Silver and iron to the origin.</em>&#39;

<em>Shit. Was that too quiet? There&#39;re people recording back there, they couldn&#39;t possibly have gotten that, could they?</em>

Kun Wu cleared his throat and tried again.

&#39;<strong>Silver and iron to the origin.</strong>&#39;

<em>Perfect.</em>

&#39;<strong>Stone and the archduke of contracts to the cornerstone. The ancestor is my great great grandfather Kun Cheng...</strong>&#39;

The air grew stagnant with each verse uttered, laden with a heavy fragrance that blanketed even the most delicious smelling food stalls. The crowd grew restless with unease. Even the commoners could feel that something was terribly, terribly off.

So this is what a summoning ritual feels like...?

A few bystanders were starting to get cold feet.

Yet Kun Wu proceeded in a loud, clear voice, seemingly unaffected by the strange phenomenon.

&#39;<strong>Shut (fill).</strong>&#39;

The fragrance grew stronger.

&#39;<strong>Shut (fill).</strong>&#39;

And stronger still.

&#39;<strong>Shut (fill).</strong>&#39;

It was sickly sweet.

&#39;<strong>Shut (fill).</strong>&#39;

Nauseating.

&#39;<strong>Shut (fill).</strong>&#39;

Suffocating.

The summoning circle crackled to life. Electric blue sparks danced along each stroke, rife with mana and causing mana-rich currents to fly off in every direction. 

&#39;<strong>I am the one who lays out all the evil of the world of the dead.</strong>&#39;

Kun Wu raised a hand to shield his face from the stray sparks, which was becoming more erratic as his incantation neared its completion.

Then the array burst into flames.

And kept expanding.

And expanding.

Feeding on atmospheric mana. Feeding on Kun Wu&#39;s mana. Growing and setting the wooden crate alight.

It was nothing like the harmless flames Kun Wu had produced, but full on malice, the heat threatening to reduce him to a cinder. A ritual gone wrong, or a normal occurrence? Kun Wu hadn&#39;t the time nor the experience to analyze the situation. What he did know, however, was that he was not one to leave a job half-assed. 

Especially not in front of a crowd.

&#39;<strong>You, seven heavens clad in three words of power, arrive from the ring of deterrence, O keeper of the balance--!</strong>&#39;

The youth unsheathed his folding fan for the third time of the day, driving the flames back with practiced swings as he spat out the rest of the incantation. Did he summon a monster? He had already prepared an excuse for when the summoning ritual spat out chump change for a Servant at his lack of a summoning catalyst. What if he had actually managed to summon some fiery beast from hell?!

Kun Wu felt an immense headache coming.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To say that Kun Wu had bitten more off than he could chew would be an understatement. A Servant&#39;s summoning was a sacred ritual, one that Masters were sworn to complete in utmost secrecy. This had a multilayered purpose: Protecting the Master from any enemies who would seek to interrupt the summon. Hiding the Servant&#39;s True Name. Preventing the Servant&#39;s Class Container from being revealed.

Last, but not least, it kept collateral damage to a minimum. Berserkers were notorious for going into a rampage upon first being summoned. Likewise, even classes outside of Berserker could occasionally have traces of madness hidden within them. Summoning without a catalyst was a fool&#39;s errand, especially since Kun Wu had no idea what sort of Heroic Spirit he had connected to. The chance of it being a Berserker was one in seven. Lady Luck could have easily forsaken him.

The flames spiraled out of his control. His fan felt like a leaf daring to go up against a storm. His nerves were twitching, worsening his headache as he delivered the final line of the incantation. This should be enough, yet the Servant hadn&#39;t manifested yet. Had he botched the ritual somehow?

His worrying turned to fear as he wondered if he should plan a backup performance.

Until the smell filled his nostrils. That heavy fragrance, now rendered soft and sweet, almost perfume-like. The flames that threatened to ruin his stage were now gently coalescing under his fan&#39;s winds. The crowd would be mesmerized as the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame started rotating, moving on its own and mimicking the spinning of the mana in the atmosphere. It was standing, twirling around in a dignified manner as the protective metal coating started morphing into delicate, silk woven fabric.

The flames around Kun Wu turned gold, before dissolving into butterflies. For once, it felt like he wasn&#39;t the performer anymore. No, he was witnessing someone else&#39;s performance.</span>

The clack of high quality heels stomped around the summoning circle, as a tall figure emerged from the cocoon that was the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. A woman, well-endowed, draped in beautiful clothing that smelled of sweet perfume. Her long, white hair seamlessly blended in with her clothes, giving an ethereal feeling to him and the audience.

She gracefully spun around the summoning circle, instinctively replicating the frame&#39;s last movements before she finally gained consciousness. Her eyes opened, peering into Kun Wu&#39;s soul with a simple glance.

Her lips contorted into a smile.</span>

Of course, such gracefulness was only exhibited due to a lack of awareness. Rider had only seen her Master so far, but she had yet to inspect the area around her. A mere few seconds later, her eyes had started darting around the area, causing her to realize where she was: A public market square, with her feet standing on top of a summoning circle. No doubt, the large crowd had gathered because of a main event: Her.

&quot;...Milord.&quot; Suddenly, her eyes didn&#39;t feel so gentle anymore. &quot;I would very much appreciate it if you could explain the current situation to me.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the flames died down, Kun Wu quickly resumed a fighting stance, ready to beat the living daylights out of whatever monstrosity he had conjured from the Throne before it could fully manifest into the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. Maybe if he acted swiftly, the audience wouldn&#39;t realize that he had thrown them all in danger. He could even pretend that it had all been part of the script! 

He thrust his folding fan forward. Steel blades cut through the golden butterflies, stirring up a breeze. A delightful fragrance teased his nostrils as he dived headlong into a bundle of soft woven silk. He involuntarily took a deep breath. The smell was heavenly. Had he ascended?

He forgot what he was doing.

A moment&#39;s weakness was all it took for Rider to manifest in her sensual glory. She took the stage by storm, immediately captivating the eyes of hundreds- no, thousands, and the number kept growing by the second. No doubt the likes of DelphiTube™️ was already crawling with videos of the descent of such a goddess-like figure. It was only a matter of time before the news spread beyond the market and attracted unwanted attention.

If it was exposure that Kun Wu had wanted, then he had passed with flying colors.

Yet Kun Wu found himself drawing a blank.

The disastrous ritual had him all pumped up to face a beast- perhaps, a Berserker even - that required taming. Yet here he was, face to face with beauty beyond his wildest dreams. Could she even fight? He <em>did</em> just boast about besting everyone in the City Grail War, after all!

But then he glanced around and found himself to be sorely mistaken.

It turned out that brute strength wasn&#39;t the only path towards conquest. Rider hadn&#39;t so much as lifted a finger - well, she did lift a few, but that wasn&#39;t the point - yet the crowd was all ready to be at her beck and call. Looks weren&#39;t everything, but Kun Wu had to admit that Rider may have just saved the day with her appearance alone.

Instead of answering Rider&#39;s question like the good boy he was, Kun Wu rounded on his Servant and picked her up princess style. Then, before she could object, he turned and dropped her unceremoniously into the crate that had once housed the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame.

&#39;Alright, show&#39;s over!&#39; He made shooing gestures at the crowd. &#39;You can all go home now or I&#39;m going to start charging by the minute!&#39;

The modern world was a strange one.

S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, especially Republic frames, always came with a chip of data containing a descriptive log of what had occurred in the past 100 years. This chip served the purpose of bringing Servants up to speed to the state of the new world. Despite that, not all Servants were so easy to adapt to the new environment in front of them.

Rider was one of those. The sight of the crowd nearby was enough to make her nervous. A massive mob, staring at her with wanting eyes as she accidentally captured their attention with her summon. It was like being thrown into a stage without having the time to recite your lines.

All she could do was put her faith into her Master. She had been summoned here for a purpose, correct? Why else would her Master put her out in the spotlight? Surely there was some grand scheme they had in mind?

As she buried herself in thoughts, Kun Wu took advantage of her distraction and effortlessly carried her in his arms. A blush escaped her face.

&quot;Milord, you...&quot;

The romantic tension in the air disappeared as quickly as it came, once the boy dropped her inside a crate without a care in the world. He then returned to shooing the crowd, attempting to dissolve the mess he had caused.

Rider sat immobile in the crate, her eyes blank from bewilderment before she regained her composure.</span>

&quot;....Milord, <strong>you have much explaining to do!</strong>&quot; She angrily banged on the crate, as Kun Wu would be able to hear her voice echo from within. &quot;What is the reasoning behind these preposterous summoning conditions? Who are these people outside?&quot; Her voice, despite being heavenly, sounded frustrated. Her new Master was already trying her patience.

Things got even worse, as Kun Wu realized that the crowd had made no attempt to leave despite his shooing. If anything, some of them insisted he continued the show. They were so captivated by his Servant that they insisted to see more of her.

He started to wonder if he had made a big mistake. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Kun Wu loved attention. To have a crowd asking - no, <em>demanding</em> him for an encore was like a dream come true. Normally, he would&#39;ve loved to oblige. But now? All that ruckus only made his headache worse.

&#39;<strong>I said,</strong>&#39; He struggled to keep his tone civil, &#39;That&#39;s it for today! If you want more, turn left three blocks down and buy a lotto ticket with my name on it! The more we win, the more you get to see my Servant in action! Now shoo! I have places to be!&#39;

But words alone were no longer enough to dissuade the crowd. Kun Wu took a few steps back as the mobs advanced like a pack of wolves. Survival instincts kicked in. This wasn&#39;t the kind of attention he was seeking!

<em>Bangbangbangbangbang-</em>

Then there was his Servant, giving him no peace of mind as she started bashing the crate, demanding an explanation. Couldn&#39;t she tell that she was the source of the problem here? Kun Wu wondered where he&#39;d put the lid-

<em>What did she say her Class was again?</em>

...

&#39;<em><strong>RIDER!</strong></em>&#39; 

Kun Wu leaned over the edge of the crate and stared Rider down with panic on his face. &#39;You did say you are a Rider right? Summon something that can get us out of here!&#39;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The crate was sturdy, but it clearly never planned on containing cargo that could fight back. With a few more seconds, it would be possible for Rider to make a dent into the box&#39;s surface and escape.

The question was: Was she truly safer out there? The lack of a lid allowed her to hear various things, namely the protests of the large crowd and her Master&#39;s attempts at silencing them.

<em>&quot;Is he expecting them to simply comply?&quot;</em> She thought to herself, biting her lip in frustration. Ah, how bothersome. If only she had been summoned by a shrewder Master. Her work was already being cut out for her.

She had no idea why she had been summoned. She didn&#39;t know why her Master was attempting to talk down a large crowd, nor why she had been summoned in public. What she knew, however, was that <strong>her Master was vital to preserving her own existence.</strong> Therefore, she could not simply abandon him.

Rider sighed, wishing that she had a pipe with a sprinkle of opium to destress. &quot;First, I shall leave.&quot; She said to herself, before hearing her Master&#39;s voice from above: The runt had shown his face near the edge of the crate and was now begging for Rider to summon their steed.

Such insolence.

&quot;...This works better.&quot; Rider took the opportunity the moment she saw it. Her arm stretched upwards as Kun Wu felt a long pair of nails grab his face by the palm. His throat gagged as he felt himself be dragged inside of the crate, plummeting on top of his Servant as his face landed on a soft and bouncy surface.

The crowd stared in awe, staring at the crate that was now hiding Kun Wu and his Servant from view. The noises inside the crate were hard to hear, meaning that the crowd was oblivious to what was happening inside. It was as if they were waiting for a magic trick to happen...</span>

Inside the crate, Kun Wu slowly regained his bearings, before Rider sped up the process by gently pulling him by his long ponytail. He raised him up, just enough for their eyes to meet on the same level.

She stared at him with a stern face, the type that you would get if you were about to be reprimanded.

&quot;Milord, please be quiet.&quot; Rider whispered while placing a finger on his lips. &quot;While I have offered my services to you, I don&#39;t respond well to foolish orders. You would best keep that in mind.&quot;

Her tone lacked anger and contempt, yet Kun Wu could feel the severity in her words nonetheless. He was <em>this</em> close to losing his Servant&#39;s trust. Incredible. He had no idea that Heroic Spirits could be so temperamental.

&quot;I regret to inform you, but I am not a Heroic Spirit that does well on land.&quot; Rider explained. &quot;Your own two legs would be a better steed than what I can produce in the current state. As such, escaping this crowd will be impossible to you.&quot;

She was blunt. Horribly so. In fact, Kun Wu felt like she wasn&#39;t even bothered by the current situation anymore! This was bad, had she decided to ditch him already? It would be easy for a Servant with Independent Action to abandon their Master and bond with a new one...Should he try contacting Republic&#39;s customer suppo--

&quot;Therefore, it is pointless to try escaping. Instead, make them submit to your will. Do you understand, milord?&quot; Rider whispered in his ear, her words sounding more like commands than suggestions. Her tone alone implied that he should follow her orders to the letter.

&quot;You will defeat them with your <strong>lips.</strong>&quot; She lightly stroked his lips with her elongated nails. &quot;Am I correct in assuming that you gathered this crowd with your own wits? If that is the case, it should be a simple task in sending them away, correct?&quot;</span>

Well, she wasn&#39;t necessarily wrong. If he played his cards right, he could easily find an excuse to make the crowd leave. That being said, it was <em>her</em> fault that they had attracted so much attention in the first place. Maybe he should--

&quot;<strong>Or I could talk in your stead, if that is more comfortable for you.</strong>&quot; She whispered in his ear in a playful manner. Kun Wu was flabbergasted. His own Servant was taunting him! <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Cool metal met flushed cheeks. Kun Wu&#39;s resolve wavered as Rider&#39;s smooth nail guards caught him by the cheeks and reeled him in like a fish. Even inside the shabby crate, complete with half-melted cushioning foam, Rider lay there like royalty. For a Heroic Spirit who had just been treated like cargo, she sure managed to make herself at home with the limited resources she&#39;d been presented with. 

Kun Wu landed face first onto a sinful feast of silky fabrics and skin, stirring up the fragrance that had just begun to settle. It wasn&#39;t long before Rider plucked him out of her bosom by the hair and proceeded to reject, admonish, and tease him like he were some kind of circus animal. He was lucky that the crate was big enough to house both him and his Servant, otherwise he would never make a comeback from such a humiliating act in front of his audience!

Kun Wu flailed his arms wildly until he found some hand room on the walls of the crate. That gave him some leverage, and he finally managed to pull away from Rider, who had no doubt been enjoying herself by whispering sweet nothings into his ear and watching it turn three shades of red. 

Breathe in, breathe out. Rider was just trying to establish dominance. This happened quite frequently with Servants who deemed their Masters unworthy. Was Kun Wu unworthy?

The youth folded his arms and chuckled loudly, ominously.

&#39;I know what you&#39;re trying to pull. You don&#39;t think I can do it, so you&#39;re trying to make a puppet out of me and steal my thunder. <strong>Well, that won&#39;t work!</strong>&#39; He exclaimed, eager to prove Rider wrong.

&#39;I know my audience like the back of my hand,&#39; He held out his hand for Rider to see, all five fingers wiggling under a pair of fine leather gloves. &#39;You just stay here and watch how your Master handles it, <em>professionally</em>. Since you missed the first show, consider this a special treat!&#39;

Was it only an illusion?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Before Rider could pry, Kun Wu was already back to his boisterous self. He hopped out of the crate and soon, the patch of sky Rider could see from the crate was soaked in shades of bright reds and blues. As if to impress his Servant, Kun Wu put on an even more extravagant show of flames and draconic familiars, blinding and mesmerizing the audience with showers of fireworks and smoke.

&#39;<strong>-Then the sky split open in a dazzling light, before the fairy of the nine heavens descended in a golden robe, carrying a great bull drum that could command an immortal army...</strong>&#39;

As his narrative reached a small climax, Kun Wu once again navigated back to the center of the stage. Pillars of temperate yellow flames swallowed the stage in a vortex, creating even more light pollution as they rose high into the sky, as if splitting it open like the tale had described. The crowd waited with bated breath for the flames to die down. A fairy from the nine heavens? There was only one possible answer...

On the other side of the firestorm, Kun Wu delivered a well-placed kick to the side of the crate Rider had ben bashing and tore a sizable hole into the wooden planks. He grabbed Rider by the arm and pulled.

&#39;Quick! Before I run out of fuel!&#39; He was trying to use his flames as a distraction and skedaddle out of here!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sensual looks and a golden voice. That alone would be enough to enthrall most men. It was something Rider knew from experience, to the point that her enemies were quick to warn each other when confronting her.

<em>&quot;Do not let her say even a single word.&quot;</em>

Her voice was a weapon to be feared. No matter how desperate the situation was, be it a storm in the ocean or a raid by pirates, a single sentence from her lips could crush her enemies to death. Such was the power of a woman destined to change the world.

And yet...

&quot;Mhmm. Is that what you think of me, milord?&quot; Rider didn&#39;t seem the least bit hurt at Kun Wu backing away from her. &quot;How callous, if not rude. I was merely offering my consulting services, which are well regarded across the land. Are you unsatisfied?&quot; She smiled, appearing benign, but still sounding as shady as ever.

If it were a battle of wits, then Kun Wu would most definitely lose. He knew nothing of Rider, but knew that 11 times out of 10, he would lose to her in terms of tactics. He could realize that from her tone of voice alone.

However, this was <strong>NOT</strong> a battle of wits.

After all, they were <em>allies.</em>

Rider&#39;s curiosity peaked once Kun Wu promised a show for her. A promise that he would not need her help. Her interest was piqued.

&quot;...Go on, then. Show me, milord, just exactly what type of person am I meant to serve.&quot; She said with a nod, while staring at the open flame in Kun Wu&#39;s hand. The more Kun Wu showed his hand, the better her chances would be to play him into her cards. It was a win-win regardless.

But nothing could have prepared Rider for the spectacle that came next. Kun Wu&#39;s fiery passion was a sight to behold. Boisterous flames, beautiful fireworks, the thrilling tale of a story that was most certainly made up on the spot. Rider could tell rather easily. The boy&#39;s voice reminded her of that of a villain, one capable of spinning lies into stories.</span>

&quot;A fairy of the nine heavens, huh.&quot; She sighed in annoyance, as if having an issue with that part of the script. &quot;Milord, <em>you really are but a boy.</em>&quot; It reminded her of the distant past.

Her thoughts would be interrupted as she felt someone kick the crate open. Kun Wu then dragged her out into the stage, much to her disbelief. She looked shocked, embarrassed even.

&quot;I have various complaints.&quot; Rider said with a frown. &quot;But they shall have to wait. Milord, please hold on tightly to me.&quot;

Kun Wu was confused at first. He expected himself to be the one to escort Rider away, but instead it seemed the latter wanted to take charge. Did she perhaps have a Noble Phantasm for ground transport after all?

No. Instead, she simply grabbed Kun Wu and placed him on her shoulder, a far cry from the delicate princess carry from before. She was holding him like a fire fighter, rushing through the platform of lights and fireworks as she avoided the crowd and sped through the market. Her delicate hair kept hitting Kun Wu&#39;s face as Rider kept running without a care in the world. She was handling him like a brute!

&quot;Milord, where to? I am rather unfamiliar with this city.&quot; Rider asked without stopping. Even if she didn&#39;t know where she was going, she would still keep moving to gain more distance from the crowded areas. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

You most certainly did <em>not</em> become a Rider for giving piggyback rides!&#39; Kun Wu kicked and thrashed and spat out hair, but to no avail. Rider&#39;s grip on him was ironclad, without a trace of delicacy that her appearance had hinted. She was no fairy, but a tigeress in sheep&#39;s clothing!

What was more embarrassing was that even with all his struggling, Rider showed no sign of slowing down, or even being bothered in the slightest. All Kun Wu had achieved was to make himself look like an utter child throwing a tantrum. The day was ending, but the streets had lit up enough to illuminate his face. Even with Rider&#39;s hair smacking into him every other step, it wouldn&#39;t take long for people to recognize him, especially with his telling attire. 

The safest option right now would be to play dead.

&#39;Hmph. You may have won this round, but only because I allowed it so.&#39; Kun Wu reluctantly submitted. &#39;I was going to take the subway back, but since you offered so graciously...&#39; He tugged a handset out of his waist sash with some difficulty. &#39;There are a few routes, but my favorite noodle bar is only on one of them. We&#39;re going to make a detour first...&#39; <span class="mention">#the-upper-house</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider could not help but giggle at Kun Wu&#39;s complaints. It showed that she barely cared.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I cannot. You are anything but unnecessary baggage. I require you to provide me with mana, after all.&quot; She put an emphasis on that last bit. After another minute of intense running, Rider started to slow down, taking in her surroundings as a result. The new world was strange. Buildings had grown far past beyond her expectations, not to mention the odd devices and weirdly dressed people that roamed the streets. Such a fascinating new era.

This gave time for her Master to give the next set of orders. &quot;Oh my, such high praise.&quot; Rider giggled at Kun Wu&#39;s white flag. &quot;I assure you, milord, that I am not your competitor. Just think of me as your most treasured business partner.&quot; She adjusted his position and gently cradled him in her arms, allowing their eyes to meet once again.

&quot;Noodle bars? Ah. It is good to know that traditions have yet to be broken in the modern world.&quot; She said with a hint of nostalgia. Had she had noodles before? That was the thought that crossed Kun Wu&#39;s mind, before his Servant broke into a run once again. This time, she carried him in a more dignified princess carry. Was it because of his complaints or--

&quot;Milord, please point at the noodle bar. I am but a stranger to this beautiful land, after all.&quot; Great, now she was making him work...

After a very brief visit to a noodle stand, the two business partners headed over to <span class="mention">#the-upper-house</span>. Takeout was such a wonderful invention. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>
