                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The basement of the Delphi Integrity Bureau Headquarters was a labyrinth of corridors dimly lit by industrial ceiling lights. It was said that a ghost roamed these halls, spooking maintenance workers by making strange noises and switching lights. Of course, Rinne Kimura, investigator extraordinaire, did not believe in these silly stories. ...For the most part. 

The detective in question had been granted permission by the higher-ups to use a basement storage room to engage in a summoning ritual. It sure had been a task to convince them, given her reputation within the department. However, after hearing her plight they had decided to go along with it. The rumors had already started to circulate, she was sure... They always did. 

Oh, how did the pretty young hot-shot always manage to achieve her goals? Was it through hard work and talent? Couldn&#39;t be! No, she had to be up to something nefarious... The job was her favorite, but the jealous colleagues were the worst. Always hitting on her, always throwing cheesy pick-up lines her way. Like she was some easy whore. They had no idea who she was. What could they possibly know?

Idiots.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rinne took out her frustration on the piece of paper in her gloved hands by ripping it to shreds. It was cathartic, okay? She already had the ritual memorized anyways. Speaking of the ritual... She should get to that. Rinne&#39;s amber eyes wandered to the elaborate magical setup. There, in the storage room, sat a magic circle and S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame. She had acquired all that with her own money and resources.

This was her chance. There was no better opportunity than a city grail war to prove herself. No one would dare doubt her once she returned victoriously. Filled with determination, Rinne removed one of her gloves and put forth her hand.

No going back now... 

&quot;Silver and steel shall be the essence.&quot;

Magical energy began to permeate throughout the room as her words were acknowledged. 

&quot;Stone and the archduke of contracts shall be the foundation

Rise a wall against the wind that shall fall.

The four cardinal gates shall close.

The three-forked road from the crown reaching unto the Kingdom shall rotate&quot;

With each verse, the summoning circle emitted a brighter blue light. By the time the magus investigator finished her chant, she was bathed in the luminescence of her magical energy pouring into the circle.

&quot;From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by three greet words of power,

Come forth from the ring of restraints,

Protector of the Holy Balance!&quot; 

Ah... That had felt good.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Rinne finished her chant, a warmth would fill the room as a great blinding light emanated from the summoning circle. THe S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame residing within the light would become engulfed in flesh and bone. Three voices could be heard mumbling incomprehensible English, the voices eventually becoming two, and then one, as if they had merged into a single entity. 

Suddenly a loud boom occurred, causing the lights in the storage room to flicker before going out, ultimately leaving the detective in darkness. Maybe the basement ghost was real after all. After a few short seconds, the light fixture would flicker back on giving off a dim light. Slowly the brightness in the room would return to normal. In front of Rinne would be the culmination of her hard work and determination, the potential key to greatness —her very own Servant—. 

Rinne’s servant seemed to be a relatively small and dainty man. He wore a rather large coat, nice pants, and a bow tie. Most notably, he bore a large mustache which he was intently fondling. The servant was rather silent; he seemed deep in thought as if he was trying to interpret the current situation with nothing to go on. If Rinne listened carefully, she would be able to catch small mutters coming from his mouth.

“No… This isn’t quite right… I am dead… was dead, and still I stand, this fate is anything but foreseeable.” Finally, the servant looked up from his thoughts, looking Rinne in the eyes, acknowledging his Master for the first time. “You there, gloved woman, if you wouldn’t mind fetching me a paper and some ink, it would be much appreciated.” 

With that, the servant looked back to the floor, once again lost in his thoughts. He rubbed at his mustache once more, muttering to himself incomprehensibly. It seemed Rinne would not yet receive an introduction from the confuddled man.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The detective wasn&#39;t afraid of ghosts, nor was she scared of the dark. However, what she was afraid of was the possibility she had summoned some evil Servant, perhaps a berserker class, and that they would rip her to shreds while she couldn&#39;t see a thing. At the thought, a bead of sweat formed on her forehead... Luckily, she wasn&#39;t murdered, and the lights soon restored themselves.

A larger-than-life heroic spirit of the past was what Rinne had been anticipating. However, once it was all said and done, what stood before her was... Just a guy. An average-looking man with an impressive mustache.  To make matters even more unimpressive, he seemed lost. Rinne was no expert, but she was pretty sure that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen... 

Oh, well! The man was a Servant. That was what she had asked for. The investigator would reserve judgment until after she got to know him better. She wasn&#39;t like some of her colleagues, after all. Rinne put her glove back on and proceeded to deeply bow as she introduced herself.

&quot;Welcome, Servant. I am Rinne Kimura, an investigator at the Delphi Integrity Bureau, and your Master. I hope we can form an amicable relationship and accomplish great things together. It is nice to meet you.&quot;

The woman was the definition of soft-spoken and polite. Every fiber of her being appeared to be serene, gentle, and professional at the moment. As the investigator straightened up, a benign smile spread across her face.</span>

Rinne didn&#39;t mind, though. She had a sneaking suspicion that she had summoned no ordinary Servant. Eccentricity was radiating from the man and his fabulous facial hair.

&quot;I can do that. In return, I&#39;d like you to tell me a bit about yourself if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Rinne reached into the inner pockets of her coat and produced the small notepad and pen she used to take notes. She waved them at the Servant, indicating they were his to use once he obliged her request.

He figured it best to jot down his thoughts later. Right now, getting acquainted with his master was of the utmost importance. 

“My name is Friedrich Nietzsche, a caster class servant; it’s nice to make your acquaintance, master” As Nietzsche finished speaking, he tugged at his coat and straightened his bow tie. He wanted to make an impressionable first appearance for his master. 

After fixing up his attire, the philosopher took a moment to observe the storage room he was summoned in. He had been so lost in thought after his conception that he was oblivious to his surroundings. The place seemed rather drab, Rinne did say she was a detective, but she may just be a janitor from the looks of it. Perhaps Nietzsche was too judgmental. Before making a further judgment, Nietzsche figured it might be wise to get to know Rinne further.

“Now that I’ve introduced myself, Id like to make a small request. What do you say about sitting down and getting to know each other over lunch? I must say, I’m rather interested in the mindset of modern-day humanity.” Nietzsche’s voice would take on an ecstatic tone. He desperately wanted to how the modern man thought. “And of course you should fill me in on your aspirations for summoning me and what not”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ah. It clicked in her head. She&#39;d seen that face in a book once, she was sure. Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher. Infamous for his ideas and large mustache. The identity of her Servant came as a surprise. She had expected a character who was a little further back in history. Would a philosopher be a competent fighter? A few concerns came to mind upon being told her Servant&#39;s name, with that being one of them. Didn&#39;t he go a little crazy at the end? Hopefully, the version before her was the one with his sanity intact...

At the very least, the Caster-class servant seemed to be a gentleman. That was good. Rinne had been worried about having a particularly brash and aggressive servant. At first glance, Nietzsche seemed to be the opposite of that. He was prim and proper in appearance, quite like his Master. Rinne approved.

&quot;That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll happily answer any questions you may have about our modern society. The world... Well, it&#39;s undergone some drastic changes since your time. I&#39;m not sure how much you know.&quot;

Rinne was a little concerned. For a citizen of the modern old-world, especially one who studied society as thoroughly as Nietzsche, it might be a hard pill to swallow. Just about everything was different. Rinne was equally as excited as Nietzsche, though her cool expression didn&#39;t show it. That flame of curiosity that drove her heart sparked. A chance to talk to someone who had lived in the world before the catastrophe was an exciting prospect. There must be details the books didn&#39;t have!

&quot;Come on, then. Let&#39;s get out of this dingy basement.&quot;

The investigator didn&#39;t believe there was an evil spirit lurking about, but still... This place creeped her out!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche gave off a gentle nod in Rinne’s direction. He was excited to leave the confines of the ‘dingy’ summoning altar to become once again acquainted with the living world. Rinne’s choice of words to briefly describe the modern era only tickled Nietzcshe&#39;s curiosity more. If things really had become so different, it would be an opportunity for Nietzsche to meditate on his past and present beliefs. How did his ideology hold up? Where his predictions of the future true? His curiosity was unquenchable; the slight bit of knowledge granted from his summoning was nowhere near enough to satisfy him.

“Well, Master, take us wherever you desire. I shall be following at your side.” Nietzsche took a second to observe his Master’s attire. She seemed formally dressed, similar to his own fashion sense. An immediate worry of his was sticking out to the public. However, based on Rinne’s apparel, it seemed he wouldn’t stick out too much

The investigator stopped at a brilliant modern invention called the &#39;elevator.&#39; She pushed the button and it arrived a moment later with a chirp. Would Nietzsche be impressed by the contraption? She stole a glance at her Servant to see what he thought, then promptly stepped into the elevator. Going up, first floor. It had a cafeteria. It would be much easier to head there than anywhere else!

Rinne wasn&#39;t eager to speak during their short elevator ride. Hell, she wouldn&#39;t even throw a look the way of her servant unless prompted. Idle chatter wasn&#39;t her thing. Instead, the investigator got momentarily lost in her thoughts. She&#39;d really summoned a servant, a philosopher from the not-so-distant past. Was she a competent enough mage to win it all? It wasn&#39;t like she specialized in fighting... Just what kind of opponents would she be facing?

Ding!

It took a moment for Rinne to register, but they arrived at their destination. The first floor of the Delphi Integrity Bureau. At the moment, only a few people were walking about. Not a single one paid the pair any attention. Rinne started forward at a brisk pace. The small caf&#233; intended for workers in the building wasn&#39;t far. 

The investigator secured a table for the two and sat herself down. It was about what you would expect from an in-house establishment. Nothing that would knock you out of the park. Nietzsche would be familiar with the idea of a cafe, right? He wasn&#39;t that old. Rinne&#39;s fingers idly drummed against the table as she perused the menu. To be honest, she wasn&#39;t feeling like eating a whole lot. She just wanted to let her Servant lead the conversation here. He was sure to have many questions...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche followed closely behind his master, enduring the awkward silence as they approached the elevator. Despite being a new contraption to Nietzsche’s eyes, he would seem somewhat normal as Rinne tried to catch his reaction. Nietzsche did take a moment to acknowledge the elevator; however, he made no visible expression of awe. When servants are summoned, they are given minimal knowledge to assimilate into the world without causing too much commotion. This accounts for Nietzsche’s odd familiarity with the future machine. 

Standing in the elevator, Nietzsche took the time to think of questions to ask his Master. There were so many things he needed to know. What was the Church’s status in the modern world? Had people moved past god? What was the art like? What literature did people study? Hopefully, all of his answers would be given shortly. 

As the elevator reached its destination, Nietzsche followed close behind Rinne before taking a seat across from her. He pulled a menu under his arms, leaning his weight on it. However, he didn’t glance at it. Instead, his gaze was fixated on his Master rather intently. He was thinking just exactly where he should start. The servant let out a slight nod as he figured which question was of the utmost importance.

“Now tell me Master, and I ask this with concern for humanity’s current state…” Nietzsche twiddled at his mustache as he prepared Rinne to receive his question. “On the notion of God, do people still worship it? And most importantly, do you believe in God?”

Rinne&#160;said it as if it was an obvious thing. I mean, people have believed in God for a <em>long</em> time. It would take something more drastic than even&#160;the destruction of&#160;the old world and near death of the human species for the idea of God&#160;to be&#160;discarded, she thought.


&quot;I imagine&#160;the influence of&#160;the Church is more powerful than it was in your time, even.&quot;


Rinne&#160;paused, watching for a reaction to that statement. While she knew who Nietzsche was, his philosophical views were unknown to her. Did he perhaps hate religion?


&quot;You see... I assume you know what this whole Grail War is about. Olympia, the other city with a hand in all this, they&#39;re practically run by the Empire.&#160;The&#160;higher ups&#160;over there will bend over backwards for the Neo Holy Empire.&quot;


Rinne&#160;had to hesitate at the second question. That one was a bit more personal. It took a moment for the investigator to formulate a response.&#160;


&quot;I don&#39;t believe in God. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself religious... But I would say I&#39;m spiritual. I&#39;ve taken part in some traditional rituals during my time. Still... I don&#39;t like the Neo Holy Empire. They give me a bad feeling, like most religious organizations. I keep out of it.&quot;


Rinne&#160;leaned forward, eager to press her Servant for more information about <em>him.</em>


&quot;What about you? I&#39;m sure your opinion on the matter is considerably more educated and thought out than mine.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche let out a deep sigh as Rinne gave her answer. Not only was the church present, but their power seemed akin to that of the dark ages: religious supremacy and world destruction.  Nietzsche’s worst fears for humanity had seemed to come true. Before his death, he had predicted that war awaited humanity’s future and nihilism would reign as a dominant philosophy. The only way to avoid this future was to move past the morals of the Christian God. Clearly, humanity had regressed in that sense.

Nietzsche leaned back in his chair, his eyes showing a disheartened look. It seemed he was genuinely troubled by what Rinne had told him. However, it was good news that his Master was not a churchgoer. “I see it is wise of you to form your own beliefs on spirituality” Nietzsche sat back up with a nod. He did not hate religion or people who followed it. He did, however, heavily criticize the church as an entity and what it stood for.

“I reject the idea of Christian God or any God that man has coined thus far. God has outlived his usefulness to humanity. In the past, human faith filled a void that we could not bear to look into. Death, the fear of nothing… a lack of purpose.” Nietzsche cleared his throat, taking a moment to catch his breath. He leaned forward, staring rather intently at Rinne. He intended to give her words to live by and fill Rinne with a philosophy that could prepare her mind for the battles to come.

“Humanity is long past the point of these desperate answers. Naturally, we need to adopt new ideas, new morals, new outlooks on life. This is how we progress; we think forward. Now, Master, I tell you this with confidence. Think hard on what matters in life, find your purpose and reject nothingness. If you can do this, then together we will destroy our enemies.”

The mood rubbed off on her, causing a small frown to form on her lips. &quot;I&#39;m not the type to just believe what I&#39;m told. I&#39;d hardly be a good investigator if I did, huh?&quot; Rinne attempted to lighten the air a bit. &quot;Coming up with my own opinions on something is sort of what they pay me for.&quot;

Humanity without believing in some kind of God? It was hard to imagine that kind of thing, especially with the firm influence the current Church had over the world. People were too weak to be able to face things on their own. The bigger the tragedy, the more power religion had, if you asked her. And, well, the world had undergone quite a few tragedies since Nietzche&#39;s time. &quot;I don&#39;t think the masses have enough intelligence, self-awareness, and courage to do that.&quot; Rinne pointed out. &quot;We humans don&#39;t exactly like change and reinvention, as I&#39;m sure you know.&quot;</span>

I have a pretty strong grasp on what matters to me, and what I&#39;m supposed to be doing with my life.&quot; There was a &#39;For the most part&#39; she decided to leave out. After all, part of the reason the investigator had decided to pursue the Holy Grail War was that she thought it may help her find something worth fighting for. She had no exact wish she wanted to be granted yet, that was something she&#39;d hoped to discover along the way if it came to it. 

&quot;Right... Destroying our enemies. I&#39;m all for it. So, what is it you do, exactly? I, for one, can use investigative magecraft and am quite proficient with firearms. If you&#39;re looking for raw power, I don&#39;t have it.&quot; Rinne was very curious as to what Nietzsche&#39;s answer would be. How would the skills of a notorious thinker translate into battle?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nietzsche let of small nods as Rinne explained her personal philosophy of free-thinking and self-control. He twiddled with his mustache taking in all of the information Rinne put out. It was important to get a grasp of the way his master thought. If he could find a way to meld their minds, then surely they could be a rather dangerous combination of pure brainpower.

“To think for yourself is the most important step in surpassing the faults of our species. I am glad to have such an open-minded master” Nietzsche couldn’t help but feel lucky for his partner. If what Rinne said was true about the church being ever-present, then he was lucky not to be the servant of a nutjob.

Nietzsche couldn’t help but nod along as his Master spoke about the masses and their lack of intelligence. “These institutions give the masses a predetermined purpose. They are slaves in mind. People only lack open mindedness and reject change because they are conditioned and enslaved to do so. Do not give up on humanity because of our downfalls Master; nihilism is the greatest enemy of all.”

After Nietzche’s quick rebuttal, he cleared his throat to move his mind past the philosophical discussion. He could talk about stuff like that all day. However, Rinne was right to change the subject. They needed to start figuring out a game plan fast so they could stay ahead of the competition. “Like you, I lack true strength, thus is the nature of a caster I suppose.” Nietzsche gave off a slight nod. As he predicted, it seemed they would have to mash their minds together to become a formidable force. 

“I have the ability to impose my philosophy on our enemies. It mostly works through mental attacks, but I do have some ways to protect us from physical harm. Given our situation, I think it’d be best to make use of our brains and outsmart those with brawn. I suggest going over some of my literature. That way, you can get a grasp on how we can work together.”

There was zero doubt in her mind that she could properly prepare and formulate a game plan to defeat each opponent.  It was only a matter of execution and raw power! &quot;Understanding one another will be of utmost importance to our success, it seems. I will read your books.&quot; Rinne began to mentally prepare herself for the headache that came with trying to understand philosophical literature. &quot;Additionally, there is no detail about me I can&#39;t tell you. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask.&quot;

They were interrupted by the default tune of a cellphone ringing. Rinne fished the device from her pocket; It was old-fashioned, hardly what you&#39;d expect to see in the modern era. The investigator flashed her Servant an apologetic smile as she flipped it open and put it to her ear. 

&quot;Kimura. ...Yes, it&#39;s done. Mm. Got it, I&#39;ll head there straight away. Thank you.&quot; Only one side of the conversation was audible, but from Rinne&#39;s polite tone, it was apparent she was speaking with a colleague or superior. She closed her phone with a light sigh, amber eyes looking troubled as they shifted back to focus on her Servant.

&quot;That was for work.&quot; She explained, intentionally vague. He didn&#39;t really need to know the details of it. &quot;It&#39;s rather time sensitive. We&#39;ll have to continue our discussion later.&quot; There was little room for objection as Rinne got to her feet. It all said that the Caster-class Servant was dismissed for the time being.
