            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A detective office repurposed into the workspace of a certain intelligence magnate. The dim lighting procured by the ancient incandescent bulbs coupled with the damp and dusty air serves to give an oldish feel to the office. The floor is in disarray: Various folders, binders and files are scattered everywhere and crumbled sheets of paper serve to punctuate every corner. Various shelves and drawers are placed across the walls, each so full of portfolios and papers that they threaten to collapse if touched the wrong way. A cork board stands on top of an expensive-looking desk, littered with photographs of famous faces and various places that are interconnected with red thread that looped on thumbtacks. Looking at the chaos and lack of organisation, one would have thought that this place has been stolen or ransacked by burglars.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Welcome to my office, Freddie. It&#39;s the first time we ever spoke face to face, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Laura said, amused. She leaned back on her chair, her feet on the table. On the other side of the table stood Frederic Figglehorn, sitting in an uptight manner on his chair. His usually neat hair was dishevelled and his suit was creased. He looked like he had ran ten miles to come here. He was staring her down, still clenching the paper that was sent to him earlier today. He looked calm on the outside but a throbbing vein on his forehead said otherwise.

&quot;Good job salvaging that situation with the council, by the way. Real smooth!&quot; Laura said, cheerfully clapping her hands. &quot;I didn&#39;t say anything about a replacement in that little letter I sent you. Confident that you&#39;ll find someone competent this late into the game? There&#39;s only three days left, y&#39;know.&quot;

&quot;Did you bug our meeting room?&quot; Frederic asked, ignoring her banter.

Laura snorted at the word choice. It was perfect, really.

&quot;I&#39;ve got lots of people relaying information to me, Frederic,&quot; She answered, smirking. &quot;And you see, those people would like to stay anonymous.&quot; They weren&#39;t really &#39;people&#39; per say, but she did tell the truth in a way.

Frederic raised an eyebrow. &quot;Are you saying that you have a mole among us?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; She replied, non-committal.

&quot;Did you plan all this just to <em>fuck</em> with me? Did I ever do anything to wrong you or your business?&quot; Frederic snapped. Laura, shocked, raised her hands to her mouth at the mention of the word &#39;fuck&#39;. 

&quot;I <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t want to fuck with you, Frederic.&quot; Laura answered, sitting upright on her chair and resting her elbows on the table. &quot;I <em>did</em> plan all this, though.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Before Frederic could utter an answer, she interrupted him. &quot;A little bird told me that you specifically hired someone to fight for Delphi in that upcoming Holy Grail War, even spent a lotta money with some of the council men on an catalyst to summon a powerful servant. I was interested in taking a hold of that catalyst to participate myself, but I also wanted to stir things up in the upper strato of Delphi. Bring some chaos in. Figured I could hit two birds with one stone. I found the Magus you were interested in, payed the guy double what you promised him to quit the job and sign the message you received earlier today. That&#39;s it.&quot;

Frederic fumed, his face red with anger. He clenched the paper so tight in his hand that it started shaking. &quot;You,&quot; He said, his tone of voice surprisingly calm. &quot;You really screwed me over, didn&#39;t you. I spent so much time in bureaucracy hell, struggling to climb through the ladder. I&#39;m one of the few that smashed through the glass ceiling, despite being born a commoner. If you wanted to be some kinda vigilante hellbent on stripping the status of rotten politicians, then you&#39;ve horribly failed. I&#39;m doing this city <em>justice</em>. Even now, I don&#39;t understand the purpose of targeting me of all people. I might lose my position as head of the council because of your <em>fucking</em> antics.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to specifically target <em>you</em>, Freddie. You just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sorry, pal.&quot; She answered bluntly. 

&quot;However.&quot; She objected. &quot;You can get to keep your oooh so important status if you agree to work with me!&quot;

Frederic kept staring at her, silent. He wasn&#39;t impressed by that proposal.

If I win, you <em>will</em> have to do me a little favour, though.&quot;

Frederic would have laughed, if he wasn&#39;t so mad. Instead, he just raised an eyebrow. &quot;You, <em>gossip girl</em>, fighting?&quot;

Laura smiled weirdly at the mention of that nickname. &quot;It&#39;s embarrassing, don&#39;t call me like that.&quot;

&quot;Stop fucking with me, Laura.&quot; Frederic spat the words.

&quot;I&#39;m serious.&quot; Laura retorted, not a hint of her usual smile remaining on her face. &quot;I&#39;m also a Magus, if you didn&#39;t catch up on that fact yet. I can handle that kind of situation where you need to fight people, I have been working in the more shady side of the town for <em>years</em>. Think that I can&#39;t handle my own weight just because I&#39;m a girl? I&#39;ll have you know that that <em>Rinne</em> girl was granted permission to participate, and I&#39;m pretty sure I can kick her butt in boxing.&quot; 

&quot;This has nothing to do with your gender. You <em>cornered</em> me into accepting that deal of yours. What exactly am I winning if I accept, huh? What happens if you lose? I&#39;m fucked both ways!&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laura sighed. She knew it wasn&#39;t going to be easy to argue with someone as bullheaded as the Figgle. She tucked her hair on the side, carefully looking at the man through her pale blue eyes.

&quot;Collateral.&quot; She sighed the word.

&quot;Collateral?&quot; Frederic asked, momentarily confused.

&quot;Let me make this simple for you, Freddie. Right now, your position as head of Delphi&#39;s Governing Body is at stakes. You proposed a plan to help Delphi win the battle against Olympia, even made some of the council members invest their money in it. Right now, they&#39;re real angry that their money went to waste. When you think logically about it, you don&#39;t have any other choice than to pick me as a replacement. I&#39;m sure someone as careful as you wouldn&#39;t trust a non-Magus with that kinda technology, even if he was one of your most trusted employees.&quot;

&quot;Frankly, I&#39;d rather pick a dog over you.&quot; Frederic retorted.

&quot;But if you pick <em>me</em>,&quot; Laura kept talking, ignoring his remark. &quot;In the chance that I win, which I <em>will</em>, you get to keep your position. You even get to have Persepolis as a little bonus, and I won&#39;t even call dibs on any portion of the city.&quot;

&quot;And if you lose?&quot; He asked.

&quot;If I lose, I will surrender my mercenary organisation to you.&quot; She said with a daring look. &quot;You get total control over it. Make it a personal army, disband it entirely and claim the kill for yourself, make the cute girls blow you in turns. Anything.&quot;

Frederic&#39;s grip on the paper tensed up a tiny bit. &quot;Anything?&quot; He asked, sceptic.

&quot;Anything.&quot; She answered. &quot;I&#39;m ready to entirely give it up. If you don&#39;t believe me, I&#39;ll mail you a list of every single contact that has used our services since its foundation in addition to the type of service they paid for. And you know how important anonymity is in this industry, how much it ties into your reputation as a firm. I&#39;m literally betting it all right here and right now, Freddie.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Frederic kept silent, surprised at the proposition but still annoyed. He shifted on his chair and took a more comfortable sit, reaffirming his control over the situation through his body language. &quot;Huh.&quot; He exclaimed, monosyllabic. 

Laura didn&#39;t fail to catch that. She suddenly dropped the serious facade and cheerily smiled.

&quot;Aww, look at you getting all dommy on me!&quot; Laura pointed, amused. &quot;And all it took was me promising you&#39;d get blowjobs from my girls for you to get back to your old self. How cute!&quot; 

&quot;What I don&#39;t get,&quot; Spoke Frederic, looking Laura in the eyes. &quot;Is why you would do that. I can&#39;t see why you&#39;d go this far just to get a &#39;favour&#39; out of me and to participate in the upcoming Holy Grail War. I&#39;m trying to wrap my brain around your reasons but I can&#39;t find a satisfying answer. Why would you gamble so much?&quot;

&quot;My goals are beyond your understanding, fool.&quot; She exclaimed, theatrically. &quot;Besides. I like taking bets. I think it suits me, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re one crazy person, Laura Hess.&quot; He said, still irritated. &quot;Not like I have say in the matter, really. I&#39;m pretty much tied to you if I want to keep my current position.&quot;

&quot;Damn right you are. I&#39;ve got you by the balls, Freddie.&quot; She commented, extending an open hand to him. Frederic reluctantly shook it, finally letting go of the paper in his hand.

He then rose from his seat, combing his hair back with his hand and turning to leave. &quot;I want that list of your contacts ASAP. I&#39;ll have everything needed to summon your servant delivered here <em>after</em> I take a good look at them.&quot; 

&quot;Aye aye, sir.&quot; Laura answered, making a salute. &quot;Don&#39;t forget to ship in some Mana batteries, too.&quot;

Frederic shook his head. &quot;You&#39;ve got enough money, go buy &#39;em yourself.&quot; He said before withdrawing from her office, noisily shutting the door behind him. 

After he finally left, Laura suddenly relaxed. She put her feet back on her table and slowly exhaled, letting all the tension escape her body.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laura flicked the light switch on. A couple light bulbs illuminated the garage, right behind her workspace. She tug on the strap of her satchel.

Rows of cardboard boxes littered the place, stacked on top of metal sheets awkwardly welded together into makeshift shelves. They carried papers she had yet to go through in her office. Each box was labelled a sequence of numbers and a date to help differentiate their contents. They contained intel on the various businesses established in Delphi, rough estimates of the people coming and leaving each week, notes on the underexposed areas yet to be explored. All sorts of things. 

Laura walked to the center of the garage. There lied a forklift with a package that stood taller than her, firmly resting on its forks. There was also a smaller box just beside it. The bigger box looked heavy enough that it menaced to topple over the machine. There were no labels, names nor addresses on it. She took a cutter and started opening the package, revealing an expensive looking S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame that forced a whistle of admiration out of her.

&quot;You&#39;re looking good, o future servant of mine.&quot; She said, gently stroking the frame. 

Her attention turned to the smaller box, swiftly opening it to reveal a wooden statuette enveloped in plastic wrap. It depicted a warrior wearing green armour, his face red and distorted by anger. It looked old. The paint was slowly fading, it had scratches, chipped bits and it was even missing an arm. Laura frowned. &#39;Is this really what they bought for the summoning?&#39; She thought as she lifted the figure carefully with her  hands, as if holding a baby.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Laura exclaimed. Something had fallen off from the statuette. A green metal shard, brightly reflecting the fluorescent lights on the ceiling. She crouched to pick it up and instantly understood. <em>This</em> was the catalyst. The Magical Energy around the shard was disturbed in its natural flow, ever so slightly pushing itself away from her grip. It looked unaffected by time compared to the decrepit idol that served to hold it.

Laura took a look at her surroundings. The garage wasn&#39;t great as far as summoning places went but it was discreet. She wouldn&#39;t make the same mistake <em>Kun Wu</em> had made when summoning his servant. For Laura, the war had already started: A war of intelligence. And the winner in that war would have an edge in the upcoming battles. Know thy enemy and you won&#39;t succumb in a hundred battles, was it?

She dropped her bag on the floor and started the preparations for the ritual. 

A hexagram inside a circle with the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame in its midpoint, drawn in her own blood to strengthen the connection between her and the servant. Lit candles placed on each intersection. A liberal spread of salt around said circle to banish any malicious spirits or unwanted disturbances. Incense sticks with burnt tips arranged around the circle.</span>

Finally, she placed the statuette along with the metal shard in front of the summoning circle, facing her. Of course, this ritual had to be conducted in total darkness, except for the faint light the candles provided. She turned the lights off and stood in front of the figure.

Did those preparations really help with the summoning ritual? Probably not, Laura thought as she gazed upon her incredibly clich&#233; and silly-looking summoning circle. It looked more like something occult aficionados would do for fun on week-ends, trying to call forth Satan for shits and giggles. It <em>did</em> serve to put her in the right mood, though. Kinda. 

Crouching down, Laura silently prayed to the statuette. She felt the faintest change in the atmosphere around her, as if something responded to her prayers. She placed her hands on top of the summoning circle, barely touching it with her fingertips. The Magical Energy around her slightly pulsed. <em>This was it</em>, she thought. She took a big breath.

Her consciousness slipped as she uttered the chant. The candle flames shook violently, alternating between sudden darkness and blinding light. The core inside the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame started lightly glowing as did the green shard.

&quot;Consolidate which only belonging to you, Ego. Consume which only belongs to me, Soul. Awaken from your stupor, arise to your former grandeur.&quot;

She almost choked. Magical Energy agglomerated around her and suddenly vanished. It once again compressed then dissipated, almost like an old car that struggled to start. Each iteration more intense, more violent than the last. It was unbearable, suffocating.

&quot;May my mind be your escort. May my flesh be your pillar. If your desires coincide with mine, answer my summon and-&quot; 

All at once, the tension disappeared.

&quot;-Come forth!&quot;

Then reappeared one last time, tenfold.</span>

The roars and fury that could only be heard on the field of battle rang through the air. For some, it was utter hell to endure. For others, it was where one could find comradery and the blazing passion one can wield in their hearts!

Each swing, each tiny mistake, could end a life; a pointless and barbaric act to inflict on another. That may be how it seems on the outside. However, to the warriors involved, it was a sign of the utmost respect. To fight at one&#39;s best against another is to respect their strength. A duel between men. A duel between warriors! This is what went through the mind of one warrior during his time on the battlefield. A thought that was carried by him until his demise and then beyond that.

These glorious times were just in the memories of a drifting mind though. For him, time never moved nor did it stay stagnant. It was a strange experience. How many times has he awoken? What happened when he did? These memories were lost to him. It bothered him none though. You can&#39;t miss what you can&#39;t remember after all. &quot;I wonder how my brothers are doing...&quot; A single thought faintly went through the warrior&#39;s mind before he was getting ready to close his eyes. It seems that it was time to rest...

<em>&quot;Trapped in the confines of time, I reach out my hand in addition to plead...&quot;</em>

It was faint. A voice. It was calling out to him. Who&#39;s was it? It was unfamiliar yet he was drawn to it nonetheless. 

<em>&quot;Consume which only belongs to me, Soul. Awaken from your stupor, arise to your former grandeur.&quot;</em>

No. It wasn&#39;t time to rest. Not yet. For His blade was needed. He has yet to ignore a call to battle.

&quot;-Come forth!&quot;

Yes! To glory onto the battlefield! To rekindle the kiln of rivalry in the flames of battle! To ride out once more! 

&quot;I will answer the call...&quot;</span>

The magical energies surged through the garage. The mana needed to summon an ancient warrior from time long since passed has gathered. The S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame shone with a brilliant light that illuminated the entire room completely. The payoff has arrived! For the energies has reached their crescendo and it was time for the servant to enter the world once again!

Nothing.

The room went dead. The magical energies fizzed out. There was no servant. Did she do the summoning circle wrong? Were her chants off? Maybe it was her footing? Just a few inches too far to the left it seems. Maybe she just needs to-

<strong>BOOM!!!</strong>

An eruption of energy came forth and threw the room into disarray. Papers flew and boxes fell over. The blank S.E.R.V.A.N.T frame that stood there has now taken shape. The winds and papers concealing their identity were stopped with a single swing of a polearm.  A Lancer? The ring of metal reverberated in the garage. It was pointed towards Laura&#39;s face. The angle of it came from someone who was either extremely tall or was sitting on top of something. A green glow shined from the engravings on the blade itself. The blade was made from the same green metal as the fragment was. The craftsmanship was flawless. Truly a weapon worthy of a servant.

The servant before her was the first to speak. &quot;Are <strong>you</strong> my master?&quot; A commanding voice boomed from the servant, who on closer inspection seem to be riding a mighty horse. A Rider? Though, the lack of lights, despite the ones coming from the blade, made it difficult to fully grasp her new servant. Perhaps if the lights were on.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Laura was thrown back from the sudden explosion, landing back first on the floor. Although the garage had fallen to utter darkness, one could guess from the sounds alone that papers were flying everywhere. This was gonna take days, <em>weeks</em> to rearrange. She would&#39;ve audibly cursed if she hadn&#39;t had her wind knocked out of her. She settled for a grunt instead. 

&quot;Are <em>you</em> my master?&quot; An ominous voice said.

Her mind was racing and her heart was beating fast. She instinctively tried getting up, but only succeeded in bringing her face closer to the blade that he pointed at her. She would&#39;ve cut open her cheek if it didn&#39;t shine as much as it did. She stopped a few inches from it, bringing her eyes up to meet the face of a... horse?

&quot;Oh,&quot; Laura thought aloud. Right, her <em>Servant</em> is on top of this horse. Her angle and the sheer size of those two prevented her from seeing his face clearly. She put both her hands on the back of the blade and gently pushed it aside, finally getting up from the floor. This time, her eyes did meet her Servants&#39;. She quickly took control of the bugs inside the garage to take a better look the man in front of her. She instantly recognised him. 

Really, she didn&#39;t need light with the sheer number of eyes she had at her disposition. Hell, she didn&#39;t need to <em>stand up</em> to look at him in the first place. But this act of pushing the blade aside before getting up served a greater purpose. It served to send a <em>message</em>. Even if <em>she</em> couldn&#39;t see much in the dark, she trusted that a Servant&#39;s eyesight would. She smiled, casually dusting off her clothes. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; She spoke, confidently. &quot;I am your master, Guan Yu.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A smile appeared on his face once he witnessed her initial reaction to him. Fearless. Assertive. <strong>Confident</strong>. A fine Master. He could work with this. However, is that all there is to her? Just how much remains under that confident layer of hers, he wondered. 

Thanks to the many eyes at her disposal, she could effectively &#39;scan&#39; him in his entirety. Clad in green robes, with hints of armour briefly shown underneath, sits Guan Yu on top of his horse, who&#39;s legend was almost as great as his own. The Taoist God of War himself. His magnificent beard was stroked by his idle hand while he used the glow to examine his master as well. Guan Yu withdrew his famed guandao once it was pushed away. 

His horse was adorned with a shaffron with the engravings depicting the vague face of a warrior who&#39;s stoic and ready for whatever comes at them. The shin guards were made in such a way that made it seem like their hooves were on flames. The rest of the Chinese barding itself was decorated with purple tassels along it. All of it shone in a brilliant gold shine. What stood out the most though, was the extremely fine red hairs that formed their mane and tail which appeared as if they were flames instead of hairs. All it was missing was the heat. A mighty breed indeed. One without rival. Deserving of the name of Red Hare.

&quot;It appears my legend has failed me in keeping my identity a secret. It matters not!&quot; Guan Yu brandished his weapon and pulled the reins on his steed to strike an impressive pose. Oh did it feel great to be back!

&quot;Yes, Master! I am Guan Yu, Lancer Servant. I am in your service until my time has come to an end.&quot; He gave a slight nod as his attention turned towards himself. This body of his felt strange. It was restricting, and yet it felt so natural. That wasn&#39;t even considering the knowledge of the world he was given. The world was destroyed then remade through the stubbornness of humans. It was to the point of being inspiring, really.</span>

He wasn&#39;t wrong about his legend extending beyond Chinese folklore, anyone with a semblance of general knowledge knew about the infamous Guan Yu. In Laura&#39;s case, however, she had preemptively memorised every entry in the ServantPedia™ wiki as preparation for the war, hence why he was so easily recognised the moment she gazed upon him. The big man did seem to be in a good mood though, so she refrained from giving away that little detail.

As far as he could see, Laura looked like a weakling. She had pale white skin that barely saw any sunlight, a scrawny body that was covered in loose clothing and a weak constitution that would be completely useless in combat. On the other hand, her body language was that of absolute confidence and assertiveness, as if she was completely invulnerable. That huge contrast served to give her a presence, almost mystical in nature. On her face were one of those vulpine grins that turned up at the corners

&quot;You might want to call off your big horse,&quot; She spoke, turning the lights back on. &quot;I don&#39;t think he can fit through my door.&quot;</span>

Did his master usually keep their place as messy as this? It looked like a typhoon decided to call this place their home! Maybe the other rooms are tidier! Can&#39;t judge on the first room alone after all! 

Speaking of, as his eyes adjusted, he got a better look at his master. She had a fragile frame to her. Not that far off from a doll&#39;s. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to find another who could best her in physical combat. Despite that, she presented herself as if she were untouchable. Just what did his Master have that would allow for such confidence in one&#39;s self? Now that is enough to make anyone curious.

She was right though. Although mighty, there were things that Red Hare could not do, like fit in enclosed spaces. If only he came with a more portable form! He could sense his partner&#39;s unease towards being caged like this. To help ease this stress, Guan Yu proceeded to stroke the neck of Red Hare. &quot;I know, my friend. We will ride across the plains once more in due time.&quot; He gently soothed Red Hare with his soft words before getting off. Even without the horse, Guan Yu still stands tall. Without even so much of a command from him, Red Hare faded away until he was needed. This would make maintaining Guan Yu a lot more manageable in terms of mana efficiency.

&quot;Rest well, friend.&quot; With one last whisper, he turned towards Laura and aimed to follow her as she led him further his base of operations. He was known to be an excellent guest and he does not aim to disappoint. Hopefully.

&quot;Miss Hess. Lead the way!&quot;</span>

She breathed a sigh of relief as she carefully sat on her office chair, her feet on the table. She did well to hide the fact that the summoning had almost completely drained her. Now that she had her back to her Servant, she allowed herself to close her eyes and stop pretending for a second. 

The office might&#39;ve looked mighty fine for Laura as she found meaning in the organised chaos that permeated it, but Guan Yu would feel the exact opposite. Papers of all kinds blended together on the floor, paperclips stuck out of every corner, shelves were filled with books and notes. There wasn&#39;t a single place that was spared from the lack of order. If he thought that the previous room was a disaster, then this was a full-blown catastrophe.
 
&quot;Careful with your feet, big man.&quot; She spoke as Guan Yu was about to step on a dossier that lay open on the floor. &quot;You can sit wherever. Just as long as you don&#39;t cause <em>more damage</em>.&quot; 

Although it was very natural for Laura to keep track of everything and anything through her bugs, it probably wasn&#39;t for her newly summoned Servant. 

&quot;Oh, right. I can watch, hear and feel through bugs. Don&#39;t freak out if I ever speak without facing you or comment on stuff I shouldn&#39;t be able to see.&quot; She clarified to him.</span>

The spike of the pommel barely caused a dent on the floorboards despite the weight of the weapon. A subtle showing how far his mastery goes.

The sight of her office stopped him in his tracks. A quick gaze around the room was made to ensure that this was indeed in fact a different room and not the same one they just left. Though the mess made it difficult to tell the two apart. If anything, it was worse! Was the price for humanity&#39;s survival the concept of organization? If so, it was a steep price indeed.

As he entered, he never felt so lost in such a small room. So much so that it appeared that he almost stepped on an important document if she deemed it necessary to warn him about it. 

Sit down wherever. Right. That is doable. Maybe.

A quick examination showed a chair he could sit in. Perfect. It required him to push a few things aside, but he got there eventually. The comfort of chairs has advanced well since his time. This was nice. 

He was about to close his eyes and relax as well before being bluntly told that she uses bugs as external sensors. That was an eye opener. It left him with more questions than it did to clarify anything for him. Magecraft during his time was as diverse as there were heroes, but he haven&#39;t heard of anything like that. There <strong>was</strong> more to her than he thought. 

&quot;Mind I ask how? Seeing through so many eyes must be rather disorientating. Let alone how it must be for the other senses to be a part of the mix as well.&quot; Guan Yu had a tone of complete curiosity to his voice.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;That&#39;s a great question, pal!&quot; Laura said as she kicked her desk to rotate her chair towards Guan Yu.

&quot;It goes without saying that handling tens of thousands of extra sensory outputs would be impossible for a regular human being, our brains weren&#39;t made to handle that much information at once. The thing that lets me make full use of this bug-control spell is a <em>second</em> spell that works to power-up my brain, which facilitates the process of giving orders to my swarm and eases the flow of information that they deliver to me. Say I wanted to take a close look at a person through my bugs, using that second spell lets me quickly cut anything that doesn&#39;t contribute to the action of looking at the person and helps me instantly stock all necessary information in my brain, effectively negating the process of sorting through everything myself. You can think of the bug-control spell as a very sharp blade and the high-processing spell as the handle that keeps that blade in place, the first would never be able to function without the use of the latter.&quot; 

To punctuate her statements, she gathered a number of flying bugs to her from outside. Mosquitoes, fruit flies, even a few dragonflies started to spill in the house through the many cracks that it had. They formed tightly packed units in front of the young girl before spreading across the room in perfect synchronisation, forming neat little circles that eventually collapsed into kaleidoscopic shapes. 

&quot;They&#39;re my tiny soldiers,&quot; She said as she made a dragonfly land on one of her index fingers. &quot;Ready to go to war the moment I order them to. Pretty cool, aye?&quot;</span>

He can think of a few tacticians during his time who would have loved to have that power of hers. Not only to keep up to date on what&#39;s going on in the battlefield in real time, but to also be able to isolate key information. In the midst of chaos that ensures during combat between two massed forces, the strategist who could understand, or even control, the flow of such chaos came out on top. If only he had that ability when...

No. Things wouldn&#39;t have been different if that were the case. He couldn&#39;t even begin to think what he could have done differently even if he had known everything in advance. It was just an unwinnable situation. He was simply outplayed.

The display of control she demonstrated with the bugs was as eerie as it was impressive. &quot;I think I understand now why you carry yourself the way you do, Miss Hess. It is quite the formidable weapon to wield.&quot; He responded with an approving smile. 

The mention of them as tiny soldiers caused a chuckle from him. &quot;Then it is rather fortunate of you to have summoned a general from the Three Kingdoms era, now isn&#39;t it!&quot; An understanding of his Master&#39;s ability was extremely helpful. This would prove most useful when they must plan their tactics for the battles to come.

&quot;Is there any questions that you may have yourself?&quot; He asked with an inquisitive glance shot her way.</span>

The way he pondered as he came to learn about her abilities did not escape her many eyes. Perhaps was he thinking of a way to utilise those spells in combat? How to best synergise his own abilities with hers? One thing was certain, he did not fail to his ServantPedia™ description. Not only was he a powerful warrior, he was also a cunning tactician that immediately thought of ways to use an asset upon first hearing about it. &#39;That&#39;s cool,&#39; Laura thought as she observed him, smiling. &#39;I can definitely work with that.&#39; 

&quot;Questions, huh?&quot; She repeated, leaning back on her chair. 

She took a few seconds to reflect on what she wanted to ask. According to his profile, Guan Yu qualified as both a Lancer and a Rider. He combined the solid discipline and the combat expertise of the former with the agility and freedom of movement of the latter. If they could fully capitalise on Red Hare&#39;s speed, there was some serious hit-and-run tactics to be employed. He did present himself as a Lancer upon summoning though, so she had to make sure of his abilities before deciding on a tactic to discuss.

&quot;Red Hare,&quot; She asked. &quot;He might well be the key to win our fights. How confident are you in his speed? Do you think he could match up, maybe even <em>surpass</em> another Rider&#39;s mount?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Red Hare. His trusted partner and friend. 

Even though he was one who asked for questions and meant no disgrace by it, he couldn&#39;t help but scoff at the questioning towards Red Hare capabilities. All it took was a single glance at their speed to blow away any doubts one might have towards them, but it seems words will have to do for now. A personal demonstration will come in due time, after all.

Guan Yu placed his arm on his leg and leaned towards his Master with a smile overflowing with confidence. &quot;When it comes Red Hare&#39;s speed, Miss Hess, he has no rivals. No one ever came close to keeping up with Red Hare on land. No matter what obstacles stood in his way, be it water, mountains, or even mighty armies, nothing was going to stop him.&quot; 

He returned to his more relaxed posture after that initial answer before continuing. &quot;Just as my blade grants me the ability to call myself a Lancer, I owe my entire existence as a Rider because of Red Hare. You see. Red Hare chooses his riders. Whatever criteria he has to determine who&#39;s worthy is unknown. What <strong>is</strong> known is that there were only two riders chosen. Myself and a warrior with no equal akin to Red Hare himself, Lu Bu.&quot; He paused as he looked up at the ceiling though his gaze stared past that. &quot;Red Hare trusted me enough to choose me. Because of that, the same amount of trust in his abilities is all I can offer in return.&quot;

Guan Yu stood up so he could take a stance in front of Laura. A deep breath is taken before he brought up his fist to slam against his chest proudly as Red Hare&#39;s Rider. &quot;Miss Hess, I am more than confident in his speed! I have one more question for you though, Master.&quot; He spoke more formally this time to impose some level of severity to his next words. 

<strong>&quot;Are you confident in me?&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She paused, frowning as she pondered what her Servant had asked.

His profile clearly stated that he despised backstabbers, his demeanour and attitude towards her was nothing short of exemplary and he just <em>felt</em> like someone you could put your faith in without worry. It went without saying that she <em>trusted</em> him, as much as a Master could trust the Servant he himself invoked to aid him in battle. 

But was she <em>confident</em> in him? This required further contemplation.

Trust didn&#39;t need evidence or questioning. This act of believing without questioning could very well be born from a spontaneous impression, without any prior evidence. Confidence, on the other hand, came with <em>time and experience</em>. It is the assurance that was naturally born from previous successful endeavours, a feeling that could never stem from nothingness. It was something important, significant. Something that, if earned, spoke at length about the ability of the person one had confidence in.

From an outsider&#39;s point of view, it might have looked like Laura had dug too deep into the meaning of Guan Yu&#39;s words, that she was just nitpicking on semantics and ended up completely missing the original meaning of the question. No matter, Laura thought. There <em>was</em> a distinction to be made between trust and confidence and it <em>had</em> to be made clear.

Laura leaned forward towards the mountain of a Servant, her pale blue eyes ever so slightly reflecting the incandescent light that emanated from the ceiling. Her expression had a particular weight to it, a seriousness that had yet to be seen before. It matched the imposing severity of Guan Yu&#39;s words in an unexpected, almost solemn way.

&quot;I&#39;d be lying if I said you didn&#39;t have my trust,&quot; She finally answered. &quot;But my level of confidence will <em>entirely</em> depend on your actions, Lancer. You rock the strong warrior style, <em>show</em> me that you can also handle it.&quot;</span>

What words will she have chosen? He could feel the excitement build up inside of him until the tension peaked when she leaned forward. His attention was all on her and her coming words.

The answer she gave in response made him grin. An excellent answer! 

&#39;<em>Well done, Miss Hess.</em>&#39; After that thought of his, Guan Yu let out a boisterous laughter. It was unclear whether or not he was laughing at her, her answer, or her attempt at being serious. Fortunately, it was neither.

&quot;I would have took you for a fool if you said you were confident! Overconfidence towards anything can, and will, be one&#39;s undoing.&quot; She had passed his test. 

&quot;You mentioned earlier before that your weapon is only as formidable as the person using it. I like that saying. That is a good one to stand by. One that I will hold you to your word to.&quot; He held out his hand for her to shake. A sign of respect. &quot;Upon our first battle together, we will be able to properly gauge each other&#39;s capabilities to see if either of us can live up to that saying! After all, words can mean anything. Actions, even a single one, are far greater than any word can ever be.&quot;

Guan Yu could feel her hand in his own, so small and vulnerable. His mighty grip threatened to crushed her if he hadn&#39;t had incredible control over his strength. This small gesture could very well be interpreted as a showing of her reliance upon him, that she trusted him enough to handle her in a delicate manner despite his imposing stature. Or perhaps she just did not care that much about her well-being in the first place. Most likely both.

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; She spoke as she let go of his hand, suddenly realising that an important point had to be brought up. &quot;You&#39;ve been summoned to fight in a... sort of <em>special</em> Holy Grail War?&quot; She let those words sink in as she pondered, closely monitoring her Servant&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Man, I don&#39;t know if <em>Frederic</em> implemented that information in your frame&#39;s processor...&quot; She thought aloud, her gaze wandering as she spoke. She had known about the thing Guan Yu planned to wish for in case he was victorious, but the miracle that the Holy Grail normally granted was not a possibility in this particular war. Perhaps it was presumptuous to think that early about their victory, but she did not want him to feel dejected or cheated if and when they got there. It was better to tackle that point early on.

&quot;Basically, there is no &#39;wish&#39; involved,&quot; She spoke, slightly cast down. &quot;Well, there <em>is</em> a wish, but it has to be something money can bring. This means that you probably won&#39;t get to celebrate with your buddies if we win.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Guan Yu returned the grin while he shook her hand. Despite her body, she definitely had the spirit of a strong warrior inside of her. To call her weak would be underestimating her greatly. A mistake that he hoped that his opponents would make. After all, a single mistake is all that one needs to seize victory.

His happy demeanor swiftly turned to one of confusion however. 

<em>Special</em> Holy Grail War? What made it so special that it would be seen differently from the rest. The answer didn&#39;t evade him for long. The lack of an actual wish made it <em>special</em>. His frame kept him up to date with the world&#39;s condition, but it had nothing on what he would be doing. 

The truth struck him hard. Even if they won, he would not be seeing his brothers again. The blow made him sit back down into the chair he got up from. It made him think. This time he did not even stroke his beard once. The weapon rested against his shoulder as he pondered those words. A familiar feeling washed over him. The realization drew a grim smile from the warrior of old. <em>&quot;So I&#39;m back in Cao Cao&#39;s castle then.&quot;</em> His words were soft. Too quiet for anyone without enhanced senses to hear. This time, he knows for sure that word of his brothers won&#39;t be coming to him.</span>

However, if he didn&#39;t fight with his all just because of this knowledge, how will he ever face his brothers again should the chance arise? How could he call himself Red Hare&#39;s Rider? Would he even be worthy of the title God of War? He held out his weapon to gaze into the reflection. No. That would be unbecoming of him. He would never hear the end of it from Zhang Fei and the lectures from Liu Bei would be without end. This line of thinking was foolish. And to think that he sought to lecture his master should she fail his test.

A single inhale was all it took to regain his smile. He returned his weapon to his side. This time he struck the spiked pommel onto the ground and caused a metallic ring to sound out. His glance returned to his master. &quot;This <em>special</em> wish, Miss Hess. What is yours I wonder..&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As it turns out, Laura did have a <em>sort</em> of enhanced hearing. As the flies placed on the inside of the warrior&#39;s clothes picked up on what he had said through their numerous hearing organs, Laura thought back to his military career mentioned in his ServantPedia™️ profile. 

&#39;So I&#39;m back in Cao Cao&#39;s castle...&#39; He had said.

Her brow furrowed as she pondered those words, linking them to what she had know about him. Did he mean that, as he came to learn that there was no reward awaiting him at the end of that upcoming battle, he felt <em>forced</em> to grant her a favour that he had no interest in granting? Did he link <em>her</em> to the traitorous Cao Cao, a man that was described as shrewd and unscrupulous in all of his literary appearances?

Those thoughts were a bit disheartening. Laura gave the old warrior an apologetic smile, patiently waiting as he took time to regain his composure. Seeing how quickly his mood deteriorated as she brought that news up made her feel a tang of regret, even as she knew that it <em>had</em> to be done. His next inquiry made it even worse, seeing as she could be granted <em>her</em> wish but not <em>his</em>.

&quot;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves here,&quot; Laura answered, slightly smirking. &quot;We can have a long, lengthy talk about that <em>after</em> we&#39;ve fought a couple Servants, alright?&quot; 

She stood up from her chair after her not-so-subtle attempt at closing the wish topic, stretching her stiff shoulders as she let out a small grunt. She fumbled with the papers on her desk, finally retrieving a smartphone from beneath a pile of reports. 

&quot;I&#39;m gonna order some food,&quot; She spoke, scrolling through her contact list. &quot;Want anything, big man?&quot;</span>

Perhaps, he would flee after the battles were done in search of his brothers. Unlike before though, he doubts he can get far in this body compared to his last escape, even with Red Hare carrying him along. He wasn&#39;t even sure where he would start.

The way she switched the topic at hand caused a smirk from him. Clever. It was smart to play one&#39;s card close to their chest after all. &quot;Fine by me, Miss Hess. We will continue this another time.&quot; A polite response accompanied with a slight nod at the end. 

The battles to come would play a critical role in understanding just who his Master plans to be. She plans to win, but why? He might have been able to pick up a clue of sorts from glancing around the room, but he understood none of the chaos around him. So he would have to rely on time to reveal the answers.

&quot;Food? Hmm... Let&#39;s see..&quot; With a hand on his chin, he pondered. Servants didn&#39;t need to eat, but he wasn&#39;t going to turn down her offer. That would make him out to be a ill-mannered guest after all. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go with a generous serving of rice with a hearty side of vegetables!&quot; Not the response one expected, especially from a warrior like him, but it was simply what he was used to. They saved the good stuff for banquets and celebrations so it was mainly out of habit for him.

She snuck a few glaces towards Guan Yu as she spoke. Thinking back about his profile, it said that he enjoyed playing <em>strategy games</em> in his free time, didn&#39;t it? Playing a few rounds of chess between fights as they rested didn&#39;t sound like a bad idea, she thought. She dialled a second number as soon as she finished her order, walking to the garage and closing the door behind her as she started talking.

&quot;A&#39;ight,&quot; She sighed as she walked back into the office, collapsing on a nearby chair. &quot;Food should be here in about... 10 minutes?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Even with knowledge of technology implanted in him when he was summoned, he still had issues accepting that small device Laura picked up could do all the things it claimed to be capable of. It couldn&#39;t be possible.

That made him curious about the other things this world had. It was extremely unlikely that he would find a place that would remind him of home. As sad as that notion was, it only meant that each place and encounter would be a new experience. A new memory. A new tale to tell his brothers at the banquet table in the Peach Garden. The place where they made their oath together. That is, of course, if he remembered it.

Once Laura left the room, Guan Yu was left to ponder by his lonesome. 

&quot;I am fortunate neither of you got to witness such a shameful display, brothers. I promise I will make you two proud.&quot; He muttered to himself with his head against his weapon as if in prayer.

With that, Guan Yu looked up with a raging flame in his eyes. In honour of his brothers, the full might of the Taoist God of War will befell those who decide stand before him and his Master.

The return of his master brought him both company and the time their food would arrive. 

Ten minutes.

He was impressed. To think that one could simply request food and receive it in such a timely manner with one small act. 

Soon enough, their food arrived and they dug in. 

To him, the food was heavenly. It was almost to the point where he would be fine with eating just that during a banquet. Though it only made him curious if they made something as simple as rice taste this good, just how well made are the other meals.

The conversation was light. Not much more was needed to be said. Everything they needed to say was already touched upon. Besides, there will be plenty of time to discuss tactics at a later date. It would be for the best if they rest up and enjoy what may be their last moments to relax in peace. For the war is about to start.</span>

<strong>A City Grail War.</strong>

A battle between two cities where the winner received their wish as the reward. 

No simple fool would have joined. Their opponents were most likely experienced Magi with their full intent focused towards achieving victory for their own dreams. None of them planned to give even a single inch to them, so neither should they. 

What kind of battles were laid out for them to overcome? Is their combined strength and cunning enough to clash against their opposition? Would it even be enough to achieve victory in the end or are they fated to crash and burn before even getting a glimpse at the top? They would need to rely on each other to ensure that their weaknesses are covered, as well as trust in their partner&#39;s strengths to come out on top.

Whether it was true or not, Lancer and their Master are prepared for the coming City Grail War.</span>
