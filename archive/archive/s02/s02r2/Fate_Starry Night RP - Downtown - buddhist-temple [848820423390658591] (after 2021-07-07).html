            <div class="preamble__entry preamble__entry--small">A lone Buddhist temple set on the outskirts of Olympia. This structure sees only one visitor due to the long and winding path to travel on. Jampo makes it his mission to travel to this temple each day after his work to pray and cleanse his soul, and to bite back the rising tide of Ashura that the work day brings out. Due to the secluded nature, Jampo has decided that this might serve as the best possible candidate for a Master&#39;s Workshop, and has decided to remain here for the rest of the coming War between Delphi and Olympia.</div>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo blinks against the tapestry of the morning sky. Pink brushstrokes swath across a deep ocean of indigo, punctuated with dwindling stars fading into the background with the coming of the sun, peeking just below the skyline to his right and bathing the monk once more in a light glow. He breathes in. Places his palms together...and prays. 

Before the front of the temple, Jampo sits cross-legged in the stone courtyard. Motionless. The only sound present for him is the slow breathing that lifts his chest, though for anyone approaching, the sounds of nature would present a calm stillness that would make the man seem like a statue were they not to look closely. This is simply a matter of routine for the monk, but it aligns quite well with the wishes of Saber, asking Jampo to maintain a peaceful facade. They had many discussions on the nature of lying, but they came to an agreement: Is it truly lying if you simply do not provide answers to questions unasked? Jampo still had reservations, but it was enough to concede an attempt to hide the nature of the temple. 

Still, should the time come, Jampo felt this was a wonderful moment to create reconciliation between Masters and Servants. The nature of Holy Grail Wars was abominable to him, but perhaps a City Grail War could skirt such violent tendencies. After all, who would kill another for a city? There had to be enough good in the participants to avoid such a feat...

And so, he waits. Until the completion of Dolorous Gard, all Jampo can do is go about his day and his routine, and simply wait for Saber&#39;s plans to come to fruition...</span>

Clouds of smoke tainted the sky with a black-ish tone. Cicadas were noisily chirping. Dust, piles of detritus everywhere and a scorching heat: This is what Olympia was. This is the place where Laura and her Servant had stepped foot into, the place where they would potentially meet their first opponents.

The downtown district had been specially arranged to accommodate tourists coming from Delphi. Food stands had been strategically placed to encourage people to consume, street vendors punctuated every street corner and the already established businesses were bursting with activity. 

The sun was beating down on the people swarming the road. They were touching skin, sweating and panting, talking amongst themselves without a care in the world as to what was happening between the two cities. 

Weren&#39;t they scared of the repercussions of the war? Even if the City Grail War had been limited to a few designated places, accidents were not out of the ordinary. <em>Especially</em> when dealing with Servants and their destructive tendencies. Hell, even Laura and Guan Yu were preparing to potentially fight in a place that wasn&#39;t meant for <em>battle</em>.

&quot;<em>Fucking Olympia</em>...&quot; Swore Laura for the fourth time, taking a large sip from her bottle.

She also sported sunglasses and a floppy hat in an effort to fight the scorching sun. Strapped on her back was a deceptively small backpack that housed all of her belongings, handgun and pepper spray included. 

For Guan Yu&#39;s part, he traded his flamboyant attire for more simple clothes, trying as best as he could to blend in with the crowd. Well, as much as a muscular six foot seven guy could blend in. 

Their objective, the Buddhist Temple, was a few city blocks away from their current position. It was in the middle of the &#39;Places of Worship&#39;, a district that housed all the religious organisations in Olympia. This also meant that a butt-load of people coming in and from their objective stood between them and their destination.

<em>Annoying.</em>

The Servant&#39;s imposing frame did somewhat help. People purposefully evaded the pair as they walked with intent through the horde of people. On the other hand, it also made them stand out more, which did nothing to ease Laura&#39;s creeping fear of meeting an enemy Master by accident.

&quot;Say,&quot; Laura spoke, taking a pause to sip from her bottle before turning to her Servant. &quot;How do you feel about going to a place that worships you as a god?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Guan Yu was no stranger to hot weather. The hot summers travelling in the open fields on march with the sun blazing upon him were quite common for him! Or at least that&#39;s what he thought when he was warned about the heat in Olympia...

&#39;This can&#39;t be by choice..&#39; Guan Yu lamented to himself in his thoughts while his Master was more vocal about hers. Maybe they were trying to weaken Delphi&#39;s teams with the heat! Such dastardly plans indeed.

The crowds only made things worse with their collective body heat.

Despite his attempts at blending in, his stature betrayed him. He was among the tallest in the crowd so it would be easy for a enemy Master to notice the odd one out once they pick up on a servant&#39;s magical signature. Without Presence Concealment on his side, he might as well be carrying a sign that reads out &quot;Servant&quot; with him.

Guan Yu&#39;s casual attire consists of a bright green long-sleeved button up shirt with dark cargo shorts. His muscular body was shown through his clothing even if they happened to be the right size for him. Initially he was planning on wearing longer legwear, but boy was he glad that he chose against it in the end! He completed his look with a pair of shades. His magnificent beard stuck out the most compared to the rest his outfit though. 

&quot;I will say this once and only once. I dread having to fight in my full gear in this heat..&quot; Heavy armour <strong>plus</strong> robes on top? No thank you! Unfortunately, Guan Yu didn&#39;t really have a choice in the matter.

Luckily for them, their path took them away from the congested streets of Olympia. The path to the Buddhist Temple was a long and secluded one. It meant that they still needed to walk for quite a bit, but at least they would have more privacy between them.

That&#39;s a good question. It is true that he does have some divinity due to becoming a deity after his death. However, to claim he was used to the idea would be folly.

&quot;I still very much consider myself to be a mortal man opposed to a deity, Miss Hess. Though, I will say that I do feel strangely drawn towards the place. Perhaps that&#39;s the divinity within speaking.&quot; It was a unique feeling. Was this how he also felt whenever he was summoned before? Not that he would be able to remember after all. It was an interesting thought though.

&quot;I will admit. It is a quite the coincidence that our first opponent resides in such a place of worship given who I am. It must be fate!&quot; Another loud laughter came from him. 

Once they were on the path, the noisy clatter of the crowds became distant. It was time.

A calm exhale left Guan Yu as he stopped. With his hand outreached, his famed guandao materialized in all of its glory. Once his grip was firm on it, his attire changed with it. With a quick burst of wind surrounding him, Guan Yu&#39;s armour and green robes were back on him. He could <em>feel</em> the heat already. Though, he wasn&#39;t finished. No. There was one last thing. One that he called forth through a sharp whistle.

As if following behind the pair this whole time, the sounds of hooves clopping on the path became clear who it was. It was Red Hare. Ready and geared up. 

&quot;It is time, my friend. Time for me to prove to you once again that I am worthy to be called your Rider!&quot; With that, Guan Yu got on Red Hare in one swift motion. &quot;Before I go on ahead, remember our talk about Casters. We must not underestimate them. Keep me updated, Miss Hess. Be safe.&quot; He simply gave her a smile and a nod before trotting off up the path alone. 

The massive shift in magic in the air from both Guan Yu and Red Hare was telling to any Masters nearby. Someone was coming.</span>

&quot;Ahh. It&#39;s time.&quot; 

The monk clasps his hands together, a soft smile crossing his face as he raises one before his face before exhaling. A field of magecraft extends out, covering the courtyard as Jampo continues to meditate, waiting for whoever was coming... 

&quot;Hmm, I wonder if it&#39;s the worst outcome Saber imagined, a Knight class...&quot;</span>

The surge of Magical power that emanated from him almost made Laura flinch, even though it was her second time witnessing it. Surely the enemies residing in the temple felt it too.

&quot;Give em&#39; hell.&quot; Laura spoke to her Servant as she watched Red Hare stride towards the temple, nervously smiling. They had to hit them <em>hard</em> and <em>fast</em>. Couldn&#39;t afford to waste time on stealthiness. It was better go ham from the start and not give the enemies time to think. 

She calmly sat on the side of the road as her Servant approached the temple, taking off her backpack to put it between her legs. 

One thing that she did like about Olympia&#39;s weather was that it was perfect for her abilities. Bugs <em>thrived</em> on hot and humid environments. That meant she didn&#39;t have to bring her &#39;weapons&#39; with her. They were already scattered <em>everywhere</em>, just waiting to be used.

Laura started focusing on her Magical Circuits, slowly spreading her Magical Energy around. She could feel the hundreds, <em>thousands</em> of insects that were lying in the shadows, crawling in remotes places that were out of sight. She could sense the numerous ants that were feasting on the meals dropped by the tourists on the floor, the spiders that weaved their silk across every corner, the flies that were flying around the numerous food stands that permeated the streets.

<em>Gather.</em>

Laura took a final sip from her bottle as she awaited for her tiny soldiers to collect. Curiously, there weren&#39;t any insects inside the Buddhist temple. Was it the influence of the <em>Domain</em>? She ordered a few flying bugs to land on Guan Yu, closely watching and listening through their senses as if she was riding Red Hare with him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The presence of a servant grew closer to the Buddhist Temple until a towering figure of green emerged from the path. They weren&#39;t alone though. They sat upon a well-armoured red stallion. A Rider class servant it seems. However, there are no sign of a Master with them. 

Knowledge was everything in a battle against a servant. If one were to discover who they were fighting, then countermeasures can be made once their strengths and weaknesses were known.  

With that in mind, Guan Yu examined his surroundings once he got a decent view of the temple grounds. Nothing stood out that gave him any clue about the servant they&#39;re fighting so far. That wasn&#39;t his job though. His job was to distract and stand out to draw out the enemy forces and listen to his Master&#39;s orders. She is better equipped to handle that than he was after all. It was worth a way at least.

There was one thing he did spot though. Someone that made him do a double take due to how still they were. A monk. A monk that appeared to be meditating in a stone courtyard in front of the temple. A Servant? Their Master perhaps? Or simply just a monk. To avoid killing an innocent bystander, he would have to make sure.

Guan Yu closed the distance between them, but stopped at a nice safe distance away. Close enough so they could be heard, but far enough to remain out of reach should an attack be made.

&quot;Greetings there, Monk! I apologize for interrupting your meditation, but I would like you to answer a few questions of mine.&quot; Guan Yu greeted the monk with a friendly smile. &quot;Firstly, may I know your name?&quot; A light ringing was made when Guan Yu lifted his guandao to point it towards the monk in one quick motion. A Red Steed and a large guandao with a gold dragon motif? An interesting combination indeed.

The presence...it&#39;s gravitas pulls Jampo from the deep, inward recesses of meditation, the monk slowly opening his eyes to take in his visitor...

&quot;...Greetings,&quot; the monk says, slowly, taking this time to absorb the figure before him. The robes, the pointed guandao, the red steed...

Was the Throne truly home to such figures...

&quot;It&#39;s quite alright, my friend, I was nearly finished anyhow. Welcome; I am Jampo. A simple student of the Dharma.&quot; His words are hushed as he waves towards the rider, seemingly beckoning him closer. Of course, such actions might be foolish to Guan Yu, but the monk&#39;s stature shows no ill will, only burgeoning curiosity. 

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind if I ask questions myself, friend, I&#39;m a rather curious soul myself, hehehehehe. But, judging from your clothes...well, I&#39;d rather not get ahead of myself, but there is a City Grail War in progress...you are a Servant, are you not?&quot; <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

&quot;You may refer to me as Lancer. I am indeed a servant. I will make no attempts to hide that fact.&quot; He wasn&#39;t one to deceive others. There wasn&#39;t any possible way that he could explain his attire otherwise. What he can do is attempt to keep his identity a secret for as long as he can. &quot;Now, I do believe it is my turn to continue these strings of questions.&quot;

<strong>&quot;Jampo, are you a Master?&quot;</strong>

The tranquil silence of the temple grounds made his voice carry that much more weight when he posed the question to him. 

&quot;These grounds...Something does seem a little off about them, especially in the air. I wouldn&#39;t have came to disturb these holy grounds if it wasn&#39;t without good reason after all.&quot; Guan Yu hoped that his questions would grant Laura with meaningful information while she did her own thing.

The blunt response surely would be surprising for most participants in a War of any kind, most notably as it would put any Master in direct conflict and danger of direct attack. If anything, one would have to wonder if it was a form of trickery, to just outright answer something so callously...

&quot;My Servant may have wished me to keep such a thing secret, but I can&#39;t call myself a Monk if I choose to lie so blatantly. Of course, Lancer, you&#39;ll forgive me if I refuse to state the class; I had to make some concedings with my partner, after all.

&quot;And am I to assume your good reason for entering these holy grounds is to destroy them if a Servant were here?&quot; The question itself seems loaded, almost accusatory, but not in a way that would betray any form of anger. Lancer might get the impression of being jovially scolded by an elder, one that sees great entertainment in what others find so serious. 

&quot;I&#39;d say, I might be a bit disappointed if that&#39;s the case. After all, you could never disturb these grounds, Lancer, not if you are who I think you are...Guan Yu, Guardian of the Temple?&quot; 

Silence filters between both of them, Jampo taking this moment to stand and stretch his body before smiling once more. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a worldly figure if I didn&#39;t educate myself on all schools and teachings of Dharma, Lancer, including those of Chinese teachings. If I haven&#39;t said so already, it truly is an honor to be in your presence.&quot; The old man says, falling to his knees and bowing before Guan Yu, his head low to the ground, his body exposed. This...might not have been what either Lancer or Laura were expecting. <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

A name she was familiar with. 

The mad monk that was said to destroy entire cities by himself in fits of rage. An unknown entity that roamed the earth for <em>decades</em>. She had witnessed numerous theories and countless rumours about who he was and what his motives were. Some speculated that he was a stray Servant that killed his Master and had somehow eluded Republic&#39;s countermeasures, others argued that he was the result of an experiment that went berserk. 

&#39;Turns out he&#39;s just a total freak.&#39; Thought Laura as she watched him through the hundreds of windows that her bugs provided. 

One thing had remained consistent throughout the theories she came across: The guy was dangerous. <em>Really fucking dangerous.</em> She had no idea what his abilities were, or how powerful he actually was in combat. But two things could be deduced from his words and his mannerism:

One, he had an enormous pool of Magical Energy. Enough to provide his Caster the necessary resources to build his Domain and potentially fight at the same time.

Two, he was confident in his abilities. He was <em>fucking</em> confident.

Declaring nonchalantly that he was a Master wasn&#39;t enough, he also had to <em>bow</em> before an enemy Servant. He was either really, <em>really</em> good. Good enough that he could stand up to a Servant in a fight. Or he had a <em>plan</em>. Perhaps was he trying to bait Guan Yu into his Servant&#39;s domain? 

Flying insects started gathering on top of Jampo&#39;s head. Their incoherent and ever shifting mass eventually amassing into a cohesive form. 

A raised hand. 

The mass of bugs collapsed on itself, revealing one more form.

Crossed swords.</span>

Without a servant protecting him, all it would take is a single well-placed strike to take them out. They could remove the need to fight the servant entirely right here and now...

Guan Yu lifted up his blade slowly. The blade raised like a guillotine to befall upon Jampo...

Though the strike never came. 

Once raised, Guan Yu brought it back and held it upright by his side while he listened to what else the Master had to say.

&quot;I do not hold it against you if you wished to keep your servant&#39;s class a secret. It is expected after all! I only told you mine since you would have to be blind not to pick up on which class I fell under!&quot; With that, he let out a boisterous laughter.

Though the laughter didn&#39;t last long, especially once he suggested destroying the grounds if their suspicions about a servant were true. It didn&#39;t take much to understand their intentions. This is a City Grail War after all. Striking first against an unsuspecting opponent would be grant the other side quite the advantage early on. 

It was his goal from the beginning to prevent as much damage to the temple as possible. Just as he was about to state that, he froze.

<em>&#39;I didn&#39;t expect to be figured out this quickly, but given who they were, I shouldn&#39;t really be surprised..&#39;</em> Guan Yu thought to himself with a smirk on his face while he stroked his beard. They did run the risk of meeting someone who could spot him out with but a single glance coming here.

What was a truly new experience for him was witnessing Jampo bow in such a way to him. He felt like he was being put on the spot. He still only saw himself as just a warrior yet he was being worshiped as a deity by the monk before him!

Guan Yu noticed the signs from his Master and understood them. <em>Not now.</em>

&quot;You humble me, monk. No. <em>Jampo</em>. It is truly relieving to find a honourable man such as yourself so early in this war! Please, call out your servant! It would be a shame to end a warrior like yourself without first allowing you to fight back at your fullest! Grant me this honour as one warrior to another!&quot; Once he finished those words, Guan Yu flourished his blade and had Red Hare rear up to strike an impressive pose!

Guan Yu. Fierce deity of war, Guardian of the Temple, The Righteous Bodhisattva that leaves behind Nirvana for the sake of purging those on Earth of their misery. Selfless but boisterous, the Servant personifies all that Jampo might have seen from those that worship him...but that also places him in a bind. 

&quot;Hmm...<strong>I refuse.</strong>&quot; 

The echo from Guan Yu&#39;s prior shouts nearly overtakes Jampo&#39;s words, but the monk&#39;s eyes say portray the message just as strongly. A Master...refusing to fight? 

&quot;Irony is not lost on me, Guan Yu. A participant of a City Grail War refusing to fight? But, my answer remains the same, for I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve confused two terms, my friend...&quot; Jampo says, calmly, rising on his legs as the wind catches his robes. They sway, gently in the breeze, caressing the monk&#39;s peak condition as he raises a hand, though this time in a submissive manner, one asking for mercy. Surely Laura would be quite confused...was this really the monster she had heard about?</span>

&quot;For one, I grant you thanks for your praise; it&#39;s a humbling gesture, Great Protector, but one I cannot accept. I am not a warrior. A warrior is one that fights valiantly, not only because they are expected to, but because they desire to. A warrior feels at home in the midst of a battle...and that is something I could never feel. I do not fight in such spectacle...the thought would pain me so. I am a monk. I do not seek desire...I seek contentment. And that is only achievable with the Temple.&quot; Jampo&#39;s words flow in much the same manner as the nearby stream, cool and elegant while full of thrust and drive. There was no hint of deceit...if either scanned his words, they would see all too well that Jampo was a man of his word. He would not fight...not yet, anyway. 

&quot;And the second...well, I couldn&#39;t grant your request even if I wanted to, Lancer. My Servant...well, they&#39;ve made it statutory not to commence in battle. Not yet. I&#39;m afraid that your only means of appeasing your own Master would be to kill me here and now, and to go against your own desire and honor. It would be a pity to try such a thing, wouldn&#39;t it, hehehehe.&quot; 

He was laughing. This Monk just denied Guan Yu his request twice, and he was laughing. The old man settles on the ground once more, folding his legs and bringing his hands together once more in prayer. His eyes sink in, lids falling as he casts his head around, looking for something...</span>

&quot;Hmm...Lancer, your Master is here, aren&#39;t they? From my knowledge, only Archers normally manifest with Independent Action...though I cannot sense them. I suspect it&#39;s foolish to ask, but part of me was hoping to speak with both a Servant AND their Master. It would make a pot of tea that much more enjoyable...it&#39;s been quite a bit since I&#39;ve been able to drink in another&#39;s company. At least one where the other enjoys the quiet, hehehehe.&quot; 

Jampo was strange. Perhaps stranger than what either Guan Yu or Laura were expecting from their first opponent in a City Grail War. Perhaps...this was a gift? Though there was also the case of his Servant...it might be easy to take on Jampo, but neither had a read on his Servant. If it was a Caster like they expected, it might be dangerous to act this second...</span>

As much as she tried to keep a neutral face as she sat on the side walk, her eyebrows unconsciously knit. He didn&#39;t want to fight, yet he joined this war as a Master. He sought only happiness and satisfaction, yet was the cause to much grief and had the destroyed so many lives.

The serene, almost solemn way he was conducting himself against the violent and destructive Jampo she had known about. The calm and measured words he spoke versus the precarious situation he was in. 

There was so much <em>dissonance</em>.

Laura isn&#39;t much of a justice aficionado. She wouldn&#39;t care about people dying as long as it didn&#39;t affect her. But right now, the monk that had been so <em>cruel</em> and <em>merciless</em>, had just invited his <em>enemies</em> to drink tea? 

And the worst thing was that he was <em>sincere</em>. <em>Everything</em> about him, from the way he spoke to his body language—It all hinted that, if given the opportunity, he might actually have a tea party with them.

That had irritated her. Just a <em>tiny bit</em>.

She gazed upon the formless mass that had gathered near her while the two men were talking. Not nearly enough to launch a real offensive, but it didn&#39;t matter. It wasn&#39;t her attention, anyway. She took a deep breath and focused, injecting her will into her soldiers.</span>

Bugs. A never ending torrent of bugs was emerging from behind Red Hare. Ants, spiders, centipedes, cockroaches and much more, all swarming towards the temple&#39;s entrance. 

No, towards <em>Jampo</em>. 

Thousands upon thousands of tiny claws, small bodies forming an oppressive carpet that extended outwards, like black paint flowing from a brush. 

Upon reaching a few meters from Jampo, the bugs collectively stopped in their tracks. The flying bugs among them took flight, the crawling bugs started crazily walking on top of one another. Their incoherent mass started taking a form. A <em>humanoid</em> form, endlessly shifting and struggling to maintain its shape.

Their buzzing intensified, disturbing the once peaceful atmosphere of the temple even more. The irregular frequencies at which their wings flew slowly started to coordinate, harmonising to form coherent, <em>familiar</em> sounds.

&quot;Here I am, Jampo. Hope you&#39;ve got enough tea, I&#39;m <em>way</em> thirsty.&quot;

The bugs <em>spoke</em>.</span>

<em>Brandin...hang tightly, I&#39;ll drive them away. We don&#39;t have to fight...</em> 

Jampo turns back to the temple, eyes lowered as he calls out to something. The sound of metal scratching and dragging against stone signals a new arrival. 

A Copper Knight lumbers towards the party, carrying with it a kettle and cups for the &quot;tea party&quot; as Laura called it.

The bugs turned in sync towards the suit of armour that approached, sending every little detail that their tiny eyes perceived to their commander.

&quot;Do you talk about the most efficient ways to murder crowds of people?&quot;

A group of ants drifted off from the humanoid figure to briskly swarm towards the Copper Knight, treading through every nook and cranny of the living armour with their claws.

&quot;Or do you prefer speaking about how great it feels to establish a Domain in a <em>densely populated area</em> that wasn&#39;t labelled as battlegrounds for the City Grail War?&quot;

The voice that emanated from the bugs was flat and without any pause. No inflection, no accusatory tone. It sounded like a text-to-speech program that was broadcasted through an old radio.</span>

&quot;It also seems as if you are not in the mood for tea...since you are so curious, fellow Master, I&#39;ll enlighten you a bit.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps we should discuss such things, Master of Lancer. Such as seeking out said Domain to enact violence. I do not consider myself holier than thou, but I do consider myself more honest in this instance. Was it your plan to kill a Master first? Is that why we are here? Is that why you have a Swarm infesting my Copper Knight...&quot; Jampo says, a hand reaching up and folding in on itself. Bending, clawing...

&quot;I am not a warrior, that stands steadfast, Master of Lancer. But a Monk defends his temple...and I will do just that. If you plan to kill me, then do so. <strong>Try.</strong> However, if you know as much about me as you do, you must know that won&#39;t be easily done. I am willing to speak. I am also willing to fight. But that depends solely on you...&quot; Jampo&#39;s body moves in tandem with his words, his hands pointing and his body seeming to harden as muscles bulge against his robes, the &#39;Mad Monk&#39; looking a bit more furious as he levels his gaze on his guests. Even so, he was placing the ball in their court...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;You...refuse?&quot; The answer had the warrior so dumbstruck that he could only utter two words. 

Despite being summoned in a City Grail War rather of a Holy Grail War, It was his understanding this was still a <strong>Grail War</strong>. And yet their opposition is declining to fight all together. Was that an option? Could they do that?

However, when the words reached his ears about having to go against his code of honour to win this battle, he knew what was going on. It was quite clever of him. Without needing to lift a finger, Jampo has effectively trapped Guan Yu in check. 

Impressive.

<em>&#39;Well played, Jampo...&#39;</em> A smirk formed on his face. This cunning act was deserving of respect. 

Soon his Master joined them. The level of control she had over the bugs exceeded his expectations when she not only was able to join them remotely but also speak! His Master had made her move. Now he needed to keep an eye out to make his next one.

His interest was drawn to the Copper Knight approaching them. A machination? What kind of Caster used automatons? Guan Yu combed through the knowledge given to him by the Throne to determine who might be their Servant from this one clue. It wasn&#39;t easy but it was better than nothing. Although, just that one clue wasn&#39;t enough to provide any meaningful information. They could be completely unrelated for all he knew. This is a different era after all.

He wasn&#39;t given long to ponder though. The rising heat coming from the monk drawn back his attention. 

&quot;We still don&#39;t know their servant&#39;s capabilities, Master.&quot; Guan Yu&#39;s grip on his weapon tightened in response as the tensions continued to rise in the air. Soon it will reach its breaking point. &quot;However, not of that may matter should they arrive too late to aid their Master...&quot; Should his Master go on the offensive, he will be obliged to defend her as her blade should she be met with resistance. Maybe this way they could force their servant&#39;s hand to act...</span>

Laura pondered the meaning behind those words. He had meant to enlighten her, but only managed to add to her inquiries. He hinted that he could not control &#39;things&#39; about him. Was he talking about his destructive tendencies? Was he much more <em>freaky</em> that she initially thought? 

The way things unfolded, the &#39;best possible match-up&#39; was going to be a bit trickier. They had just met one of the strongest Magic users she had known about and he was looking a bit <em>unstable</em> at the moment. 

One good thing <em>did</em> come out from their exchange. Jampo seemed to be easily swayed by her words, judging by his initial reaction to her taunts. There was maybe a flaw, a <em>weakness</em> to be exploited here.</span>

&quot;The reason as to why we&#39;re here should pretty obvious by now, but please don&#39;t <em>misunderstand</em>.&quot;

As they talked, more bugs gathered in the temple&#39;s courtyard, reinforcing the swarm&#39;s structure. It looked more humanoid and more stable with each passing minute. Hand gestures were now accompanying it&#39;s speech and it&#39;s position shifted as it talked.

The significant change in temperature didn&#39;t seem to affect the bugs very much. Hell, they seemed to be even more active than before.

&quot;We&#39;ve got nothing personal against you, old man. The fact that we&#39;re here is an <em>inevitability</em>. Not only are you an unknown factor that could potentially harm lots of innocents, <em>as you already did in the past-</em>&quot;

The ants purposefully made their way to the cups of tea, swarming them with their overwhelming numbers. Mosquitoes, flies and others flying bugs quickly rejoined them in the tasting of the tea. Crowds of small insects were now frantically piling on the freshly brewed beverages. It was unsightly, to say the least.</span>

&quot;-But you also seem to be <em>Caster&#39;s Master</em>. You do realise that I cannot let that slide easily. If left alone, you&#39;re just gonna grow stronger and stronger in that stronghold of yours, inevitably turning into too big of a powerhouse to face by ourselves after a little while. Our only option if we want a significant chance of taking you down is to fight you <em>now</em>, while you&#39;re still at your weakest.&quot;

The humanoid figure managed to produce a shrugging motion, adding a semblance of character to its monotone speech.

&quot;Us taking the fight to you, regardless of your past endeavours and without knowing the true nature of your Servant, is a <em>bet</em>. It&#39;s us purposefully risking to take a bullet for the greater benefit of both peaceful citizens and Masters alike. Ah, such great guys we are.&quot;</span>

Until now, Laura and Guan Yu had been faced with the kind chuckles of a grandfather, lightly teasing both of his guests in a kindly ancient way of his. 

It was like a switch had been turned. Jampo&#39;s eyes bulge, frantic and racing as he cackles with raucous laughter. His throat was going hoarse, his body trembling as he seems to fight to contain this laughter. His hand wraps around his mouth as he attempts to stifle himself, biting into his own withered flesh, but the muffled laughter continues as the temperature rises more. Steadily, bit by bit, the bugs in the Swarm growing frenzied from the heat as it climbs, Jampo seems to curl in on himself-

<strong>SMASH</strong>

His fist shot out and slammed against the stone of the courtyard, punching clean through and leaving a small crater of rubble and a soft plume of dust. 

His laughter subsides, the heat dissipating as his vacant eyes stare at his handiwork. This Master...they were working to unravel him...they were succeeding. They may not realize it, but they were dangerously close to <strong>it.</strong> 

&quot;...Take the bullet for civilians...how noble you are indeed, Master of Lancer...

&quot;If that is your true mission, I see no fault in that. As I have said, if you wish to strike me, so be it. I can only respond one way...just be prepared for that retaliation. I see we are done talking. Your choice has already been made, so simply act...and I will demonstrate myself at my weakest, as you claim.&quot; 

If Jampo was capable of making a threat, that was a pretty clear one... <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While the conversation played out, Saber watched silently from the inner confines of the temple. The worst possible case scenario was playing out right before his very eyes. A Lancer had found them far too early and a powerful one at that. The famous Chinese General Guan Yu.

In addition, Lancer’s master had sent in a swarm of familiars to act as their stand in. Saber had tried to locate them, but wherever they were, they weren’t within the territory of Dolorous Gard. An unfortunate outcome.

Saber had been content to let Jampo continue his negotiations, there was some juicy tidbits about his Master in the conversation. But Saber could tell that talks were quickly going south. It wouldn’t be long till a fight was inevitable.

Saber began to silently command his Copper Knights, moving them throughout the temple to prepare for battle. Most took up positions near the entrance area with a few reserves hanging back. Saber also sent two out of the Temple and towards the edge of the territory of Dolorous Gard for a special mission.

Saber peered on the conversation from the shadows of a doorway. Jampo stood defiantly before Lancer and his Master, daring them to make the first move. However, while Jampo was merciful enough to let his enemies initiate the battle, Brandin was not and took matters into his own hands.

Even from this distance, Brandin could feel the protection surrounding Guan Yu, backed by a blanket of divinity. Even though Saber’s magics were strong here, that ridiculous level of resistance would protect Lancer from all but the most powerful spells from someone of the Caster class. The Master however, was a different story.

<em>SNAP</em>

With a snap of his fingers, Saber initiated their first battle of the Holy Grail War as a powerful curse ravaged the swarm of insects. Obliterating a chunk of it as the curse ate its way to the very connection Lancer’s Master was using to control the swarm and attacking them directly.</span>

Meanwhile, Laura feels a terrible feedback of magic as the curse strikes at her using her own connection to the insect familiars. She feels her concentration temporarily break before reasserting control albeit a bit shakily. The curse struck her with nowhere near the power it did her swarm, but it lingers on her. She feels that had she’d been standing within the Territory of the enemy servant, she’d be much worse off.

 However, in addition to not being able to control the swarm as well as normal, Laura also feels her mana uncontrollably leaking from her body. The reason why quickly dawns on her as her scouting bugs spot two of the Copper Knights leaving the temple and quickly closing in on her position.</span>

The enemy servant claimed the first blow and in an instant, Guan Yu saw a good chunk of the swarm of bugs get obliterated from what must have been Caster&#39;s spell. 

Guan Yu attempted to retaliate himself and performed a wide swing at the copper knight AND Jampo. Though the thrown teapot threw off his aim which allowed Jampo to avoid the swing much easier. He wasn&#39;t allowed even a second to correct the swing before Red Hare, in a burst of unnatural speed, ran when they sensed danger into a more clear opening on the temple grounds. 

&quot;Argh!&quot; Though he brought up his other arm to shield his face, it didn&#39;t block the contents of the teapot from still spilling onto him. As if the heat wasn&#39;t bad enough!

Fortunately, while these temple grounds were their domain, there was still plenty of open space for Red Hare to ride unhindered! An advantage that they will not let go to waste!

While Red Hare&#39;s speed outmatched even a servant&#39;s with A rank Agility, that wasn&#39;t the most impressive part. It was the level of control that Red Hare, and by extension Guan Yu, had over their speed! Sharp turns and maneuvers could be done without loss of control nor speed. For nothing could rival Red Hare on land! 

&quot;Come, my friend! Let us show them what it means to go up against <strong>us</strong>!&quot; The flaming red hairs from his steed truly appeared as if they were flames with the wind flowing through them. How long has it been since they last rode to battle together?

<strong>The first battle of the City Grail War had begun!</strong>

Jampo&#39;s words fall on vindictive ears as Brandin begins his assault, the monk nearly losing his head to the Protector&#39;s blade. There was just enough time for the monk to bend over, the air above his neck whistling as it missed tender flesh. 

&quot;Oh Saber, what a bind you&#39;ve placed us in...&quot; Jampo whispers to himself, his face falling as he bounds back to his feet, hands at the ready as he takes a combat stance. His feet glide into place, a trail of dust lifting in the air as Jampo levels at Guan Yu, eyeing the flaming mane of Red Hare as it flows in the wind around its own master. A fight with the guardian of the temple...he&#39;d be remiss not to notice the irony. 

&quot;Copper Knights! Come to me!&quot; Jampo shouts, commanding (despite his supposed unwillingness) 7 more Knights to join him in battle, each taking up arms around Jampo. 1 on 1, the odds were not in his favor...perhaps these could even the field. 

Jampo&#39;s field of mana dissipates, retreating into his figure and encompassing himself in a red glow, his eyes taking on the hue as he trains on his opponent. 

&quot;Forgive me, Protector,&quot; he whispers under his breath before dashing forward, Knights following behind in formation. <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span> <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Saber could not help but curse the foolishness of his Master. Revealing his class so easily like that, did he really think that peace was possible when Lancer&#39;s Master was so eager to fight? Such things were of little consequence however compared to the opponent before them. Lancer was the worst possible match up they could&#39;ve had in this early stage. Powerful combat abilities, incredibly high magic resistance, blinding speeds, Brandin scowls as he is briefly reminded of a certain french prince.

The inexperience of command was prevalent to Brandin as Jampo charged in, the open courtyard would be nothing but a liability with Lancer&#39;s Rider-like speeds. It would be smarter to fall back into the temple and use its winding, restricting corridors to limit Lancer&#39;s movements. But, Brandin couldn&#39;t let Jampo die yet so he let the Knights under Jampo&#39;s command follow him into battle.

<em>Hmm, how to approach this? Fighting Lancer head on is a fool&#39;s errand, there&#39;s no way he can be taken down by conventional means without great losses. Killing the Master is the better route, I&#39;d go after them myself but they&#39;re too far outside the Domain of Dolorous Gard. If I went out there, Lancer would have no trouble catching me and striking me down. I&#39;ll just have to hope that my curses weaken them enough for my Knights to finish them off, worst case Lancer has to fall back to save them and give us time to regroup. Unfortunate, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be forced to use the Black Knight this early.</em></span>

It didn&#39;t take long for him to snap, presumably releasing the &#39;thing&#39; which he had no control over. He was slowly transforming into <em>something else</em>. Something her instincts <em>screamed</em> not to fight.

The way his shrivelled muscles were nervously shifting with each movement. His crazed stare that threatened to punch holes through their body. His maniacal laugh. The <em>thing</em> they had in front of them was a 180, or rather a 540 degree turn from the tranquil man they met upon first entering the temple. Laura thought about saying a few more words in an effort to ever so slightly diffuse that situation, but <em>once they start punching through rocks, there&#39;s no going back.</em>

Not only that, but she could feel the control over her swarm <em>slipping.</em> Worse even, her Magical energy was slowly escaping from her body. Was that the work of the enemy Master? No. The field that surrounded him had shrunken. It couldn&#39;t have been him.

<em>It was his Servant&#39;s work</em>. 

<em><strong>&quot;SABER!&quot;</strong></em>

Laura froze upon hearing the monk&#39;s shout. His Servant wasn&#39;t <em>Caster</em>. they had been wrong about the class of their enemy. But there was most certainly a Territory Creation skill that englobed the Buddhist Shrine, how would a Saber have access to such a technique? Not to mention the abundance of Magical familiars that had been invoked, the living armours.

Flying bugs flew deep inside the Buddhist Temple, confirming her suspicions as they gazed upon the white-haired knight in copper armour.

<em>Lord Brandin</em>, the lord of Dolorous Gard.

She didn&#39;t have time to contemplate that revelation before her bugs spotted two of his Copper Knights, running with purpose towards her position. 

&quot;What...?&quot; Exclaimed Laura as she stood up from the sidewalk. How had he known about her location? Did his domain extend far beyond the Buddhist temple?

They were a bit far from her position. She trusted that she could escape them with the help of her bugs, knowing instantly the best route to take thanks to her enhanced spatial awareness. But in her path stood an area densely packed with people. Not only would they hinder her movement, but the sight of two suits of armour running in the streets would surely raise unwanted attention, if not cause total <em>mayhem</em>. Did Lord Brandin also take that into account?

From the looks of it, this battle had turned into <em>race.</em>

Which of them would be faster: Guan Yu as he fought a horde of familiars aiming to strike down Jampo, or those living armours chasing her down across the streets.

She started running away, carefully avoiding busy streets and dead-ends while watching out for the two Copper Knights.</span>

A meaningful pause punctuated that sentence as the insects curiously examined the Copper Knights that stood between them and their interlocutor.

&quot;Turns out that getting chased by two of these monstrosities makes even the most polite of Masters forget their manners. You can call me Laura, o lord of Dolorous Gard.&quot;

The curse that was put on the swarm caused a few bugs to slip out of control, erratically flying towards Lord Brandin before eventually returning to the swarm.

&quot;But I gotta say,&quot; The cloud spoke. &quot;I didn&#39;t think a careful man such as you would risk having his <em>short-tempered</em> and <em>dangerously unstable</em> Master negotiate with the enemy. Alone, nonetheless.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sight of Jampo charging forward with an entourage of knights backing him up told him that his blade missed his mark. Smart thinking on their servant&#39;s part. Quite courageous of him to be charging headlong into battle even after knowing who his opponent is. His respect for Jampo only grew as he witnessed more of his actions.

&quot;Jampo! Your bravery will not be wasted on me I assure you!&quot; Guan Yu shouted in response to Jampo&#39;s bold charge. The only answer Guan Yu thought appropriate was to meet Jampo on the field of glory!

Though the troubling issue wasn&#39;t the Master, but the knights guarding him. Individually, they weren&#39;t that strong. But enough of them would soon overwhelm him if he allowed them to entrap him. He would have to play this carefully lest he gets surrounded and fall to numbers. 

<em>&#39;What an excellent first opponent!&#39;</em> The Copper Knights really gave him the feeling of being on the battlefield once more! 

The open courtyard provided more than enough freedom of movement to make full use of Red Hare&#39;s mobility. This was made evident when Guan Yu charged the right flank of Jampo&#39;s formation to strike at the Copper Knight at the rightmost side before attempting to zip away. If Guan Yu wants to take out their Master without suffering grievous wounds, he would need to cull the Copper Knights with hit-and-run tactics given the speed advantage he has.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The battle had begun, and Jampo was face to face with a legendary figure of his Temple, one that had the inherent ability to skewer him were he not careful. The monk tried brushing up on the Servant classes for this Grail War, so in his mind he knew this was an uphill battle as he dodges Guan Yu&#39;s strike, watching as one of his Copper Knights is skewered and crumples on itself. 

Lancer truly was the worst first match up they could have, Jampo now painfully aware of how outclassed he is out in the open. His chest pounds as the voice tainting his soul hisses once more against his ear: <em>Let. Me. Out!</em>

In defiance, Jampo turns on his heels, facing Guan Yu&#39;s retreating figure before taking a seat. His eyes shut as his palms slap together, a clap resonating with each Copper Knight as they freeze in place. 

Jampo&#39;s mana flows from his body, circling him and the Knights in a barely visible bubble, casting a magical purple hue across everything in its vicinity. The 6 remaining Knights take up their arms, forming a V shape around the monk and raising their weapons against their foe.</span>

&quot;Guan Yu, I suspect you won&#39;t find much contentment with just slapping a follower around. Allow me to even some odds.&quot; 

Jampo&#39;s bubble and his Knights take center stage in the courtyard, taking up nearly the center of the stone stage while leaving the corners free. 

Jampo sits and waits, a reactive fighter to the very end. It seems Guan Yu still had quite the shell to get past in order to get at Saber&#39;s master. 

<em>I&#39;ll have to retreat into the temple. My strikes won&#39;t reach Guan Yu at all, not if he&#39;s a Lancer. His magic resistance will be too much to overcome...I need close quarters to make up the difference...</em></span>

A defensive formation. It aimed to keep him out from the looks of it. The Copper Knights were quick on their feet, but were they quick enough?

Red Hare understood Guan Yu&#39;s intentions and immediately set forth the motions of his plan. Together, they circled their formation to observe them as they built up speed. His gaze was still, analyzing their position and looking for weaknesses. 

Dust was kicked up from the pent up momentum until the moment happened.

&quot;<strong>Now!</strong>&quot; 

Once enough speed was built, Red Hare turned on a dime and leapt towards a gap. Guan Yu swung in a upwards arc with both hands firmly on his weapon. His target wasn&#39;t at the knights nor was it towards Jampo, but directed at the stone stage itself. The heavy blade and momentum would be enough to shatter the stone apart as he aimed to break Jampo&#39;s and the Copper Knights&#39; formation and strike while their grouping was broken.</span>

Was her attention so divided between gathering her forces, looking out for potential dangers, helping Guan Yu out in combat and running away from her pursuers that she had missed a living suit?

She injected more Magical energy into her circuits in an effort to subside the effects of Lord Brandin&#39;s curse. More bugs came under her control as her range ever so slightly increased. Watching through their countless windows suggested that no other knight was leaving the temple, only the two that were already chasing her down. She double-checked, <em>triple-checked</em>, but nothing seemed to have slipped past her net.

&#39;Too bad that you&#39;re actually <em>losing</em> the information war, Brandin.&#39; Thought Laura, smug. &#39;That kinda bluff might&#39;ve worked on someone else, but not on <em>me</em>.&#39;</span>

A Copper Knight suddenly bursted forth from a nearby building not 30 feet away from Laura. Having closed the distance while Laura was busy talking to Saber and scanning the area for the nonexistent third Knight. The curse was affecting her from looking around so much without missing a few details. Its head robotically turned towards her, Laura then realized that the cursed energy was radiating from her body along with her mana being expelled. No doubt a beacon for the Copper Knights to track down. The other Knight was still far away but this one was right on top of Laura. It uneasily began to stumble towards her, sword raised. Laura could tell that it was weaker than ones Lancer was currently facing, perhaps enough for even someone like her to defeat. <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

His face remains set, his body unflinching even as Lancer sent a section of the courtyard into a pile of loose rubble that breaks apart beneath he and the Knights, both falling in tandem...

&quot;<strong>Absolute concentration. Indomitable will.</strong>&quot;

The rubble flies...and then floats. Calmly, serenely, bobbing like bubbles around Jampo&#39;s head as he remains resolute in intention, his face pulled into a mix of dream-like transient thought and intense, furious concentration. The Copper Knights buckled from the lack of footing, but they, too, soon found themselves floating. Each return to the uncracked area of the stone courtyard, before turning on a dime and forming a loose circle around Jampo. 

The monk remains still, his robes now stained by dust and rubble as he eyes Guan Yu. 

&quot;The power of mana for me equates to the power of life, Protector. I call it Qi...and so to how it flows through me, it inhabits all things. My Qi is an extension of myself...those in the West use their key as fuel...whilst I wield it like my own body. <strong>Move in.</strong>&quot;</span>

Jampo gives the order, with at least 3 Knights raising their heads robotically to carry out his will. They launch themselves, swords dragging against the stone and sparking in their wake, a trail between their blades and Guan Yu&#39;s steed. Red Hare was their target, each one approaching in a pincers like movement to restrict Lancer. 

&quot;<strong>I agree with you, Protector: it is an honor to fight one as worthy as you! Do not show restraint just because I am a Master, for I do not carry such distinctions in my my mind! You are MY opponent, and no matter the difference in power, I fight with everything I have! Do not disgrace me...SHOW ME THE SAME!!!!</strong>&quot;</span>

There <em>really</em> was a third Copper Knight that she failed to sense. The realisation as to why he had escaped her bugs&#39; vision quickly dawned on her: Brandin had sneaked in this knight inside the building <em>before</em> the fight started, keeping up with his reputation of being extremely cautious and not taking bets unless he was certain of winning them. <em>What a crafty old man.</em>

Even though that third Copper Knight seemed more clunky and dull compared to the ones fighting alongside Jampo, Laura didn&#39;t want to start a meaningless fight. A lot of energy would be wasted and the other two might catch up. 

Meanwhile, her body had started struggling thanks to the endless running she was subjected to. Leg muscles began to ache, sweat accumulated in a thin layer and air was struggling to enter her lungs. This was getting troublesome, <em>really troublesome</em>.

Unexpectedly, she picked up her pace and ran full speed towards the Copper Knight, closing her eyes to entirely rely on her bugs&#39; vision.

<strong>SLASH</strong>

The Copper Knight brought his sword down, violently slashing across the young girl&#39;s chest. Hopefully, she ducked low enough to dodge the brunt of the attack, as it only succeeded to graze a shoulder. 

She made a sharp 90&#176; turn, taking advantage of the missed slash to get away from the living armour while keeping her momentum. Lungs struggled for breath and shoes pounded heavily across the ground.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After the strike, Guan Yu figured the formation would be broken but that wasn&#39;t the sight he saw when he looked back.

Everything was suspended in the air. It was held there through what he called his &#39;Qi&#39;. Even the Knights were floating. This wasn&#39;t any ordinary Magecraft. This level of control could only be achieved through a lifetime of practice and dedication.

<em>&quot;...Do not show restraint just because I am a Master..&quot;</em>

Time were to have slowed as the three knights charged Guan Yu and Red Hare, hoping to restrict his movements, as he pondered those words. Without realizing it himself, he was holding back. Through his own desire to face Jampo&#39;s servant in honourable battle, he hoped that through harassment and the threat of losing their master would be enough to draw them out. But in doing so led him to holding back. <em>Disgraceful</em>. His duel wasn&#39;t with his servant. His duel was with <strong>him</strong>.

His expression was visible for a split second before he took off to skewer one of the knights on the flank to break through their piercer attack. It was one of determination as the flames of comradery erupted inside of his heart. To think he would insult the enemy master in such a way! Nay! A fellow fighter on the field of war!

Red Hare&#39;s speed seemed to have increased. Jampo&#39;s words lit a fire inside of him. No holding back! It meant that there was more time in-between each attack due to needing to adjust more and come back around, but they came at frightening speeds! 

<strong>&quot;Forgive me, Jampo! It was true I held back in hopes of facing your servant, but in turn I only served to insult you! Now, bear witness to why they call me Guan Yu, TAOIST GOD OF WAR!&quot;</strong>

One might think Jampo would regret his choices, having fired up his opponent in such a way.

But all the monk has in response is a smile. Soft and inviting. 

<em>Brandin, forgive me. I know how I act may be foolish in a War such as this...but I cannot abandon who I am. To fight with honesty, fervor, and in full capability...that is the only way to fight. I act as a Guardian, which means I must defend to my utmost ability. If it means stirring the flame of passion and honor in others and inviting the blowback, then so be it.</em>

A vein throbs against the monks hands as he concentrates, remaining still as the 3 Knights around him move in between the Monk and Lancer. Between he and his guard, the rubble from Guan Yu&#39;s attack floats and piles together, forming a makeshift wall to act as another layer of protection. The other 2 Knights left in Guan Yu&#39;s wake stir to life, rushing back to their Master. Lancer&#39;s speed was far too much for either Knight to keep up with, meaning they would need their master to get creative...

&quot;My Knights, cover your Master!&quot; Jampo shouts, eyes glowing bright in ferocity as he grits his teeth against the welling fury. 

The two approaching Knights jerk their head at the command, one tossing a sword to the other while continuing to rush for Jampo. The other spins briefly before lobbing both Swords towards his Master, both racing through the air for either side of Jampo in an attempt to corral Guan Yu away from approaching, presenting the possibility of being skewered by either blade.</span>

The swords was a smart move to make. It made approaching Jampo quite dangerous. He would not be able to without suffer a blow from them if he came in for an attack; straight on at least. A grin formed on his face once he saw what kind of defence Jampo put up between them. 

Between him and Jampo were three Copper Knights, but most importantly in front of the Knights was a makeshift wall that formed shortly after. 

&quot;There&#39;s no use hiding any of our tricks, my friend!&quot; Guan Yu shouted to Red Hare before letting loose a booming warcry as they charged straight for the wall itself. It was time to show them that speed wasn&#39;t Red Hare&#39;s only trick in the bag! 

The golden armour on Red Hare&#39;s hooves began to glimmer once they reached the wall. Instead of ramming into it and either coming to a full-stop or bursting through, the pair simply ran up the wall as if it was flat ground that continued onward! 

Once they reached the top of the wall, Red Hare leapt up and over Jampo. The heavy blade from Guan Yu swung towards him in a downwards arc at same time as the leap. The ringing of the blade rang through the wind as it made its way towards the target. This blow wasn&#39;t meant for any of the Knights this time...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The legend continues to amaze. Jampo is left speechless, watching his opponent defy his defense and simply run over the erected wall. His judgment was set as Lancer&#39;s weapon swings down to deliver a fatal blow to Jampo. The monk glowers inward, teeth clenching tight as he turns in place. 

The bubble vanishes, along with the stone wall crumbling on top of his Copper Knights, each one statutory as they wait for further commands. At this speed, Guan Yu&#39;s blade would slice Jampo&#39;s head open like a melon, and with such strength, he wasn&#39;t sure he could fight back...

Jampo turns, steam wafting from his trembling body as he fights back the welling urges inside. 

<em>Kill. Maim. Rip. Destroy. Destroy.</em> <strong>DESTROY.</strong>

<strong>CLAP!</strong>

Steel rings as something meets with the blade of Guan Yu...Jampo&#39;s hands. Both clap together against the Guandao&#39;s flat ends, the tip of the blade mere inches from the monk&#39;s face as Lancer&#39;s strength carries him up. His ascent reaches its peak, and Jampo releases his hold, flying back...towards the temple. 

The journey was short, with the Monk landing mere feet away from the entrance, his body crumpling against the stone courtyard. Shakily, the Monk rises, his robes suffering a cut across his chest...along with a nasty slice across his bare skin. His robes, stained with blood, dampen his bright wardrobe as he catches Lancer in his gaze. Even in the face of such trials...he will not falter.</span>

&quot;Copper Knights...your enemy is risen...<strong>STRIKE!</strong>&quot; Jampo commands, his voice hoarse as his body continues trembling. He clasps a hand over his face, as if to push something back down. 

The Knights spring back to life, the three bladed monoliths turning and dashing for Guan Yu&#39;s expected return to Earth, brandishing blades to catch and slice at Red Hare&#39;s descent. Meanwhile, the two bare handed Knights begin running for Jampo, eager to protect their mana source as the man struggles for dominance in his mind. 

<strong>Let me out...let me kill him...</strong>

&quot;Stay...down...you won&#39;t see light ever again...&quot; 

With this, Jampo pounds his chest, fighting back shivers as he stomps a foot into the stone beneath him, reducing it to rubble. Once more, he takes a meditative stance, his purple field returning as the rubble floats around him, circling his body before launching at Lancer. This clearly wasn&#39;t enough, but this Servant needed to be corralled, at least until he could get inside the Temple.

It was still a serious blow, there is no mistaking that, just not the finishing one Guan Yu figured. Although, He would have been disappointed in him if, after all of that, he fell in just one blow shortly after.

The command against him was made while they were in a vulnerable state. Luckily, their speed and Red Hare&#39;s barding provided sufficient protection. While it was enough to evade one of the swords, the others struck Red Hare&#39;s rear. The blows themselves wasn&#39;t enough to cripple Red Hare, but enough strikes would surely begin to weight on them. The sight of blood from his friend&#39;s injuries brought forth a grimace from him. If he could, he would have directed the blows towards himself, but Jampo both caught him in mid-swing as well as having struck from behind. There was no way he could have done so.

And so both sides drew first blood from each other. 

The other problem with the rubble flying towards him. Luckily, it was simply rubble. A swift change in grip and a short continuous twirl with his blade formed a barrier that got rid of the bigger pieces of rubble. The smaller bits would prove to be nothing more than a nuisance, if anything.

But when he rounded the corner, he saw that he was but a moment too late. More Knights were escorting Jampo into the temple itself with a distinct figure leading them as well. No doubt that&#39;s Jampo&#39;s servant. They were anything but mechanical from the looks of it.  

They both slowed down and kept out of range of both them and the remaining Knights. Whether he liked it or not, their duel seem to have ended for now. &quot;So, you must be Saber. I must admit, I am disappointed that you arrived when you did.&quot; The sight of their servant plus the fact that he heard Jampo refer to him as Saber previously allowed Guan Yu to peer into the knowledge the Throne has given him to further narrow the possibilities of who he could be. &quot;I honestly expected more from a Saber than to simply have Knights fight in his stead.&quot;

Three knights coming in from the streets to her left, one right behind, a fourth seemed to have appeared in front of her. They were effectively closing in on her like a tightly sprung net, and they were dead set on catching her.

She thought back to her options. She had a <em>hand gun</em> in her backpack, a bottle of pepper spray, bottled water and tons of bugs.

None of those things would help, she thought as a nervous smile found its way to her lips. If it came down to fighting she would have no chance of beating them, and besting them in a game of endurance was out of question. They were soulless puppets that didn&#39;t breathe nor sweat while she had a human body with limited stamina. Holding out until her Servant delivered a fatal blow on Jampo was no good either, seeing how the monk had retreated back to Dolorous Gard and was surrounded by copper knights to protect him. 

Calling upon Guan Yu to save her from the knights was also no-go, seeing how the pressure he applied inside the temple was the only viable strategy they had to win this fight. Going through with this option meant effectively losing.

&#39;Think,&#39; she ordered her brain. &#39;Think!&#39;

Her stamina would give out before Guan Yu accomplished his task and she couldn&#39;t defeat the knights chasing her in a fight, her pained chest and aching muscles made it abundantly clear that outrunning the knights wasn&#39;t a viable option either.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">None of her available resources were of any help, none of her options were viable, she was running out of breath and the living armours were getting closer by the second.

To put it simply, she was <em>fucked</em>. Thoroughly.

She kicked the ground hard as she came to that conclusion, perhaps in desperation, putting more distance between her and the knight that was behind her. The fifth changed course as she fearlessly charged into an alleyway, dodging every obstacle with incredible ease as if she knew that path by heart.

Her movements dropped in speed. She felt the immense weight that her feet carried with each step, the air that struggled to enter her lungs. Only despair awaited her at the end of the alleyway.

<em>And then it clicked.</em>

The angle she tackled this problem from had been wrong from the very start. She didn&#39;t need to <em>outrun</em> the suits of armour. All she had to go was get away from them, or rather get <em>them</em> away from her.

If the leaked Mana that resulted from the curse was the guiding flame attracted the copper knights to her, the only thing she had to do to get away was to <em>snuff out</em> that flame.

To do so would mean completely exhausting her resources. Not an ounce of Od was to be left in her body for it to work. Then she would be invisible to the copper knights and could safely get away. 

That plan wasn&#39;t with any risks. Mana exhaustion put a huge strain on the user&#39;s body, rendering them extremely weak for some time. It could even lead to death, in some cases. 

It was a bet, a <em>risky bet</em>, but Laura wasn&#39;t one to turn down hazardous plans as long as they worked out.

She concentrated, felt her magical circuits warming up as she injected more and more of her Od into them, forcibly squeezing every last bit of strength out. Her control over the bugs started fading away, her muscles gave in to the accumulated wear, and suddenly—

She disappeared from the face of the earth.</span>

All at once, the insects flailed in a yet unseen frenzy. They bit, collided with walls at full speed, flew in every possible direction, buzzed the loudest yet. It was utter <em>chaos</em>. The black dots spread across the battlefield, tainting it with their dark-brown hues.

But soon after, the bugs collectively <em>collapsed</em> on the ground. Lifeless.

Jampo struggles against the grips of the Copper Knights escorting him inside of the temple, restricted and otherwise relegated to that of a child being saved from a bully by some big brother. 

In the midst of his struggles, however, Jampo notices something else...The Swarm. While he had tolerated the swath of insects, he had not paid the most attention to the audience of his battle with Guan Yu, the droning buzzing becoming more akin to background noise. But now, as the droning rises in crescendo, the insanity of their flight rose and saw the insects begin to fall one by one. The Swarm was dying...

&quot;...Saber, did you...did you kill Lancer&#39;s master?&quot; 

The monk&#39;s limbs drop as he falls against the Knights, his face in a swirl as he tries to process the information. Saber...had Saber killed someone? 

<em>Death is something that only acts as a gate...but the taking of life...that&#39;s a sin that paints any soul in a cloak of darkness.</em> 

Jampo remains silent as the Temple takes him, the shadows of the wall giving Jampo a glimpse into his own soul. The Master of Lancer...their words now echo in his chest as he recounts the depth of his actions...</span>

“I’m simply being tactical here. Why fight a meathead like yourself where you have the upper hand when I can wear you down with my loyal subjects?” There was definitely some frustration behind the taunting in Saber’s voice.

“Now, unless you plan on getting off your high horse, we’ll be taking our leave now.”

With that, Saber, Jampo, and the remaining Copper Knights disappeared inside the temple. A place where Saber would no doubt hold the home field advantage.</span>

It appeared that he was too late. Even if Saber were to be too late in saving his Master like he did, it would have resulted in both of them losing their respective Masters in the end. 

Without a master to supply him with Mana afterwards, he wouldn&#39;t be long for this world. He could flee and find another Master to take him. However, if he did that then there would be no <strong>Justice</strong> for his late Master! 

No.

Fleeing was never an option to begin with. Right here and now, the least he can do is ensure that an eye for an eye is paid in full!

He can worry about forgiving himself for desecrating a holy temple like this later; for Justice needs to be served! 

&quot;SABER!&quot; A bellowing warcry boomed forth from Guan Yu, his face distorted with anger, as he reared Red Hare for a final charge! A wide swing was made towards the doors to weaken them to allow Red Hare to burst through them much easier. The debris shot forth into the temple as the pair made their way into the Temple itself.

The powerful presence from a Servant riding on top of a equally powerful Phantasm beast seeped through the temple, alerting anyone and <em>anything</em> to the Temple&#39;s new guests.

Guan Yu&#39;s suicidal charge showed that he wasn&#39;t going to go out quietly! Not without bringing someone with him first.

<em>It worked.</em> Not an ounce of Magical energy was in her body, but she was <em>alive</em>. Barely hanging on, but alive nonetheless.

As the steps of the knights grew closer, she hauled herself up with an <em>oomph</em> and started moving.

Thanks to her insects, she was fully aware of the nature of her surroundings. It was the edge that let her flee from her pursuers. Leading them into an alleyway first, crossing into a nearby path that connected to a second alleyway, making full use of her petite stature to crawl through the more narrow places and so on. The walking tin boxes had no chance of reaching her, let alone finding her.

Clumsily, but with resolve, she made her way back to the Buddhist temple.

Walking was a pain. Literally. The kind that made you think of every life choice leading to that and wishing you had done things differently. The artificial circuits in her forearms burned to the point where she could hardly lift her arms, her legs were close to giving up with each step they took, but the most pain she felt was in her <em>head</em>. It felt like it had been poked, prodded, beaten and kicked in the dirt, then made to do a marathon after the fact. It was the sort of pain that made <em>everything</em> hurt, and only promised more pain for each taken step.

As she slowly walked towards the temple, her mind wandered somewhere else. For the first time since the beginning of this fight, she had an occasion to deeply contemplate on the current situation.

But would it be worth it? Her head throbbed as she pondered that question. 

Leaving the Saber situation as is and escaping was no-go. They would only get stronger as time goes on and could prove to be a huge problem in the future. On the other hand, taking them out would be really troublesome, especially now that Lord Brandin could focus a hundred percent of his attention towards Guan Yu. What else could be done...

She thought back to her adversaries, reorganising her thoughts carefully.

<em>Lord Brandin</em>. The cowardly and unexpectedly confident control-freak, hellbent on holing up in his little fortress of his. He had familiars at his disposition, perhaps a trump card hidden somewhere inside Dolorous Gard, but he himself was weak. Weaker than his Master, most likely.

<em>Jampo</em>. The not-so-stable monk that fought a Servant head-on. He made it clear from the get-go that he didn&#39;t want to fight. Nothing surprising considering that he was Master to a Caster-ish Servant that relied on his domain. But more than that, his seemingly genuine attempt to keep things civil, even offering to talk with his opponents around a cup of tea—that had particularly piqued her interest.

If it&#39;s Jampo and his pacifism, coupled with Lord Brandin&#39;s arrogance and cowardice, then maybe...

She nodded to herself as she found her path to the temple. She had a plan, now.</span>

Perhaps it was the slow draining of vital blood that was causing the monk&#39;s mind to wander, his breathing becoming ragged as Brandin&#39;s Copper Knights brought him into a separate room of the temple. Their metallic hands apply pressure as they lay Jampo on a mattress, giving the Master another glimpse into the changes that had befallen this sacred place ever since his alliance with Saber. The wooden support was making way for cobblestone, and previous statues to Buddha were slowly morphing into crosses and stained glass. The natural light outside was being replaced with a strange rainbow beam...artificial. 

<em>She knew. What if the others do?</em> 

The monk strains against the familiars, his heart pounding and only gushing more blood from his open chest as he searches for Brandin. Their first battle...and they killed someone...

<em>You knew what a Holy Grail War was. It destroyed the world, fool. You knew you couldn&#39;t maintain peace.</em> 

&quot;Brrrandin...Brandin...&quot; Jampo croaks, weakly, searching for his Servant in the darkness. He couldn&#39;t be alone...not with these soulless automatons...not with his thoughts...with <strong>it.</strong> 

<em>Brandin knows the true path to power. This world is built by the strong...be strong. Release me. It will happen in due time. I only must wait.</em> 

&quot;Brandin...Brandin, what have we done...&quot; The monk whispers, eyes watering and looking for some answer. Some recompense or compassion.

Behind them, the sounds of an enraged Lancer echoed through the halls. Saber flicked his hand and a group of Copper Knights split off from the main group to try and slow Lancer down.

Saber then flexed his hand and recalled the cursed energy back to him. The mana from Lancer&#39;s master had vanished but he hadn&#39;t heard the confirmation of their death from his Knights on the outside. Saber didn&#39;t know if they were dead or not but the curse would be needed to help finish off Lancer, even if the effects were extremely minor. The Black Knight could take care of the rest.

Brandin then turned his head to the pathetic cries of his Master. The mere thought that they had killed Lancer&#39;s Master appeared to have nearly broken the man. A ghastly prospect of things yet to come.

&quot;This is the price of your noble ambition Master.&quot; Brandin responded in a firm but understanding tone. &quot;Morals and doing what is good are sweet when applied to the individual. But for those who aim bigger, reality is far more cruel. No change can be made in society without sacrifice. Even the most noble knights have stained their hands with blood. Even the most fair and honest kingdoms are built upon the corpses of their rivals.

He would have just his own mana reserves to rely on. Would he even be able to unleash his Noble Phantasm? If he did then it would be extremely likely that he would simply disappear mere moments after.

Once inside, the signs of the temple&#39;s conversion were more obvious. The outside looked normal, but the inside was beginning to look like something else entirely. Maybe he didn&#39;t even need to forgive himself. This place wasn&#39;t the holy place it appeared to be from the outside anyways.

Without any sort of scouting done beforehand, one could easily get lost. Guan Yu had a trail to follow, luckily. The blood spilled from Jampo allowed him to continue his beeline towards his targets. Though his target wasn&#39;t Jampo himself at this point. He wasn&#39;t the one who slain his master after all. 

He knew he was heading the right way when more of Saber&#39;s Copper Knights came to stop him. Or at the very least slow him down.

Soon after the command was given out, sounds of fighting could be heard. Guan Yu was deep inside the enemy&#39;s castle and thus had no hesitation or intention of holding back. The threat of Guan Yu continued to grow throughout the grounds.

The aura coming from the heart of the temple was almost suffocating. His instincts as a warrior warned him about continuing onward with his task of ensuring that Justice is served. Saber was hiding something...

He hoped that he could deal with him swiftly enough before Saber could make full use of whatever they have in store.

&quot;End of the line, Saber. Enough running. Face me so you could salvage whatever honour you may have.&quot; Guan Yu stopped and spoke within earshot. If he planned to use his Noble Phantasm as his final farewell, he would need a running start...

A massive source of power that had to be the reason behind Saber&#39;s abilities. However, Lancer&#39;s view was quickly blocked by a large shadow in the doorway.

A great and terrible Black Knight squeezed through the doorway. Its horrific power radiating from its jagged black armor and glowing red eyes. Lancer could immediately tell that this warrior greatly outclassed every enemy he had faced so far and to an extent, even Lancer himself. A gout of flame spewed from the Black Knight&#39;s helmet as it single mindedly began to approach Lancer.

Intruders. Enemies to the Black Well. It would remove them immediately and with impunity.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The cold wind blew past Guan Yu. Even with the wind gone, the cold presence stayed. So this was Saber&#39;s Trump card. His <em>Champion</em>. 

The sight of such a mighty warrior made quite the grin show through. It really did feel like he was back in his era. Copper Knights were the foot soldiers and this Black Knight served as Saber&#39;s blade. 

How many famous warriors did Guan Yu clash against during his time? How many challenged him before his demise? The answer was simple. Not enough. There were too many that he wished to have clashed blades against. Some of them he even wished to fight a second time! 

This Black Knight was no different compared to them. 

If he were to succeed then it only made sense that he should best the enemy&#39;s champion!

&quot;The Saber class seemed to have been wasted on you...&quot; This was said with a hint of sadness rather than venom. It wasn&#39;t meant as a jab towards his capabilities either. What Saber have shown was definitely worthy of the most powerful class. What it was towards was the lack of honour to face him head on. Instead, he got all of these automatons from Saber. There was no honour in that...

&quot;If you have no pride as a warrior, then I gladly face off against the only things that do!&quot; This time this one <strong>was</strong> said with venom.

It didn&#39;t take long until Black Knight pushed him back. His swings didn&#39;t do much either as they were pushed back just as easily.

Guan Yu had to rely on hit-and-run tactics just to survive. The sounds of a titanic battle could be heard from the outside. The dark insides were lit with flames and sparks alike occasionally. This Knight. No. This THING bested Guan Yu in all but two areas. If he didn&#39;t have Red Hare to keep him mobile enough and his Eternal Arms Mastery Skill being as high as it was, he knew that he wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it out of the hallway. 

The end of the battle came when Guan Yu came bursting through the walls of the temple onto the ground and Red Hare came running out of another hole made by their battle. His armour cut by strikes he couldn&#39;t dodge. Blood dripped from wounds he had to take. If it wasn&#39;t for his Endurance, he wouldn&#39;t even be able to stand right now. If this continued any further then neither side could walk away claiming they&#39;ve won. 

&quot;Tough bastard...&quot; Guan Yu said with a smirk as he got up using his weapon to help prop himself back up. Red Hare soon joined his side again. &quot;Who would have thought that they had something like that hiding in their basement...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Legs throbbing, head hurting, chest rising up and down: the pale-blue eyes finally gazed upon their objective—the Buddhist temple. 

When her arms didn&#39;t respond to her commands, Laura turned and twisted her shoulders to make her backpack fall on the ground. With what little strength she had left, she reached inside and took out a blister pack.

<em>Mana Batteries.</em>

She popped one and gulped it down without hesitation. They were originally meant for Servants, but a Magus with sufficient Magic Circuits could probably handle one or two. <em>Probably.</em> 

The pill was tiny, odourless and tasteless—so subtle that she thought she hadn&#39;t swallowed it, but what came afterwards quickly dismissed that doubt.

Like a gentle fire warming her up from the inside, she felt her energy coming back, filling her previously drained magical circuits with power. It was like taking a fresh breath of air after rising to the surface of the water, only that it kept going further and further. Even her body was responding slightly better.

She crossed past the gate leading to the courtyard, her head turning left and right as she analysed the battlefield. Traces of rubble, cuts on the ground, a few copper knights laying still, her <em>insects</em> also laying still. Some of those who escaped her control were bathing on what remained of the tea served by Jampo, feasting upon the sugary beverage without a care in the world. She reached, forced her will upon them and made them stop. 

But more importantly, the place was awfully quiet. Deserted, even. Not a trace of Jampo, Saber&#39;s knights nor <em>Guan Yu</em>. *

Had he entered Dolorous Gard? The thought alone was enough to give her a tight feeling in her stomach. Not only was it reckless, but her plan wouldn&#39;t work if they were fighting their guts out.</span>

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

At this exact moment, Guan Yu had been thrown through Dolorous Gard&#39;s wall and into the courtyard, appearing right in front of her. She stumbled back in shock, almost falling on her butt.

Her reaction was a mix of relief, seeing how he hadn&#39;t gotten himself fatally hurt, and of confusion in regards to the state he was left in. As she wondered who—or <em>what</em>—could have possibly done that, the sight of the Black Knight standing on the other side of the hole came to answer that.

The relief overpowered her worries, though. She lumbered across the courtyard towards her Servant, walking with slow and uncoordinated movements that threatened to make her fall at any moment. She wanted to put a hand on one of his shoulders, but her dangling arms didn&#39;t respond. A shame, she really wanted to startle him.

&quot;<em>Fuck me,</em>&quot; Swore Laura, walking to the other side of Guan Yu, observing his opponent. &quot;You fought this dude and lost? Way to go, mister <em>God of War</em>.&quot;

As the long-bearded Servant turned his attention towards her, she flashed him her signature smirk. <em>She was okay.</em>

She reached for her newly gained magical energy and pushed, taking once more control of the piles of bugs that surrounded her.</span>

One of the previously still bugs started buzzing, slowly flying up towards the sky. One more took flight, then two more. Ten more. A hundred—nay, a thousand more.

<em>They had resurrected.</em>

All of them flew and crawled with intent towards the deep confines of Dolorous Gard, approaching Jampo and Lord Brandin with their overwhelming numbers.

Just before making contact, they collectively stopped. The flying bugs amassed to form neatly organised rows in front of the two, and so did the crawlies. 

They were observing the monk and his Servant from their countless windows, utterly still and docile.

&quot;Hum,&quot; A sound akin to a coughing. The bugs spoke once again. &quot;First of all, I&#39;d like to congratulate our boy Brandin for his cunning and strategic mind. It took me a while to figure out that your knights didn&#39;t have eyes and that something was leading them to me. And planting knights inside the buildings before our fight even took place? That&#39;s pretty damn smart. Bravo.&quot; 

The bugs collectively clapped, or rather hurled their bodies into one another, making a sound that vaguely resembled clapping.

&quot;And I&#39;m not trying to take away from our monk&#39;s incredible skill. I don&#39;t think anyone else could go hand-to-hand with Guan Yu and still leave in one piece. Bravo to you too, old man. And I wish you the best of luck to recover from that wound.&quot;

The bugs clapped one more. This time, a long silence extended. As if the bugs were reflecting on their next words.

&quot;I recalled something about you wanting to talk in the beginning?&quot; The swarm finally spoke. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve had a lot of time to reflect on this whole situation while getting chased by those armour fucks. I will try to summarise my thoughts and go straight to the point.&quot;

One more silence extended before they went on.

&quot;As it stands now, the only path that awaits us is that of <em>mutual destruction</em>. Therefore, I&#39;d like for us to stop fighting for a while. A truce, if you will.&quot;</span>

Jampo&#39;s wheezing carried him through the clash between Guan Yu and their Black Knight, the smoldering form of Brandin&#39;s champion pushing back the monstrous strength of Lancer and sending the Protector back outside. Jampo had tried to lift himself, but the wound was too much and forced him back down. How could he continue if their existence was killing those unfortunate enough to cross their paths...

But she was alive. The Master of Lancer&#39;s bugs flew in to greet both he and Brandin, a welcome sight of relief as Jampo mustered his strength. 

&quot;<strong>BRANDIN, ENOUGH!</strong>&quot; He called. Despite the wound in his chest, there was enough strength  behind it to demonstrate a level of authority he hadn&#39;t shown before. 

&quot;I&#39;m to assume Lancer still has another trick...a Noble Phantasm we haven&#39;t paid witness to. I believe you are correct...if we were to push ourselves, we would lead ourselves to oblivion. A truce sounds more than ideal<em>gasp</em>.&quot; 

Jampo&#39;s breath hitches as he lies back down, the automatons surrounding him continuing to apply pressure on his wound. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you are alive, Master of Lancer...&quot; <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="SHDWSPRTN#2375">@Sieg</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

Getting scolded by a man such as Jampo didn&#39;t look very fun. He could really carry his voice far, despite the gaping wound that he previously received in combat. Motherfucker was <em>tough</em>.

Unexpectedly, he also accepted her proposition in the blink of an eye, showing that he was as perceptive as she was in regards to their current situation. She had expected resistance to her proposal, was prepared to argue and to fight tooth-and-nail in case they rejected her offer, but it seems like there was no need for that. A surprising but quite welcome development.

But even more than that, what really astonished Laura was his last statement. 

<em>I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re alive.</em>

She unconsciously showed surprise on her face. 

For starters, it seemed like he reverted back to his <em>tranquil persona.</em> But still, did he not realise how contradictory he acted by saying that, seeing how his Servant chased her around town and almost skewered her with his familiars? 

...No, that behaviour could be explained if he did not get along well with his Servant, which would also explain why he was constantly screaming at him since the fight began. 

Or perhaps—</span>

Brandin looked at the Black Knight. If he had complete control over it, they could finish Lancer right then and there. But since Lancer had been ejected from the temple it went into a somewhat dormant state and Jampo’s attitude certainly wasn’t helping.

“Speak then.” Brandin said to the swarm. <span class="mention" title="Spiritssss#5397">@Spirits</span> <span class="mention" title="Killer#6882">@Killer</span> <span class="mention" title="Mr.Diddles#9442">@Mr.Diddles</span></span>

With what he had seen so far though, he began to doubt that even a direct hit would be enough to finish off the Black Knight. He might as well try however. What does he have to lose after all?

&quot;Come, Red Hare. Let&#39;s us sho-!&quot; A large gathering of Mana was gathering around Guan Yu before it was quickly dispersed when the sound of a familiar voice was heard. Quickly, he turned to see whether or not the voice belonged to who he thought it did.

He was at a lost for words. She was alright. Though, she appeared to have went through the same wringer as he did. Once the initial shock of seeing her alive and well, he couldn&#39;t help but laugh. So far the Masters he had seen had surpassed his expectations by a great number! 

&quot;I had that thing on the ropes, Miss Hess! Trust me. One more good strike was all I needed.&quot; Guan Yu said with a smile. Whether that was true or not was shown through how much damage he had on him compared to the scratches he caused to the Black Knight. For now, it seemed that he can rest for a bit...

Once. Twice. Thrice. 

Somehow the silence gave him the benefit of seeing if he perhaps had heard wrong...but he knew better. His hearing was sublime, after all...

&quot;...Uh...I...

&quot;<strong>What are you talking about!?! Y-you&#39;re mistaken, completely! I&#39;m a monk, how can you say such things so blatantly!!! Shame! Shame!</strong>&quot; 

Blood spurts, though not from Jampo&#39;s chest. The old man brings a trembling hand to his face, wiping across his lip and pulling back bright and fresh blood, heated by embarrassment and indignity. The monk trembles in the throes of his two Automatons, both of which were struggling to hold down a truly embarrassed old man. 

&quot;And what&#39;s this about a young girl?!?! How old are you?!? I would never, especially with a child?! How are you able to say such lies, take those words back now!!&quot; 

It might be best to continue on to conditions of the truce, as it would appear Jampo was more concerned with his image at this point...

Seeing him in such a sorry state told her all she needed to know; his opponent was no push-over. Even from a good distance, she could feel the black knight&#39;s maleficent and oppressive aura. Completely different from the foot soldiers they had been up against.

&quot;Still, you&#39;ve done more than enough for today.&quot; She spoke, leaning on him for support. &quot;I&#39;ll handle the rest.&quot;

Even as her chest was rising up and down from exhaustion and her legs were shaking because of the strain, her stare was focused. <em>Sharp</em>. She had regained that aura of confidence she had showed upon their first meeting.

The teasing came to a sudden halt as Lord Brandin interjected with his firm voice, injecting the situation with much needed seriousness. He was surely the straight man out of the two, Laura pondered.

&quot;Erm, right.&quot; Answered the swarm. &quot;The truce.&quot;

The bugs ceased squirming and went back to their previously docile behaviour.

&quot;My terms are as follows—&quot;

&quot;First, this fight immediately ends. No more blood spilling, we each go on our separate ways and we leave it at that.&quot;

&quot;Second, if we happen to meet each other somewhere down the line, which is quite unlikely since you&#39;ll be <em>staying here</em>, we won&#39;t go at each other&#39;s throats. Not for the next few weeks, at least.&quot;

&quot;Third, if you happen to be fighting someone, make sure not to harm nor alert any civilian in the process. I&#39;m not too keen on attracting <em>unwanted attention</em>, and I&#39;m sure that you aren&#39;t either.&quot;

&quot;Finally, I will plant a few colonies of bugs inside of Dolorous Gard to ensure that you&#39;re not breaking any of the previous terms. I&#39;ll make sure to keep them out of sight, you won&#39;t even <em>know</em> that they&#39;re here.&quot;

The swarm stopped, sizing up the two men&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Do you agree to these terms, gentlemen?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jampo&#39;s face flutters as he reels from the feisty attitude of this young Master. What impudence...

Of course, the terms themselves were more than acceptable with Jampo...but he could already sense Brandin wouldn&#39;t be entirely satisfied. The idea of being spied on wouldn&#39;t sit well with him, although it would give Jampo another illusion of company (something he very much would like to maintain.) 

&quot;We did well enough today not to harm any civilians, Master of Lancer. I assure you, it&#39;s my utmost priority to maintain peace, despite what you might think...

&quot;However, it doesn&#39;t sit right with me to have another Master keeping tally on us and have no means of keeping tabs on them. For all we know, you could be using this as a moment to send reports to possible allies in a bid to kill us.&quot; 

<em>Or send them to their deaths,</em> Jampo thought, eyeing the corridor which Brandin occupied. &quot;I&#39;d feel more comfortable if we had a means of spying on you as well. Do you have any complaints, Brandin?&quot; Jampo added, tossing the ball to Brandin to iron out his own details.

&quot;Honestly, I could argue <em>fervently</em> in favour of the monitoring... but I&#39;d rather leave it at that.&quot; Spoke the insects, solemn. &quot;As long as you can abide to the first three terms, I&#39;m more than satisfied.&quot;

The swarm slowly approached the monk, taking a vaguely humanoid form. The form leaned over the monk, examining every little intricacy of his.

&quot;From what I understand, Guan Yu has a nice opinion about you. He <em>respects</em> you, even.&quot; Spoke the swarm, the flying insects collapsing into a hand that pointed towards Jampo. &quot;It&#39;s only because I put my trust in his judgement that I will give up on the monitoring.&quot;

The buzzing started quieting, their sound growing more faint with each passing second. It was as almost as if the insects had relaxed. But surprisingly, the swarm wasn&#39;t any less ominous. A sense of unease would slowly creep upon anybody looking at it. Maybe it was due to their freaky figure or the way they mimicked human behaviour to the point of reaching the uncanny valley, but it seemed like something was <em>off</em>.

&quot;But I will tell you this—we&#39;re not very fond of backstabbers and traitors.&quot;</span>

I would hate to disappoint the protector of Temples,&quot; Jampo says, smiling softly as he refers back to Guan Yu. He might not have made much headway, but few could say that they fought against a facsimile of one of their patron deities. Well, maybe that&#39;s not true, but few could say they survived such an encounter. 

&quot;On my word as a monk, we will honor the tenants of this agreement. May we both meet again by the end of this war. Isn&#39;t that right, Brandin?&quot; 

Jampo throws a cautionary remark to his own servant. He knew Brandin would have words for how Jampo conducted himself, but that could wait. For now, he just wished for this Confrontation to end.
