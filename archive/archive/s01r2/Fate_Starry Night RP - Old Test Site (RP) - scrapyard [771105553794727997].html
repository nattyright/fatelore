Sinmara hadn&#39;t been having a very good time. Soaking up the full force of the Opportunity Rover and its explosion rattled her brain around her skull like a pinball. That was enough to give her a migraine, and that wasn&#39;t made any better by Sandro&#39;s incessant whining. 

<em>&quot;SABER, NO! Don&#39;t blow up that boat! SABER, NO! Stop setting the palm trees on fire! SABER, NO! Why are you setting those bananas on fire, you&#39;re wasting food!&quot;</em>

Gods, what an annoying little twerp. Fortunately, now she had an opportunity to instill some punk rock spirit into Sandro! Now that she knew about the concept of &quot;gasoline&quot;, the future of blowing things up was bright and burning! That was why she arrived at the scrapyard, an arena filled with already destroyed things. Perhaps the boy could learn from experience?

Clapping her hands together, the giantess spiraled around, giant grin on her face as she looked down at Sandro. Today was not going to be a good day for him.

<strong>&quot;Okay, pipsqueak! Are you ready for Sinmara&#39;s Perfect Destruction Class?! If you are, then make SOME NOISE!&quot;</strong>

At least this time Sinmara had chosen a reasonable place to blow things up. No one would miss their garbage, for once Sandro wasn&#39;t stressed to the max.

As Saber asked Sandro to make some noise he glared up at her, giving off a disappointed look that said “Do you really expect me to make some noise?”. Despite his cold demeanor Sandro thought burning some garbage might be a good way to let off some stress. 

He shifted his eyes over to the piles of junk before them. If he really wanted he could burn the whole lot of it. He laughed at how much he could aid Sinmara in her destruction (although he likely wouldn&#39;t), if she only knew that he could make anything flammable she might take more of a liking to him.

“Well i&#39;m not gonna cheer or anything but go ahead give this ‘lesson’ of yours.” He wasn&#39;t quite showing the ‘punk rock spirit’ but it was something at least.

You&#39;d think this would be more in line for a berserker&#39;s den...&quot; Kari said, sidestepping a rather large girder sprawled out on the artificial dirt as she approached the entrance of the scrapyard. &quot;If I would have known this, I would have picked out a bit more rugged outfit. Oh well, we&#39;ve got business to do and a deal to make, come on Ada.&quot;

 Figuring that the master of Saber stayed the same, Kari was looking for a cyborg mercenary by the name of Szrac, as per the information the company web of informants and homuculi had collected for her since the first summoning of Archer. Supposedly, a Saber class servant was spotted heading this direction and it was a better lead than anything Kari had tried before. If there was anyone that could make for an ally of convenience, it would be him and she had the money to insure the deal went through. She even dressed a bit edgier like a femme fatale for the occasion. 

Now they would have to navigate this mess of a location and find the prize in the metaphorical haystack. Who knew how long it would take but Kari was willing to stay way into to the night if need be, the benefits were that good.

Perhaps another technologically inclined Servant? Or perhaps this mercenary is more opportunist than his cover letter let on.&#39;

Ada indulged Kari in small talks as the two picked their way through the scrapyard, sticking out like sore thumbs in their outfits that definitely did not look appropriate for dumpster diving. After all, their goal for the day was to find this potential ally by the name of &#39;Szrac&#39; rather than blend in.

He turned head at the obnoxious yelling coming from the other side of the scrapyard. It would seem that they weren&#39;t the only ones trying to stand out here.

&#39;I can sense mana signatures belonging to a Servant from there.&#39; He nodded towards the source of the yelling, which was hidden behind yet another mountain of trash. &#39;It could be the Saber you&#39;ve been seeking. Permission to, as they have requested, make some noise?&#39;

<strong>&quot;Fine! Okay, the first lesson of Destruction 101 is this - quantity over quality! The more destruction, the better!&quot;</strong> Sinmara triumphantly declared, pulling Laevateinn out of its sheath. <strong>&quot;Here, lemme give you an example...&quot;</strong>

<em>SHWOOM</em>

A dart of flame launched itself forth from the sword, soaring across the hunks of junk and landing into some rotting timber. The wood then burst into flame, slowly spreading to the surrounding garbage bags and discolored &quot;Smellytron the Cyber-Tamarin&quot; shirts. It was a true domino effect! Not particularly subtle, but VERY badass.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro peered towards the pile of garbage that would fall victim to Sinmara’s teachings. Sandro had previously thought his school days over, however it seemed he was now taking an introductory course in destruction. 

Sandro listened to the first lesson questioning if Saber was right. Was quantity over quality really the proper move? After all destroying something with precision would yield a greater success rate then blindly setting things aflame.

“Well… I guess it&#39;s cool” the aristocrat replied scratching his neck as the garbage burned. If being in a dump didn&#39;t already smell bad enough, now he had to stomach the odor of burning garbage. Not only was the odor repulsive he was hoping that a passerby wouldn&#39;t feel the need to investigate why flames were coming from the scrapyard

“Here Saber how about I show you something cool instead?” as Sandro spoke he reached down for a shard of metal sticking out of the garbage. He lifted it up showing it Sinmara. “I&#39;m sure you’re aware that metal does not combust like that wood and cloth over there, instead it melts. That&#39;s because the point of sublimation is much higher than the material&#39;s melting point.” Sandro could spend a long time explaining the science between it but he didn&#39;t think his Servant would have the patience to listen. “However, with the proper touch I can make the point of sublimation more accessible.” 

Sandros eyes closed for a second as he focused on the chunk of metal, after a second he lifted the piece of trash to his cigarette, lighting it aflame as if it were paper. “Well what do you think?”

She turned with Ada as a loud bellow echoed its way through the entire place. Clearly someone was having a good time doing something stupid. Probably just a group of punks breaking some of the junk for an easy out in this depressing city.

&quot;Wait, you think that&#39;s where they are?&quot; Kari said with an edge of skepticism though her expression soon turned mischievous as Ada made his request. She went to fish out several vials from her belt, well two belts this time around, wrapped around her high-waisted leather shorts. &quot;Here, you want to make a statement? Fire off some of these, they&#39;re some pretty volatile stuff!&quot; She flared out her hands as if to mimic an explosion. 

&quot;We need to show this mercenary that we&#39;re just as strong as him, and might makes right for them. The money will only sweeten the deal. So you go up and over and I&#39;ll go around. You got the fireworks, I got the words,&quot; She said before tossing a few more random vials at Ada and then set off towards the sound of the yelling and explosions.</span>

Landing on the other side, Sandro and Sinmara might see a girl seemingly emerge from a nearby pile of scrap as if it was water and dust off her slim burgundy overcoat and black suede thigh-high boots. The woman made for quite the cutting figure. &quot;Szrac Vaughn, you&#39;re quite the hard man to find. Fortunately for you or maybe not, I am a determined woman. Now, I have a business proposal for you,&quot; She said in a smoky, slightly seductive voice, looking at her leather glove and adjusting it as she spoke before bringing her arm down with a frosty mist surrounding it and looking directly at Sandro and Sinmara, not yet realizing who the man was.

A ways off behind the trio, the trash mound erupted like a volcano as a wave of heat washed over it with blistering force. A pall of smoke settled over the space above like some kind of backdrop, while specks of flame burned the flammable trash in the vicinity. The explosion was timed impeccably, five whole seconds after Kari had made her opening speech. Not too short to feel rushed, and not to long for the audience to wait. 

Of course, that was what Persepolis&#39; localized wiki had to offer on the topic of making a lasting impression for one&#39;s stage entrance. And that was exactly what Ada had read off of during his spare time. The Servant in question was now seated comfortably on a relatively clean looking cabinet sticking out of another trash mound, his visage perfectly blanketed behind the smoke. 

That, of course, was also planned. After all, there was no need for the stage crew to steal the spotlight, was there?

Ada grinned. He&#39;d done his job of making some noise and executed it perfectly - as per instructions from both his Master and the almighty wiki. It wasn&#39;t as if Kari had specifically suggested him to lay off on the theatrics. Whether the woman would use this stunt to her advantage or to her embarrassment was completely up to her.

Sucked. Was he even listening to what the giantess was saying? Sure, being able to set metal on fire was cool and all, but all he did was scorch some silly little shard! Did he actually thing that was impressive? It was LITERALLY quality over quantity. But he was clearly trying hard, like an idiot puppy chasing its own tail! How was she supposed to put him down after that pathetic effort?

Fortunately, she wouldn&#39;t have to. They were interrupted by a pair, both servant and master alike. They entered with a slick series of explosions and bursts of flames, a fitting backdrop to their attempt at a dramatic entrance. It was practiced, elegant and formal. In other words...

<strong>&quot;HAHAHAHAHA! Oh my gods, that was so lame! Did you honestly thing that corporate sellout garbage style of destruction was actually</strong> <em><strong>cool?</strong></em> <strong>HA! That was even worse than HIS attempt! At least his came from his pure stupid little dog heart!&quot;</strong> Sinmara keeled over laughing, completely unimpressed by their entrance.

Their attempts to look cool had backfired!?

Before he could gather her response however, a woman dressed in a fashionable coat appeared calling him by the name of ‘Szarch Vaughn’. Who the hell was Szarch? 

Sandro took a good couple of seconds to look at Kari. He had gripped the candelabra under his jacket prepared for the worst. Something about the girl looked strikingly familiar, “ Szarch? Who the hell is-” as he was speaking an eruption occurred just behind the mistaken girl. 

He looked at the duo who arrived with a cold stare, Sandro wasn&#39;t a fan of theatrics in the slightest. It seemed his Servant agreed with him, the entrance was lame but he could have done without the insult… at least Sinmara acknowledged that he tried to impress her.

“Hold on a second Saber I think I know that girl” Sandro peered towards the pair. He wiggled his cigarette around on his lips trying to think. “Karolina?” He questioned pointing to the girl in the red coat. It was her right? The Tovesky girl? They were about the same age so growing up as aristocrats they had the same tutors and operated in the same circles. They never interacted much with Sandro always keeping to himself. One thing still remained a mystery however, who was the person accompanying her?

The hint at her brand of magic was supposed to be enough to keep them guessing while Ada would come in with the big guns and the demonstration of their combined power. It was all the show she wanted and more, even Ada had done his part right. She couldn&#39;t help but grin. Surely her perspective business partners would respect the showmanship...

Lame? Corporate sellout? That couldn&#39;t be right, Saber was supposed to be professional and an old man. Who was this edgy bimbo in front of her. Taking a second to squint up at Sinmara, Kari realized that the pair infront of her were not who she was looking for at all. Especially the dull man beside her, there was no way that he was a mercenary or Szrac. What he said only confirmed it.

&quot;Kari, it&#39;s Kari. Literally no one calls me Karolina. And you&#39;re not Szrac, I&#39;ve heard he was a tad bit soulless but not in the same way you look,&quot; Kari took a few steps forward as she looked more closely at her prospect, her icy blue eyes piercing through his head. &quot;Oh shit, you&#39;re that Moretti kid, aren&#39;t you?  The wallflower who was daddy&#39;s little servant. Honestly, I&#39;m surprised you ended up a master. Not that it matters since you&#39;ll wont be one for long.&quot; Kari said condenscendingly, dismissing him with a wave as if he was meaningless. 

&quot;Mr. Lexington, we&#39;re wasting our time here. Let&#39;s try to find the mercenary somewhere else.&quot;

It was hardly even a conversation, after this mercenary by the name of &#39;Szrac&#39; turned out to be nothing but a fraud. Well, a fraud was stretching it a bit. Yet the term childhood friend didn&#39;t feel quite right. Kari&#39;s tonal shift was telling enough of her impression, or the lack thereof, on this acquaintance of hers, but that raised another question. 

&#39;Are you the replacement for Saber&#39;s Master in this Holy Grail War? Was Szrac decommissioned by his sponsor, or did you have something to do with it?&#39; With Kari clearly being done with the talk once and for all, Ada decided to cut to the chase and ask the match boy what he wanted to know the most.

<strong>&quot;Oh, my, GOD! You didn&#39;t tell me you had a girlfriend, twerp!&quot;</strong> Sinmara&#39;s cackling filled the air once more, this time fueled by a horrible misunderstanding of social cues! <strong>&quot;HAHAHAHAHA!

The giantess continued to completely revel in her &quot;knowledge&quot; of the situation, doubtlessly making it awkward for everyone involved. Well except for the weird guy accompanying Sandro&#39;s girlfriend.

Wait a minute...

<strong>&quot;Hey, WAIT! Sandro, who&#39;s that cripple that&#39;s accompanying your girl? Wait, don&#39;t tell me... are you one of those </strong> <em><strong>weird</strong></em> <strong>people who are into that?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In a moment&#39;s notice there was so much for Sandro to process. Kari’s insult has struck a chord deep in Sandro’s heart. On Top of that he still had no idea who this ‘Szarch’ guy was. He felt judged by the duo in a moment&#39;s notice and it seriously ticked him off, and now he had Sinmara yelling in his ear about a girlfriend. Sandro was experiencing an indescribable form of agitation.

Sandro gritted his teeth biting down into his cigarette, the paper was shredded by his teeth letting the bitter tobacco fall in his mouth. He grabbed the butt of the cigarette from his mouth and flicked it at the back of Kari’s head almost demanding she turn back around.

“Let’s set some things straight, I don&#39;t know who Szrac is so stop asking” Sandro then moved his cold eyes over to Kari giving her a stare that would convey just how unamused he was “And you, Kari or Karolina I dont care, don&#39;t you dare speak about my relationship with my father” Sandro moved his hand into his coat pocket pulling out a new cigarette and lighting it. The paper scrunched under the pressure of his fingers as he gripped it rather intensely. “Besides i&#39;m not sure the daddy conversation is one you really wanna have”

Sandro averted his gaze from Kari looking at the servant to his side. Kari’s comment really didn&#39;t bode well with Sandro but thinking how Saber misread the situation oddly enough lightened his mood. “How did you come to a stupid conclusion like that?” Sandro asked dumbfounded. “We just know each other from when we were kids that&#39;s all, plus look at her, i&#39;m way out of Kari’s league” he added, blowing a puff of smoke in Kari and Ada’s direction. “And listen when people talk, the guy asked about the Holy Grail War, try and put two and two together” In all fairness Saber did put two and two together… just not in the way Sandro was thinking

Ahahaha... you serious? God, Sandro, you really know how to pick them. A demonic, bossy bimbo . . . man, what a joke,&quot; 

She wiped away a tear as she recovered from her belly laugh. The Moretti kid was turning out to be more entertaining than she thought. Maybe it would be worth it to stick around and feed this sideshow of a pairing for a bit longer. That was before she found a cigarette butt smacking her right in the forehead.

Sandro would watch as rather than just bouncing off Kari, it rolled down her face as a messy brown rivulet. It took her a second to process what happened before she frantically tried to wipe it off. <em>Damn reflexes, this was not the time to pop off, shit this smells.</em> That insult would be followed up by Sandro stepping on a very delicate nerve of Kari&#39;s, one that had a very fine hair trigger attached to it. Kari&#39;s eyes widened before becoming eerily fixed on Sandro.

&quot;You really want to go there huh? Remember what I just said how you probably won&#39;t be a master for long? Well you keep that up and I&#39;ll make sure it happens within the next five minutes,&quot; Kari had gotten closer to Lorenzo again, the temperature around the two steadily dropping. Sandro could almost see the ice beginning to form in the air.  &quot;So how about you be a polite little boy and answer my servant&#39;s question before you really mess up, huh?&quot;

You, on the other hand, seem to be struggling for favor against a single <em>matchstick</em>.&#39; The Servant somehow managed to pack an irritating amount of cheer into that one word. &#39;Perhaps it would do you some good to make some actual effort in appealing to your trophy Master, when all of your assets failed to impress.&#39;

Ada side-eyed Kari striding over to Sandro, her trademark ice magecraft already beginning to crystallize around the poor chap. &#39;Not that you&#39;ve got long.&#39; He tapped his watch-less wrist with a finger, making no move to intervene in the quarrel.

bitch?&quot;</strong> Sinmara looked down at Kari, totally unimpressed with her behavior. She knew Sandro was a doormat, but really? Hanging out with this sorry excuse for a woman? 

And then, her attentions were lured away by No-Legs and his petty insults. Sandro getting beat about by his skank of a girlfriend, she could tolerate, but this dumbass talking shit on her? 

<strong>&quot;You want an answer? I&#39;ll give you an answer, shithead!&quot;</strong>

Her grip tightened on her sword, and suddenly, Sandro will feel a familiar sensation, and hear a familiar chant.

<em>This is the scream of a rebel soul, burning bright! Oh, sword of twilight, that which brings about the end, BURN IT ALL DOWN!</em>
<em><strong>L&#198;VATEINN, SWORD OF THE SEVEN SEALS!</strong></em>

Her blade roared with life-scorching flame, swirling around the edge like a vortex of death. With eyes full of rage, the giantess took a swing at Archer, unleashing the might of the blade of Ragnarok upon Ada, the pile of trash he was sitting upon, the heaps of trash piled up behind him, and everything else unfortunate enough to be within a mile.

If nothing else, it was a clear answer.

He shoved his hands deep in his coat pockets trying to get over the surge of cold in the air. He took a step closer to Kari closing the distance even more now. His blue eyes clashed with hers as the wind around them picked up causing both of their coats to sway to the side. As the air circled the two, flames would appear and disappear being smothered by the cold condensation created by Kari and leaving steam in its wake. It was a clash of Ice and fire.

“I haven&#39;t been to this place in a while, this master thing, it&#39;s not something I wanna be part of… But it&#39;s something I have to do for myself, something I have to prove to myself, if you understand that kind of sentiment I think you&#39;d be well aware that I can&#39;t let you walk over me. I&#39;d rather not start a conflict but I won&#39;t have any problem trying to finish it.” Sandro was serious and straight to the point, Kari might not have taken him seriously, but at the current moment he saw her as a potential threat. 

Just as Sandro had made a statement about not wanting conflict Saber was way ahead of him. A wave of heat appeared that was instantly recognizable as a force much stronger than his own. He looked away from Kari to see Sinmara in a fit of rage. His eyes grew wide, he wasn&#39;t able to do anything to stop her .”Saber NO!” He yelled as Sinmaras blade through a line of destruction Ada’s way.

&quot;So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t even want to be in this war? What kind of mage are you then? Because if what you said about not wanting to start a fight is true, you&#39;re either an idiot or a coward. Fortunately for you, those are things that can be beaten out of someone,&quot; Kari said, doing her best to look down on Sandro even if he was taller than her. &quot;Let&#39;s start with lesson number one...&quot;

She started to lecture her fellow master only to feel an intense wave of heat that distracted Sandro, Ah right on time Ada, I&#39;m surprised how dependable you are for once. &quot;Never turn your back on a potential enemy!&quot; Sure he might not hear Kari&#39;s advice but he would feel it as her hand slid through his skin and up through his gut. It was a truly alien feeling as the initial resistance of his skin gave way and immediately it was like his stomach was being pushed and contorted into awkward shapes. As she ripped her hand out right below his lung, Sandro&#39;s stomach began to violently churn as his guts were spinning in eddies like a peaceful lake after a boat tore right through. It was the worst form of nausea he had likely ever experienced as his organs tried to reconfigure themselves.

&quot;See what I mean, you take your eye off your opponent and you&#39;re toast. Now how about you actually try to fight someone for once. I mean if you can, that is,&quot; she taunted as she watched Sandro react to the sucker punch.

I&#39;ve never been one fit to teach, you see.&#39; He continued, even as it was evident that his words had failed to reached to the red giantess, who had begun a series of chants. From the length of the chant, the panicked cries from her Master and the ridiculous mana output radiating from her sword, it wasn&#39;t hard to conclude that what Saber had planned to unleash was nothing if not an utter disaster.

Tanking a direct hit from the strongest of the seven classes, in his current container? Why, he&#39;d never thought he had it in him to be a comedian!

&#39;What history do you hail from, Saber? A blade of scorching flames, a legend of a bygone era?&#39; Ada questioned the giantess as tendrils lashed out from his gloves. They slashed the space next to him into neon colored glitch effects, which in turn crystallized into a mount. A mechanical horse of silver, with copper colored veins running through its chassis. 

&#39;Saber of Red, meet the Chicago Typewriter. My most prized possession.&#39; Ada declared with a slight bow, even when the smoldering calamity was imminent. Strings of commands flushed the equine machine&#39;s veins in lime green. Its head split open, revealing the muzzle of an old-fashioned cannon.

Archer spoke calmly as a sea of crosshairs appeared all over the firestorm. The head of the Chicago Typewriter glowed a bright green as it fired a cannonball composed of pure mana at one of the crosshairs. As it did so, the space behind Ada was tinged the same green hue as an insane amount of mana condensed into myriads of cannonballs of the same caliber. They promptly fired off on their own, each locating their own crosshair and blasting into the flaming leviathan&#39;s body, contorting its belly and spine as they sought to repel its advance.

Technology, versus mankind&#39;s oldest friend?

Explosions sounded the field. Out of the corner of Sinmara&#39;s eye, a few cannonballs veered off the others&#39; path and headed straight for the two Masters, as crosshairs appeared around Sandro whenever he used his magecraft to ignite the air. Even those two weren&#39;t exempt, it seemed.</span>

It was even MORE flammable than that shitty beach that Sandro summoned her at. How blissful!

At least, it would be, if <em>someone</em> wasn&#39;t trying to play Fire Brigade on her. That stupid archer and his stupid gun were shooting some kind of silly projectile at her fire, beating back the hungering inferno.

<strong>&quot;HEY, DICKHEAD! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE DOING?!&quot;</strong> The giantess barked, charging towards Ada with her blade in hand. How DARE he try and screw over her destruction, that hoity toity nerd! This jerk needed to be taken down a peg, and preferably, thrown off the peg rack and down into a pit of lava! Sinmara leapt upwards, bringing down her blade towards Archer with the intent to cleave him in half.

She paid no heed to the scuffle of Kari and Sandro, nor the cannonballs that had flew towards their direction.

A sharp pain hit him the gut seemingly out of nowhere. Had Kari just hit him? As the alien feeling dragged through Sandro’s body his hand which had previously been placed on his candelabra dropped from his jacket. Pulling the flame from his cigarette the candle became lit as he swiped towards the alienated feeling catching Kari’s jacket sleeve with the flame.

“Agh” Were the only words that left Sandros mouth as he stepped back placing one knee on the ground. He had no idea what happened to him but it was clearly the result of Kari hitting him. The light on the candelabra flickered as he gripped the handle like a stress ball.

Sandro had initially thought he was done for but it seemed Kari gave him time to recuperate giving him a lecture as if she were his professor. He stood back up looking at his opponent as his vision slowly went for double to normal. 

“Before you worry about lecturing me, worry about that shabby jacket of yours.” Sandro said pointing to the flame that was growing on Kari’s sleeve. Right as Sandro was getting ready to face off with Kari loud cannon shots ringed in his ears. This sound would only be followed by the unsightly appearance of cannon balls flying right at him and Kari. 

Sandro gritted his teeth jumping backwards as he fired a ball of wind in Kari’s direction to try and propel himself to safety, making it by a slim margin as a ball of destruction nearly grazed his chin.

It was almost like she could not feel the flame gnawing away at her clothes. &quot;If I had known this, I would have came in something a bit tougher.&quot; 

Kari placed something in her hands and spread it over her palms like soap. Taking her time, she dragged her hand down the opposite sleeve of her coat, smothering or dousing the fire instantly with the material. What was curious was that the parts of her sleeve that had burned away had come back thinner but intact. She was so confident that she didn&#39;t see the cannonball until it was too late. 

She heard the sharp whistle of an incoming projectile and the next thing she felt was the dense sphere of mana collide with her back, sending her flying into a pile of scrap. For someone so confident in her abilities, Kari sure seemed to go down easy.  That was unless Sandro noticed a couple ripples eminate from the pile of trash as if Kari was nothing more than a glorified drop of water to its pond surface. 

Sandro would soon feel the icy atmosphere come back though Kari was nowhere to be seen. Six more icy shards came flying at him head on, three more to each of his sides.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A large shadow charged out of the smoke and fire as Sinmara closed the gap between her and the trash mound. A headless, mechanical horse, its body starting to decay from tanking the initial hit of the firestorm. It caught Saber&#39;s descending blade in its neck and kept charging in, aiming to ram her in the guts with what little momentum it had left.

On its back, Archer coughed into his sleeve, which had been charred in places along with the skin underneath.

&#39;<em>This dickhead is working. What of it?</em>&#39; He raised his voice, which was a bit raspy from inhaling the smoke. He stood up from his mount and prodded the giantess squarely in the sternum. Twice.

&#39;You are one expensive lady to keep around, has anyone told you that? I had to drain my entire stock of mana just to entertain your tactless flames.&#39; He reprimanded Saber harshly.

<strong>&quot;Oof!&quot;</strong> Sinmara grunted as the horse smacked her body, causing her to momentarily keel over from the force of the blow. Fortunately, the mechanical mount had also taken much damage during the encounter. Another successful destruction! Yet the sweet taste of this victory was made bitter by the mockery of Archer.

<strong>&quot;Yeah? Well, I hope that spent mana turns into a dick so you can choke on it, asshat!&quot;</strong> The giantess snapped, grabbing the poking finger of Ada. Clenching her teeth, she twisted her body, aiming to slam the twink cyborg into his stupid horse.

Not a particularly grand or sophisticated maneuver, but there was no room for grandeur or sophistication here.

And thus, unsurprisingly, the giantess lifted him off the ground without so much as a struggle. She was going to use the Chicago Typewriter against him!

But that simply would not do. As a heroic spirit with an excellent handling on the Riding skill, just how embarrassing would it be if they were to crash into their own mount? 

The horse disintegrated into a vortex of neon colored glitch effects right before Sinmara&#39;s eyes. With nothing else in the way, Archer was slammed into the ground on his back with a grunt, sending glitch flakes flying. Sinmara towered over him, her sheet size and display of strength suggesting that she could probably snap him like a twig if she so wished.

&#39;Slow down, Saber. I am not used to such primitive advances.&#39; Ada readjusted his glasses as he lay in the backdrop of his glitch vortex. He looked quite disappointed. &#39;At least buy me dinner first.&#39; The vortex shrunk as the long muzzle of some sort of firearm protruded from its surface, its head reared and staring Sinmara right between her eyes before starting to blast away.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro’s eyes grew wide as he watched Kari get smashed by the cannon ball…. Was she dead? He wasn&#39;t the hugest fan of Kari, and sure they were fighting but he didn&#39;t want her to die! 

“Kari?” He asked moving his head side to side trying to locate where her corpse would have flown off too. It was nowhere to be seen. Did she dodge it? Or was she blown to shreds, and would her own servant release an attack so reckless that it would kill her?

Sandro was so busy piecing the mystery of Kari’s body together that he didn&#39;t notice the ripples in the trash till there were already multiple shards of ice flying his way. Sandro didn&#39;t have enough time to dodge, instead he would pull in the flames from the burning trash created by Sinmara making his candles flame much hotter. 

A small wall of flame would ignite around Sandros body. The heat was spread equally amongst the wall, he didn&#39;t have enough time to gauge where each shard was coming from. Because of this he wouldn&#39;t melt the icicles completely only mitigating their ability to do damage. Cuts would open up with a small bit of blood soaking into his shirt. 

“Hey I was worried about you, it&#39;s rude to sneak attack an unsuspecting person like that.” He said sarcastically, reigniting his cigarette. It seemed Kari was really serious about trying to beat Sandro to a pulp, all he could do was beat her first.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>God, that hurt,</em> Kari thought to herself as she rubbed her back, safe within one pile of scrap. She really should have found a softer pile to land it but there was only so much she could do to prevent that cannonball from boring a hole in her. Wasn&#39;t the first time her origin had softened the blow on her and was sure to be far from the last either. 

Kari could at least take some mind of her pain as her spikes found their mark, even against Sandro&#39;s flames. It was hard for her to resist a snarky response but she had other things she had to attend to at the moment, namely why Ada had expended his NP already and blasted her. She did her best to sneak out of the pile she was hiding in and made her way over to Ada by diving through more piles of scrap via her ability. In between those, she would send more ice spikes to Sandro to keep him busy. 

She eventually made it over by Ada and stuck her head through a nearby hill. &quot;Hey what&#39;s going on over her- oh shit!&quot; She said ducking back within the pile temporarily as Sinmara made another swing at Ada. &quot;Don&#39;t forget I gave you several mana batteries earlier. I think you&#39;re going to need them along with some of those freezing vials against this whore. I hold nothing but faith in your ability to knock her on her fat ass. Good luck!&quot; And as quick as she appeared, Kari had submerged back into the trash and ran to find some hill near Sandro to make her dramatic re-appearance

Of course Sandro had quite the show already to deal with as he was beset on all sides by those annoying ice shards, only to see her pop up on top of a scrap heap wielding some type of icy javelin. &quot;Aww I can&#39;t believe you actually care about me, isn&#39;t that <em>sweet</em>?&quot; She said with the same mocking tone as Sandro had given her earlier.

Things weren&#39;t about to get much better for her, nor would her opinion of him improve much. Instead, the Chicago Typewriter transmogrified itself in some kind of gun, and proceeded to pepper her with bullets.

<strong>&quot;Geh!&quot;</strong> The giantess staggered back briefly. Fortunately, her giant constitution was resistant to such damage, but the true damage she sustained was the damage of <em>embarrassment</em>.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m MARRIED, you mouthbreathing bottom feeder!&quot;</strong> Sinmara barked in rage, swinging Laevateinn downwards with immense might in an attempt to cleave the scientist in half.

However, it also magnified imperfections, and right now, every single emotion Sinmara had toiled through was written and enlarged by the immaculate yet sizeable features of her face.

Could it be? That this red Saber...was a <em>prude</em>?

Once the thought had taken root, even the fiery blade of Laevateinn seemed to lose its edge.

That wasn&#39;t to say the sword had stopped being a menace. Should it connect with Ada, he had no doubt it would do just what its owner had asked and split him like a log. He wasn&#39;t physically built to last through such direct confrontations, and yet...

&#39;<strong>Hah-hah-hah!</strong>&#39; A hearty laugh erupted from Ada&#39;s chest. &#39;My dear Saber, please don&#39;t get ahead of yourself. I too am already engaged, and the one whom I have pledged my loyalty to does not like to share.&#39;

He hadn&#39;t acknowledged Kari, in case the action drew Sinmara&#39;s attention away towards his even less durable human Master. It was one thing to fend for himself, but another matter entirely to take care of an extra baggage. Ada liked his fun, but that was the premise. <em>His</em> fun. 

He wasn&#39;t one who liked sharing, either.

They popped upon contact, as a chilling mist engulfed the giantress like a blanket of ice, freezing even the air around her. What Kari had unleashed onto her childhood friend-foe was replicated to an intensity tenfold, chilling her to the bone and slowing her down even with her innate magic resistance. The bullets had been crafted from Kari&#39;s ice compacts!

A tool produced by a human, taking effect on her? Either she wasn&#39;t as sturdy as she thought to be, or the petty trick had been boosted by some sort of skill. Of course, without an NDA, there was no way she could hope to get a straightforward answer out of Archer&#39;s mouth.

Ada then performed the logical action and did a side roll to dodge Saber&#39;s sloppy slash. The Chicago Typewriter followed, now fully taken shape as a futuristic machine gun color coded similarly to that of the horse. Archer got himself into a sitting position, his back snug against the trash mound for support as he locked onto Saber yet again.

&#39;Would you sheathe and wait if I said I need to change out my mana batteries?&#39; He asked Sinmara. &#39;I suppose not?&#39; He answered before the giantess could reply. &#39;Why don&#39;t you have them instead? My treat.&#39; 

The barrel of the gun grew red and nearly white hot as a surge of mana lodged itself within. Ada hadn&#39;t used the mana batteries on himself; he had transmuted the veritable mana bomb into ammunition for his gun! 

<strong>BANG!</strong>

There was no hesitation as he pulled the trigger.

Things didn&#39;t get much better, as the icy bullets that peppered her body and caused her already-abysmal agility to further lower. That, in turn, gave the cybernetic cripple ample time to dodge her cleaving blow, meaning the slash connected with nothing but scrap metal and discarded trash.

<strong>&quot;Ngh, so what! You think you&#39;re hot shit or something because you&#39;re getting lucky? Well, your luck has run out, cocksucker!&quot;</strong> Sinmara snarled, shaking the frost and rime from her body as tore her sword free from the ground. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re like embers on ash, while I&#39;ve got plenty of kindling left to burn! You&#39;ve got no way out of here!&quot;</strong>

Of course, that might have been true, had Archer not had a trick up there sleeve. Pulling forth the Chicago Typewriter once more, he converted his mana batteries into pure mana, not to sustain himself, but to put an end to her!

The blast of energy surged towards her, and though the giantess tried to shift her sword to block it, the freezing rounds had slowed her too greatly.

<em><strong>CRACK.</strong></em>

A direct hit! Sinmara&#39;s body buckled from the sheer strength, going limp and slamming into the ground as blood poured out of her broken body. She could feel her insides melt and churn from the sheer heat, her spirit origin being torn apart as damage ruptured and hemorrhaged, leading to further injury. 

<strong>&quot;N-No way... I won&#39;t... I c-&quot;</strong> Saber sputtered pathetically, trying desperately to stand once more. Yet no matter how she willed them, her legs disobeyed, as did the rest of her body. 

It hurt. Not her body - it had become numb, unable to even conjure the idea of pain anymore. No, the true pain was the humiliation. The failure to see through her mission, the mockery of her opponents.

She was so tired.

Sinmara closed her eyes.</span>

And then, something stirred within her. Something that she was even sure that she was aware of. In fact, she wasn’t even sure that the Throne of Heroes truly knew what it was. Yet it pierced through the blackness, the numbness and the nothingness as though it were nothing, and like an inferno, burst into burning light.

<em>“No. This is not where it will end for you, ▅▅▃▃▄▄▅▅▃▃.”</em>

When Sinmara opened her eyes once more, her mangled body had somehow clambered to its feet, with Laevateinn held up towards the skies. Though she still could not feel her legs, no longer did they betray her. Instead, they held firm, as though they were the roots that held aloft the World Tree itself. Likewise, her arms were the branches, bristling with seemingly unlimited energy.

<em><strong>For creation to begin, the old must be destroyed...</strong></em>

Her sword was swirling with flames once again, the seven rules upon the blade glowing with searing energy. Ada Lovelace had pushed her to her limits with his last attack, yet in doing so, he had made a critical error. The mana bomb had been rich in magical energy, making it a perfect weapon. Yet, it was that selfsame trait that was also the perfect thing for her Giant’s Outer Shell, rich in power for her to absorb.

<em><strong>It must be burnt away, to make room for the new...</strong></em>

Enough that she was capable of unleashing her Noble Phantasm a second time. The fires of Laevateinn surged to life once more, even brighter than the last time that Ada had seen them, more voracious and insatiable than ever before. Though externally she had been beaten and battered, the giantess had never felt better. It was as though the flames of the Sword of Calamity were aligned with her soul, growing every larger with every passing moment.

Swallowing the blood and ash that filled her throat, she allowed a grin to come across her face once more.

<em><strong>This is the scream of a rebel soul, burning bright! Oh, sword of dawn, that which will allow for a new beginning, BURN IT ALL DOWN!</strong></em>
<em><strong>L&#198;VATEINN, SWORD OF THE SEVEN SEALS!</strong></em>

With a defiant cry, Sinmara swung her sword with all her might and unleashed the cataclysmic blow.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Kari’s ice flew towards Sandro he would pull more fire from the burning trash, his candle growing hotter. Unlike before he was prepared for her ice and knew how hot his fire needed to be to melt them. A ball of fire met each icicle turning it into vapor, his fire was just the right temperature so the two projectiles cancelled each other out.

Although none of Kari’s attacks struck true, her actual goal of maneuvering to Ada without being noticed was successful. Sandro wasn&#39;t aware of Kari&#39;s location until she revealed herself, opening up with a sarcastic comment.

“You know Kari, when people hide it usually means they’re scared” As Sandro taunted Kari he used it as an opportunity to glance over to servants. Saber was losing… Sandro gritted his teeth trying to hide his anger from the girl adjacent to him. If Saber dies that would mean the end, an end that would arrive much too quickly. Was Sabers failure his fault? He thought he could rely on a strong servant but maybe this was just a testament to how weak he was. Sandro didn&#39;t have any way of helping Sinmara, it seemed the only option was to fight Kari and beat her before Ada could kill Saber. 

Only looking in Ada and Sinmara’s direction momentarily Sandro would miss her glorious evolution, instead Sandro was more focused on winning his battle. Sandro’s hand would reach out in Kari’s direction engulfed in flame. One by one balls of flame would fly her&#39; way whistling through the air as they moved with great speed.

Still, he was putting up a good fight, more than she expected. It was a good distraction from her main goal, an elegant way of working out some of her pent up aggression and frustration.

&quot;Not bad, fireboy, not bad. However I&#39;ve just guaranteed the match for my servant so let&#39;s wrap up our little game here real quick!&quot; She said before drawing her javelin back and tossing it straight at the fireball. It took off with tremendous speed, sheathed in a dense cloud of swirling wind that scattered the energy of Sandro&#39;s attack harmlessly before continuing on towards him and breaking apart just over his head. The crack of ice and wind could stun Sandro if he had not put up the proper defenses and the shards would crash down around him as well.

<em>I could continue the attack from up here but I&#39;m going to lose a lot more energy if I keep making such high powered attacks for little gain. Kid&#39;s better at fighting than I thought,</em>  Kari said as an idea popped into her head. She jumped down from the scrap pile, surfing down its slope as if it was a leyline and using its momentum to bring her close to Sandro again.</span>

&quot;Game set and match,&quot; She said with a cocky grin, beaming in her sudden play. &quot;And that&#39;s how we ended fights in the Gymnasium back when I was a part of the dueling team.&quot;

&quot;Since we&#39;re basically on the same team as Aristocrats, i&#39;d say we can end it here,&quot; She lowered her blade away from Sandro&#39;s neck, a single bead of red rolling down his throat as a reminder that she could easily retaliate if he tried anything scummy right now.  &quot;You showed me you can fight and I showed you what kind of masters you could come up against. We both learned something but can keep our trump cards hidden still. That&#39;s a great outcome for any match. Now how about you recall your servant and we call it a day, huh?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ada was by no means touted as a seasoned fighter. He should not have qualified for a knight class in the first place. To be summoned as an Archer was an anomaly made possible through a slew of coincidences and what-ifs. An error in the Throne&#39;s database. 

It was a miracle.

He had fully planned to take advantage of this miracle.

No longer was he bound by the burdens of his legacy. A computational genius? The founder of the digital age? He would rather do without any of that. The world did not lack an Ada Lovelace. Humanity would have progressed just fine, even if he hadn&#39;t been placed on a pedestal by modern scientists and mathematicians who loved the symbolic significance of his name more than the contents of his work.

He detested his face.

He detested his body.

He detested his family.

He detested his life.

Ada Lovelace did not wish to be Ada Lovelace.

It was impossible to describe the thrill he had felt when his inhuman, mechanized feet touched solid ground in Kari Tovesky&#39;s office. The Archer class container, in a sense, had liberated him from the curse of being a magical staff-wielding nerd who was expected of nothing but even more of the same shit he had been subjected to in his past life. Incantations? Familiars? Reality changing experimentation that involved scribbling magical array upon magical array from his magical dictionary of magical sigilla?

Never again.

The first time he had held the Chicago Typewriter in his hands, Ada knew that he would do anything to make this simple yet blissful moment last. No more repressions, no more innovations. Just him, his gadget, and a fully developed world ready for <em>him</em> to exploit this time round.

It wasn&#39;t a childish wish to test his mettle, but a selfish wish to feel what it was like to do as he pleased. He wanted to feel the thrill of battle, not through eye strain from analyzing code on a computer screen, but through the broken capillaries and mangled flesh that only existed when he presented himself on the front lines.

Dodging Saber&#39;s slash had been entirely within his calculations. So was penetrating Saber&#39;s defenses. He was aware of the knight classes&#39; innate magic resistance, but every chassis had its limits. And in this world, they came in the form of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. mystic codes. A fresh set of mana batteries should have contained more than enough power to penetrate this corporeal barrier.

And yet...

&#39;Oh for God&#39;s sakes,&#39; For the first time since the fight had begun, a crack breached Archer&#39;s carefully mounted expression. He had accounted for a mystic code-branded Servant&#39;s common weakness, yet he underestimated the layers of mystery built upon the Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods. It was a strength modern Heroic Spirits like him could not fathom. A bug in the main frame he had never encountered.

<em><strong>It was fascinating.</strong></em>

No, no, NO! He had vowed to do without those analytical bullshit! And yet as Ada took in the sight of Sinmara&#39;s abnormally unwavering frame, he couldn&#39;t help but itch to pry. To decipher this indecipherable phenomenal brought about by his own hands.

His hand twitched. 

The Chicago Typewriter responded before he had willed it so, transforming back into its laptop form and shooting a dozen or so cables towards their opponent. The ends of the cables attached themselves to Sinmara&#39;s hulk, transferring data back to their main body even as they decayed from the magical energy pouring out of the giantess&#39; body.

&#39;Mana output has spiked.&#39; He whispered, eyes boring into the data on the screen. &#39;The mana batteries? Most likely. A crude recycling of mana at the expense of sustaining damage herself. But how much?&#39; 

&#39;Subject irresponsive to probing. An automated defense mechanism?&#39;

&#39;The subject&#39;s core-&#39;

A premature wave of pure mana blasted into him, cracking the lens of his glasses and a few more locations under his shirt that made him grunt in pain. Yet the genius refused to relent as he commanded even more tendrils to flock over to Saber, so he could get more glimpses of the anomaly surrounding her core.

As Sinmara began chanting the second verse of her Noble Phantasm, a second wave of mana once again crashed into him and challenged his concentration. Dark spots blossomed on his vest, but he kept pressing on. He was close. He was oh so close...

When the third mana wave arrived, Ada reluctantly acknowledged that it was time to move.

Like a book addict being asked for the third time round to leave the library 30 minutes past its closing time, Ada slammed close his laptop with more force than necessary. 

&#39;Fascinating,&#39; said Ada. &#39;So. What the hell are you hiding in there, Saber?&#39; His eyes suddenly burned with a strange fury. &#39;All this potential, and yet you choose to deliver it in the most inefficient way possible. Has no one taught you that the stronger the attack, the easier it is to miss?&#39; He shook his head in dismay. &#39;Your four verse chant may as well be an open invitation to your funeral!&#39;

&#39;But you&#39;re not actually listening to my advice, are you? I&#39;d have more success conversing with a log.&#39; Ada rolled his eyes and plunged his writing hand into the closed lid of his laptop.

A single cable stretched itself from the laptop into a crack on the ground and wormed its way through the earth, hooking itself up with one of the many cables making up Persepolis&#39; telecom network. Ada&#39;s computational prowess had manifested in a simplistic yet practical command of data, including the data of himself. Any open access to a telecommunication device was a free ride for him. Sinmara&#39;s Noble Phantasm may be terrifying, but it still had a range. All he had to do was transfer his own data over to a device even further away.

He had no intention to contend with a second bout of her Noble Phantasm from the start.

The fiery firestorm ate up the Chicago Typewriter and crushed it into a shower of harmless glitch flakes, yet Archer was nowhere to be seen...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sandro changed his target to the icy javelin as it flew his way. He wasn&#39;t sure what Kair meant by ‘securing her servants&#39; victory’ but it sounded like something he should get to the bottom of. 

As the javelin broke apart sending a wave of air towards Sandro he created a current of his own mitigating Kari’s blast of air and casting the shards of Ice off track so they landed around his feet. Before he could go back to firing at Kari she was already under him.

He looked down at the girl feeling the ice against his neck. His cigarette bud fell to his feet burning out as it had been completely consumed. “Game set match?....” He repeated. “Well if it helps you sleep at night I guess we can say you won.” 

Kari would soon realize that the ice sword would begin to sublimate in her hands. It didn&#39;t feel any warmer, however it still acted as if it were heated past its boiling point. He couldn&#39;t help but feel that if Kari chose to use her hands she might have actually checkmated him. Their magic were direct opposites, Sandro felt neither could win a contest of magecraft. 

“You’re the one who attacked shouldn&#39;t you call off your-” Sandro stopped himself from speaking. He remembered that Saber started the fight… Normally Sandro would try and talk things out first but Sinmara totally acted in the opposite. At the very least it seemed Kari had given him some much sought after respect.

“Saber we’re done here let&#39;s go home.” He called out only to look over and see the great display of her noble phantasm. Saber seemed like she was in a better spot then when he last looked but she still looked seriously messed up. Ada on the other hand looked to have dipped out, she must have known it was time to leave. 

It was clear that Kari and Ada had a stronger bond than him and Saber. Maybe Sandro needed to try and put up with Sabers shenanigans so they could learn to work  better together. Kari wasn&#39;t wrong about this being a learning experience</span>

It felt like the outcome of the Servant battle was partially reliant on his faults as a master. He bit his lip taking on a rather gloomy look as he waited for Saber to join him in departure.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Laevateinn was unleashed once more, everything around her melted. Well, everything except Ada himself. That would have been irritating, had Sinmara even been cognizant enough to notice it. Even though she had miraculously clambered back to her feet once more, her body was still damaged beyond disbelief.

As the final flames of her Noble Phantasm faded, the giantess collapsed into a pile of ash and soot, her garments scorched into nothingness and her flesh burnt from her own attack. 

As far as she was aware, she had won. Technically, that was even true! Yet it still didn&#39;t feel great, considering how much things hurt.

Clumsily, the giantess drew a rune in the ash that clung to her chest - a spell of healing. On cue, her body began to stitch itself back together once more, attempting to repair the absolutely catastrophic damage that had ravaged her flesh.

As soon as feeling had returned to her body, she stood up and stumbled off. Not with Sandro or anything of the sort, but simply off in a random direction, trudging through the trash and scrap.

Anywhere that wasn&#39;t here would be an improvement.</span>
