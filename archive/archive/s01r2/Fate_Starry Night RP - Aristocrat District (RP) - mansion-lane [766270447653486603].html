It had been a few days since the encounter with the flaming Saber and the bombastic vehicle at the docks. Aratron and Tapio had long since recovered from their minor injuries, and the Master&#39;s clothes had been thoroughly cleaned thanks to a last minute purchase of laundry detergent. The Holy Grail War had officially begun. It seemed ideal to rest and observe the other Masters&#39; movements, but...

&quot;We are here.&quot; Aratron said, dragging his student to the end of the commoners&#39; district. If they took one step past that point, they would officially be inside aristocrat territory.

&quot;Since the horned Saber&#39;s testimony was completely worthless, we have no choice but to inspect the aristocracy&#39;s base ourselves. It will be a lengthy walk, but a good learning experience: I haven&#39;t memorized this part of the map yet, after all.&quot; The Caster mentioned, before shoving Tapio forward and following through. They had barged themselves in. Mere commoners in a place designed for the elite. It didn&#39;t seem like Aratron cared though. He stared at the mansions with the same disinterest he gave to the crumbling church from a few weeks ago.

Aratron then remained silent, his head bobbing repeatedly up and down as Tapio had no idea what his Servant was doing. Were they headbanging? With no music? Did they get a rock stuck in their ear? 

They finally stopped, then they sighed.

&quot;So, student,&quot; He turned back to Tapio. <strong>&quot;which out of these fifty nine mansions should we explore first?&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Early mornings used to be a treat to Tapio. That awkward hour when the city was just stirring awake, when the streets were perfectly empty and basking in the foggy rays of sunlight. He loved running through those streets, chasing after his soccer ball and letting it take him to the most random places without having to stop for anyone on the way. 

Unfortunately, those kind of mornings went extinct ever since he had summoned Caster. Early morning runs became grueling pre-breakfast recitals on magecraft theory, homework cramming, and mini quizzes that most of the time ended up in double the work because of his appalling grades. That wasn&#39;t all. Even the Holy Grail War couldn&#39;t save him, as Aratron had decided to add morning patrols on top of his old workload ever since their encounter with that loudmouthed Saber, which meant that he now had to drag his ass out of bed at the crack of dawn. It had only been a few days since the Holy Grail War had started, and already Tapio felt as if he had shaved fives years off his life.

The boy yawned, rubbing sleep out of his eyes as Caster&#39;s questions barely registered in his sleep-addled brain.

&#39;Fifty-nine? We couldn&#39;t have passed by <em>that</em> many. Wait, you were counting.&#39; Great. Of course he would do that. And of course he would seriously suggest that they comb through every single one of them. &#39;You do realize that you only have a one in fifty-nine chance of finding Saber here, right? Assuming they even live here.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sun was shining, with just a hint of clouds beginning to threaten the ball of fire with their embrace. For some people, namely Aristocrats, this was a great time for them to hunker down and practice magecraft, or crush both the Commoners and Mafia underfoot.

For Lorenzo, it was time for an ice cream run.

It had been ridiculously hard to convince his father to let him go out during a Holy Grail War, however, it had all been for naught, as Auster had answered with a resounding

&quot;No! Absolutely not! I forbid it! Auster had shouted when Lorenzo had asked him in his office. Shrinking back, Lorenzo had left the office. Father had meant well, but that well-meaning had a price.

So Lorenzo had snuck out through a tiny gap in the fence, near the back of the mansion. The bounded field prevented enemies from entering, but it said nothing about exiting. Being a Jamie helped too.

So as such, Lorenzo wandered down Mansion Lane on his lonesome. It would take a little while for Auster to realize he had escaped. Aetos, on the other hand...

&quot;Ah well. I&#39;ll be back before they know it! Just wait until Aetos sees what I bring him.&quot; Read: Honeyed fruit...

As he walked down the central street, Lorenzo became aware of a Servant and his Master, preparing to walk by. Soon, they would pass each other.

&quot;Ha ha. Amusing. I was merely describing a worst case scenario. I am completely aware that searching every nook and cranny of fifty-nine buildings would take us 142 hours total. Fortunately, we have several methods of narrowing our search down.&quot; Aratron said with a smug, self-satisfied smirk, as if he had finally solved the puzzle to their Saber Quest™️.

The moment a passerby started working towards them, Aratron was quick to block their path.

&quot;Excuse me, kind stranger, but we have a few questions to ask: Are you aware of any Masters around this area that own a Saber class Servant? Preferably one that isn&#39;t horned or female.&quot; He immediately asked. This was his amazing solution: Asking people for information in a shady and suspicious manner. Great.

Lorenzo would be caught off guard by the question, especially since it was blocking his route to the fabled ice cream. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span></span>

Next Aratron was going to tell him he&#39;d count the number of steps he took in a day, wasn&#39;t he? &#39;Besides, we can get a rough estimate by checking a few door numbers and do some maths. What.&#39; He noticed Caster staring. &#39;<em>I know how to subtract!</em>&#39;

Yet, Aratron would not grant him the chance to show off his arithmetic skills. He stared past the midget that he was, his gaze fixated on the newest addition to the block: a kid who was walking on the other side of the road, obviously minding his own business and with no intention to engage in their morning squabble. The Servant took a few big strides and swiftly blocked the kid&#39;s path before peppering him with targeted questions. 

So that was his genius strategy, huh? Just going up to random passersby and quizzing them on other Masters and Servants? There is such a thing called showing tact, but that word seemed to be missing from Aratron&#39;s dictionary. 

Of course, what was a Master if not their Servant&#39;s ass wiper? Feeling immense responsibility on his shoulders, Tapio politely inserted himself in between Aratron and the kid. He cleared his throat.

&#39;A slight correction,&#39; He raised a finger to signify the importance of said correction. &#39;Not just any Saber. An old man in a suit of armor, looking like he came straight out of those Renaissance paintings. <em>That</em> would be the one we&#39;re looking for specifically.&#39; He concluded quite proudly.

He had overheard the debate the boy had and watched him sneak off the property through one of the few chinks in the manor&#39;s armor. He smiled at the boy&#39;s tenacity to see the outside world for himself. He may not have been the most fit boy but at least he was brave. 

Still, with an active grail war going on, Ajax would decide to follow behind his master,hiding in the alleys and shadows and concealing his body with a massive cloak. He would keep watch even as Lorenzo walked along without a care in the world. There was a sense of foreboding building up in him as he sense the presence of a servant edge closer and closer to his master. 

He could hear bits and pieces of their conversation, seemingly unaware of his role. They were far more concerned with finding some other servant so Ajax would simply keep himself hidden for now. If they made any aggressive move towards Lorenzo however...</span>

Lorenzo hummed happily as he waltzed down Mansion Lane without as much as a care in the world. Father was always warning him that he&#39;d get attacked by Servants, now that he was a Master, but it was unlikely that he&#39;d be attacked on Aristocrat territory, so he was presumably safe. If the mafia mobilized, the Jamies would be among the first to know.

&quot;Chocolate with sprinkles, and vanilla scoops too!&quot; Skipping as quickly as he could, Lorenzo was primed to pass the duo of Aratron and Tapio, before being stopped by the taller of the two. Without much hesitation, the adult began shooting questions at Lorenzo out of nowhere. At least the man was polite...

&quot;U-um... Servants?&quot; Lorenzo stammered. Had these two come to Aristocrat territory looking for a specific Servant? Lorenzo&#39;s blood turned to ice. As a matter of fact, there was a Servant around here. A Lancer, at that.  Aetos.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know any other Servants around here, none at all, sir.&quot; Lorenzo nervously looked down, as the kid at the man&#39;s interjected the question, specifying a Saber.

Oh. Whoops.

Looking up, Lorenzo shook his head. &quot;No, I&#39;m sorry. There&#39;s no Sabers around here. What do they look like? <em>How cool was their sword</em>?&quot; Realizing that asking more questions would lead him deeper into conversation.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; <em>Stop apologizing, stupid!</em> &quot;You two must be really busy, and I&#39;m taking too much of your time. Sorry! Bye!&quot; Lorenzo attempted to slip between Aratron and Tapio.

Aren&#39;t you all filthy rich?&#39; Tapio tapped his feet. He looked up at Aratron and shrugged. &#39;Well? What do you want to do? I think it&#39;s pretty hard to hide a Servant, but if you want to knock some doors and ask around some more-WANNA CHECK OUT THEIR SWORD WITH US?&#39;

Tapio reached out and grabbed ice cream boy by the back of his shirt as he tried to slip through. Another Saber fanatic? Oh no, this one wasn&#39;t going anywhere. 

&#39;Can&#39;t really say much about the old man&#39;s sword, but if you want a really cool looking one, there&#39;s a huge lady in red with a flaming sword that shoots fire when she kicks it with her feet. Kinda dumb if you ask me, but the flame is the real deal. Did you hear about the explosion at the docks the other day?&#39; The boy rattled on, a clear indication that he (thought he) was anything but busy.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron initially appreciated Tapio stepping in. Not only was their description helpful, but it was far easier to earn the trust of commoners by talking through a reliable looking expy. Tapio seemed innocuous enough to fit the bill.

Of course, this massively backfired once the conversation derailed completely, as the two Masters started talking about flashy swords and the loudmouthed Saber from a few days ago. Aratron had no intentions of seeing that Servant ever again, and the praise directed towards her paltry flames was getting to his nerves. How was basic elemental magic considered &#39;cool&#39; nowadays?

&quot;Ahem,&quot; He gave a stern cough. &quot;explosion? We have heard of no such thing. I&#39;m sure a member of the aristocracy wouldn&#39;t concern themselves with such boorish matters.&quot; He said while covertly tugging at Tapio, as if telling him to stop messing around.

&quot;However, the lady in red certainly does exist. She also confirmed that she was a Saber, therefore, there <em>are</em> Sabers around here. Do you perchance know of any areas populated by Knight class Servants in this district?&quot; He rephrased his question to Lorenzo, crossing his arms and blocking the boy&#39;s path. It was clear he was looking for a satisfactory answer so he could continue his search. <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Fanatic was a strong word.

Appreciator, connoisseur, and fan were all infinitely better words to describe Lorenzo. He had never <em>seen</em> a Saber Servant in action, before. Aetos had offhandedly mentioned them once or twice during his planning sessions with Auster, which Lorenzo attentively paid attention to. He knew they had big swords that blew things up, and were among the strongest classes.

He wanted to see one in action. 

&quot;H-huh? Sword? Why would you ask me to see it if you don&#39;t know where it issss?&quot; Lorenzo pleaded as Tapio grabbed a hold of him. It took a few seconds for him to realize what Tapio had said. The dock explosion rang a bell. If that had been caused by a Servant...

&quot;That&#39;s... SO COOL!&quot; Lorenzo nodded fervently, agreeing with his similarly sized Master. &quot;A Servant did that? Wow...&quot; As a practitioner of unorthodox magecraft, anything that could cause an explosion was fine in Lorenzo&#39;s book. However, Lorenzo&#39;s fanboy moment would be interrupted by Aratron.

It was obvious that Aratron was looking for something concrete, but Lorenzo couldn&#39;t spill anything about his own Servant. It was unlikely that anybody was in Aristocracy territory for simple sightseeing. To make matters worse, the Servant had extended his queries to include all Knight Classes.

&quot;L-like I said. <strong>I don&#39;t know anything about Lancers!</strong>&quot;

Whoops.

&#39;Come on, stop quizzing me on the fly! I&#39;ve already memorized the sequence of events like it had happened only yesterday.&#39; He boasted, completely missing Aratron&#39;s point. His Servant seemed quite unmotivated when it came to chasing down this new Saber, but weren&#39;t all Sabers the same? Why was he so fixated on the old knight?

Regardless, this string of questioning wasn&#39;t getting them anywhere. Tapio was excited to have found a comrade in Saber appreciation, and he was loathe to scare the boy off. He laughed when Lorenzo visibly tensed up.

&#39;Who said anything about Lancers, you doof! Are you even awake right now?&#39; Tapio gave Lorenzo a light flick on the forehead. &#39;Look, if you want to catch a Saber in action, the least you can do is get their class right. Oh!&#39; His eyes lit up as an idea hit him. &#39;Why don&#39;t you come with us? We&#39;re going to interview some more houses in this district. You seem to be from here. Why not be our guide? In exchange, we can take you with us when we fight Saber.&#39;

He stopped thinking of that once the boy proposed dragging the stranger around as their escort. One would normally be against snatching a random passerby, but Aratron had no such concerns.

&quot;A fine plan. Follow us, aristocrat. You have nothing to fear while under my protection.&quot; Aratron boasted, albeit his boast felt more like a threat: While he guaranteed Lorenzo&#39;s safety, he was also insisting on the boy following him. The ice cream would have to wait.

&quot;Quickly, lead us to the richest of the families nearby. Sabers are a prestigious class. No doubt, their catalysts was obtained through gold coins and obscene wealth.&quot; Aratron stated as he directed Lorenzo towards the nearby houses. &quot;...Not that such wealth matters to me, of course.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span></span>

&#39;A Servant!&#39; He blurted out. &#39;Yours? Your family&#39;s? Why didn&#39;t you say so earlier?&#39; He nudged Lorenzo. &#39;I thought you were just some casual fan boy.&#39; 

The presence of a new Servant did nothing to douse his excitement. 

&#39;The ice cream place won&#39;t be open for a while, we passed it on our way here. C&#39;mon, help us first, it&#39;s not everyday you get to personally track down a Saber.&#39; He made to grab Lorenzo&#39;s arm.

Mana permeated the air, a sign that the man&#39;s words should be treated cautiously. They were no doubt a Servant, one that had revealed their hand to them in an effort to show off their seriousness.

From their tone, voice and choice of words, it was rather apparent that they were the overprotective type. Tapio got a faint sense of deja vu while Aratron squinted his eyes, as if mildly annoyed.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not. The next few hours have already been booked. Lessons await him.&quot; Aratron pointed to Tapio while maintaining eye contact on Ajax. The student would most likely groan out of annoyance, being reminded of the classes that he had left for him after this dumb search was done.

&quot;Step aside, familiar. I promise to not harm your Master, since it is not my objective to hurt humans. Non-humans, however, are estranged from such kindness.&quot; Aratron put it bluntly, becoming rather assertive as he looked back to Lorenzo.

&quot;Find Saber for us. Then you may leave. If done efficiently, our search will only take an hour at most.&quot; <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span></span>

It probably helped that Tapio was a ball of pure fanboyism, and Aratron viewing Lorenzo as nothing more than a compass. If he were higher profile, who knew how bad that blunder could&#39;ve been?

&quot;Um... Well... You see—&quot; Lorenzo was spared from answering any questions. having been saved by a shadow looming up behind him. Judging from the size of the shadow, it was Lancer. He had been found out. Curses! If only he hadn&#39;t been stalled, he could&#39;ve been eating ice cream by now. 

Turning around, Lorenzo shrieked &quot;AET—&quot; Before being silenced by the Servant with a shush and a wink. It was obvious that Lancer was trying to get him out of a sticky situation, but it wouldn&#39;t work against their adversaries. 

There was only one choice, wasn&#39;t there?

Lorenzo stared at Aratron for a few seconds, before breaking eye contact and looking down. He couldn&#39;t do it. He couldn&#39;t look the Servant in the face and tell him no.

He lacked a spine.

Taking a deep breath, Lorenzo took a few steps forward, as if getting ready to lead Aratron towards his prize. He could feel the Servant gazing expectantly into the back of his head. Lorenzo stopped.

&quot;E-Even if I lead you to Saber, what then? You&#39;ll do what your Master s-says, and fight him? Even if you say you won&#39;t hurt humans, that&#39;ll be hard to do while fighting another Servant with people running around screaming... T-They could get hurt..&quot; Lorenzo rubbed his eyes with his sleeves. &quot;So I&#39;m sorry... I can&#39;t... People could get hurt.&quot;

&#39;Hmmmph, you could&#39;ve just said no. I&#39;m not <em>that</em> difficult to talk to!&#39; He said, squinting at Lorenzo with a slightly pouty expression. He clearly hadn&#39;t taken his peer&#39;s words seriously. &#39;I thought your Servant was just making an excuse, but if you really have a fancy meeting to go to, then don&#39;t let me keep ya.&#39; He rapped Aratron on the arm. &#39;Caster and I can find Saber on our own, maybe even cancel today&#39;s lessons!&#39;

There was a lot of hope in his voice. The search for Saber was grueling, but still way better than poring over books in a stuffy classroom. Satisfied with his compromise, the boy turned to leave, but then an idea crossed his mind and he spun around once more.

&#39;Oh, I know! Why don&#39;t we leave you one of his familiars?&#39; He pointed at his Servant. &#39;We can then tell you when we find Saber so you can come watch! If you&#39;re worried about getting hurt, then find a rooftop a block away and watch from there. You&#39;ll have plenty of time to get out of the way.&#39;

<strong>&quot;Unacceptable.</strong> Since when were you under the impression that lessons could be cancelled on such a short notice? Today isn&#39;t a state holiday either...if Persepolis is even considered a state.&quot; Aratron declared while giving Tapio the stink eye.

&quot;Ergo, I will not be skipping classes and I will not be skimping out on any possible leads.&quot; The Caster turned back to Lorenzo, who was stammering out of anxiety and fear. 

&quot;Such matters are not worth your concern. It is virtually <strong>impossible</strong> for my Noble Phantasm to result in humans being harmed. Even the environment bends to my will, so stray accidents have a nonexistent chance of occurring.&quot; Aratron boasted about his prowess, as if trying to sound reassuring. Instead, he just made Lorenzo feel more worried: A Servant capable of keeping tabs on all humans and preventing them from being put in danger? Either they were <em>that</em> omnipotent, or they were a hothead in disguise with a few screws loose.

They didn&#39;t seem trustworthy.

&quot;However, we do not have time to prove our capabilities, especially when doing so would attracted unwanted attention. Therefore, I suggest you comply with our demands and fulfill them as soon as possible. You may leave afterwards.&quot; Aratron bossed Lorenzo around, not even waiting for an answer from the kid.

&quot;...Ten seconds have passed. How long are you going to stand there? Proceed.&quot; He said, waiting for Lorenzo to escort them to any places of interest. <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span></span>

He gave his master an encouraging glance as he finally stood up for himself. &quot;What you have proposed, Caster, is nothing more than what the people would call a &quot;wild goose chase.&quot;

&quot;I can say as much for it is my duty to be forever vigilant and my frame accomodates that mission. You and I are the only discernable servant participants in this area. Though it is odd... there is a third one nearby, signature faint and indistinct. Regardless that third one would not be a Saber anyway. As such go back to where you came from. You are wasting your time here,&quot; He shrugged and a massive shield fell into place on his left arm. He was not going to move anytime soon if the guests kept up their request.&quot;

They would not budge, being the boy&#39;s guardian and protector. Aratron did not care for such chivalry. It felt hollow, coming from a familiar that had no choice but to serve their Master.

&quot;Your opinion is unneeded, Lancer. And <strong>ignored.</strong>&quot; Aratron said with spite as he stood firm in front of the Lancer. &quot;If the geese fly away, then I shall simply shoot them down. It&#39;s simple, really.&quot; 

&quot;Step aside, and I shall bring your Master back unharmed once I have found my target. Insist on wasting my time, and I shall be forced to make you redundant.&quot; He threatened.

Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. Virtually impossible. 

Lorenzo stood still, as if receiving a far away signal. Aratron had to resist the urge to knock on his head like a crummy radio. Lorenzo kept muttering to himself in dumb shock and outrage.

It had been &quot;virtually impossible&quot; for the nanomachines within him to tear his body apart. It had been &quot;virtually impossible&quot; for him to recover. To have the enemy Caster casually say such a phrase made Lorenzo&#39;s blood boil. He felt a desire to punch Aratron in his stupid face. Was this outrage? He&#39;d never been this angry before. One might&#39;ve called it <strong>virtually impossible</strong>.

Yet here he was.

Lancer and Caster began arguing, and Caster&#39;s threat to end Lancer was more than Lorenzo could take.

&quot;Sh-sh-sh-sh...&quot; Lorenzo stammered. &quot;<strong>SHUT UP! YOU&#39;RE STUPID! I HATE YOU!</strong>&quot;

Lorenzo could&#39;ve used every curse word in Tapio&#39;s vocabulary, and it couldn&#39;t have been more forceful. He barely knew Aratron, and he had been willing to bust out the S word!

&quot;You can&#39;t... Make that promise... You can&#39;t keep it...&quot; Tears began to stream down Lorenzo&#39;s face as he glared at the enemy Servant. &quot;You just can&#39;t! Lancer!&quot;

Those were fighting words.

He shifted his shield again and slammed it down into the ground, cracking the pavement with minimal effort. He moved to speak again but looked over his shoulder as Lorenzo seized up with emotion. Ajax could feel his own soul roil with anger as the caster continued to demand Lorenzo to join him even as he kept denying. 

He held his gaze longer than he thought as Lorenzo&#39;s sudden and forceful denial of Aratron&#39;s request gave more fuel to Ajax&#39;s fire. The servant in front of them was acting like an entitled king who demanded that the world revolve around his wishes. Just the thought of such a person sent an odd purple tremor down his back though Lorenzo would not be able to see.</span>

The sound became louder as the shield began to glow and expand outwards into more of a oval shape, its ends elongating into sharp ends.

&quot;This is the last warning I will give you, apparition. Leave now or I will make you leave, carted out as a broken husk,&quot; He said, pointing one of the sharp ends at Aratron&#39;s throat. 

Ajax did not care for the third heroic spirit he mentioned earlier for his focus was entirely on the governor of a heavenly body in front of him. It was almost asking for an ambush...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal’s day could not be getting any worse.

It started off with his morning ritual (sleeping in) interrupted by one of his superiors. Despite becoming a master in a HOLY GRAIL WAR, they decided he still needed to fulfill his duties to the faction. Which meant another mook job requiring him to deliver a package to some semi-important hot shot all the way in tim-buck-to. 

Then, he had to bring Claudius with him. The job wouldn’t have been so bad if he could at least go alone, time to think about what their next step in this thing was. So far, he had simply laid low and continued on as per usual. Save for the constant companionship of the biggest bum alive, who he still wasn’t able to figure out where he was from time (He WAS based in the U.S. He thought). That drove his heart through the roof, always on the lookout for any servant on the prowl for blood. 

Adding to that, the best way <em>to</em> the delivery point was through some part of the Aristocracy turf. He considered every possible route, but they all either took longer than he could afford or would get him potentially attacked by other criminal scum that were looking to rise a few ranks in the faction. Not that they would ever come close to beating him in a fight, but any attention was bad attention. He donned a fake uniform ‘borrowed’ from a delivery man, hoping to at the very least look like a lost idiot unaware of his surroundings.

And the blood red cherry on this shit cake was that he wandered into the start of a scuffle between TWO servants. He had hidden somewhat far away, taking partial cover and watching the events unfold. He desperately wanted to turn the other direction and give the middle finger to his boss, but Coal was unable to tear his eyes away from the two pairs. He couldn’t really hear them the best either, yet the man felt bad for the two kids. Neither of them looked like they craved a brawl, but the servants had sticks up their asses.</span>

Let’s let them explode and start tussling, then we rush past and pretend we saw nothing.”

Some part of him knew that they were getting involved, but he hoped that part was wrong. At least, a little bit. Please?

He hadn&#39;t the slightest idea why Lorenzo went off like a firecracker, but the boy&#39;s little outburst <em>was</em> pretty funny to him. That was the first time he&#39;d heard someone call Aratron stupid, even the big tin can man couldn&#39;t do it!

&#39;I should&#39;ve gone to school with you.&#39; He choked out, trying to even his breathing. &#39;Everyone&#39;s so uptight at the academy, I wish-&#39;

Oh shit, was he crying?

Never mind the two Servants trading scathing remarks above their heads, were Aratron&#39;s words usually harsh enough to reduce people to tears? Or perhaps Tapio had simply grew thicker skin over the past few weeks and gotten used to the verbal abuse?

He&#39;d rather not acknowledge that.

&#39;Well, if nothing else, I can vouch that my Servant is superb at keeping his word.&#39; Tapio quickly recovered. &#39;I know he&#39;s kind of a stuck up, but he hasn&#39;t gone back on a promise yet...unless...&#39; His gaze shifted to Lancer, who had already summoned his shield and directed its pointy end at the Caster pair. A direct provocation.

&#39;...Unless you want to test him?&#39; Mana rippled past him in waves, but the boy didn&#39;t take the hint. He stayed, and reached into his pockets, taking out a handkerchief. He handed it to the other boy.

&#39;Here,&#39; He said. &#39;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so worked up over this, but are you saying that you&#39;d believe my Caster if he can win against Lancer without hurting anyone else?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Great, now Lorenzo felt crummy. 

Not only had he lost his temper and looked like a child, but he had failed to see the bigger picture. He had thrown a tantrum. How unbecoming of an Aristocrat heir. Hopefully, Lancer would keep this on the down low when they got back to his father.

Assuming, of course, that his father didn&#39;t ground him for all eternity.

&quot;U-Um... Thank y-you...&quot; Without making eye contact with Tapio, Lorezno accepted the handkerchief and began wiping his eyes. The kid was certainly a waterworks. He could probably raise up the water level in the ocean by a few feet if left to his own devices.

As he wiped his eyes, Lorezno considered Tapio&#39;s proposal. It wasn&#39;t the worst idea—keeping Aratron and this hypothetical Saber from tearing down the district was far better than letting them go nuts. Besides, Lancer was good at playing defense. If there was anyone who could stop another Servant in their tracks, it would be him. Lorenzo looked at his Servant, and then back to Tapio.

&quot;It won&#39;t hurt your chances.&quot; Lorenzo said firmly, before returning the cloth. There was a finality to the sentence. It didn&#39;t seem like there would be a better deal. To Tapio, it would hopefully qualify as a &quot;Yeah sure, go ahead and wreck the street&quot;.

Claudius was more than unimpressed to discover that his Master was just some lowly delivery boy. Maybe it wasn&#39;t all that bad, Claudius did want to try and lay low planning strikes accordingly throughout the war, and a bottom of the barrel Master was certainly ideal to execute that kind of behaviour.

One thing did seem to go as Claudius wanted. Running into a conflict between two other servants gave him a chance to scout out potential competition from afar. Keeping himself concealed the assassin had no intentions to throw himself in the middle and assumed that Coal wouldn&#39;t either. 

Claudius turned his gaze towards Coal, he came off as nervous to Assassin, he needed his master to have confidence if they had a chance at winning the Holy Grail War. “Now&#39;s not the time to contemplate our words, yeah? You don&#39;t gotta worry about me, not being seen is what I do best,  worry ‘bout yourself Master and sneaking by should be a walk in the park.” 

For good reason Claudius was confident in his ability to go through the area unnoticed, Coal was his biggest concern, hopefully he could get by with ease. “Will go when ya think best alright? Just go ahead and ill be right behind ya nothing to worry about”

They had doubled down on being an annoyance, deciding to speak through actions instead of just words. It was bothersome, and so was Lorenzo&#39;s brief tantrum. Not only could it possibly attract unwanted attention, but the fact that his emotional outburst ended in a few seconds thanks to Tapio&#39;s assistance just made Aratron give out an exasperated sigh.

<em>&quot;Humans are so fickle and temperamental.&quot;</em> He thought to himself, but there wasn&#39;t any disdain in his mind. Instead, the only thing that irritated him at the moment was Lancer&#39;s presence.

&quot;So typical of an unrefined familiar to protect their masters through declarations of battle. Lancer, were you perhaps a war monger? How much blood has your spear spilled?&quot; Aratron replied bluntly, playing the moral high ground before hearing Tapio&#39;s proposition.

&quot;...I have no qualms with that. If anything, this situation <em>does</em> call for disciplinary action. I cannot allow such an impertinent familiar to roam free.&quot; He stared Lancer down, before lowering the Servant&#39;s spear, which had been sitting dangerously close to Aratron&#39;s throat.

&quot;You will have to do better with your provocations for they do not find purchase in my hide. Perhaps you should go back to your books and sharpen your tongue again,&quot; He seemed unconcerned with Aratron&#39;s taunts, standing ready with shield in front and face neutral in expression if not a little amused. &quot;You seem of noble bearing. I will let you take the first strike, for what am I but a warrior, scum of the earth?&quot; He spun his shield around before bringing back down in front of his body, inviting Aratron to strike.

In the back of his mind, he could not shake the fact that there may be another servant in the area, planning its own actions against him. He glanced around but still could not see any potential threat.

&#39;It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine!&#39; Lorenzo was being awfully polite about this ordeal, even offering his own Servant up to be Aratron&#39;s sparring partner. Tapio felt like he had to reassure him somehow. &#39;Caster thinks that he&#39;s stronger than even Saber, so <em>he</em> has a word to keep, not you. A Lancer should be a piece of cake in comparison.&#39;

That totally came out wrong.

&#39;Oh! Um, do you want to keep your Lancer? You can always summon another, right?&#39; Realizing the error of his ways, Tapio tried to show some tact. &#39;I kinda need my Caster though. I registered him for the Holy Grail War, so I can&#39;t just go find another spare.&#39;

Well, at least he was telling the truth.

Holy shit, was that CASTER? The Caster he was told by some official would be a potential ally in this thing?! Well this was certainly a one in a million encounter to stumble upon, and it certainly changed things. For starters, this guy was trying fuck with another servant that could be a schmuck for some random kid not even in the damn thing. And if he somehow got gutted by that long as spear or shield…

He’d be down a potential ally AND sacrificial lamb to be stabbed in the back later down the line! This really wasn’t his day. At least it ain’t coming up that way.

“...Change of plans,” he said, turning to Claudius. “That’s gotta be Caster. They didn’t tell me what they looked like or even who the hell their master was, but my guts are screaming at me that it’s them. And if that guy gets fucked over by that other guy, we’ll be fucked later. And we’re bum fuck in rich bitch territory. I need them alive and not here.”

“Follow my lead,” he said before leaving cover immediately. He shifted his collar before speaking up, “Hey, excuse me! Are any of you the guys I got a delivery here for? Says it’s for a, uh,” he pulled the package from behind his back and looked at the label, desperate for any name that sounds vaguely familiar.

“Uh, a Mr. Shmoal Hopson. That name ring any bells? What about you two,” he points to Tapio and Araton, “You guys know someone that goes by Hopson, right? You appear to live in the area.” He motioned to their attire, which was probably not at all fitting of Aristocrats.

He had considered throttling him, before changing his mind and deciding that Tapio wasn&#39;t a bad person. Despite that, Lorenzo was back in a throttling mood.

Face passive and eyebrows half raised, he looked at Tapio. It was a mix between smugness, disdain, and <em>I will beat you with an ice cream cone if you keep letting garbage come out of your mouth, you knucklehead</em>. Lorenzo had shown more different emotions in the past 15 minutes compared to the last few weeks. That was an achievement.

&quot;W-why are you treating him some interchangeable part? He&#39;s just as human as you or me! I can&#39;t just summon another Lancer! I wouldn&#39;t ask you to replace your Caster!&quot; Lorenzo wrung his hands nervously. Father had dealt with the specifics of signing up Lancer. 

Wait Tapio and Aratron were signed up together for the Grail War? That meant that sooner or later, Lancer and Caster would have to face off, assuming Caster survived. The idea of Lancer&#39;s defeat didn&#39;t cross Lorenzo&#39;s mind. It was an impossibility.

&quot;Good luck to both of you. M-may <s>Lancer</s> the best Servant win!&quot; Fitting of an Aristocrat, Lorenzo behaved himself with some measure of professionalism, contrasting with his previous behavior.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">‘We’re bum fuck in rich bitch territory’ Was Coal even speaking english? Claudius sighed at the prospect of Coals inquiry. He had hoped to just watch everything unfold, especially since he now knew that the two pairs who stood before him were future obstacles. It seemed that the future might be sooner than later however.

Claudius now had something else to observe, the unfolding of his masters improvised plan. He gave off a nod to Coal as he was instructed to follow his lead. “I&#39;ll be close behind” He replied swiftly, scaling a nearby tree. Claudius figured staying hidden was still the best move, staying out of sight was his strongest weapon after all. 

 The assassin peered down watching as his Master placed himself into the fray. He contemplated if Coals plan was really the best option, he was throwing himself in a conversation that seemed to be escalating into something much more volatile. 

Now all Assassin could do was wait and see how the two Masters would react to the shenanigans of his own, he was ready to come down and assist Coal at any time necessary if the situation called for it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Each word uttered from Ajax&#39;s tongue felt like an annoying splinter stuck in Aratron&#39;s mind. The kind that was incredibly small and unnoticeable, yet stung profusely whenever you noticed it. With their Masters having officially confirmed the bout, there was nothing left but for the two to compete against one another. Of course, Caster had already predicted his own victory.

&quot;...A shield. Common article utilized in ancient warfare to block strikes and arrows. I suppose I am dealing with a rather primitive Heroic Spirit. To be expected, considering your tone.&quot; Aratron scrutinized Ajax, observing his manner of speech and his weaponry. It seemed he wasted no time in abusing any advantage he could possibly obtain, or perhaps he was trying to intimidate Ajax with words?

&quot;Placing it in front of you and making yourself an open target. No doubt, that shield is ready to counter any sort of attack I have in reserve for you. Painfully obvious, yet I expect nothing less from a brute.&quot; Aratron sighed, a self-satisfied smirk on his face as even his own Master felt like punching him. Was he really bragging about figuring Ajax&#39;s plan out?

&quot;If you were human, I would recommend some classes on warfare and surprise tactics. I recommend <em>Art of War</em> from Sun Tzu. Very interesting book. Unfortunately, you are a mere familiar, one with not much growth potential to speak of. Best for you to perish, instead of further humiliating your Master with your very presence.&quot; The Caster said rather bluntly, before taking a few steps back.

&quot;Also, there is no need to wait for me to strike. <strong>I have already started my attack a few minutes ago.</strong>&quot;</span>

Ajax&#39;s eyes would widen. He was so focused on getting Caster to strike his shield and wipe that arrogance off his face, that he didn&#39;t realize that Caster&#39;s attack had gone <em>around</em> his shield.

His legs were petrified, turned to stone completely, even. He couldn&#39;t feel them at all and couldn&#39;t walk either. Could this mean...?

&quot;Of course, I started to petrify your legs the moment I started speaking. My lectures do not come for free.&quot; Aratron smirked. The talk about a shield was a mere decoy to buy time!

&quot;Now, Lancer, what is that great shield of yours going to do? A shield is sturdy and reliable, but only as versatile as its user. Now that your legs have returned to being ichorous earth, shall I proceed to sever the rest as well?&quot;

As he said that, Caster moved forward, rushing past Ajax as he maneuvered around the man and stood directly behind him. He was going to petrify his back next! <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio blinked at Lorenzo like he&#39;d just said something incomprehensible, but it wasn&#39;t. It really wasn&#39;t. It was just different. Different from the way he&#39;d been taught to perceive the magecraft side of things and, well, it would take more than another kid to change his mind. He scratched his head.

&#39;But I summoned him into a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. In case you don&#39;t know, you can even use catalysts to make sure you summon the same Servant over and over again. That&#39;s, like, the definition of a familiar! At least that&#39;s what my teacher used to say.&#39; He raised a finger and mimicked Aratron&#39;s way of preaching. If nothing else, at least Caster would take solace in the face that his disciple had a knack for entertainment arts.

&#39;Besides, it&#39;s not like he&#39;ll last forever.&#39; The boy paused. &#39;<em>We</em> don&#39;t last forever.&#39; Tapio added with a little reluctance, but brightened up quickly. He patted his own chest. &#39;So it&#39;s my job to make the best out of Caster while he&#39;s still here! Why don&#39;t you ask Lancer to put on a good show for us too? It&#39;s more exciting than worrying about decommissioning him. C&#39;mon! Let&#39;s find a good spot and watch!&#39;

He grabbed Lorenzo by the wrist and tried to drag him to the other side of the street, only to bump his nose on a package between the hands of an oddly dressed deliveryman. 

&#39;Shmoal Hopson? I don&#39;t live here. Is that you?&#39; He asked Lorenzo, who didn&#39;t not exactly fit the image of a Shmoal. He then remembered their &#39;bet&#39;.

&#39;Mister, you miiiight want to back off a bit.&#39; He waved his free hand in an attempt to ward off Cole from heading deeper down the street. &#39;If you can&#39;t tell already, those two are Servants and they are in the middle of a match.&#39;

His ploy failed immediately, and it might still be too late. He wasn’t sure how willing those two were to just call it quits and walk their separate ways. Threatening the two munchkins right in front of him might get the servant’s attention, but for all the wrong reasons. It’d be HIM with a spear lodged in his stomach, bleeding out on the ground. His mind struggled with another lie, excuse, almost anything to get some hold on the situation. 

“Are you sure you guys shouldn’t take this someplace else?” He was hesitant to move backwards with the two kids, but found himself shuffling along. “I doubt any of these bigwigs wouldn’t take it kindly to come out and see a fight going on right in the middle of their neighborhood, don’t you think? Maybe you should get them to take a walk over to say, oh I don’t know, back down the street this way. I saw a nice little open spot just a few minutes down the road, I can show you so you don’t bother these assuredly nice people.” He pulled a little on Tapio’s shirt, hoping to draw him further away from the other lad.

Or even away from those two starting their battle, he still felt uneasy being in sight of the damn thing. Well, rather, in sight of that massive behemoth called a Servant. He hoped none of the Knight Class he had to deal with weren’t as intimidating...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax was taken back by the sudden paralysis of his lower half. Tugging with his waist, his legs would not give at all. He was very much stuck between a rock (himself) and a hard place (his opponent). How would a primitive warrior like himself deal with being put in such a corner. 

&quot;You make it sound like I my plan was to run away. Unfortunately for you, your petrification is several degrees poorer than that of the Shapeless Isle and only she could render me useless,&quot; that thick concentration of mana around Lancer only condensed further and further as he came to grips with his situation, his shield humming louder and louder until it let out a loud whine. 

Aratron was more than correct that Ajax was from a primitive time yet with that meant a close proximity to the whims of the Gods. His high magic resistance stymied the flow of petrification from advancing while his shield concentrated the mana into a shimmering field that encompassed his entire being. This counter-boundary field began actively pushing down on his petrified legs, slowly removing the curse of stone. That little bit more flexibility allowed him to bring his shield around towards Aratron&#39;s next advance with full force. 

Aratron could very well get smacked by the full force of the shield and field if he kept up those airs...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron waltzed around Ajax, wondering on which area he should petrify next. The elbows? The neck? The spine? All were good options when it came to crippling the Servant&#39;s fighting prowess for good. However, a low moaning coming from the shield, coupled with Ajax&#39;s boastful statements, made Aratron believe that something was off.

&quot;Shapeless Isle? Are you attempting to invent new locations to confuse me and buy time? I assure you, it will not wo--&quot;

The whining increased, until Aratron realized that Ajax&#39;s petrification had all but disappeared. This wasn&#39;t just Magic Resistance...it was something much bigger.

<em>&quot;His resistance to magecraft seems to be worse than Saber, yet he recovered from my spell at a much faster rate. It isn&#39;t a mere class skill. It could only mean,&quot;</em> Aratron stared at the shield, realizing that it was the cause of this. A little too late, since Ajax had already turned around and was planning on bashing the Caster&#39;s skull in.

&quot;A cheap trick, Lancer! Don&#39;t think my Magecraft is so easily swayed!&quot; Aratron erupted in fury, as if taking offense at his petrification being so easily dispelled. Before the shield could collide, the terrain itself started to shake and morph. A wall of pavement rose up, blocking Ajax&#39;s strike and being crushed to bits while simultaneously protecting Aratron. The Caster used the opportunity to create some distance between him and the Lancer, now standing a dozen meters away from his opponent.

Turning people to stone wasn&#39;t Aratron&#39;s only specialty, it seemed. Even the earth itself was serving him. Was it really control over the land itself, or something else?

He realized what he was dealing with once he noticed that the rubble he had destroyed was long gone. In its stead, a swarm of locusts with a rocky exterior had appeared.

&quot;...Devour him.&quot; Aratron declared, as the locusts headed straight for the Lancer in an attempt to eat him whole.</span>

Noble Phantasm Beta, come to me!&quot;

The dense mana around Lancer once again condensed into a physical form with the crack of thunder, his right hand briefly sheathed in light before the form of a peculiar weapon took shape. It was something half way between a spear and a sword, a long blade slung underneath a barrel with six revolving chambers near the handle. Ajax flicked it to his side before bracing it against his shield. He fired four shells in quick succession, buckshot scattering into the swarm of locusts like a fleet of angry bees intent on destruction. 

Cutting aside any that had made it through his withering fire, Ajax swatted down the rest with shield and lance before using the last two rounds as heavy slugs aimed at Aratron&#39;s chest.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lorenzo shook his head at Tapio&#39;s question. It made for a poetic scene. Two Servants thwacking at each other while their two pint sized Masters discussed philosophy. Lorenzo&#39;s outlook was disconnected from the idea of a traditional mage. His existence was a contradiction. He, in theory, shouldn&#39;t exist.

&quot;Of course I know that. Treating Servant as <em>just</em> familiars is insulting. They contribute to history, only for us to casually summon them at ours whims. Then we have the gall to throw them away when we&#39;re done with them? To <em>resummon</em> them as a blank slate? Their memories...&quot; Lorenzo made a poofing sound and splayed his hands. &quot;Gone. Returned to dust.&quot;

 &quot;Nothing lasts forever.&quot; Lorenzo echoed. &quot;That&#39;s true. Me especially. I&#39;m on...&quot; Lorenzo trailed off ominously. Had Tapio touched a nerve? It didn&#39;t seem like it. Lorenzo didn&#39;t get angry or sad. He just spoke and went on with his day. What was up with this kid?

Before Lorenzo could elaborate or before Tapio could pry, a new challenger approached. Coal spoke to Tapio about a &quot;Shmoal Hopson&quot;, before turning to Lorenzo expectantly. Tapio was right. He certainly wasn&#39;t a Shmoal or a Hopson. &quot;I don&#39;t think there are any Hopsons on Mansion Lane, sorry, sir. Besides, we can&#39;t move the battle, and no Aristocrats will have any say in it. Besides, it looks like your—&quot; He poked Tapio on the shoulder nervously. &quot;Servant can fiddle with material. He can fix up Mansion Lane. No muss, no fuss.&quot;

Not only had Coal&#39;s deception failed on Tapio, but it had also failed on Lorenzo. Whoops.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Well, Coal’s options were dashed against the rocks, so to speak. He still didn’t want to get any negative attention from either of those two maniacs currently fighting it out so his only option was to get Claudius to try and distract Lancer, if only for a few moments. Then, he would figure something out to get Tapio to back off and get out of this hell hole. Maybe just pull him back and whisper in his ear or something. 

Quietly, he stepped backwards from the two young boys, making sure they didn’t pay him any mind while he went back to his Servant still watching from the tree. If they were to turn around, it’d probably ruin everything and he would HAVE to go with physical force. He wasn’t in the mood to threaten one twelve year old with violence and another with an untrustworthy promise that he was in danger and needed to get the fuck out, but desperate times…

When he finally got back to the tree, he tried to be loud enough to be heard but only by Claudius, “Hey, plan failed. Fuck me, we gotta engage. You buy me some time, distract the big guy, I’ll try to get Caster’s kid in on the news and see if he’ll be willing to leave. If not, then… fuck it, we fight to kill. A free sneak attack will keep me up at night but nothing else, so just… do the thing on whoever is easiest to do it on.”

He started to waltz back over to the pair watching the battle or whatever, hands in pockets. He fidgeted with his box cutter deep in his pocket, releasing and returning the short blade in its hold. Hopefully it got to stay unbloodied.

Look how nervous he was, even trying to cope by hanging onto his clothes! And look, there he went, all forlorn and hugging the tree for comfort. 

That was simply heartbreaking. It made Tapio feel an immense weight being placed on his shoulders in the name of responsibility. He may be terrible at handling his grades, but he was no slouch when it came to handling people! He loved being dependable.

&#39;That guy looks like he could use a hand. I don&#39;t want him to lose his job because we&#39;re occupying the street.&#39; He jerked his thumb towards Cole. &#39;You speak of some funny things, but we can both agree that he&#39;s not a familiar, so he at least doesn&#39;t deserve to make sad memories off of a misplaced package.&#39; He egged Lorenzo on, even as their Servants started terraforming the street right in front of their eyes. Talk about a short attention spam.

&#39;Hey mister...&#39; Tapio trailed off, watching Cole coming back again with more resolution on his face. He wasn&#39;t sure if Persepolis&#39;s mailing service loved employing people with anxiety or that this guy was just <em>that</em> special. But, well, if he had found his happy place, then Tapio was happy for him.

&#39;Figured out the address? You could&#39;ve asked us for help. We aren&#39;t mages for nothing, you know.&#39; He chided the guy softly.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Claudius watched the two servants duke it out, enamored by their combat ability. Aratron seemed particularly threatening to Claudius. His mysterious ability to petrify limbs and hinder movement would be a powerful attack against Claudius. Not to mention his command over the earth was most impressive, Coals assumption that he was Caster seemed about right. 

Claudius also had the combat prowess of Lancer to worry about. Claudius never intended to fight out of the shadows from choice but he wasn&#39;t so ignorant to think everything could go his way. Furthermore if he could attain a sense of the Servants&#39; identities he might be able to plan a more devastating attack. All he was able to gather so far though was that Lancer is Greek. There were many Greek heroes who wielded both shield and spear however, so this alone gave Claudius too many options to decipher. 

Assassin was so fixated on the fight that he almost failed to realize that Coals plan had been thwarted. He watched as his Master hobbled back over, ready to hear what he had to say. “Not too good of a liar are ya?” Claudius asked with a laugh. 

A sigh left Claudius’s mouth as Coal walked away. Two plans in one, Claudius wasn&#39;t a fan. If Coal felt they were gonna resort to a brawl they should just start out that way. Claudius was much more dangerous when he could attack while the enemy was completely unaware of his presence, but if Coal needed a distraction first, he would get his distraction. Claudius reached into his pockets pulling out three powder bombs as he moved from tree to tree getting as close to the action as possible.</span>

One bomb would land at each side of Lancer and one more between him and Aratron. The bombs set off with a thud creating a loud pop bound to ring the ears of everyone in the area. The explosion wasn&#39;t very large but the smoke let off was a good deal, enough to obstruct everyone&#39;s vision on the battlefield

However, his street smarts were a sin against man. He was shocked that he hadn&#39;t done something incredibly stupid that caused Tapio to just walk off. Perhaps he already had, and Tapio just took it in stride.

However, nothing caused him confusion like Coal&#39;s actions.

First, he asked them for an address that Lorenzo was fairly certain <em>did not</em> exist. He didn&#39;t know a ton of the specific people within Mansion Lane or the Aristocrat district, but he knew most family names, as expected for the heir to mage family with an acceptable standing.

Then he hugged a tree.

What?

&quot;U-um... Are you...?&quot; Okay? Having a hard time? Nuts? Lorenzo didn&#39;t know what to say. To make matters worse, Tapio wanted to help him. Lorenzo had no issues with that specifically, but how could they help? Lorenzo&#39;s magecraft didn&#39;t help much here, unless the man&#39;s package was ice cream. Despite that, Lorenzo was naturally docile. He couldn&#39;t hurt a fly.

&quot;Are you o-okay, sir? We can help you, proba—AHH&quot; Lorenzo cried out as explosions rang out on the battlefield, filling the area with smoke. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Lancer?!?!&quot; Lorenzo&#39;s voice rang out.

That’s when he noticed a few balls fall from the sky. Assumedly from his own servant (if there was a fourth servant in this clusterfuck Coal would simply give up on everything) he prepared himself a second before impact. Magic muffled the bang from the balls, as well as dimmed the flash significantly. For the two looking at him, it would’ve appeared as a hint of orange film covering his eyes.

And that’s when he struck himself. When the two were confused, he grabbed Tapio by his arm, yanking him backward. “Close your eyes!” he yelled, yanking his right hand out and producing a small orb, bright red-orange in color and the size of a golf ball. In one fluid motion the ball went from his hand down towards the ground, right in front of Lorenzo on the far side. He tried his best to cover the child’s ears, shielding himself once again with his magic.

And the ball exploded. As if a sub par military grade Flashbang had been used, an even brighter flash and ringing noise came out from it’s point of impact. Anyone who got a sight of that thing without some ear plugs were gonna be <em>very</em> blind and disoriented for the next half a minute. Servants, well, Coal hoped they were more generally confused than anything else. 

Coal held onto his arm, trying to pull him in the vague direction that was ‘away from this fight’. “Kid, we gotta go! If you get axed from this War here by a nobody rich kid and his toy, I’m gonna be so fuckin pissed!”

Hmph, I&#39;m far superior to that old fairy tale.&quot; Aratron replied, scrutinizing Ajax&#39;s words with impunity. &quot;Not very astute of you to keep talking, Lancer. A Greek warrior with a shield who faced champions selected by Gods themselves. Even during the time of my conception, humanity had already discovered texts that described such epics. Perhaps you should curse your own popularity, warrior from a war long gone. Though looking at you now, you seem rather pitiful compared to Hector and Achilles. For once, my research is lacking, since I cannot possibly remember the valor of someone who cowers behind a shield.&quot;

Aratron taunted. It was apparent that he had figured out Ajax&#39;s origins, but he hadn&#39;t pinpointed the man&#39;s identity yet. The Caster seemed to come from a time where the Iliad was known, but still not fully researched. It didn&#39;t matter to Ajax, however, since he had unveiled his second Noble Phantasm. He disposed of the locusts in a few shots before aiming a few more at Aratron himself.

&quot;...You insult me, Lancer. Do you really intend to shoot down a <strong>God?</strong>&quot; Caster growled as the two slugs were microseconds away from him. There was no time to erect a barrier, so he just took the hit.

They penetrated his chest and erupted on the other side. A clean shot. A clean kill. At least, that was until Ajax saw the lack of blood on Aratron&#39;s clothes. Instead, something else was leaking...sand?

He wasn&#39;t dealing with a <strong>human</strong> Heroic Spirit. That much was certain now.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio was quite taken aback by the mystery bombs dropping from the sky. He had been <em>so</em> fixated on the people immediately before him that he ended up only paying half a mind to Lancer and Caster&#39;s fight. That wasn&#39;t to say his was disinterested. Quite on the contrary, he simply hadn&#39;t considered the possibility of Aratron losing. 

Of course, Saber was still the greatest class of all, but Caster was no slouch either. Were Tapio a more accomplished mage, perhaps he&#39;d take this Olympian spirit&#39;s self-assured drivel with a mountain of salt. After all, petrification and familiar creation weren&#39;t exactly Servant-exclusive skills. But what was lacking in originality, Aratron more than made up for with his abundance of knowledge and store of mana. Compared to him, Tapio&#39;s own mana reserves were like a drop in the bucket, so how could he even begin to measure the difference in strength, as one fellow magecraft practitioner to another?

So long as Aratron remained cool as a cucumber, Tapio would continue to take his words for granted.

...Until his Servant took a few shells right in the chest, blasting sand everywhere. 

That got the boy&#39;s full attention. He didn&#39;t recall seeing Caster do that trick before. Tapio extracted himself from Lorenzo&#39;s kaleidoscopic change of expressions, which had been entertaining to say the least. &#39;That&#39;s not good-&#39; He began, but that was when the smoke bombs dropped, and Tapio lost sight of his Caster.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The boy&#39;s immediate thought was to clear the smoke, but then a hand grabbed him and pulled him roughly away. He blinked and stared blankly at the deliveryman. He continued to stare as the man sandwiched his head between his hands in an effort to protect him from what was to come.

A flash of light, followed by an incredibly loud bang that was sure to disorient anyone in the vicinity without proper precautions. Coal would be relieved, as Tapio hadn&#39;t so much as flinched from the explosion of his Flashbang. That could only mean his magic shield had worked to its intended effect. Caster and Assassin&#39;s Masters, reunited at last-

A sharp pain in his hand made him drop Tapio. A ring of teeth marks lined his hand, the puffy skin glistening an angry red and even beginning to bleed in a few spots. The boy had bit him!

&#39;<strong>DON&#39;T</strong>. Spoil my fun! This is my first ever Servant fight! What are you, my nanny?&#39; Tapio was indignant as he turned on his potential ally with a solid stomping on his foot, further aiming to drive the man away. There was a trace of blood on his lips. &#39;Who&#39;s gonna axe me? I&#39;m staying. I want to watch.&#39;

He hadn&#39;t figured out Coal&#39;s agenda at all, had he?

Can’t have the young thinking they can go around biting people. And to top it all off, he got a swift foot to the… foot. Yep, all those middle schoolers better watch out the next time they eyed a nice flight of stairs. 

He immediately let go, shaking his hand in some vain attempt to get the pain out. The foot hurt too, but adrenaline was already starting to kick in. His heart started beating fast, instincts kicking in. 

Sort of.

“Jesus christ, what’s the matter with you?!” He gripped his hand tight to his chest, hoping silently that the kid had gotten his shots recently.  “I don’t care what you want, what you <em>need</em> is to get the fuck outta here! I doubt that big fuckin guy is gonna play nice if your Caster starts getting their ass kicked, and if your servant dies you’re out of the War! Now come on, I’m not asking again. Let’s get. The fuck. Outta here!” He made another attempt to grab Tapio, this time with his not bitten hand. And with less kindness. Tapio did just do a taste test, to be fair.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax was confident in his skill to slay any foe that stood before him. After all he taken a hefty toll on the numbers of Troy&#39;s champions during that grisly siege that seemed to last forever. Indeed he had even fought the great Prince Hector to a draw multiple times, even as the Prince was supported by Apollo. However to face a divine spirit itself was another matter entirely. How could he win against so mighty a force and one with dominion over Gaia&#39;s body? 

Of coruse, Aratron made like the kings of old and announced his defiance and supremacy over the old gods. That flavor of hubris had been wielded by those he knew in past life and denied him the honor of bearing Achilles&#39; armor. They failed to see his merit as a great warrior for they were too focused on congratulating themselves on the work they did not do.  Such a being could not be allowed to stand any longer. Ajax readied himself for a fatal lunge only for his vision of his opponent to be obscured by smoke. 

His shield began to tug in the direction of a third spirit origin signature. it had seemed that Aratron was working in concert with one hidden in the shadows, one with no honor to his name, Assassin. However, given that Caster was suddenly concerned for his master&#39;s well-being, this must have been an opportunistic assassin than one given to true alliances. The memory of Achilles and his companion Patrocles immediately came rushing into Ajax&#39;s mind and there was only one thing he could think of doing.

&quot;LORENZO! Stand your ground!&quot; He said, taking off at high speed, far faster than his frame had suggested. His shield whined louder and louder until it left off a loud rumbling sound as the field that had surrounded Ajax was now moving even faster than him in the direction towards Lorenzo, meeting him and surrounding it in its glow. As Ajax passed Aratron, he gave a few swipes at his shell, hoping to discourage him from pursuing him. &quot;Master, I am coming for you but take this sanctuary in my absence.</span>

Father would be furious with Aristocrat security, and with Ajax&#39;s inability to defuse the situation quickly. Not that it was Ajax&#39;s fault. Smoke bombs from out of nowhere? That was definitely an Assassin gimmick. There was no way that Ajax could see it coming completely. 

Luckily, Lancer had managed to protect him, even as he rushed to his Master&#39;s aid. Was it really luck, or was it a skill gained from his past life. Or perhaps experience?  Lorenzo didn&#39;t mull any of this over, but gratefully accepted the barrier that was protecting him. His knees felt weak and his teeth were chattering, but he had to put on a brave face.

The effect of Assassin&#39;s bombs were far beyond creating mere cover. They also sewed the seeds of chaos. Caster became less composed, as did Lancer. Meanwhile, the culprit scurried around. The higher the tension, the more likely that the enemy would snap, and Lorenzo had the lowest limit by a landslide. Not only could he snap mentally, but he could snap physically, as well.

&quot;D-don&#39;t leave my side, Lancer. Stay c-close. Don&#39;t let anyone get hurt. That&#39;s an o-o-order.&quot; Lorenzo stammered as he looked around. &quot;Where&#39;s Caster&#39;s Master? Is he okay?&quot; Unaware of Coal&#39;s attempts to drag away Tapio, Lorenzo called out into the smoke randomly.

Things really took a turn for the worse when Aratron and Ajax understandably made a mad dash for their Masters “Oi we can&#39;t have that now can we” Claudius mumbled to himself, he was far from happy with the progression of the situation

Claudius dashed from the branches of subsequent trees till he was in the position to drop down in front of Aratron. He would much prefer to try and take a swing at Lancer but it seemed he had to pass up that opportunity to save Coal. Claudius pushed off the branches from above meeting Caster at eye level with his pistol to his chest. Judging from what happened earlier with Ajax’s projectiles he figured this wouldn&#39;t hurt Aratron at all. 

“Ye better calm down, we’re trying ta be your chap alright?” He stated firing the duckfoot pistol to try and slow Aratron down.

Compared to an Achaean hero and an assassin from the west, he was relatively slow. Therefore, he simply accelerated the ground, separating a piece of terrain from the ground and having it hover in mid-air. He stood on it and accelerated, seconds away from reaching Coal before Ajax intervened.

&quot;Do not interrupt me, Lancer! Your Master is not my target!&quot; He protested, but Ajax was having none of that. He bashed Aratron multiple times, with Aratron replying by erecting more rock walls to intercept the bashes.

&quot;Student, I am almost th--&quot;

<strong>BANG BANG BANG</strong>

More sand fell from Aratron&#39;s body, as Claudius blocked his path while pointing a gun at him. Caster was fuming, watching as Coal ran off in the distance while the Assassin insisted on remaining put.

&quot;Chap? Calm down?&quot; It seemed like Aratron hadn&#39;t understood Claudius&#39; intent, most likely due to his manner of speech. &quot;<strong>Out of my way, Servant.</strong>&quot; 

Claudius would be surprised to find the bullets he had fired emerge from Aratron&#39;s body. They had been morphed completely, now resembling bat-like creatures made of rock and metal. They viciously pursued Claudius, one of them colliding with his gun as he watched his weapon start to lose parts. They could even tear through hard alloys! <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Once bitten, twice shy. Coal made a grab for Tapio again, this time much more cautious. This time, he stayed away from anywhere near the boy&#39;s mouth and ended up grabbing him by the back of his coat. He pulled Tapio away like a dog on a leash, the boy half skipping and half hopping away as a third Servant jumped into the foray and accosted Aratron.

The street was in disarray. It was no longer the match Tapio had desired. 

&#39;Who sent you?! I didn&#39;t ask for a bodyguard!&#39; Tapio scratched and kicked and snapped at Coal. At least he had the brains to connect the dots. Some dots. That bum of a Servant must&#39;ve belonged to this (obviously fake) deliveryman. They spoke of the Holy Grail War and didn&#39;t want him dead. Another participant? ...An ally?

Everything clicked, but Tapio was having none of it.

&#39;Well you can&#39;t boss me around, we&#39;re on equal foo-WHY IS HE ATTACKING CASTER?!&#39; Tapio did not appreciate Claudius&#39; advance at all. &#39;<strong>You are lying, let go!</strong>&#39;

Tapio reached into his belt pouch and pulled out an assortment of four-sided die. It was hard to see his &#39;kidnapper&#39; when he was being pulled from the back, so he just tossed them all backwards in the general direction of Coal&#39;s face. Streaks glowed on the dice, reminding Coal of basic runes. What sinister purposes did they serve-

Coal&#39;s worries were promptly answered when an assortment of everyday objects rained down on his head. Gumdrops, apple slices, pen nibs and ink bottles assaulted his face in an attempt to disorient him. Miniature bounded fields...for storage!

Aratron would be absolutely appalled at such barbarous usage of a fine craft. If only he had a mind to spare.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal sighed out some of his built up stress. Seems like the kid could put two and two together. He continued pulling him away from the conflict, managing to keep him relatively close and keeping him on the right direction. He was content that the kid at least understood his inten--

Wait Claudius was attacking Caster?! What the everliving fuck were these last moments and why the hell did nothing make sense anymore? Coal made a mental sticky note to take a very, very long steaming hot shower when this was all said and done. 

If he didn’t manage to get himself killed by an understandably pissed Servant, that is. Maybe this plan wasn’t the best in the world…

“My… Servant, stop your attack! You’re giving off the wrong--” 

He watched as glowing dice whizzed past his head. He wasn’t able to even comprehend the strange carvings on the surfaces, but mere moments later various objects started to attack him. Various was put it lightly, they were as random as random could be. Who the fuck attacks someone with a few writing supplies and snacks appealing to a toddler?

It did work in disorienting him, his grip momentarily lightened. Tapio escaped, and he wasn’t able to grab him on the instinctive rebound. A red flash of anger surged into his head. He started to feel bad for the Servant instead of the other way around.

“Kid, I’m not lying to you,” he tried to quickly step his way back towards Tapio and attempted another grab, “if I were, you’d be in a lot worse shape, trust me! Claudius--fuck, Servant! Make sure the big guy doesn’t follow us! Caster isn’t the target here!”

On one hand, that slip up might hurt them in the long run. On the other, he still couldn’t figure out who the fuck this guy was even with an online search. If anyone else could put the pieces together, he’d give them a fucking medal.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron was surrounded by distractions. First, the obnoxious Lancer who insisted on continuing their bout despite their Master being in danger. Second, the new arrival which was a gunslinger Servant whose objective seemed to be slowing Aratron down. They were harmless flies compared to him, but he still detested this. All of this. 

This confrontation had been a sham: He had just come here to prove his superiority to Saber, the strongest Class of them all. There was a sound reason behind this objective, but he could barely remember it with all the chaos around him. His Master was in dire straits, so he refocused on keeping his student safe. It was his main purpose, after all. Saber could wait.

Aratron blitzed past Claudius, letting the bats keep the Assassin occupied while the Caster attempted to reach Tapio. He witnessed the struggle between Tapio and Coal, watching as the student so valiantly attempted to defend himself against his aggressor with makeshift tactics that weren&#39;t befitting of a mage.

<em>&quot;Not even a single spell or incantation? Have my lectures fallen under deaf ears?&quot;</em> Aratron wondered, tempted to criticize Tapio right there.

Until Coal attempted to grab the kid while screaming aggressively.

Coal certainly wasn&#39;t in the wrong and he had no intention to harm Aratron, but Caster&#39;s mind had already perceived the event as something else: An attack on his student. <strong>His student was in danger.</strong>

Humans were vile. Humans were disgusting. They could turn on each other in a matter of seconds and regularly engaged in spiritual and physical bloodshed. By all means, they were destined to be damned.

But this demon with a heart of stone could not help but cherish them. Ever since he met that man in white robes...</span>

&quot;...Humans. Servants. You will stop now if you value your lives. <strong>Or else.</strong>&quot;

Aratron&#39;s clothes fluttered. He stood immobile as the ground itself started to quiver. Lancer&#39;s footwork felt hindered as he felt like he was running on uneven terrain. Eventually, he heard splashes: He was somehow standing on knee deep water, despite being on a sidewalk not long ago.

Claudius had a similar reaction, feeling the scorching heat of a desert sun as he saw half submerged in sand.

Coal was seconds away from grabbing Tapio, but his survival instincts kicked in as his body instinctively backed off and moved on its own. He wondered why that was the case, before noticing that the floor ahead of him had now been replaced by scorching hot coals. Touch&#233;.

The entire area had been terraformed, or part of it at least. The environment around them was shifting, changing and morphing at will. Roads turned into deserts, sidewalks turned into seawater and Tapio was surrounded on all sides by coals, spikes, lava and such. Surprisingly, the temperature around him felt normal. Cozy, even. However, those around Tapio felt the effects of both heat and cold as they realized that only Tapio was being protected.

Things got worse once they stared at the sky. It was no longer a sun shrouded in clouds, but a starry sky showing one of the main planets: <strong>Saturn.</strong></span>

<strong>&quot;My arms encroach the skies, my feet tread on galaxies...&quot;</strong> Aratron chanted while the rest of the group realized that the area around them had been segmented: 49 grids formed the area around them, each grid being around a meter long and wide. The battlefield had been divided in these 49 grids, a sign that something was manipulating the world around them. A barrier? A Reality Marble? Who could say? The only thing they knew for sure was that it was Aratron&#39;s doing, and that it was too vast of an ability to be a skill.

A Noble Phantasm.

<strong>&quot;Kings, rulers, emperors...I am above them all. The almighty planet, sovereign of the cosmos, behold!&quot;</strong> Aratron screamed, an enormous pillar erupting beneath his feet as it took him high above the skies. He looked down at the Servants and Masters below him while raising his arms and embracing the planet above him.

Saturn was slowly descending...

<strong>&quot;Come forth, from my limbs, my flesh...Divine power. Enough to tear the cosmos asunder! Arbatel Saturn: The Kingdom of 49 Provinces!&quot;</strong>

Saturn descended, cracking into pieces as it fused with Aratron. The Servant&#39;s human body had disintegrated. His shell was gone. Instead, his true form started to surface...</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio didn&#39;t sign up for a lecture by someone he had just met. Coal could scream all the sense there was into his ear, but he had long since made up his mind. Tapio wanted to meet a Saber. Aratron wanted to defeat a Saber. For better or worse, the Master and Servant&#39;s goals had aligned, and they now chased after the common thread that was Lorenzo. 

This aristocrat kid was the ticket to their Saber.

Assassin&#39;s Master wanted to orchestrate the game like a chess master, but Tapio only wanted to be a pawn. Retreat and reconvene? That was simply out of the question. For as long as he could remember, falling back had never been an option.

&#39;If you want my trust, then let me stay and watch!&#39; He tried to untangle himself and beat back Coal&#39;s arm with a thwack - and surprisingly, it had worked. The man faltered, even before Tapio had resumed his infallible tactic of biting.

The ground had shifted. Well, to say that it had shifted would be an understatement.

The slab of earth that Tapio, Coal and everyone else had been standing on had simply been <strong>replaced</strong>, by a mishmash of everchanging landscape that under no circumstances should&#39;ve existed in harmony. Lava, spikes, deserts and forests bloomed under their feet. The galactic visage of planets and stars shrouded the sky. The splash of water carried the distinctive smell of an ocean breeze, yet they were nowhere near the edge of the city!

Tapio was momentarily distracted. He blinked, taking in the impossible landscape all around him with wonder. Caster had always talked a big game, but when he descended from the heavens in a draconic mass of stone and lava, <em>that</em> was when Tapio realized that this old-fashioned stuck-up had the bulk and strength to back up his claim. 

&#39;Holy...holy <em>shit</em>!&#39; Whispered Tapio. He turned and ran.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The thought that the burning earth could harm him hadn&#39;t even crossed his mind. Indeed, as he bounded across smoldering coal mines and climbed over spiky forests, none of those earthy projections had so much as left a mark on him. The boy chased after Aratron, heart beating like mad. 

<em>This is the coolest shit EVER!</em> In the heat of the moment, even his fixation on Saber momentarily wavered. Forget about the sword, he wanted to see the dragon, <em>his</em> dragon, gobble up the other Servants like afternoon snacks right now!

He started hyperventilating.

&#39;Do you see now? There&#39;s no way I can lose!&#39; The boy spun around and waved at Coal before continuing on, unaware that the man, unlike him, wasn&#39;t so lucky to be exempt from the hinders of Aratron&#39;s bounded field. He slowed to a walk as he got close to the Servants&#39; three-way standoff, sweat rolling down his forehead. 

Scorching hot lava spewed out of the dragon like gigantic waterfalls, spelling doom for the other Servants yet only radiating a hot water bottle&#39;s level of heat to Tapio. The sight was mesmerizing.

&#39;Why won&#39;t you teach me how to do this instead, Cast-Caster...&#39;

His skin felt cold and clammy.

<em>Thud.</em>

&#39;Caster,&#39; Tapio fell to his knees, arms shaking, head swimming. A large tear marred the back of his coat. Translucent patterns lined the inside of his coat, their purpose evident to an accomplished magus at a glance. Hundreds of sigils working in unison, all towards the singular goal of entrapment and stabilization. But for what?

Lancer and Assassin felt a stir in their earthen shackles.

What would&#39;ve been an instantaneous transformation from water to stone had been slowed to a near crawl. An unfamiliar source of magical energy rushed to their aid, expending itself to neutralize the effect of Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Water crystallized into stone one moment, but thawed into liquid the next as Aratron&#39;s sorcery and the external force waged war against each other.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio&#39;s mana was leaking like water out of a broken faucet, blindly attaching itself to everything and anything in the vicinity. Spikes stopped emerging from the ground. The gun in Claudius&#39; hand stopping breaking under the stone bats&#39; bombardment. Even the earth resisted being scorched as Aratron&#39;s lava blanketed it from above. 

Change.

Tapio&#39;s mana was trying to prevent the environment from changing, and it succeeded superbly.

But only for a split second.

After all, compared to Aratron, Tapio&#39;s mana reserves were but a drop in a bucket. Even though he had the potential to shut down Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm, the toll had wrung his body dry faster than he could blink. What was worse, it seemed that the process was one beyond the boy&#39;s control.

Words failed him. It took all Tapio had to remember how to breathe. He touched the ground with his forehead, which was growing hot from sporting a fever. 

His mana continued to leak. 

Should Aratron and the other Servants continue to wreck the environment in pursuit of one another, chances were high that Aratron&#39;s kingdom of stone would become its Master&#39;s final resting place.

It <em>was</em> a pretty sweet deal for anyone wishing to take Caster out of the Holy Grail War, however.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">At the moment all Ajax cared about was keeping his master safe and Aratron’s plea fell on deaf ears as he cut him down the hastily risen earth walls with ease, seeing them as nothing more than roadblocks to securing his master and bringing an end to this duel.

The cover of sanctuary over Lorenzo would protect him from any magical effects sent his way and he could feel it grow stronger as Ajax neared his master. He was only a few paces away when he heard Lorenzo’s commands and saw how shook-up the boy way.

“Understood, Master. I will not leave your side and you shall never have to fear while i am near,” Ajax reassured him with a fatherly smile, though what Lorenzo said next confused him. To look out for the opposing master and make sure they do not get hurt? What an odd request but perhaps in this instance when both were so young, there was something to be said for the naivety of youth and purity of soul. “I will abide by your orders at all cost.”

It made him think of the countless times he had saved the lives of his fellow Achaeans on the beaches of Troy, though that was not because of the order of a child but rather it was what one did for their fellow man in a time of strife. Achilles may have been the shining star of the war, Odysseus its playwright and Hector its sympathetic antagonist but Ajax had done all the work behind the scenes so they could shine. 

His thoughts and search for Tapio were interrupted by Aratron’s dramatic ascension into divinity and his own arrest by the shifting earth below. To be held in place like a damn chicken waiting for the axe to drop was intolerable for a man of action like Ajax. He quickly looked behind to see Lorenzo free of a similar condition but still threatened by the lance of magma above. He would have rather kept his cards hidden but the need for self-preservation, the protection of his master and the memory of the War provided the impetus for him to make his stand and be known.</span>

His shield was angled up towards Aratron’s oncoming magma. 

“<strong>Tyrants, monsters and Gods may strike with the wrath of many but my will does not waver,</strong>” His shield let out a familiar whine as more and more mana became compressed within its layers. “<strong>With strength and courage, Mankind shall prove its worth once more on this battleground</strong>”

“<strong>Against all odds, I shall defend all those under my aegis.  Unleash your glory, Seven Layer Guardian of the Hero, EURYSACES ALPHA!</strong>” On cue, the shimmering field from before radiated out from Lancer’s shield but at much greater speed as six more fields emerged from behind, each more potent than the last. Within a second, Aratron’s dominion over Ajax’s square collapsed and his hold on him shattered. Within three, a veritable blossom of a giant magical shield had grown to encompass the adjacent grid squares as well. Lorenzo found himself swaddled in its comforting energy, absolutely safe against all forces that could hurt him.</span>

He did not know where he was going but his instincts compelled him so, even as he expended more energy countering the bounded field around him. Yet when he finally stopped, he did not have the luxury to look down at who he was protecting as the strike cast by Saturn finally made contact with his shield.

Tapio would find himself an unlikely guardian in his time of exhaustion. Despite the immense commotion above himself and the sheer amount of power on both sides, the boy would find his mana easier to control in this moment. Likewise, breaths seemed to come easier as the oppressive air of Aratron’s NP lessened around him while grass tickled his belly. Sanctuary for the moment, a necessary breather before a final sprint.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A demonic dragon of molten rock had descended from the intergalactic heavens. The aristocracy could only dream of summoning such a terrifying Servant. How did an innocuous mage such as Tapio manage to summon or even sustain such a beast?

Perhaps it was wrong to assume that Tapio was <em>innocuous</em> in the first place.

Claudius was shitting his pants from fear at the rain of magma that filled the skies. He wondered if this was the end...until he realized that he could move again. The rock had returned to sand, the sand desperately tried to turn back to rock but to no avail. Something was stopping the metamorphosis, and giving him ample time to free himself as a result. It was now or never: He either got up and ran off back to his Master, or he risked becoming Servant BBQ.

And if he looked around him, he would notice something odd: Caster&#39;s Master, on his knees and with a face bluer than the night sky. He looked like he was choking to death. Claudius knew that his mission was to protect Caster&#39;s Master, but honestly, could he even be arsed when he too was in mortal peril as well?

But something felt off: The grids around Tapio weren&#39;t changing. <em>At all.</em> Water turned back to sidewalk. Spikes became normal roads again. The mansion lane was slowly returning to normal, and it didn&#39;t feel like it was due to Aratron deactivating his Noble Phantasm. No, someone with Magecraft strong enough to affect a Noble Phantasm was causing this. Magecraft so unruly and pure that even the most prodigious of Magus would be unable to match its sheer volume and intensity.

Tapio eventually collapsed from strain, as his mana reserves dried out. But his Origin was still strong, as the lasting effects of his Magecraft could still be felt in Aratron&#39;s bounded field. They would disappear in due time, but for now, both Claudius and Ajax could freely move.</span>

Ajax took this chance, rushing to his Master&#39;s defense. To his surprise, he would notice that none of Aratron&#39;s attacks had landed next to Lorenzo, nor Coal. Regardless, his mission was far from afar: He had to rescue Tapio under Lorenzo&#39;s orders. He rushed to the boy&#39;s defense, activating his Noble Phantasm in the process as magma projectiles were flung away from a safe distance. Pure mana erupted from Ajax&#39;s shield as Aratron&#39;s bounded field was starting to crumple, being confronted by something of comparable power.

However, it wasn&#39;t all that easy. Ajax was confident he would be able to overcome the Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm if he expended his remaining mana reserves, but then he looked back at the child that he was protecting. His Noble Phantasm...wasn&#39;t protecting them? No, it was actively making things <em>worse.</em> For some reason, any amount of protective shielding around Tapio&#39;s body kept cracking and disassembling itself, as if he were watching a recording in reverse. The boy&#39;s own body was rejected his aid, but why?

It was then that Ajax noticed that this wasn&#39;t just affecting his Noble Phantasm, but the entire area as well. The grids were returning to normal, Tapio&#39;s unique Magecraft undoing any form of change around him. Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm wasn&#39;t the reason for Tapio collapsing...<strong>Tapio collapsed because of the latent energy hidden within himself.</strong>

Ajax couldn&#39;t vouch for the boy&#39;s survival at the current rate. His Noble Phantasm was able to protect himself, but not the child behind him. Aratron&#39;s magma beam descended upon them...

...before it morphed into a stream of water. Harmless, flowing water that was unfit to even be a waterjet cutter. Ajax watched as droplets bounced off his shield, wondering what the Caster was playing at. It was only when he turned around that he realized that Tapio had been carried away by the waves.</span>

The waves morphed into rock, but Tapio morphed them back into water. It was a vicious struggle, with Aratron trying to restrain the unconscious student, but the boy&#39;s own body fought back. Eventually, Tapio&#39;s mana completely emptied as Aratron trapped the boy in a cocoon of rock. Strange markings and runes then appeared all over the stone prison, resonating with Tapio&#39;s body and undoing the blueness of his face. They resembled the marks on his cloak.

&quot;Lancer, you impertinent oaf! What good is your heroism if you can&#39;t even save my student? You are an insult to all familiars...&quot; The rocky dragon from the skies growled at Ajax. Aratron was pissed, having most likely noticed his Noble Phantasm&#39;s spotty effectiveness when affected by Tapio&#39;s crisis and Ajax&#39;s own Noble Phantasm.

&quot;Had you simply stayed put, <em>as I said</em>, this wouldn&#39;t have happened! My Noble Phantasm does not target humans...&quot; He chided, almost tempted to blast Lancer there for his insolence, until Tapio&#39;s cocoon started cracking...The boy still had mana to spare?!

Aratron panicked. He had never witnessed something this terrifying before. Mana capable of consuming even its own host. Ajax watched as the grids around him started to gradually disappear, a sign that Aratron was releasing his Bounded Field. Magma returned to being sidewalks while water grids became a street. The mansion lane was restored, with Aratron&#39;s draconic form cracking open like an eggshell. His hydra-like heads dissipated into sand and dust as Aratron&#39;s human form reemerged.

The teacher landed on the ground, sprinting towards Tapio&#39;s rock cocoon as he grabbed a piece of cloth that was suspiciously lying on the floor: It was Tapio&#39;s coat.

The cocoon then burst open, returning to being water as Aratron swiftly slammed the cloth on Tapio&#39;s back. By the power of Magecraft, he proceeded to stich the coat back together.

Finally, Tapio had stopped exerting the pressure from earlier. It was over.</span>

Aratron, was of course, displeased.

Surprisingly, however, the mansion lane was completely intact. All of its participants were also unharmed. Had you asked a passerby whether they thought a battle had occurred today or not, they would most likely respond with &#39;no&#39;.

Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm was devastating, but surprisingly cautious at the same time. Anything he destroyed, he once again created. Were his boasts about defeating Saber without harming a single human really just boasts?

&quot;...This bout ends here. My student requires rest.&quot; Aratron said while staring daggers at Ajax&#39;s eyes. He then glanced back to Claudius and Coal.

&quot;And you two. I care not for your motives, but if you are truly our allies, then you shall leave us be. My student has no need for self-proclaimed caretakers.&quot; He declared, before grabbing Tapio by his coat and preparing to leave. <span class="mention" title="Eagan#8440">@Eagan</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0083">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="nebby#3980">@Nubby</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He almost had Tapio again, a second away from getting his grip back on the kid. He didn’t even want to understand any of the childish thoughts currently occupying his mind. Seriously, did he even know how dangerous it was being <em>remotely</em> near the conflicts of servants? That shit was terrifying, yet he kept trying to watch them to at it as if it were a game or something. Was this what the youth did to keep themselves entertained these days?

Yet something seemed… off. He felt a surge of some sort of power all around him, coursing through the area. As Tapio fought back, his gut told him to back off regardless of how poorly the kid was doing at it himself. And so he did, quickly stepping backwards away from the boy. Was this some sort of on-the-fly counter trap?

Something like that: ground before him quickly turned to scorching hot coals. His mind didn’t exactly process the situation around him immediately. Coal’s first thoughts were that this Caster was trying to play a funny man in a serious situation, which made him groan in annoyance. Haha, really funny--

Holy shit, what the fuck was going on around him?! He tensed up just looking at all the wacky stuff going down, street side turning into a mishmash of different environments. Gears struggled to turn in that brick head of his. Mouth hung open, a prime hiding place for any nearby bugs trying to escape whatever fresh hell this was.

If he had known that Caster was capable of such… magecraft, he’d had never tried to intervene in the first place. Would it have killed the guy to give a little warning ahead of time? ‘Hey, I can literally make the area any kind I want’ would’ve done wonders for his course of action planning. For starters, they’d probably not be in this situation in the first place.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Speaking off, where was Caster now? He knew that the guy was pretty close before shit when to hell. He glanced around, looking for that weirdo but failing to spot in amongst the trees and ocean and desert. 

Until he looked up. Hanging up in the sky was no longer the same thing he had taken for granted all his life. Now there was a big as fuck DRAGON spouting shit about fourty-nine and a cos-mos, whatever the fuck that was. Truly a terrifying sight, but that was more than likely Caster. Fit the bill, being all smart and mighty about his new body or however that worked.

But something caught his eye, something that actually made Coal wide eyed in fear: some sort of burning rubble had appeared from the sky. He was able to tell that it was nowhere near close to coming down on him, but instead on two other figures in the vicinity.

That being the big guy and Claudius. 

All instincts pointed to an easy solution of running away and to not look back at whatever destruction was about to come around. Coal would be lying if he said it didn’t sound tempting to see how much ground he was able to cover for… testing purposes. 

But Claudius was about to be burnt to death or smothered by some hot rocks. And that wasn’t something Coal could afford. 

“I’m coming, Claudius!”

So, he ran into the fray. Past burning ground too hot to touch, over deep pools of water threatening to swallow him whole, between a few trees sprouted from the ground, right over to his servant. None of these dangers actually registered inside his head. They appeared as roadblocks hell bent on keeping him away from Claudius, like Caster was determined to keep Coal out of the area and unable to help his own servant.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That only pissed him off even more. Life was trying its best to spit on him at every opportunity, every turn and bend in the road. He wasn’t about to let some stuck up, book smart, snotty nose, hot headed NERD like this dragon guy join in suit with whatever god really wanted Coal to fail at his only meaningful goal in life. 

He pushed on, finally pushing past the final trunk and getting eyes on his servant. And it looked bad. The guy was dug in deep, knees stuck in weird black rock. Whoever that Caster guy was, they weren’t playing around. Already stacking the odds against him ever getting Claudius out of this bind, but that ain’t ever gonna stop him.

“Come on,” Coal yelled, sliding over to Assassin’s resting place feet first. He stopped right next to the person, a clearly practiced maneuver. Not that it was the time to show off, but it felt cool and right doing it. 

“We gotta get out of here! Mission’s canceled, little brat had a fucking DRAGON up his sleeve. If anything, we need <strong>his</strong> help in staying alive!” Coal grabbed around the servant’s waist, vainly pulling up and back in an attempt to free him of his newfound prison. Sure enough, he slowly slid free of the rock. Well, sand. The rock had turned to sand. Somehow. He wasn’t about to question the way that worked.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Coal grabbed hold of Claudius’ arm and pulled him away from the descending hot rocks, not even paying attention to Tapio who certainly would’ve been easy pickings, so long as you ignore the shit threatening to kill them. Back they went, away from the burning rock falling from the sky and to somewhere a little safer. 

And they watched hot rocks turn to water, the dragon talk to the warrior from earlier (apparently they were a Lancer) and return everything back to normal. Unfortunately, Mansion Lane was back to normal. Coal preferred it the other way, only because it meant that even the Aristocrats weren’t safe from the very things they treated like jewelry and toys to be admired and played with. 

In the middle of it all was Tapio, currently out cold. The kid looked like he had just ran a marathon and then some. Caster stood over them protectively, staring down Lancer while chiding Coal and Claudius. He did not bother to argue about how he himself could be a ‘self-proclaimed caretaker’. 

But he could admit when he wasn’t exactly in the right. “Fair enough. If I had known you could turn into a dragon before all this, I would’ve never tried that shit earlier. But this ain’t the last you’ll see of me. Swing by the middle of the Commoner District and we can stuff figured out, if you want. If not, whatever.”

“And you two,” he turned to the other servant pair. “I ain’t dumb. You two are a part of this area, plain as day. You ain’t part of this War going on. Stick to your lives of privilege and wealth for just one fucking second, please, instead of harrasing anyone you come by.” Coal’s outburst was more personal than anything else. Maybe some past interactions with Nobility soured him to their lives.</span>

He started to walk further down the street, deeper into Aristocracy territory and past Caster. A package re-emerged from his jacket, now firmly between his hands. “Now I got a box to get to someone, and a nice hot shower waiting for me.”

Coal hated his job.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Claudius was a little ticked off as his gun dissolved into a bunch of flying pests. He tried swatting at them, however that would quickly become the least of his worries. Assassin watched with a keen eye as Aratron shaped the landscape in an attempt to eliminate both him and Ajax.

What beautiful imagery Claudius thought watching as Saturn revealed itself only to be accompanied by a dragon, who seemed to be a bringer of death for the servants below. This flashiness, the heat, the bending of everything natural around them, Claudius despised it all. Gritting his teeth he could think about how much he hated magus of the sort. Although Aratron was well beyond a magus Claudius’s distaste was nothing short of the same.

With nothing to do but die Claudius observed the surroundings, he had danced with a brutal death before only this time he had far less passionate things to worry about… That was until his Master came scurrying to his side.

“You idiot what are you doing!” He yelled at Coal. In the face of death Claudius had done his best to keep composure but idiocy, idiocy that was something he couldn&#39;t stand. His death in life was the result of people making stupid decisions and now his Master was making decisions that were just as outlandish. “You idiot forget about me! I’m expandable, you still have a life!”

Claudius’s doubts in Coals ability to save him seemed to be misplaced. By some miracle Aratrons Noble Phantasm let up, did it have to do with Tapios sudden collapse he wondered.

Pulling away from Coals grasp Claudius dusted himself off now that everything was safe. He looked back at Caster with disdain in his eyes, rubbing his rotten teeth together as if trying to break them. “You…. I don&#39;t quit like you’re type.” He stated then walking off with his master</span>

Claudius decided he’d wait till they got back home to lay into his Master for acting so rash.

Aratron had changed the world, altering it in a way that Lorenzo could just barely wrap his head around. Stone shifted into sand then into fire then into dust, and then back again. It reminded Lorenzo of the pain fueled haze he had been in, years ago. A body incapable of feeling, of reacting, and responding. A time when his soul flew beneath the waves of the ocean, and into the stars in the sky. Rational? No. Possible? Definitely not. Comprehensible? Yes. It was a magnificent Noble Phantasm.

Turning into a dragon? Sure, why not. That made more sense to Lorenzo compared to Aratron being a human with a bone to pick with everything and everyone. 

The greatest of praises belonged to Lorenzo&#39;s Lancer, as well. Ajax&#39;s ability to stand stalwart under the assault of such a powerful Noble Phantasm proved his capabilities for defense. Eurysacres Alpha... A defensive Noble Phantasm that resisted the very changing of reality. A bulwark capable of preventing nearly every attack. It made perfect sense for the type of Servant that Lorenzo had summoned. The name was definitely Greek. So Aetos WAS a Greek name. However, despite all that...</span>

&quot;W-what&#39;s wrong with him?&quot; Lorenzo said, already knowing what it was. Mana leakage. Was this an ironic twist of fate, or just a monstrous coincidence. The smallest masters suffered from such a fatal flaw? Why was this happening? According to Caster, this had been their doing. Did this mean that Lorenzo&#39;s orders had been a sham? His ideals had been false? Did he cause the near-death of another human being? How did he apologize to both Aratron AND Caster? He couldn&#39;t look either of them in the eye.

Lorenzo fell to his knees. &quot;L-lancer. Stop.&quot; It was a simple order, but one his Servant would be obliged to follow. Nothing had been accomplished today. Lancer and he hadn&#39;t won or proven anything. Caster&#39;s Master had been nearly killed, and Coal and Claudius... Lorenzo wasn&#39;t sure where to even start with them.

&quot;I never even learned his name...&quot; Lorenzo told Lancer as Caster carried Tapio away. Slowly but surely, Ajax guided Lorenzo away. &quot;Does that mean that what we believe in is a lie? You can&#39;t protect everyone from getting hurt.&quot; Lorenzo said as they returned back to the manor. 

&quot;I just want this war to be over.&quot;
