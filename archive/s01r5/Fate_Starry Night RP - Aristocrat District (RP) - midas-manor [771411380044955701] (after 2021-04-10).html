An hour or so had passed since Caster&#39;s defeat. Since the destruction of Midas&#39; Manor. Since Archer&#39;s reckless sacrifice.

The end was nigh.

Two figures scurried over to their original destination. Their detour had taken quite a while, but at least they had survived. Opportunity was still damaged, but functional enough to assist them in their trek.

Pascal was on the passenger&#39;s seat, staring at the traces of the injuries he had received. Bullet wounds, stabs, scars, burns...All of them had somewhat faded, but it was a mere illusion. He could still feel the fire burning his skin, the bullet embedded in his body, the pain of stab wounds that had yet to heal.

It was just like Kari had said: He would survive, but he would also start wishing that he had died instead. Her healing magic was great, but the damage he had taken was too severe for a non-expert like her to take care of. She patched him up enough to get a trip to the nearest hospital.

So, of course, he decided to go after Szrac instead. There was no point in going to a doctor if Szrac was around. He would probably get killed mid operation. Rider knew that as well. It was time to finish things now or never.

The two arrived at the manor, feeling the smell of burnt gold as Pascal sneezed for the sheer amount of smoke in the area. Someone else had attacked Berserker first. Were they in luck? Had Szrac already bit the dust?

&quot;Rider, do you think,&quot; He asked for secondary approval. &quot;...that they&#39;ve already..?&quot;

Pascal&#39;s voice was rather weak, but Rider wasn&#39;t feeling great either. The last fight had cost him a lot of mana, to the point he wasn&#39;t even sure he could activate Apollo 11 anymore. They had mana batteries, sure, but the process of ingesting them was time-consuming and vulnerable.

On the bright side, whoever had fought back at Midas&#39; Manor was probably worse off than them. He doubted that they had enough time to recharge either.</span>

From atop the ruined manor, reduced to little more than stone rubble and golden detritus, the figure that he feared reached the crumbled summit. The mechanical demon, cloaked in metal, who exuded naught by pure malice with their every action.

Szrac looked down upon the Opportunity, through the windshield and to the inside, gaze firmly fixed on Pascal. Even with the distance between them, even when separated from him by the thick hull of the rover, he could still feel the absolute hatred radiating from him, as though his glassy lenses were red orbs of pure contempt. 

<strong>&quot;How irritating? You are the last resistance I must crush? You are the last challenge to overcome? Tch... Well, I suppose I shall entertain this delusion of grandeur. You may consider it a prize for your survival, miserly cockroach.&quot;</strong>

Having thoroughly chewed out the master, his eyes then turned to the servant, perched within his driver&#39;s seat.

<strong>&quot;After our encounter, I took the time to research you, Neil Armstrong. Your actions and your deeds. The first man on the Moon, was it? And yet you possess the Mars Rover as a Noble Phantasm? A mission you had no stake in.&quot;</strong> The magus spoke coldly and analytically, shaking his head as if he was disappointed by the masquerade. 

Then, his attention turned to the both of them, as one.

<strong>&quot;Pascal Poirot. Rider of NASA. The winner of this conflict will attain the Holy Grail. A vessel of miracle, one capable of granting any desire that you hold. Tell me, what wish do you hold for the Grail? What drives you to fight on, despite the hell that awaits you ahead?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In comparison with Pascal, Rider was raring to go.

On the surface, anyway. He felt like he had been crushed by a rocket.

Sure, he had sounded excited on the drive to the mansion, talking about space and the possibility of light speed travel, but in his gut, he knew one certain, inescapable fact: The Holy Grail War was coming to an end, and his actions would finally have a direct result on who would touch that blessed cup.

&quot;That they already bit the dust? We can hope, Houston. We can truly hope.&quot; Rider said quietly as he smashed through the ruined fence gate. Secretly, Rider was hoping that both Berserker and Gagarin were still alive. He wanted to confirm that both Master and Servant were crushed  before treading on towards the future. They were too dangerous to be left alive.

Besides, Rider <em>really</em> didn&#39;t want to go through the mental gymnastics required to discern a new Servant&#39;s identity, especially after failing so spectacularly with Archer.

&quot;So Houston, we&#39;ve been working together for a while. I&#39;ve been wondering something personal about you. <strong>What is your wi—</strong>&quot; Opportunity stopped, and Rider&#39;s most important question would be forgotten. Atop a mound of rubble was their enemy: Szrac. Yuri Gagarin. Whatever. The only label he needed was &quot;enemy&quot;.

Opportunity faded, just as Pascal had requested before. Armstrong elected to carry him in a fireman&#39;s carry. It was more effective than letting Pascal bleed out on the ground.

&quot;Grandeur? Here I was, thinking we would be kind neighbors and visit. Perhaps Berserker&#39;s massive ego has rubbed off on you.&quot; Armstrong&#39;s eyebrows raised. &quot;Well, it&#39;s always kind to meet a fan. I do <em>love</em> the ServantPedia. All this information, right at mankind&#39;s fingertips!&quot; Armstrong laughed.

&quot;Speaking of, where&#39;s Berserker hiding? A king should greet his subjects personally.&quot; Rider said, looking around. He stopped upon hearing Szrac&#39;s question for Pascal.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“Correct,” Midas called out, standing up from his somewhat hidden spot almost right behind Szrac. He looked worse for wear, much like Rider. Scorched, bloody. The faint smell of burning hair was still present, blackened, crispy hairs the only remains of his beautiful hair. Whoever had been here first really put him through the wringer, that was for certain.

“I see that you have gone through dangerous combat. Your master there looks to be dead in all but technicalities,” he motioned to the fact that Rider was now carrying the poor bastard like a hero would the damsel in distress. “Perhaps you made a wrong turn on the way home, wherever that destitute hole in the ground may be.”

The King slowly approached the pair, eyeing them up and down with those brilliant golden eyes. The master had proven to be a nuisance, but nothing more. Rider, this ‘Neil Armstrong’, was formidable but could not stand the assault of two beings highly capable in combat. Without knowing it, this ‘astronaut’ had driven themselves into their final resting place. If only he had prepared the coffins ahead of time.

“I would offer to have you executed and hung inside my vault, to be treasured for my eternal reign, but as you can see…” he let the sentence hang in the air, realizing his failings of clever wordplay only after it has been said. His blood started to boil mere at the thought, much like his-- nevermind!

Once only a hop, skip and jump away, he stopped cold in his tracks. Staring down that mysterious servant, not even glancing at the pathetic excuse for a man in his arms. He wanted to hear these simpletons’ wishes, so that he could rub it in once that Throne decided to call Rider back to their resting place.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal grunted as even the act of walking became a chore. He would gladly let Rider carry him all the way to Szrac&#39;s manor, were it not for the fact that it would be more tactically sound to split up. He had to endure this pain, as unseemly and excruciating as it felt.

&quot;Likewise. Did I really have to fight a tin can for last? I would very much prefer someone with an actual <em>face</em>, thank you very much.&quot; He immediately spat venom, being a far cry from the timid idiot from several weeks ago. The pain that he had endured, coupled with the insane events that he had witnessed recently, had made him numb to Szrac&#39;s threatening aura. Sinmara and Kari looked tougher than him.

Of course, Szrac&#39;s Servant was another question. The fact that Armstrong had fought Midas once, yet had failed to defeat him, already spoke volumes of Berserker&#39;s strength. Granted, both Midas and Szrac seemed to be injured. Someone had fought them just a while ago. They had lost, or so Pascal hoped. Things would get ugly real quick if there was still a third party at play, but he doubted it.

Szrac confirmed it by asking him a question, a sign that he had time to kill. The two pairs already knew that this would be their last battle, so there was no shame in replying.

&quot;...Frankly, I&#39;ve never done this for the Grail. Not only does a Holy Grail that grants wishes sound suspicious as fuck, but I was never a friend of the mafia or the aristocracy. Once I get my hands on it, you can bet that the entire city is going to go after me like a pack of rabid dogs.&quot; Pascal said with an audible groan. He wondered how he had gotten himself from the simple life of a wandering cook to fighting for a mythical object.</span>

Of all the responses that Pascal could have received, that was among the more unexpected. Pascal had delivered a curse beyond curses, a wish for Szrac to never have been born. Yet instead of anger or rage or disgust, his reply was like that of a maths teacher whose student had failed to show their working.

<strong>&quot;Exterminating me from this world would be blessing, but the rest would remain. You can slice the tumor out of a decaying wound, but that will not stop the necrosis. It is too late to do anything for this world.&quot;</strong>

The cyborg began to stride down from the mound of destruction, each step accompanied by the crunching of stone. As he descended from his vantage point, he continued to elaborate, eyes focused dead ahead on Pascal all the while.

<strong>&quot;I have witnessed a divine dragon birth untold miracles within their last words. Yet when I sifted through the ashes, I found nothing but disappointment. There is no joy to be found in this world. There is no hope left for those forced to linger in this realm. We are within a dead end where no progress can exist.&quot;</strong>

As Szrac reached the bottom of the manor&#39;s ruins, his arms stretched out, a grand gesture that scarcely fit the inhuman machine in front of them.

<strong>&quot;I am a weapon, a tool to destroy. With the aid of the Holy Grail, I will sever this reality. In doing so, a new world will be forged, one without the accursed waters, one where mankind may flourish, unaware of the existence of magecraft. One where neither I, nor you, nor anyone else will ever have existed. The damage I have caused will be undone, for it will never have occurred in the first place.

It was obvious that at least somebody would object to Szrac&#39;s wish. That was the nature of the Holy Grail War. Seven Servants and Masters rejected and stepped on the wishes of their foes in order to make their own wish come true. This was one of those moments.

Both his ally and his foe&#39;s wish surprised Rider. Pascal&#39;s wish was... completely unexpected, yet totally in line with Pascal&#39;s petty and altruistic tendencies. It was that same drive that led to them actually fighting Saber, instead of just running away. It was true that they couldn&#39;t leave the city, but Pascal had still elected to fight Saber. It was the same drive that lead them here to Szrac and his Servant.

Yet despite that, he was shocked by Szrac&#39;s proclamation to rebel against fate. All this time, Rider couldn&#39;t figure out what Szrac had desired. Did he want money? Unlikely. Midas could&#39;ve made him wealthy, though it did give a good reason on why Szrac followed Midas around. The desire to reset the world was something else entirely. It baffled him.

Did Szrac Vaughn have a heart? Unlikely. He was a demon encased in metal, and his heart had turned to iron long ago. Yet resetting the world...?

&quot;Look around you! The ground we stand on, the air we breathe, our very existence has survived the apocalypse. Humanity&#39;s growth has allowed them to outpace their own cosmological shelf life. They shall claim the future, and not you! They deserve happiness after losing their world, and they shall reach for it among the stars.&quot;

Rider said, removing his helmet. His eyes studied Szrac&#39;s metalic red ones, and shook his head. &quot;Resetting the world? Please. No one man should have the Grail, and no one man should hold the entire fate of the world his his shoulders. &quot;

With that, Rider&#39;s hands glowed as a massive American flag appeared in his hands. &quot;I&#39;ll crush your armor—that sarcophagus of destruction... and spread its ashes across <strong>the world!</strong>&quot;</span>

Rider proclaimed, pointing his flag defiantly at the king. It was time for Berserker and Rider to dance once again. This time, there would be a definitive winner. That winner would have the luxury of touching the Holy Grail.

&quot;And only then... will there be peace!&quot; Rider roared, running towards Berserker, intent on skewering him with his flag.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac’s desire was… concerning the King, to say the least. A new world? Restored to previous times? The part of him that missed his homeland, and furthermore his Castle, would be delighted in a return to the Old World if only for that. 

Yet every other logical neuron in that Berserker Brain of his screamed to simply kill his master right then and there. Time was a fickle creature, perhaps even more so than his whims. If perhaps things were changed from long ago…

His summoning would be gone. Opportunity to conquer, to win a Holy Grail War, all for naught. Sure, the possibility to be summoned in this new supposed timeline was for sure a possibility. Yet that made his head hurt and all further thinking on the matter was ceased. 

Certainly, his Master must never have his wish granted. 

How that would occur was a matter for later. For now, the final duel between Rider and Berserker. It had been the beginning of his time in this War, so it was only fitting for them to finish was had started so long ago. 

How he went about it was certainly disappointing, though. Seriously, a bum rush towards him with only weapon in hand? Surely the being before him remembered the very first time they tried that, right? It would end the same way.

Side-stepping the stab was easy enough, a combination of pushing the end of the flag away and leaning the opposite side. A hint of gold stained the tip, yet Midas did not bother trying to convert the makeshift spear. He wanted to use a weapon? Fine.

His fists would speak for themselves.

At the same speed as Rider, The King launched a relative flurry of blows towards the astronaut. None were nearly fatal enough to kill, for they only needed to beat the man into submission. His own Noble Phantasm would do the hard work for him...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The longer Szrac spoke, the more Pascal wondered if he had misjudged him or hit the nail on the head. A wish that could be seen as selfless and beneficial for the world, could similarly look selfish and sociopathic. It felt like Szrac was more machine than man, in more ways than one.

&quot;...Don&#39;t give me that bullshit.&quot; Pascal almost snarled in response at Szrac&#39;s wish. He would have, had he not been so flabbergasted by words that came from the tin can&#39;s mouth. This was far worse than the aristocracy pushing its authority on the commoners: Szrac intended to push down his authority to the entire world.

&quot;People live in this world! Longer than you have been! Do you ever think to consider whether other people agree with you or not?!&quot; Pascal protested. Szrac&#39;s mentality was poison. Poison that had been in the veins of aristocrats since the start. Even Pascal&#39;s own parents were proof of that: Selfish mages that had simply spawned children for the proliferation of their magical circuits.

People who saw other people as pawns simply disgusted him.

&quot;If you want to use tools, then go learn to cook or start welding something. Those are the only tools you should use. If you start seeing people as tools, then....<strong>what are you?</strong> Tell me!&quot; Pascal asked the big question, but wouldn&#39;t receive a reply. Midas had already moved first and intercepted his Servant. Rider and Berserker were currently duking it out, leaving Szrac and Pascal at a stand off.

&quot;I&#39;m not just a spatula for you to flip omelettes with.&quot; Pascal growled. &quot;If you really want to pull that card, you&#39;ll have to go through me.&quot;

He thought about the contents of his bag. A few mana batteries, that were now useless due to Rider taking time to process them. Some cooking oil. Some fuel. Ingredients...Yeah, he wasn&#39;t exactly prepared for a fight.

All he could do was pray and hope that Szrac had run out of gas from his earlier fight. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

The cyborg had expected such resistance. From the progress-focused NASA, to the petulant Pascal. He even felt the contemptuous eyes of King Midas upon him, as though Berserker was pondering executing him there and then. It was, by all accounts, a rational reaction.

But a man with metal flesh had no need of rationality. While the short term was a frightening and mysterious plunge, the long term held far more promise than this current wretched world.

<strong>&quot;What am I? An absurd question. I am the greatest tool of all.&quot;</strong> Szrac stated, with no hint of irony or comedy in his voice. <strong>&quot;My whole life, I have been a pawn of others. My true parents, who sent me away in some desperate attempt to earn favor with those greater than themselves. My false parents, who destroyed my mortal form against my wishes, in some vain attempt to garner a more powerful heir. Even the aristocracy viewed me as nothing more than a means to an end, a path to victory over the mafia.&quot;</strong>

Szrac&#39;s hand snatched outwards, grabbing Pascal by the scruff of his shirt and hoisting him upwards, dragging him face to faceplate.

<strong>&quot;This? This is my opportunity to solve the errors of mankind. This is my chance to shed the chains that have bound me for so long. I must go through you? A moronic notion.</strong> <em><strong>I would go through the entire world to bring about this wish.</strong></em> <strong>Compared to everyone else? You are leaves in a typhoon.&quot;</strong>

As if to punctuate this point, he swung Pascal downward, aiming to smash him against the pavement below.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was unwise of Rider to face Berserker in direct combat. However, there was little he could do. Riders relied on their Noble Phantasms to control the tide of battle, and Szrac countered Opportunity. Unfortunately, it left Rider with very little room for clever maneuvering. 

The only thing he had going for him was the terrain. The mounds of rubble took Midas far longer to climb then Rider. The spaceman could simply hop up them like it was a nonissue. He would need to use every ounce of cunning at his disposal to defeat Berserker, it seemed. Even after that, he would need to kill Szrac. Such a man could not be allowed to live.

It seemed to be a frankly impossible task.

Ignoring the long slog ahead of him, Rider met Berserker on a fairly flat bit of terrain. The rubble was stable, for now. That was good. This was an excellent place to test Berserker. Rider grinned from beneath his helmet. He had fought Berserker before, and knew how quickly the king fought. It would be simple to countera—

A fist slammed into Rider&#39;s chest before he could even bat an eye.

<em>He&#39;s fast!</em> Rider thought quickly, taking a few punches before quickly retreating. His suit was flecked with gold where Midas had struck him. If Berserker hit him too many times... This wasn&#39;t good. Berserker was faster. Almost too fast for Rider to react. 

Several more fists came Rider&#39;s way. <em>Speed confirmed. Using new speed value for Berserker&#39;s equations.</em> A punch was just an arm being swung through the air. That could be calculated. Once it was calculated, it was easy to determine where each fist would last before it had finished winding up.

Sidestepping, Rider waved the flag in front of Berserker, blind sighting the mad king. Acting fast, Armstrong/NASA leapt over Midas, using their low gravity to their advantage. Stabbing at Midas, the force of Rider&#39;s own blow sent him flying backwards, thanks to his lower gravity. As he did so, he pelted Berserker with blasts.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Already the coward was using their weird abilities to their advantage. Pathetic. He knew that the strength disparity between them was unparalleled to any other, but did he really have to attempt hand-to-hand combat only to run away when things started getting tough?!

Bright red and blue danced in his vision, confusing the Berserker enough to give Rider time to hop away. Well, away was a relative term. <em>Above</em> was a more apt term for the strategic positioning. More stabs followed, which Berserker was able to block most of them. One landed, piercing the flesh and sending ripples of pain across his arms. 

And now he was shooting?! This was too far! At least he was aware of his surroundings more, able to narrowly dodge the shots with enough time to spare and take a gander at the environment.

Rubble. Ruins. Destruction. Nothing useful. Perhaps a few rocks would suffice in bashing that thick-headed skull of theirs in. But that was time wasted, and time wasted was time spent not attacking. Caster had taught him an important lesson, that devious bastard: a good defense starts with a good offense.

Eyeing a sturdy piece of stone-slash-gold block ahead of him, he took a look at Rider’s new position. Flying away, but not flying higher. Sure, the force of his own blasts would potentially continue is path forever if aimed correctly (he had no idea how smart the servant was but he assumed it was ‘smart enough’) but that invited the opportunity to murder the master.

He increased his pace, taking bigger and stronger steps forward. One, Two…

An initial jump, followed by a great <strong>STOMP</strong> onto the material. It practically folded in half as the sheer force of his kick, dust scattering all across the point of impact as he too joined Rider in the air. Midas readied his fist, instead aiming one strong swing over atop his scorched ears. How well could Rider reposition in the air?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pascal didn&#39;t know what to say. He thought of Szrac as a madman, someone who would suppress the lives of others just for the sake of his own ego. Instead, it was the opposite.

Szrac knew very well how it felt to be used. He had been used his entire life. First, by his parents. Then, by his other parents. Eventually, the aristocracy too treated him like a mere machine.

Get called trash enough times and you&#39;ll start to believe that you are human waste. The same would apply to someone who had been called a robot in his entire life.

He too, was a victim.

But that didn&#39;t make his words true.

&quot;Just because you&#39;re correct, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re <em>right.</em>&quot; Pascal snarled through his lips, eventually bolstering his resolve. &quot;Solving mankind&#39;s errors? Whining about your parents? Sorry, but I didn&#39;t come here for a pity party!&quot;

He flailed his body around, albeit in a very inefficient manner. Szrac&#39;s grip remained firm, preventing Pascal from escaping.

&quot;Your parents might have treated you like garbage. You might be disposable to the aristocrats, but you&#39;re still you! <strong>You</strong> chose this life. Don&#39;t go blame others for your own path, now.&quot; Pascal said, a smile on his face as his fear of Szrac had now vanished completely with this last revelation.

He wasn&#39;t a madman. He was just an idiot like him.

<em><strong>ZAP!</strong></em>

Which is why he fell for Pascal&#39;s trick. The flailing from before wasn&#39;t a pathetic attempt to escape: It was a <em>dance.</em> A familiar cloud had manifested behind Szrac and zapped him violently. He remembered this sensation, it was the same lightning that struck him at the restaurant a few weeks ago. Cheap parlor tricks.

Of course, Pascal would still collide with the ground. Szrac smashed him real good, but he hoped the cloud would distract his opponent long enough. The cook attempted to quickly crawl out of Szrac&#39;s way. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span></span>

He would not make it very far. 

While a roach might have been able to avoid a stomp, the cook was not so lucky. His foot was pinned against the ground by a metal boot slamming down upon it, preventing him from making any further progress. While the thunder dance had worked wonders during their first bout, his body was now aligned with lingering lightning-aligned prana, once used to call forth the Spark of Ingenuity.

That meant that Pascal&#39;s storm, filtered through the insulation present within the Iron Sarcophagus, were reduced to a brief stun. What was once the skewer of a spear was reduced to the prick of a pin.

<strong>&quot;What a foolish notion. You think I chose to enter into this metal shell?&quot;</strong> Szrac looked down at Pascal as he spoke. <strong>&quot;No aristocrat would allow their heir to willingly cripple themselves during their prime. No sane man would enter into this prison.</strong>

The metallurgist called upon a few rails of fence, iron bars tearing themselves free and hovering over top of him. A primitive lightning rod, but one that functioned just fine. While he was unfazed by the previous shock, he was wary of the next one. He&#39;d witnessed enough obnoxious miracles throughout this war. Already, he was wary of the next to come.

<strong>&quot;People die when they are killed. Yet though my soul was killed, my body cannot die. You cannot comprehend how it feels to trapped in this chrysalis, forever stuck in a botched metamorphosis, the true peak of your potential sealed away until your inevitable expiry comes. I never had no choice in that matter. I only bear the consequences of it.&quot;</strong>

Pascal coughed blood as he felt Szrac&#39;s oppressive foot slam down his spine. It was like a piston, crushing garbage underneath it without thought or worry. The cook was pinned down and unable to move further.

&quot;...You sure you&#39;re sane?&quot; Pascal wisecracked in response to Szrac&#39;s speech, with the latter replying by diving the foot further down, cracking the cook&#39;s bones. &quot;ARGH!&quot;

He was pinned like a roach, and roaches went splat.

Yet the ability to stand up again after being crushed was not one shared by roaches. It was a trait of <em>man.</em>

&quot;...Listen, I don&#39;t know what turned you into a Robocop™️ and you probably have hate the aristocracy as much as I do. But that&#39;s why...<strong>why are you subjecting yourself to this?</strong>&quot; Pascal asked, his tone of voice making it sound like a legitimate question. &quot;You&#39;ve already been screwed over. You&#39;ve reached rock bottom. So why? <em>Why do you keep digging further down?</em> You&#39;ve got two arms and two legs. Climb back up!&quot;

He snarled, feeling nothing but rage towards a man who clearly had potential, but had severely misused it. He knew how it felt to see one&#39;s potential be completely snuffed out, and Szrac <em>wasn&#39;t that person.</em>

&quot;As long as you&#39;re alive, you can still make it up to everything that wronged you. Don&#39;t go ditching your life away for stupid shit like this! You&#39;re not a corpse, <strong>so stop acting like one.</strong>&quot;

Szrac felt compelled to silence the annoying nonce at that point, but his instincts suddenly went ballistic. Pascal was in a compromising position and utterly down his luck...yet why did Szrac feel threatened?</span>

He understood. He stared at Pascal&#39;s bag, which was lying on the man&#39;s shoulder. It was <em>open.</em>

He vividly remembered it being closed when he grabbed him by the neck. Even stranger was the fact that the cloud was still buzzing around him despite the threat of a lightning rod. Was Pascal simply stupid?

No. The target was something else.

A small bottle of gasoline lied down on the ground. It slowly rolled towards Szrac...

<strong>ZAP!</strong>

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

The explosion sent both of them flying... <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">If Rider and Berserker were matched well in one thing, it was determination. Both attempted to maim one another with obsessiveness and lust, knowing that the other Servant&#39;s defeat would place the Grail firmly in their hands.

This was no time to slack off.

&quot;Bold of you to join an airman in the air, Berserker!&quot; Rider laughed, brandishing his flag yet again. What was his strategy? To blind Berserker while giving him a second to get away? Was this all that Rider was capable of? Reusing old tactics and spouting nonsense? Not that it was difficult to blame the spaceman. He paled before the King of Greece in direct combat, and he lacked Noble Phantasms. The only thing Rider had now was a bag of tricks and repair equipment.

That&#39;s what made it impossible for Rider to dodge Midas&#39;s next strike. For all his boasting, he, like Berserker, couldn&#39;t move much in the air.

Yet, as Rider brandished his flag, he fired several weak, rapidfire bursts towards Berserker. The bright colors on the flag! Even as Berserker wound up a strike to send Rider smashing towards the earth, the flag hid Rider&#39;s shots until they were ready. Ultimately, though, that was irrelevant. Berserker would still smash Rider with his next attack.

Until Pascal and Szrac went flying into the air, that is. Here was NASA/Armstrong&#39;s chance!

Using some quick calculations to discern where Pascal would end up mid-fall, Rider flung some industrial tether towards his Master. The type used to keep astronauts from flying off during spacewalks, and the very same used against Saber. Berserker could see Rider give a wink from behind his visor as he was flung away by Pascal&#39;s momentum. Curse that spaceman!!!

However, Rider would need to act quickly before they hit the ground. He reached for Pascal...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">An epic strike, one to rival every blow he had thrown before… stolen from him. Robbed. Much like had done to countless before, what was rightfully his was suddenly not. Rider was lucky Pascal was vaguely smart and Szrac was currently not. A deadweight to bind a rope and swing away, much like a monkey through the trees.

Even worse, a few more pot shots came his way. He knew there was no avoiding anything he threw back in retaliation, but that was fine considering the strike going his way. A trade off.

Now, not so much.

Midas continued his arc, missing Rider by a decent enough margin. The force behind the swing swung him forward, performing a complete flip before falling back towards the ruined ground below. He landed with the grace of a dying seagull, barely managing to not flop over entirely. Red hot flashes painted his view, blinding him to any semblance of rational thought. 

Rider was going to die. Soon.

Rider was going off with his Master. Both were prey best killed quickly. There were plenty of rocks scattered around, from rubble and crushed materials. And more could be made easily. Berserker wasted no time in diving for said ‘weapons’, grabbing a couple in each hand. By the time they left towards the landing place of Rider and Pascal, they had turned into solid gold nuggets. 

Their accuracy wasn’t the best, and they weren’t exactly <strong>big</strong> or even impressive. Yet even a single one finding it’s mark would be disastrous if it collided with the cook. All the while, he was grabbing more rocks while closing the distance between them. Neil wanted ranged combat? He would get ranged combat.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">To describe Pascal as &quot;vaguely smart&quot; was a gross overestimation.

Szrac was thrown backwards by the explosion, though due to the weight of iron that surrounded him, it wasn&#39;t particularly far compared to the scrawny chef. Likewise, his exoskeleton prevented him from receiving anything more than soot and ash upon his form, unlike the fleshy body of the human.

It did not even halt him for long. Like a stalled engine, all it took was a few seconds for him to start up once more, dragging his prone form to his feet and beginning his ceaseless march once more.

<strong>&quot;Am I not doing something now? Is being moments away from attaining a miracle not a true enough action?&quot;</strong> The cyborg asked, as if incredulous at Pascal&#39;s own short-sighted idiocy. <strong>&quot;Do not try to lecture me, as you crawl among the mud and muck. If you were the Jamie heir, perhaps. If you were the runt of Caster, maybe. But I shall not tolerate lectures on leading my life from a deadbeat chef who has already reached his dead end.&quot;</strong>

The problem, of course, was that Rider had now attached himself to Pascal like a leech, though with the intent to protect instead of harm. However, that mattered little. Now, it was simply a matter of killing them both in one blow.

The aforementioned metal rods launched forth, turned from lightning rods into spears, aiming to pierce through both Pascal and Rider in one go.</span>

Lugging the chef like a sack of potatoes, Rider quickly hopped away. The more range between Team Cook and Team Get Money, the better.

Unfortunately, it looked like Berserker was making that difficult. Taking advantage of Rider&#39;s desire to protect Pascal, he had tossed a fastball of gold towards the spaceman. It was a clever trick. Rider was devoted to protecting his Master, and wasn&#39;t looking towards the stream of projectiles that Berserker had flung towards him. One hit his leg, and the spaceman fell to the ground, turning to protect Pascal from the worst of it.

<em>How can he throw so accurately?</em> Rider said as he fell down. The damage was negligible—gold was heavy, but it was also fairly soft. It barely scratched Rider&#39;s armor, but the force behind it was very real.

It also gave Szrac the perfect opportunity to fling his barrage of metal spears. However, now that Rider was looking towards the projectiles, he could calculate their trajectory with ease. Rider rolled to the side. Rider was, however, slowed by carrying Pascal around, leading to the former getting pierced in the hand as he moved.

Rider hissed as his hand was pierced asunder, pinning him in place and causing him to drop Pascal. Despite that, he would never fall to such a paltry attack. He pulled the spear out with his other hand, hissing slightly in pain. He tried to make a fist.

His hand responded, albeit much slower than he would&#39;ve wished. Not good.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The impact of the explosion was enough to knock a few marbles out of Pascal&#39;s head. He was dazed and his ears felt ruptured, to the point he could barely hear Szrac&#39;s reply to him. His eyes were more focused on Rider, who had arrived to save him just in the nick of time.

Of course, they weren&#39;t safe. Berserker was hot on Rider&#39;s trail and Szrac had already retorted Pascal&#39;s bomb with iron spears. They penetrated his Servant like a shish-kebab, forcing Rider to drop Pascal down as the cook slowly regained their bearings and got back up to their feet.

Rider was injured, while Szrac and Midas looked like they nary had a scratch on them from the previous scuffle. It looked like Pascal and Armstrong were still outmatched, despite the injuries Berserker&#39;s team had sustained during the fight against Caster. The weak should fear the strong...

Yet, it was because of their weakness that they had made it this far. Szrac had underestimated them in their first encounter. The same happened with Saber. It repeated itself with Archer. They were constantly looked down upon: Pascal for his upbringing and Armstrong for his modernity.

Was it all just a stroke of dumb luck? Or did they actually <em>earn</em> their victories?

Time to find out.

&quot;Rider, I hate to break it to you, but that bomb was the last thing I had. <em>I&#39;m out.</em>&quot; Pascal revealed, sifting through his bag as he no longer had anything left. Just some cooking ingredients and a pair of mana batteries. Kari had wasted more of his supplies than he had thought.

With utmost caution, he quickly handed over the batteries to Rider, hoping that Szrac and Midas wouldn&#39;t catch a glimpse of the exchange. 

&quot;You probably don&#39;t have time to eat this right now, but I bet you have better uses for it than me.&quot; Pascal said, hoping Armstrong could do something with the now useless batteries. Usually, Rider would eat them and recharge his mana, but the process took too much time to do so right now.</span>

&quot;And don&#39;t forget: <strong>You&#39;re after Berserker.</strong> Not me! I can handle the tin can man.&quot; Pascal muttered with a groan, as if he knew that he was spewing bullshit. There was no way in hell he would last even a minute against Szrac, but he still had to try. He was already one foot in the grave thanks to the scuffle against Archer. He couldn&#39;t afford the luxury of playing it safe.

&quot;...I know that it sounds stupid, but we thought the same against Saber too. When Berserker and Szrac are united, we don&#39;t stand a chance. You know what that means.&quot; The cook explained.

&quot;Besides, I have a plan. I&#39;ll just ask you to be sure, though: <strong>How did astronauts even eat in space?</strong> Did you stick a tube through your cloth or something?&quot; He poked at Armstrong&#39;s astronaut attire. Rider wasn&#39;t sure what he meant, until he remembered Pascal&#39;s opponent was Szrac.

A man in a metal suit. Not that different from a diving suit, also known as the prototype of the astronaut suit. A realization dawned on him.

No armor was completely impenetrable, especially not armor that was meant to be worn as <em>clothing.</em> Szrac practically lived in his suit, meaning that he needed a few openings for his daily activities: Eating, drinking, expelling waste...Small openings for his very human needs. If Pascal were able to grasp those openings... <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

Armstrong managed to pull the iron bars out of his flesh with ease, the rods clattering against the ground. However, they would soon begin to vibrate, gripped by some unseen force. It did not take a genius to figure out what perpetrated that phenomena, as soon, the metal began to shift and warp. Barbed wire carved itself out of the metal, and began lashing out wildly towards the pair, aiming to rend their flesh and slow their actions.

<strong>&quot;Berserker, execute them.&quot;</strong> Szrac stated simply, looking over towards Midas as his metal madness was occurring. <strong>&quot;The fool or the servant. Whichever one dies, we win nonetheless.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Things were approaching some sort of climax, Midas was sure of it. Szrac’s aim was true, piercing the flesh of Rider with ease. Granted, it was only a hand, but every little bit helps. If that meant something soon, then he was all for it.

And with a pit of sharp, prickly wire enclosing the pair, things were looking to finally be on their side. Movement was slowed if not outright disabled, and a Berserker with two gleaming rocks in hand wasn’t exactly a better alternative. Perhaps it was too cruel, dashing their hopes against the rocks in such a humiliating manner. Most of the damage sustained by the King wasn’t even from his current foes, further cementing the state of affairs.

If only he cared! Such vermin deserved nothing less, even making it this far a disgrace to all other contenders. Surely one of the other pairs deserved a more fitting end than these fools. Even that annoying damned Caster was more threatening than whatever this was. 

So, Midas thought it appropriate to rub it in. He approached the duo, currently discussing amongst themselves one thing or another. It wouldn’t matter soon enough. Hands rose to defend against any sudden counter attacks. Which one to shame…</span>

And threw out the left one first. Certainly not flashy. Not at all  but definitely not ‘fair’. 

“This is for last time, cur.”

And his assault continued once again, much more personal than before. A mix up of fists and even the occasional foot. He relied on the metal wire and the fact that Pascal was <em>very</em> close to help ensure that he didn’t run away this time. Any attempts to grab the cook would be met with fierce resistance. Any attempted blows were dodged to the best of his ability. Stamina wasn’t a concern, confident that he would burn out long after Rider perished from this world.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;You said you were out last time.&quot; Rider complained, flexing his wounded hand experimentally. He could still fight with it. The massive weight and momentum behind Szrac&#39;s metal lances had pierced his armor where Midas had failed. In reality, it was unlikely that Midas could pierce Armstrong&#39;s armor AND flesh beneath, without some serious firepower backing him up.

It wouldn&#39;t be a fight with Berserker if Szrac wasn&#39;t holding Rider back from his maximum potential. Typical.

Pascal had gotten that devilish gleam in his eye again, much to Rider&#39;s dismay and excitement. Pascal plans were half excellent, half suicidal. He would&#39;ve been an excellent NASA employee. Few things were as suicidal as taping a man to a rocket and shooting him into the sky.

The Servant frowned at Pascal&#39;s question. &quot;Well, we sucked the air, flavor, and everything good out of it, put it in packets, and ate it while floating around in our cabin. Sometimes Aldrin tried toss food into Collins&#39; mou—&quot;

Stupid Servant! He was useless when it came to planning these attacks. How could all of NASA be so smart yet so blind all at the same time? Eventually though, it clicked. Rider grinned beneath his visor.

&quot;I see. That&#39;s the difference between my suit and his. Mine is only meant to be worn in space. It can be indestructible because it&#39;s only worn for a short time. His, however...&quot; Rider trailed off as he accepted the mana batteries. He looked at them dubiously. They were useful, but slow. What could he do with these? That was irrelevant. He trusted Pascal&#39;s judgement.

&quot;Well then. I&#39;ll leave Gagarin to you, Houston.&quot; Rider said as a fire blazed in his chest. He marched to meet Berserker. 

The fight was disappointing.</span>

Berserker&#39;s fist met Rider&#39;s spacesuit. <strong>SMASH</strong>! It met again. It was like being hit by a brick over and over again. Berserker beat the spaceman back, again and again. He had learned how to counter Rider&#39;s ability to predict his attacks. The only way the spaceman could dodge now was by dodging far to the left, right or back. As such, nearly every strike hit.

Yet despite that, Berserker felt like he was hitting a brick wall. Each strike rang true, furthering the creep of the cursed Golden Touch across the spacesuit, yet all but the most solid punches seemed to have no visible effect on the spaceman. Rider responded with a massive lug wrench, which he swung overhead towards Midas.

<strong>DONK!!!</strong> Rider looked at the bent wrench dubiously.

Taking the hit gracefully gave the mad king ample time to wind up his swing. Berserker&#39;s most ferocious punch tore Rider out of his barbed wire cage and into a wall, which collapsed on top of him. 

Things weren&#39;t looking good for the mountless warrior.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Once Rider left to fend off Berserker, it was down to Pascal and Szrac to settle the fight. It was obvious at this point that Midas would completely overpower Armstrong in a matter of minutes. Seconds, even. Pascal was similarly staring at a dead end: There was no way for him to overpower Szrac. The difference in strength and experience was far greater...

Yet the chef had cooked more meals, while Szrac hadn&#39;t prepared his own in decades. So, who was the <em>real</em> winner here?

It would cost him <em>a lot.</em>

Selfishly letting Rider take the first wave of barbed wire, Pascal used Armstrong&#39;s sacrifice to predict the trajectory of the next sharp whips directed towards him. He avoided them with a skip and a jump, even though his legs crunched and croaked anytime he exerted movement besides walking. Fractures and internal bleeding would do that to you. If he had known this would happen, he would have let Archer and his annoying Master fight these monsters first!

&quot;...Question, are you on a low carb diet?&quot; Pascal asked, panting as he stood a few meters away from Szrac. &quot;I&#39;m just wondering, since I have no idea if you&#39;re actually ripped behind that heap of junk or not.&quot; He taunted, mocking Szrac&#39;s diet and appearance in one fell swoop. Did he perhaps have a death wish?

No. He was buying time. Buying time with meaningless banter as he tried to goad Szrac into a response. The longer the two talked, the more time Pascal had to inspect the man&#39;s armor. He had made several meals in his life, some even designed to be eaten by those with permanent scars or injuries. Or those who were too old to chew their food properly. He wasn&#39;t a stranger to food being fed through tubes.</span>

That&#39;s when he noticed it: A small opening between Szrac&#39;s chest area and shoulder that was wide enough for an IV tube to be inserted. It was most likely there where Szrac was administered his meals and fluids.

&quot;Can&#39;t say I envy you. All that power, yet you&#39;ll never feel the taste of fresh bread on your tongue.&quot; Pascal said, making his intention clear. He marched forward without fear: A direct charge towards Szrac&#39;s meal tube.

At the same time, the cloud he had left behind started approaching Szrac once more. The man would hear thunder rumbling behind him as he sensed the presence of Pascal&#39;s pesky cloud. This would be his last attack. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It felt good to wail on the Rider, especially since he seemed incapable of launching an appropriate counter-attack. Dodging was almost impossible, thanks to previously mentioned circumstances of barbed wire and being so close to Pascal, but it looked as if the cook was hell-bent on committing suicide via Szrac. 

Whatever made him ‘happy’, he supposed.

But that wrench? A surprise. Midas barely got to take a glance before it came crashing down on his head, clashing with his skull and crown to reverberate dully across the landscape. His head bent down minimally, knocking the senses back into him. Of course, those left almost immediately as fast as they had come back after looking at Rider. That wrench had paid the ultimate price for his boldness, now a crooked metal piece no longer properly suited for much at all.

Berserker paid the attack back in kind, swinging out recklessly. Trash would <em>not</em> get the better of him, not this time! His blow was the strongest yet, clearly striking the gold-flecked astronaut square in the chest. 

Neil flew, far back. Past the wire. Into a nice wall. Said wall did not take kindly to its assailant, deciding to collapse on him instead. Definitely not enough to kill, but hopefully enough to keep him there for a few seconds.</span>

A place of the divine, only for gods. To breach such a sacred place…”

He had finally reached the scattered remains of rubble, shifting Servant in the mass of stone. “Is admirable.”

Midas stepped on top of the stone, moments away from contact with the astronaut.

“That is where my praise ends. Be grateful you have gained that much, insufferable insect.”

Knees dug into pointy stone, sending aches all the way down his nerves. A small price to pay for this moment. It was time to end this miserable game.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Rider took the brunt of his barbed assault, leaving Midas free to assault the astronaut with little concern for any sort of counter-attack or retaliation. However, that meant that the ever-irritating chef managed to slip through, just barely scraping past the whips of jagged metal as they grazed the bottom of his shoes and sliced the ends of his hair.

And then... a charge. Pascal rushed towards Szrac. Was he simply suicidal? Did he simply accept death? No. This was a scheme. A scheme that he had already seen through.

 <strong>&quot;Inane question after inane question. Is is truly so impossible for you to dredge up the slightest wisdom from your lacking mind?&quot;</strong> The cyborg spoke with utmost disdain, looking away from the master and over to the servant. He flexed the servos in his arms and the atrophied muscles underneath, before the exoskeleton began to shift once more.

<strong>&quot;You have not fooled me. I saw your little plot with the mana batteries. You think a Noble Phantasm will stop my march to progress? As I will cull this timeline, I shall cull your attempt to stop me!&quot;</strong>

Wires from the power source of the suit slithered outwards, dragging themselves towards the primary arm of the suit once more. The air around the two magi took up an electric quality, as though they were standing next to the most powerful reactor of the Power Plant, overclocked several times over.

Something was coming. An ace in the hole. If Pascal was to turn things around, he would have to do it now.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Rider, no, Neil Armstrong shifted beneath the rubble in a haze of pain, he was reminded that he was not, in fact, invincible. Berserker had been one of the only Servants in this war that had been capable of seriously damaging Rider, and that invincibility and bred overconfidence. 

That had been the one thing that had consistently doomed RIder throughout this false Holy Grail War: overconfidence. It had doomed him against Berserker. It had doomed him against Saber. It had doomed him against Archer, as well.

And it looked like Berserker was going to be the one to finish the job, finally. Berserker, of all people! How ironic that the arrogant king would be the one to end Rider for his own arrogance and ego.

Rider rose from the depths of the earth, rubble falling off his shoulders as he stood face to face with the king. 

&quot;The moon... is nothing more than a stepping stone... It&#39;s nothing more than a symbol. That&#39;s all it&#39;s ever been. Someone was bound to step on it eventually. It just happened to be me.&quot;

What made Neil Armstrong special? He had been picked out of a cast of other cosmonauts to be the one to touch the moon. It was a great honor, sure, but it was likely that any other astronaut would&#39;ve been capable of doing so. They were all trained equally, anyway. That&#39;s when it clicked:

Nothing made Neil Armstrong special. So why was he fighting?

<strong>SMASH!</strong>Midas slammed his fist into Rider&#39;s head, causing the world to spin. The astronaut held firm. Rider attempted a swing. Blocked.

What was it...?

<strong>Thud.</strong> Another punch left Rider completely dazed. He staggered. That was odd. How had he felt when he touched the moon on that day? What was the look on Aldrin&#39;s face?

<strong>Thud.</strong> How had he forgotten? What was his mission again? Something about progress. Rider had forgotten his dream from that one promised day.</span>

&quot;Probably gonna make out with my wife and eat some real food, and not this vacuum sealed crap.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, they really don&#39;t pay us enough to stomach this garbage. You&#39;d think they&#39;d spend more money on keeping their astronauts happy when compared to seeing how many nukes they could put up in space,&quot; laughed [  ] as he waved a spoon around, letting little particles of food float around.

Nukes...?

&quot;Yeah, you can say that again.&quot; Agreed [  ]. &quot;This race with the Soviets is finally over, though. We left those frozen sacks of shit eating dust!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but what happens to us?&quot; [  ] replied. Silence. Now that humanity had proved that they could touch the moon, what happened now? The United States would certainly try to weaponize it, but funding for general exploration was done and dusted. How upsetting. Armstrong looked out the window as the green and blue globe came closer and closer, slowly but surely.

&quot;Neil, what&#39;s up with you?&quot; One of the nameless spacemen asked. Who was it? Armstrong couldn&#39;t recall. Why was he drawing a blank? One of them was... Aldrin, right? Aden? 

&quot;What was the point?&quot; Neil asked as he turned back towards his comrades, they both looked at each other, then back towards him.

&quot;To beat the Soviets.&quot; One said.

&quot;For glory and remembrance.&quot; Said the other.

No, no. This was wrong. This wasn&#39;t how that conversation had went. Neil and [  ] and [  ] had talked about something different! It had been... Something. Rider sniffed, and then cried. The commander of the expedition had cried as soon as they had reached space for the first time, but he had made sure to hide it. This time, though, there was no need to hide it from these nameless men.</span>

I don&#39;t remember the group of people that I touched the moon with, but I can remember all of these <em>fucking</em> equations! These deals behind closed doors, and these internal struggles for power. What is it? It&#39;s not progress. It can&#39;t be. It isn&#39;t!&quot;

[  ] scratched his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Neil.&quot;

&quot;<strong>It&#39;s time to stop this push and pull between NASA and Neil Armstrong.</strong> Why do YOU want to progress? If you wanted to win the Grail for the sake of progress, you would&#39;ve allied with Archer&#39;s Master.&quot;

Why did he want to progress? Neil started, &quot;I don-&quot; Wait, no. That wasn&#39;t right. There was a reason. He DID want to progress for some inexplicable reason. He looked out the window yet again. There had been very few constants that the Servant Rider and the man Neil Armstrong had in common. He looked back at the moon that they had left behind.

&quot;I want to go back.&quot; He finally said. Aldrin nodded, while Collins gave a round of applause.

Aldrin cleared his throat casually as he floated about in zero gravity. &quot;Listen, we&#39;re going to ask something completely terrible of you. Can you abandon the wishes of thousands of people who worked together to put you on the moon for your own selfish reason? Combine your own ego-driven wish with the brains of an entire civilization. Remember, you are the Servant, not NASA.&quot;

Collins inclined his head. &quot;And with that, Commander, good mission, and good day.&quot;

The inside of the lunar shuttle collapsed into darkness.
-----

Midas took Rider by the neck, and hoisted him up from the ground. As weak as this &quot;Neil Armstrong&quot; person was, he had survived a massive barrage of punches. However, this was the end. Dionysus&#39;s curse creeped across the armor like frost, and soon, it would reach Armstrong.

And then it would be over. He would hold the Grail.</span>

The future, for instance. He had to return to the moon, and he had to bring mankind with him. It was just a rock, sure, but he had to mankind. Why? To show that he, and by extension, mankind itself, <strong>could</strong>.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDVtMYqUAyw</a>

Yet even he had to admit something: defeating Midas alone was impossible. However, if Neil Armstrong was good at one thing, it was defying the expectations of others. He couldn&#39;t survive the moon? Watch him. Defeat a fire giant? Average day. He&#39;d do that too. Defeat a mad king? Trivial.

He would need to use the one thing that he had brought with him all this way: the moon. 

Unfortunately, Rider didn&#39;t have much energy left in the tank. Most had been spent fighting Archer, and Rider was absolutely certain that he didn&#39;t have enough energy left to make another moon and live to tell the tale. That didn&#39;t matter, though, he had to try.

Rider flickered with the light of a dying star.

<strong>I will use my everything.</strong>

The memories of NASA, hell bent on beating their foes in Moscow to the stars. Deals with Nazi scientists, underground dealings, sabotage, and blackmail. NASA&#39;s legacy would be turned to ash in a blaze of glory.

Childhood memories of home. A first kiss. Scattered birthdays and friendship. Many would be incinerated to fuel a rune placed on Rider&#39;s chest by one of his earliest opponents. All of these memories flowed into the rune, burning like the fuel of a star in order to start a process of unlimited light.

Sinmara had wanted him to destroy civillization in his stead, right? Fine. He&#39;d burn himself to ash for her power.</span>

His eyes narrowed at the mention of mana batteries. Did they just lose the element of surprise?

The sudden loss of weight around him made him think otherwise. The ground&#39;s surface had morphed to the holey soil that he had become far too familiar with: They were on the Moon. He could feel his breathing falter.

<em>Oh shit, he actually did it.</em>

Pascal didn&#39;t know if he was blessed or just plain lucky. A Servant as unassuming as Rider had somehow carried him far better than any prodigal knight or terrifying sorcerer. Someone from an era of spacecraft and astronomy, things that were often mocked by mages and aristocrats alike. 

Maybe he and him weren&#39;t so different after all.

It was now or never. Szrac was ready to attack, but even the most trained veteran would flinch a bit at the activation of Armstrong&#39;s Noble Phantasm. This was the perfect chance for Pascal to get closer as his cloud fired away.

<strong>ZAP!</strong>

The cloud&#39;s lightning struck Szrac in the back, being no more harmful than a mosquito bite. However, this too was just bait. A distraction on top of a distraction. Pascal got close. Close enough to make contact with the tin can&#39;s feeding tubes. He haphazardly tossed his bag around and dragged a bottle of cooking oil from it...

He poured it inside Szrac&#39;s tubes. Half a liter or so of oil was now headed directly for his skin. It made contact with the armor&#39;s inner circuits, burning at the heat and sparks surrounding it. Szrac felt like he was being cooked alive.

More zaps from the cloud followed suit, releasing more electric current to accelerate the frying. He was like a roast pig encased in an oven.

But would this be enough?</span>

Armstrong began to exude ungodly amounts of mana, and sure enough, his Noble Phantasm followed. The ground beneath him switched into a white, barren floor of uneven stone, the sky above transformed into a yawning void, speckled with stars. It was a breath-taking thing to witness, quite literally, as he found all oxygen stolen away and replaced with nothing. Beyond even that, he found the electricity he sought to summon faltering, the mystery behind it choked...

...But not snuffed. Ever since Nikola Tesla had stolen lightning from the gods, it had belonged to mankind, to men of science, engineers and mechanics. Perhaps it was the necessity of electricity in the space race, or perhaps it was simply the modernity of the magecraft, but the Spark of Ingenuity could survive in the wasteland of science.

Armstrong couldn&#39;t stop him. But perhaps someone else could.

The storm cloud lashed out at the cyborg and impacted against his exoskeleton, doing little to phase him. However, that was little more than a smokescreen. Pascal rushed him soon after, and with a swift motion, managed to pour his cooking oil into the feeding tube.

Heat scorched through the metal innards, burning his flesh. The pain was great, not great enough to halt him entirely, but great enough to divert his attention. But he would see this through, even if the heat killed him.

But now, through a combination of Apollo 11 and Pascal&#39;s plot, they had something they didn&#39;t previously - time.

Not that he would do such a thing for fun, but this was a special occasion. After all, this was the <em>only</em> obstacle standing in his way. His kingdom would be born anew, and a castle would signal everyone else that the time of Royalty had returned. 

Thankfully, the cockroach would not waste his time. Veins of yellow sprouted, grew like roots in the soil. His perfect statue, a flower that would lead way to a beautiful forest of gleaming gold. An empire to end all empires. Conquest, Imperialism, the powers of a God. All would converge into the perfect King, and once again would man know the iron fist of a ruler.

Until that blasted rune started to sprout. How had the pathetic man gotten hold of something among the ranks of a mana tank?! Energy flowed, burned from the sigil etched into Neil, rivaling Caster’s supernova, attempting to surpass his own shimmering glory! Did he think this would kill such a powerful Servant?

Of course it wouldn’t. 

That wasn’t the goal.

Instead, reality shifted. Crumbled. Droplets of crimson painted his face as one last ‘gotcha’ to Midas, which fueled his own burning rage. His fingers got closer together--</span>

Beautiful, wondrous gold mixed in with the muddy browns and blacks surrounding them was washed away by a sea of <em>white</em>. The sky itself counteracted this new palette by turning to the darkest blacks imaginable, being darker in hue than all the scorch marks adorning Berserker’s body could even attempt to be. 

His grip weakened as Strength was stripped from his Spirit Origin. He let go, falling to a knee as even his Endurance was smashed to bits and pieces before his eyes. All those wounds that were capable of being somewhat ignored before now flared up. It was hard to even breathe without flaring up his entire body in hot spots of agony. 

Not that he could breath. Air had been stripped from his lungs, instead the biting cold of nothingness taking its place. Hands went to his own throat in a feeble attempt to massage something remotely breathable into his windpipe. 

There was no mistaking it: this was the Moon the astronaut had defiled by taking that revolutionary first step towards a distant future. He had spit in the face of the gods that had once called this place their own. He had spit in Midas’ own face mere moments ago, a man with godly powers that meant nothing in this barren landscape. 

In Between all the curses and fears currently racing through his head, one stood out amongst them all. A single, inescapable reality that there was no avoiding at this point. From <em>him</em>.

<em>Perhaps… not even a sane King has a place in this world.</em>

Rider mused as he looked around his Reality Marble for the final time. Parts of his armor collapsed and faded to dust under the guzzling of mana that the moon required to exist in this world. Saber&#39;s rune was providing ample energy, but Rider&#39;s body could only take so much of this before he collapsed into dust.

Luckily, if Rider was known for one thing, it was his endurance.

Running up to Berserker, Rider slammed him in the face with a solid punch, confident in the fact that the Golden Touch would have no effect here. No sound traveled in space, but the crunch of suit against bone traveled through vibration into the brains of both king and cosmonaut.

&quot;There are no gods here, King of the Greeks. There is...&quot; <strong>SLAM!</strong> &quot;...NO future for them here! When humanity finally leaves the old world behind, when they see the same sights that I saw...&quot; <strong>SLAM!</strong> &quot;...will they finally feel the need to improve themselves. The time for kings...&quot;

Rider held out a mana battery. A device capable of powering a Servant for hours. What would happen if it were all released at once? It was time to finally find out. Rider crushed the battery in his gloved hand, feeling the weight of a black hole tear his arm asunder as the magical energy threatened to burst outward.

&quot;...is over.&quot;

Rider slammed his fist into Berserker, tearing him apart with a strike that could split stars and shatter worlds. 

Berserker had tried to kill Rider, and Rider had killed Berserker. The simple American spaceman had done what gods had failed to do.

That was all.

They seemed perfectly capable of movement, down to decking him in the face. It hurt, every single neuron in his face sending signals to the brain right behind. Now his face was as bloody as his body was burnt. 

Where did he go wrong? What lead him to this situation? Was it the very first encounter, where he failed to put an end to their lives from the start? Or was it the brutal beatdown he decided to give his opponent right before, instead of rightfully killing him? 

Perhaps there was no wrong in his part at all. Or existence itself was the greatest mistake he had brought to fruit. That’s what Neil thought, at least. Energy tearing them apart at the seams. How could he have known about that blasted rune by someone other than themselves?

At the end of the day, it was the Throne itself that had decided the outcome of this whole thing. A perfect blend of coincidence, magic, luck, and perhaps sheer will had doomed his conquest before the first minute. That beloved kingdom, sunken to the depths of the ocean by man itself, would never become true. 

The Great King did not even attempt to block that blow to tear apart the cosmos. What point was there? It was going to kill him all the same. Not like he could even find the strength to lift his arms at this point. He was a goner after the second punch. The Mad King would’ve kept going, but they were all but screaming silently in the back of his head, control split between the two.</span>

If anyone would bring salvation to this cursed boat, it would be from the humans that called it ‘home’.

What would be his final moments? Words? Actions? Those too were decided from the start. 

The edges of his lips flexed upward, the only remaining energy spent on such a simple action. 

“<em>Thank...</em>”

The King returned to the Throne, no better than all else that inhabited it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Despite Pascal&#39;s best efforts, Szrac had transcended humanity. This meager amount of pain would not stop him. He endured the flames of the cooking oil like a champ, causing the cook to falter and even shiver in the face of the tin can&#39;s resilience. Fear was once again gripping Pascal&#39;s heart: He had long forgotten why he had been scared of Szrac in the first place. Was it because of his terrifying armor? His cold blooded attitude? His mastery of technology and magecraft? The fact that he could keep even Rider occupied?

No, it was his <em>tenacity.</em> He was like a freight train that had no brakes. Pascal was just a bull in comparison, a bull fighting against a train.

But at least he had distracted him. Distracted him long enough for Rider to deal the finishing blow. Suddenly, Pascal felt as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. The gravity returned to normal. He could breathe again.

An explosion dulled his senses. His eyes went blind as he stumbled on the ground, tried to get up, and stumbled again. By the time he could see, the event had already finished. All that was left was the aftermath: A gigantic crater.

Rider and Berserker were no longer there. All that was left was Szrac, still in pain and smelling of burnt pork.

There was no Berserker to protect him now. Likewise, there was no Rider to bail Pascal out of trouble. His next move would be his last.

Running away meant <em>defeat</em>.

Pascal shuddered, shivered, <em><strong>sweated.</strong></em> His brain was on the verge of collapsing from stress and pressure. Yet he knew very well what had to be done. It had no chance of working, but he grabbed the nearest chunk of debris nearby and charged at Szrac.

&quot;GRAAAAAAAAAAAH!&quot; He released a beastly growl as he attempted to smash a rock on Szrac&#39;s head. It was all he could muster at the moment. <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Magnetic#0081">@Magneto</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

All it would take was a moment for the thunder to land, a single second to stun Armstrong, and give Midas the opportunity to deal a finishing blow.

That future would never arrive. Before the Spark of Ingenuity could reach its mark, the battle had already concluded.

Berserker was gone. Rider was gone. The Reality Marble that had surrounded them was beginning to fade, all things returning to where they once were. Back on Earth, in Persepolis, the smoldering wreckage of the Midas Manor behind them. Slowly but surely, the storm of mana that surged through Szrac&#39;s arm faded away, an ending signified not by a glorious bang, but with a pathetic whimper.

There was nothing left. Nothing except Szrac and Pascal.

<em><strong>CRACK.</strong></em>

The cook&#39;s attempt at an attack was completely futile. The debris shattered into a dozen pieces upon making contact with the metal exterior, disparate pieces crumbling and bouncing against iron plates, before being swept away by the wind. It did absolutely nothing to harm his foe, but it did everything to draw their attention. 

Responding to the attempted assault, Szrac turned around, gaze focused directly onto Pascal. However, it possessed none of the usual malice, completely devoid of the burning hatred, the absolute disgust, or... anything, really. It was hollow, just like the man who it belonged to.

<strong>&quot;Pascal Poirot. You did not answer my question. What is your wish upon the Holy Grail?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His weapon had turned to crumbs in mere seconds. Pascal was far outmatched and was lacking any real way to damage his opponent. Even his cloud had been rendered harmless, not to mention his mana reserves had almost run dry. He could barely even remain conscious as the injuries that Kari had healed were slowly starting to reopen.

Szrac was no better, sounding soulless and robotic. They were like two dead men walking.

&quot;...My wish?&quot; Pascal repeated. He was barely able to compute Szrac&#39;s words. His head throbbed from stress, nausea and pain. He felt like vomiting blood after what he had been put through. What little brainpower he had attempted to process that request.

Was his wish truly to remove people like Szrac from the world? No. Even if the Grail could do that, Pascal wouldn&#39;t believe it. He firmly believed that scumbags like Szrac would exist in every part of the globe, no matter how hard people tried to cull them.

Was his wish to leave Persepolis and return to the life of a vagabond? No. It had been his status quo for years. He knew all too well that such a life led to a vast emptiness.

What was his wish then?

To bring <em><strong>him</strong></em> back?

His brother. The person who had their life robbed because of his own pettiness, his jealousy, his <em>hatred.</em> Surely, it was time for Pascal to make amends: There was no wish nobler than to undo a sin one had caused. It was the best way for him to redeem himself after a lifetime of vagabondry and emptiness.

Then why did he pause? Despite his best efforts, he could not utter the words. He knew that his wish was noble, but it didn&#39;t feel right.

It wasn&#39;t the wish <strong>Pascal</strong> wanted. It was what his conscience wanted.

If he had no debts, no disappointments, no sins and no worries...what would he wish for?

....

&quot;I...&quot; Pascal lowly mumbled. 

&quot;<strong>I wish to know what my wish is.</strong>&quot; He said with an air of shame, as if he knew how wasteful his wish sounded. The wish of a man who had been empty, until now.</span>

Szrac turned away from Pascal, pacing over to the smoking crater that had been cleaved into the earth. It was during this walk that the chef would notice the blood cascading out from the Iron Sarcophagus. Though he showed no signs of pain in the slightest, the sheer amount of sanguine that flowed out from his body was a clear sign of what happened underneath the metallic facade. 

A freight train was unstoppable, unmatched, a force of nature. If it stayed on the tracks, that was to its advantage. However, if it were to derail, the ceaseless momentum it generated became a detriment, an accomplice of complete self-destruction.

When the cyborg finally reached the precipice of the crater, he did not say anything. He simply looked downward, as if paying his respects to the servants who had given their lives in pursuit of victory. He did, however, find the time to spare a few words for the other survivor.

<strong>&quot;You cannot wish for such a thing. The Holy Grail is simply a tool. Tools cannot understand humanity, and thus, cannot comprehend their desires. It is simply impossible.&quot;</strong></span>

Instead, the smell of pork was replaced by the pungent aroma of blood. Szrac bled red more than the freshest tomatoes or pomegranates. He was walking on death&#39;s door.

Instead of using the last of his strength to murder Pascal out of spite, Szrac simply walked past him, gazing at the crater next to him with a silent type of acknowledgment. As bare as it was, it was still a form of respect.

&quot;...Don&#39;t go saying stupid things like that! If the Grail is real, then it should be able to do <em>anything!</em> How are you going to give me that crap without even seeing it, huh?!&quot; Pascal clenched his fists and stomped on the ground. He wasn&#39;t angry at being denied his wish. He could always think of something else if push came to shove. He was infuriated by Szrac&#39;s demeanor, because his opponent had accepted their fate. Yet the victory felt hollow.

He was the last Master left standing.

&quot;...Don&#39;t you at least want to see it?&quot; He asked his foe solemnly, before returning to his tantrum. &quot;Don&#39;t be a melodramatic asshole just for the sake of it!

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The entire mansion lane had gone through hell and back in barely under a day. Gold and debris littered the ground, fanning out from the giant crater that marked the deaths of the last two Servants. Rider was gone, so was Berserker. Eviscerated by Armstrong&#39;s explosive killing blow, they had gone back to the Throne, leaving their Masters to fend for themselves. 

Though it wasn&#39;t as if they could do much by themselves. Pascal had barely recovered from his wounds and Szrac was leaking blood like a sieve. Both of them were like candles in the wind, counting down the seconds until their inevitable demise. 

What kind of wish drove humans to such desperation? Pascal did not enter the Holy Grail War with a wish, but now that Szrac was dying, the appeal of the Grail became apparent. If not for him, if not for his brother, then what of the mangled piece of Tin Can that had so vehemently sought after his life? What of Persepolis, which had been damaged beyond repair from the War? If the Grail really was a wish granter, then an immediate wish still counted as wish, right?

So where was the Grail? 

Was someone from the Mafia coming to hand it over? Did they even know who Pascal was? 

Pascal would realize in a panic that he had never even left the faction he represented with his phone number. What if it took them days to find him? Though Rider and Berserker had caused plenty disturbance, surely people would know where to check-

&#39;Oh! Good. I made it in time.&#39;

A wash of gold entered Pascal&#39;s vision. Was Berserker still alive?!

But then he realized that what he saw was not real gold, but golden hair belonging to an actual human bean. A young man who looked no older than him hurried over in confident strides, clad in all black and fixed with an overabundance of belts and buckles. His cloak fluttered in the wind, as did his beautiful hair; the contrast of gold on black was simply divine. And if that wasn&#39;t enough to seal the deal, then the dozen or so cross-shaped motifs on his clothes and accessories sure would. 

As the man approached, Pascal would realize that he had a large cross tattooed across his chest as well, perfectly framed by the diamond-shaped <img class="emoji " alt="🍈" title="🍈" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f348.png"> window in his form-fitting shirt.

...What exactly was he looking at?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;I could hear the commotion all the way down at the deserted labs. It&#39;s truly a miracle that I made it in time.&#39; 

Orecchiette was relieved. Engrossed in his search for the Grail, he had almost forgotten about the Holy Grail War. Thankfully, Caster&#39;s large-scale Noble Phantasm clued him in on what was going on. Once he had made it to the aristocrat&#39;s territory, it was only a matter of keen observation and deduction to figure out how far the War had progressed. 

Orecchiette looked Pascal up and down, then placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

&#39;Congratulations, winner of Persepolis&#39; Holy Grail War. You have proven your tenacity in the face of adversity. For that, you have my utmost respect.&#39; He delivered a benign smile that was 100% unadulterated indulgence, treating Pascal like a kid that deserved to be pampered. He was taking a leaf out of Parppadelle&#39;s book! What a fast learner he was.

He then turned his eyes onto the stoic frame of the Iron Sarcophagus.

Szrac&#39;s armor, without contest, was the most flamboyant, and least human-like thing in a 3-mile radius. Orecchiette took the dying magus&#39; silence as obedience, and naturally assumed him to be Pascal&#39;s contractor instead of another contender.

&#39;Servant, I commend you for protecting your Master till the end. Your unwavering loyalty has brought victory for your Master. For that, you have my deepest sympathy.&#39;

The air was suddenly rife with mana. 

A single rapier manifested itself in Orecchiette&#39;s hand, catching the warm rays of the sun as its wielder poised himself, then thrust it through the Iron Sarcophagus like hot knife through butter.

&#39;Apologies for such a crude send-off.&#39; Orecchiette felt more disappointment than remorse. He had been looking forward to locking horns with a Servant before playing their executioner, but he had no one to blame but his own tardiness.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And then, after the dust had settled and the victor had been declared, came... someone. Who was this newcomer, whom Szrac had never seen before? The arbiter of the Grail War, perhaps? The one who found the Holy Grail? They certainly had the seem of an eccentric, the kind of man who would plan such an unnecessarily grandiose affair. 

Ah, but he had no place to complain, did he? A broken tool did not get to ask for repair, nor could it criticize poor work that it had been involved in.

So, he stood silently and watched as Orecchiette spoke to Pascal, acting as the spectator, just as was requested of him. He was no longer a sword for killing, but an eyeglass, someone to watch that which occurred with clear eyes. It was an unusual transformation, but not an unpleasant one. Not trapped within the past, nor focused upon the future. It was nice to live in the present.

It was a nice way to spend ones last moments.

The rapier pierced through the Iron Sarcophagus without issue, and tore into the flesh underneath. Szrac did not even react to this execution. It was as though he had expected it.

<strong>&quot;Hmph, very well. I suppose this is an acceptable ending for Szrac Vaughn.&quot;</strong> He stated plainly, before turning to face Pascal one last time. <strong>&quot;Do not burden yourself with remembering me, Poirot. It would be better for the both of us to let me fade away.&quot;</strong>

With that, the cyborg finally collapsed, falling backwards onto the concrete beneath him. After a moment, the quiet cacophony of noises that the Iron Sarcophagus emitted, the dull hum of the generator, the whir of servos, the beeps and boops of the HUD, all went silent. Everything went limp all at once.

Pascal could no longer feel a gaze, malevolent or hollow or anything else, upon him.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While Pascal felt glad that Szrac had not completely given up, he also remembered that he had no idea where the Grail was stored. It was apparently owned by the Mafia and pit as a prize between the feud of mafiosi and aristocrats. But in that case, whatever happened to him? He was neither a member of the mafia, nor a member of the aristocracy? Was he even eligible for the prize? He boiled at the thought of having the prize be stolen by those who started this mess in the first place.

Thankfully, that would not happen. Instead, he was greeted by a golden figure that reminded him of the terrible king. However, this figure was far more angelic, radiating a holy aura that felt almost blinding. He squinted his eyes, trying his best to understand the complicated layers of the man&#39;s outfit as they introduced themselves.

The man called them a winner, praising their efforts and discussing the Grail. Were they an overseer hired by the aristocracy? Was he actually eligible?

Those thoughts went out of the window once the man cruelly stabbed the weakened Szrac. It was a swift death, but not at all merciful. The sensation of being stabbed, coupled with intense blood loss, would be enough to make grown men cry. The fact that Szrac endured it enough to puff out more hot air was telling about the man&#39;s mental resolve.

Yet he still croaked in the end. He lied down, motionless and inanimate. Another victim of the Grail War.

Pascal was flabbergasted. He stared at the dead Szrac, before glaring back at the so-called overseer.

&quot;What the <strong>fuck</strong> is your problem?!&quot; He snarled, grabbing Orecchiette by the ridiculous collar that formed his outfit. &quot;That man was a Master! They lost their Servant, so they had already lost the Grail War. Yet you still killed them?!&quot;

Pascal wasn&#39;t one to mourn his enemies, but he somewhat empathized with Szrac&#39;s condition. To see his opponent be slaughtered like cattle left a bad taste in his mouth.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac Vaughn. What an eccentric name. Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t help at all. Orecchiette racked his brains, but couldn&#39;t recall anything from memory. A brand new Servant that had only seen his first summon in this Holy Grail War, maybe? 

Orecchiette made sure to note the name down so he could include it in his report later. He then stepped aside and let the Iron Sarcophagus fall, waiting patiently for it to transform back into the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. skeleton. Once all 7 Servants had gone back to the throne, the Grail would be filled, and his mission complete. 

A second passed....

Three seconds passed...

Pascal suddenly lunged for him and grabbed him by the collar in a fit of rage. 

Orecchiette was utterly befuddled. He blinked, then lowered his head to look at the man who was trying his damnedest to lift someone a full head taller. Via their oversized collar no less. Should he play along? Pascal wasn&#39;t doing so hot, but since he was the victor of the Holy Grail War, Orecchiette didn&#39;t want to rain on his parade. He compromised by tip-toeing, so that he could give Pascal the satisfaction that he had managed to lift <em>something</em>, at the very least.

What an elegant solution. But Pascal posed two problems, and the second one was a lot hairier than the first.

<em>A Master?</em>

Orecchiette turned to look at the Szrac&#39;s corpse. A solid minute had passed, but the Iron Sarcophagus had yet to fade. Blood kept pooling around the armor, almost as if it had been inhabited by an actual, living being.

Lightning struck. Realization dawned on his face.

The man in the machine was not a Servant.

&#39;No wonder he didn&#39;t put up a fight. His wounds must&#39;ve been too grievous to heal as a mere human.&#39; Orecchiette theorized out loud. &#39;Rest assured, victor of the Holy Grail War. I have liberated his soul from the pain of mortal flesh. He will soon find salvation in the Lord&#39;s embrace.&#39;

&#39;Wait. Then where is your Servant?&#39; He asked Pascale urgently, then glanced around, half expecting a Servant to pop out from behind some cover.

Pascal saw Orecchiette as angelic, and as hard as it was to admit, his description was <em>spot-on</em>: No one with a human heart could have reacted so coldly to Szrac&#39;s death. Not even someone emanating such warmth as Orecchiette. He was an angel that wasn&#39;t bound by humanity&#39;s morals.

Pascal&#39;s blood ran cold. Instead of taking the Executor&#39;s offer of a hug, he stepped away and released his hold. That was when Orecchiette remembered the finer details and prodded the chef with another question.

&quot;...My Servant is dead, asshole! Who are you even with?! The aristocrats? The mafia?&quot; Pascal shouted, stressed out of his mind and body from the back to back fights and the new arrival in front of him. He had no idea whether this was a dream or not.

&quot;Y-You said I won. Where&#39;s the Grail then? Why are you here...&quot; His rants started growing weaker and weaker. He was clearly just minutes away from passing out. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Fundamentally, the Executor failed to understand the guy named Pascal Poirot. Why was he getting worked up over a necessary sacrifice? Moreover, why was he so fixated on identifying Orecchiette? The Executor let out a puff of air, his patience starting to crack under Pascal&#39;s barrage of questions.

&#39;Correction: I am not an asshole. I am an Executor belonging to the Church. You may call me Orecchiette. This is also the second time you swore.&#39; He preached with an even tone, albeit a vein had popped somewhere underneath his golden mane. <em>That</em> was what tipped him over? &#39;I will make an exception today, since you must be going through a lot right now...&#39; 

&#39;As am I.&#39;

The cross-shaped tattoo on Orecchiette&#39;s chest started glowing, then an intricate summoning array manifested right on top of the design. Orecchiette placed his hand over the array and soon enough, an ornate box inscribed with sealing runes dragged itself out of the array and fell into his hand. 

&#39;The Grail is right here. If your Servant has been recycled already, then the Grail should&#39;ve been filled long ago. But, look,&#39; Orecchiette held up the box for Pascal to see, but made no indication to want to hand it over. Instead he rubbed his chin and continued mulling over Pascal&#39;s answer with a troubled expression.

&#39;<em>Something</em> must&#39;ve happened when the final Servant got absorbed,&#39; He theorized. &#39;Though there hasn&#39;t been any fluctuation in its mana signature since I laid my hands on it. It&#39;s how I came to the conclusion that Szrac was the 7th Servant, but clearly I was wrong. Then, is the Grail defective?&#39;

That couldn&#39;t be. The Holy Grail took on many forms, but they had no influence on its innate function as a wish granting device that ate Servants as batteries. 

&#39;Then, is the box sealing its mana signatures?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That made sense. The Mafia and Aristocrats loathed each other. If the Aristocrats could locate the Grail without having to go through a lengthy War, then there was no reason they wouldn&#39;t at least try. Wasn&#39;t there a Master who tried to do exactly that? Though he had no idea what became of them. Rumors tend to die when the city they originated from was dying.

Still, Orecchiette was amazed. He hadn&#39;t received a lot of magecraft training, and his knowledge in them were rudimentary at best. Most of his known spells were to aid himself in combat. As such, to disguise a container capable of sealing the Holy Grail as such a <em>basic</em> looking box was a feat that was <em>almost</em> comparable to miracles.

Supposedly it wouldn&#39;t hurt to take a closer look?

There was no way to confirm the integrity of the Grail without opening Pandora&#39;s box, after all. Orecchiette turned the box in his hand and quickly identified its locking mechanism, which just turned out to be a few braces and a lock with a keyhole. Breaking them seemed easy enough, but surely there was more than meets the eye.

Orecchiette mindlessly pried at the box lid. The braces gave in and tore off the hinges easily. He hadn&#39;t even exerted his full strength!

The lid snapped open-

<strong>BEEP</strong>

-and a small, spherical object came to life as its surface lit up with a countdown.

Orecchiette promptly closed the box, but the beeping continued. He looked at Pascal.

&#39;My task was to retrieve the Grail.&#39; He stated honestly.

<strong>BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP-</strong>

&quot;<em><strong>HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH?</strong></em>&quot; Pascal&#39;s head tilted. Tilted so hard he could easily pass up for an owl to an untrained eye. What he had just heard was ridiculous. The Church had been observing this war behind the scenes? The Church was <em>fine</em> with a massacre between mafiosi and aristocrats in a city on the verge of destruction?

Had Orecchiette not already demonstrated his strength, Pascal would have been tempted to punch him. Unfortunately, all he could do was stand quietly and wait for him to finish. He was the Executor&#39;s mercy.

So it was to his surprise for the man to reveal a mystical box in his hand. It was ornate and emitting powerful mana signatures. Strong enough to rival those of Servants. It was obvious what it could be.

<strong>A Holy Grail.</strong> Orecchiette&#39;s long winded explanation of it further corroborated Pascal&#39;s theory. The rest of the science was lost on him, since he had no idea that the Grail was supposed to be filled by the dead Heroic Spirits, much less the fact that all seven Servants had to die for that to happen. Of course, once the Executor finally opened the box, things were a lot clearer...

That was no Grail. It wasn&#39;t even a cup! Just an orb with an ominous ticking sound. A small timer could be read on it.

<em>00:59</em>

<em>00:58</em>

<em>00:57</em>

It was counting down. Pascal didn&#39;t like this. Orecchiette immediately closed the lid to hide his shame.

&quot;It&#39;s gonna <strong>BLOW</strong> you idiot! Get it outta here!&quot; The cook shouted as he shook Orecchiette&#39;s arms, as if pleading him to dispose of the mysterious device. Even if it wasn&#39;t a bomb, Pascal wanted nothing to do with it. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The mafia had lied about the Grail.

And the Church had bought into the lie. It couldn&#39;t be helped; with little in the way of intercity communication, the Church had no choice but to dispatch Executors to personally verify each and every rumor about this magical artifact. Orecchiette just happened to draw the short end of the stick when it came to mission assignments and got handed a dead lead.

Not to mention that all the mafia members he had questioned were in cahoots with each other. He couldn&#39;t have seen this coming. As virtuous as he was, Orecchiette was designed to place the utmost trust in people who were willing to talk, and everyone was more than ready to spill the beans after he had confiscated their weapons! 

But now that trust had led him into a trap.

Orechiette was in a pickle.

No, it wasn&#39;t the fact that he was holding a time bomb. Worse than that. Much worse.

&#39;Lying is a crime punishable by death.&#39; He said ominously, eyes narrowing into slits. Pascal would be taken aback. Between the box and the Execute, he couldn&#39;t tell which one was more deadly. What did Orecchiette mean by that? Was he going to hunt down the mafia for what they&#39;d done? Was the church always this ruthless?

Meanwhile, in Orecchiette&#39;s mind...

&#39;<em>What should I tell Papardelle?</em>&#39; The fresh graduate panicked. &#39;<em>I already promised her the Grail. I even gave her an ETA. But now I have no Grail and no ETA. If I report back to her now, then what does that make all my previous reports?</em>&#39; His frown deepened.

Had he always been a liar?

&#39;I am <em>not</em>. A liar.&#39; He suddenly spoke up, spooking Pascal yet again. 

He would <em>not</em> go back empty-handed. He had promised his supervisor a Grail, and a Grail she shall get. If the Grail turned out to be a fake, he just had to find whoever it was that bore the responsibility and turn them in. That&#39;s right. Orecchiette, the University&#39;s top-achieving graduate in the Class of 2104, would not botch his first fieldwork.

You can show me the way around their base.&#39; He turned in the general direction of the abandoned labs, then drew his arm back. Pascal heard a mighty <em>whoosh</em>, and the box was the gone from his hand. 

He had chucked the box out of the residential district like a baseball! Soon, it was no more than a dot on the horizon, then Pascal blinked and lost it completely.

Where did it go...?

Not that it was of much concern to Orecchiette. He was simply returning the counterfeit to where he had dug it up: Persepolis&#39; biggest dumpster, where it belonged. Now that the immediate danger had been taken care of, he grabbed Pascal and started marching towards the mafia&#39;s base. &#39;Now that you&#39;re safe, let us make haste. I must find this culprit by nightfall.&#39;
