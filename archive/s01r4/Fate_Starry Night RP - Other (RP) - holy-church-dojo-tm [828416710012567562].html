Not even those in positions of authority were spared from the arduous work tasks that filled menial life. Paperwork, meetings, schedules. It was enough to elicit many tired sighs.

Therefore, it was rather common for this particular woman to groan at this hour. It was peak working hours, yet she refused to dive in for the next five minutes. Even workaholics needed time to gain their bearings.

Indeed, her way of resting was simply to replace work with other work. Hence why she called <em>that man.</em>

<em>&quot;His first task should be done by now. I wonder how it went...&quot;</em> She thought in her head, feeling worried, but also excited at the same time. He slowly typed numbers on the phone...

&quot;Executioner, Orecchiette. I trust that the mission is going well? Have you found any clues regarding the Holy Grail&#39;s whereabouts?&quot; She asked with her divine voice filled with piety. Her words came from her ample bosom as she patiently awaited a reply from her prodigious partner. Surely, a model student with the best of grades had already completed their task with no issues whatsoever? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Orecchiette&#39;s handset buzzed once, then again. And again. It wasn&#39;t a new message, but a call personally addressed to him? The youngster removed the phone from his breast pocket and flipped it open. 

The number on the screen was one that he had memorized before setting out on this mission. He pressed the connect button and raised the phone to his ear.

&#39;Hello, Pappardelle.&#39; He greeted his personal informant-slash-supervisor solemnly. He wasn&#39;t expected to make a routine report until tomorrow, but he&#39;d been instructed to always follow his supervisor&#39;s orders. If she wanted a report now, then a report she shall receive. The fresh graduate started stringing words together in his head.

&#39;The mission is progressing without a hitch.&#39; He said in a calm, soothing tone that was sure to put anyone at ease. &#39;The mafia is currently hiding the Grail at the deserted testing site. There is a lot of ground to cover, but I managed to find a few mafia members willing to help. I even spoke to a few of them just now, and they were kind enough to cross a few locations off my search list. But, hmm.&#39; 

He paused for a moment, unsure whether the next part of his report would qualify as one. To begin with, it had little to do with his mission of retrieving the Grail. He&#39;d been taught that reports should be concise and precise; there was no room for unnecessary fluff.

However, it had never been in his interest to withhold information. His every action had been nothing but righteous and just, therefore, he had nothing to hide.

&#39;There is one more matter I would like some guidance on.&#39; He continued as a cool breeze swept past his feet, sending the pile of dangerous-looking items next to his feet clattering to the ground. 

&#39;I have accidentally acquired a small collection of the mafia&#39;s weapons and riches. What should I do with them? The only church in the city is out of repair and I&#39;ve yet to find a suitable replacement to make an offering to God.&#39;

Orecchiette&#39;s voice felt surprisingly soothing, similar to something you would hear in an audiobook. What followed next was even more refreshing.

&quot;You managed to communicate with the mafia members and coerce them into revealing key locations?&quot; Pappardelle asked, trying her best to hide her amazement. Orecchiette&#39;s test results showed that his natural aptitude and dedication towards his mission was astounding, but to think that he was also a silver tongue was incredible. A man of many tricks. Pappardelle had struck gold in opting to be his supervisor.

With the mafia under Orecchiette&#39;s grasp, it would be child&#39;s play to obtain the location of the Grail. Or so Pappardelle thought. If only she knew what had truly happened over at Persepolis...

Instead, she was fed even more amazing feats.

&quot;...You acquired <em>what?</em>&quot; She asked in disbelief, twirling with her lavender pigtails while comfortably sitting near her desk. The relaxing sensation of her masterfully crafted chair did nothing to assuage her surprise.

<em>&quot;Not only is he shrewd enough to befriend the Mafia, but he is likable enough to receive weapons and riches from them? He must have truly earned their trust. Orecchiette...is dangerous.&quot;</em> She thought to herself, worrying about the possible scenario in which her own executor would use their wits and charms against her. She had to prepare herself for such an eventual possibility...

...She was vastly overestimating him.

&quot;I see. You are truly devout, Orecchiette. As a nun, my pious heart cries out for you.&quot; Pappardelle replied, hiding her worries with benign words. &quot;The word of God demands that you sell the mafia&#39;s weapons and keep the riches on yourself. Bring them back to the base in one piece. I trust you to be capable of that.&quot;</span>

As she said that, she pressed onward and addressed the elephant in the room.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Whatever machinations went on in Pappardelle&#39;s head stayed in her head. She was truly a crafty being, keeping her guard up towards her prot&#233;g&#233; as she masked her worries under the pious words befitting of a woman of a cloth. The other end of her phone remained silent for a while after she issued further instructions...

<em>Sell the weapons?</em>

Orecchiette processed his supervisor&#39;s words with some difficulty. No, he had understood every word the nun had uttered, but when strung together, the idea they presented was inherently alien. He was not a trader, nor a merchant, and most definitely not a banker. He had learned about those occupations while at the University, and he had crossed paths with plenty of people in those trades while living in Persepolis. Paying for room and board, paying for laundry, paying for little kids on the street who really wanted that crepe from the local food truck. He had gotten really good at paying for stuff.

But now he was asked to switch his role.

Orecchiette was troubled. He didn&#39;t think he was capable of striking up a sells pitch as well as the merchants he&#39;d come across. Even the thought of kneading his face into a placating smile and using crude speech bordering slapstick humor to entertain customers was enough to make his cheeks flush with embarrassment. But Pappardelle had specifically asked him to do it. Who was he to refuse a direct order from his supervisor?

<em>Just think of it as an unconventional execution. Think of it as a test. You&#39;ve done well to assimilate yourself into the community. Playing merchant isn&#39;t that different from persuading the local mafia.</em>

Orecchiette made peace with himself in just a few seconds. He returned to the more pressing matter of securing the Grail.

Now that Republic has perfected <strong>their version</strong> of the Mystic Code, the entire area has been abandoned and never rebuilt. Mafia activity has always been rampant. If they had to pick a location to hide the Grail, it wouldn&#39;t be anywhere but here.&#39;

Orecchiette stated his observations with absolute confidence. Even if they were only conjectures, he somehow made it sound even more convincing than the morning news. Of course, Pappardelle was far from gullible, but Orecchiette sounded so genuine and self-assured...

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was a moment of awkward silence as Pappardelle patiently waited for Orecchiette&#39;s reply. The man was having a bit of a crisis, trying to envision himself as a salesman. He simply couldn&#39;t see it. It was something beyond his grasp.

&quot;Hello? Is the communicator on?&quot; Pappardelle snapped Orecchiette back to reality, ten seconds or so having passed in between as the man finally replied. Apparently, the Grail was rumored to be around the abandoned test site that had been formerly used by <strong>Republic</strong>. It made sense, especially considering how the mafia was the most likely candidate to take advantage of remnants of the old test site. The aristocracy was far too prideful to stoop to salvaging scrap.

Orecchiette delivered his report with utmost precision. Pappardelle could feel his words ooze confidence and ability, like the trained expert that he was. The University had taught him well, and she felt like applauding herself for finding such a rare catch.

Yes, with Orecchiette as her pawn, she would be able to easily rise up in the <strong>Church</strong> ranks. His exploits would lead to her fame. A symbiotic relationship that worked in her favor.

Of course, it would be best if Orecchiette was never told that. Ignorance was bliss.

&quot;I understand. Excellent job, Orecchiette. I have nothing but praise for your performance so far.&quot; Pappardelle said with a gentler tone, trying to ease him in. &quot;Continue your mission: Obtain the Grail. Report to me back when you are done. I shall deal with the paperwork needed to report your successes to the higher ups.&quot;

She had completely bought into his theory. For such an analytical manager, they sure were gullible. Or perhaps, their nature to overthink was what made them gullible. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

He couldn&#39;t wait to see Pappardelle&#39;s face when he brought back the Grail.

One district down, three more to go.

Orecchiette cut the call, then started organizing the weapons he had obtained from the mafia. Where should he go to sell them? What were his potential buyers? The young Executor glanced in the direction of the <span class="mention">#mass-grave</span>. Would it work if he convinced those guys to buy them back? He could even let them name the price out of the generosity of his heart. It would be an absolute steal for them...
