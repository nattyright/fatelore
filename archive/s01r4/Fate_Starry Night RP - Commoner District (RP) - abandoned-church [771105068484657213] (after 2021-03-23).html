All Tapio remembered was that he had witnessed the demise of Assassin, along with a demonstration of strength from Archer and his Master. The mage he was dealing with was quite the odd sort. He knew that they were a prodigy, but they were also ranting about things such as revenge and the fate of Persepolis.

It must have bored him to tears, since he soon fell asleep inside Aratron&#39;s snug body. Scales could be surprisingly warm when clustered together, as Tapio soon found out. He dozed off in a jiffy, leaving Caster the burden to carry the child home.

Coal had been distraught after his defeat at the hands of Kari, and Caster saw no value in keeping him around. He simply waved Coal goodbye with a few blunt words.

<em>&quot;This is the last time we shall ever meet.&quot;</em>

Odd. Tapio was asleep at the time, yet he could remember Aratron&#39;s choice words quite clearly. Was this...telepathy? No, it seemed a bit too weird to be true...

After that, there was a moment of darkness. Tapio didn&#39;t know what was going on around him, but his body knew that he was back at home. Back at the church. Back inside the tent. He felt warm and cozy, as if lying inside a futon roll...or laying on someone&#39;s lap.

Either alternative was fine to him. He dreamed about his magazines. He dreamed about the Holy Grail War. He dreamed about...

...wait, what <em>was</em> this dream? Suddenly, Tapio started sweating. He felt a bit anxious, as if he had stepped into someone else&#39;s room...or someone else&#39;s dream, to be precise. It was an awkward, horrible feeling. Like opening a bathroom door and finding a man with their pants down.

Yet Tapio knew that he could only move forward if he planned on leaving this dream. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Exactly when that had happened, Tapio had no recollection. He couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it, but something about this room, the chills it gave him, it all felt so familiar. Was it something he&#39;d experienced before? A memory long since forgotten, only to resurface in a dream? People say that repressed memories often manifest in dreams. Had he been repressing his memories?

Was it <em>his</em> memory?

Tapio took a few steps forward. The room blossomed in his mind, every nook and cranny. It sort of looked like the rundown church he&#39;d been residing in-

He stopped. What church?

Why was he here again?

Tapio suddenly felt like an intruder. He took another step, and a cold chill crept up from the bottom of his feet. This dream was starting to feel less like a dream and more like the prelude to a nightmare.

Tapio scoffed. He was no wimp. Dream monsters couldn&#39;t hurt him. Now that he&#39;d worked out the logistics, this place could no longer scare him. All he had to do was find an exit. There was always an exit.

Tapio picked a random direction and started walking.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio felt stranded in an alien world. He was somewhere beyond home, and he felt like he wasn&#39;t supposed to be there. It was the sensation of being an uninvited guest, or an intruder entering a home that was not theirs.

But he was there now. There was no choice but to keep moving.

He moved, and moved, until the walls around him turned bleak. Sterile tiles. The stench of blood. Trash bags in front of him that felt like they contained more than just trash.

Summoning circles...

Men in hoods. Pointy hats. Cross in hand. Prayers inbound.

A man with a suit that reminded him of scales. He emerged from the bathtub, looking as bored as ever. Tapio remembered him well: It was without a doubt, Aratron, who had emerged from a bloodied bathtub with arcane symbols scribbled around it. The blood reminded him of pig&#39;s blood, but it looked too bright and fresh to be that of a mere animal.

The hooded figures bowed down to Caster as they raised their hands in prayer.

Tapio was starting to understand what he had just witnessed. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio stopped for what felt like the sixth time since he had embarked on this short trek. Every time he did so, he noticed something different. Stone floor became ceramic tiles, candle lights became incandescent, hemp sacks became plastic bags. It felt as if he were journeying through history, but in the most unsavory and most disturbing way possible. 

He went over to one of the plastic bags and prodded it with his foot. It felt like hard rubber inside, riddled with grooves and ridges. He doubted it was actually rubber. The air smelled metallic, smelled like death. Tapio didn&#39;t feel like guessing what was inside the bags. 

He pressed on. Then the most bizarre scene unfolded in front of him...

Tapio quickened his steps. He navigated through the crowd of weirdly dressed men, batting their hands away as he squeezed himself between them, trying to get to the center. A bathtub filled with blood drew everyone&#39;s eyes, and Tapio found himself unable to look away from the figure that had emerged from it.

He knew this man. This creature. This beast. Scale-like clothing adorned his body, glistening under the pale light. It almost looked cozy, were it not for the bloodbath that was starting to make Tapio&#39;s stomach turn from the stench. He took a breath through his mouth and called out to the figure. 

&#39;I didn&#39;t know you took baths, C-&#39; 

Words lodged in the back of his throat. Was this Caster?

It was Aratron, without a doubt. But was it Caster? <em>His</em> Caster?

Tapio hopped past the summoning circle. It looked nowhere as neatly drawn as his. The bathtub was almost within arm&#39;s reach.

&#39;Come with me,&#39; He stuck out his hand, then panicked when the figure didn&#39;t respond.

&#39;I&#39;m right here!&#39; He raised his arm and waved it around Aratron&#39;s face, trying to break him out of his stupor. &#39;Come on. Let&#39;s go back.&#39; He pleaded.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Caster remained silent. His face was filled with disdain, which was normal: Tapio had gotten used to his own Servant giving him disgusted looks. However, he felt like he wasn&#39;t the one on the receiving end of that soul-piercing gaze.

&quot;Aratron. Almighty Aratron. Governor of Saturn and member of the Seven Olympian Spirits. We humbly seek an audience with you, the ruler of the <em>Arbatel.</em> A demon above all!&quot; The hooded people said while bowing. Their voices changed with every word, as if numerous people had uttered the same sentences throughout the years.

Aratron&#39;s gaze was focused not on them, but on their offerings. Bags, sacks, containers...Filled with that?

The red liquid leaking out of them was enough of a giveaway.

Tapio could tell. His Servant was <em>pissed.</em> It was one thing to offer animals to a deity, but these weren&#39;t animals. These were hu-

&quot;...You have no need for me.&quot; Aratron replied solemnly. His face was still filled with hate, but Tapio saw something else. Tears were flowing from his Servant&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;<strong>You have already summoned plenty of demons.</strong>&quot; Caster said with a snarl more raw than any beast. &quot;Suffer in Hell, you beasts of man!&quot;

Tapio saw a familiar figure: A dragon. A gigantic lizard of rock and stone emerged in the cramp room. The bathtub collapsed under its weight, blood pooling out as the hooded figures backed away in fear.

Aratron then fired away. A gigantic beam of sand collided with Tapio and the men around him. The boy flinched, closing his eyes for a solid minute before realizing that he was still alive. He opened them and saw the aftermath around him.

The men were alive. Their legs had been petrified. Their arms had turned to stone as well. Even their mouths were now solid rock, rendering them incapable of eating or drinking normally. They could no longer speak. No longer mention any dreaded incantation. A fate worse than death.</span>

Aratron returned to his human shell. His teeth grinding on each other as he stared at his summoners in disgust. He then proceeded to do the logical thing:

He decapitated his own head.

...

His head rolled down to Tapio, still glaring at him in hatred and pity. Still crying tears for humanity.

The room started to dissolve into sand... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio wasn&#39;t sure what he&#39;d just witnessed. The dragon sent him sprawling behind the broken bathtub, using it for cover while the beast roared above. When he opened his eyes again it was all over. Aratron had kept himself busy, condemning the crew and casting their limbs in stone before raising his hand to his own neck.

<em>This is a dream</em>, Tapio thought. <em>This is just a dr-</em>

The blood that spritzed all over his face almost felt warm. A weight fell into his lap, and the boy looked down, only to find a bloodied face contorted in agony. 

This was the first time Tapio had held anything akin to human flesh in his hands. The experience was far from pleasant, and he&#39;d forgotten to remind himself that it was a dream somewhere along the way. He wanted to throw Aratron&#39;s severed head away, but it weighed him down like a boulder, all the while staring into him with its piercing gaze, accusing him and the countless humans before him of the crimes they had committed in search of selfish salvation.

Tapio&#39;s arms trembled. It was a weight he couldn&#39;t bear alone.

&#39;Ara-&#39; He opened his mouth, but then Aratron&#39;s head burst into sand. They slipped through his fingers, and Tapio found himself cradling a tiny lizard, curled up with its own tail in its mouth. 

His mind went blank.

&#39;...Aratron?&#39; He asked tentatively, and the creature responded. It opened its eyes and uncurled its delicate form, only to look past him yet again. Tapio followed its gaze. He turned around...

And found himself in the presence of a giant.

Gone was the bathtub, the tiles, and the crowd of zealots demanding Aratron&#39;s powers. Tapio found himself standing on a gigantic workbench filled with beakers and tubes and magic devices almost as tall as him. A new summoning circle spread out under his feet, each stroke as thick as his arm and exquisitely drawn into a large sheet of parchment.

<em>Who are you?</em> He wanted to ask the giant man. <em>And what did you do to my Servant?</em>

The ground dissolved into sand and the boy found himself sinking into a vortex of light...

<em>**

Tapio opened his eyes to his tent saturated with light. It was well past noon, and he felt like he had just run a marathon. 

What was that all about?

He sat up and caught sight of his Servant, then memories from his dream came rushing back. Tapio flinched and immediately wormed his way back under the covers, pulling it well over his head to create a safety barrier between him and his Servant.

*WHAT THE HELL.</em> He thought to himself. He didn&#39;t need to remember all...that!

The moment he woke up back inside the tent he was hit with a feeling of deja vu. This was exactly what had happened last time after he fell unconscious during the fight against Lancer. Except now, he had context.

It wasn&#39;t hard for him to piece the puzzle together. He had seen this dream several times by now. It was something he would rather not confront.

But alas, Aratron had been closely monitoring his condition ever since the boy fell asleep. He had already noticed the boy wake up.

&quot;Student? Are you awake?&quot; Aratron asked as he entered the tent, albeit he already knew the answer. The purpose of the question was not to check for him being conscious, but to see whether he was willing to talk yet.

&quot;...I see that you are still intent on sleeping. Shall I leave?&quot; Aratron narrowed his eyes. <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">No! They noticed! Of course they did! Aratron practically had eyes growing on the back of his head. There wasn&#39;t a single waking moment where Tapio didn&#39;t feel like being watched. At least that&#39;s what it had felt like. He had finally gotten used to it, but that dream tossed him all the way back to square one. He had never been more conscious about Aratron&#39;s piercing gaze until now.

He could almost feel the intensity of their glare through his blankets, as if it had singed the fabric and bore a hole on his back. He squirmed under the sheets. Does he respond, or not? Would Aratron actually leave him alone if he pretended to sleep?

No! Scratch that! He was bursting with questions, he was dying to ask them!

And yet he hesitated. Facing Aratron felt like a monumental chore. What was he going to say? Where would he even begin? This was the crisis of a lifetime!

Aratron watched the lump in the bed toss and turn from one end to another then back around. He was ready to lose his patience, but then the blanket burst open and out popped his student, face red and gasping for fresh air. He locked eyes with his Servant and immediately shied away. He cleared his throat awkwardly.

&#39;Um. You may stay.&#39; He pulled himself into an incredibly proper sitting position, feet tucked away under his body and hands on his knees. His eyes were still shifty. &#39;Am I a good Master?&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron was worried. He sensed his Master&#39;s palpitations and nervousness through the jittery blanket that was shaking right in front of him. Tapio most likely didn&#39;t realize that his subtle movements had caused the blanket to move as well.

Caster chalked it up to a brief anxiety attack. He was tempted to inquire further, were it not the fact that he could potentially worsen things with words alone. He relented, until Tapio emerged from his cocoon and allowed him to speak. His words were very...suspicious.

&quot;...Master? To me, you are but a mere student. Think about being a Master after you&#39;ve graduated.&quot; Aratron replied bluntly, which didn&#39;t bolster Tapio&#39;s confidence. He was still being treated as a child.

But Caster could see something else within him.

&quot;...What did you see? Did you have a nightmare?&quot; Aratron asked, puzzled. He had been staring at Tapio&#39;s eyes for a while, because he had noticed a glint in them. The sight of something that Aratron had witnessed himself long ago...

&quot;You&#39;ve been prying.&quot; Caster snarled, scratching his chin in frustration as he felt that his privacy had been tarnished. So, this is what the books meant by Master and Servant connection. It was more than just a connection of mana. &quot;What did you see? Answer!&quot; <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;Nothing!&#39; Tapio involuntarily squeezed his eyes shut as Aratron lambasted him for probing his dreams. &#39;Just...a bit of this, a bit of that...it wasn&#39;t on purpose!&#39; 

He peeked at Caster through one squinting eye, wondering if they were mad. Aratron looked genuinely pissed off, and the sight reminded him of the dream. Reminded him of how readily they took their own life in the face of a disappointing Master. Masters. He wasn&#39;t anything like them, was he?

Then why was he a part of the dream? Why did he end up in the crowd? Was he really that different from Aratron&#39;s past contractors, or was that just his own wishful thinking? 

Did Aratron hate him?

&#39;I didn&#39;t do anything to upset you lately, did I?&#39; He asked tentatively, after a long pause. &#39;I mean! I think it&#39;s better for the both of us if you gave up on tutoring me. But other than that, I haven&#39;t done anything awful, right?&#39; 

He then remembered the fight at the graveyard. 

&#39;Well, I wanted to beat up Archer&#39;s Master, but I couldn&#39;t even land a hit on her...maybe that didn&#39;t count, after all...&#39;

His hands were clenched together so tight that they were starting to sweat. God, why did he have to bring up that fight now of all times? Aratron had gone ballistic over Archer, did that really manage to slip his mind until now?

Tapio wanted to kick himself.

&quot;...You did not upset me. I am completely fine.&quot; Aratron muttered while grinding his own teeth. Tapio could see sand falling from Caster&#39;s lips. &quot;If this is your attempt at goading me to abandon my duties as teacher, then I am very much not impressed.&quot;

He would have kept ranting, had Tapio not mentioned Archer and their dreadful Master. Aratron snarled, thinking about how despicable Archer was with their idealistic nonsense.

He shook his head once he realized that he was digressing.

&quot;Stop beating around the bush! Student. Tell me. What. Did. You. <em>See.</em>&quot; He held a light pause with each word as he stared Tapio down. &quot;I can sense adrenaline coursing through your veins, along with deep embarrassment and high anxiety levels. Let me reassure you: I have no intention of harming any humans. This includes you, my student. So, feel free to speak with this newfound knowledge.&quot;

Aratron hoped that this would reassure Tapio, but the boy could still remember how his Servant turned people&#39;s limbs to stone with ease. Sure, those cultists were probably still alive, but did that really count as living? <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Besides, Caster&#39;s definition of not harming humans was dubious at best. He still recalled how he got petrified once just because Aratron thought he ran too slow, and proceeded to turn him into luggage. Was petrification something as normal as putting on a jacket for them?

&#39;...<strong>I&#39;m just trying to be considerate!</strong>&#39; He groaned. &#39;I don&#39;t want you to go decapitating yourself because I touched a nerve or something! I know I&#39;m just a no-good flunker in your eyes, but I&#39;m trying to be a good Master, okay? I didn&#39;t use a single catalyst when I summoned you, and I never offered you anything other than mana batteries. I even gave up on Saber and rooted for you.&#39; He admitted reluctantly. It seemed that he was forever doomed on his quest to find Saber. Any saber. Did Aratron come with an innate Saber repellent or something?

Tapio crossed his arms. 

&#39;What I&#39;m trying to say is! I&#39;m better than your previous Masters!&#39; He huffed and puffed and put on a brave face. &#39;So if you have any complaints, <em>you</em> talk to <em>me</em>! And no going around petrifying me without permission.&#39; He sniffed.

Well, that was a disaster. Aratron had already regained his composure while Tapio lost his. He&#39;d gotten himself worked up, but for what?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Considerate. Considerate?

Aratron could never fathom the prospect of Tapio being considerate for his Servant&#39;s feelings. After all, from his perspective, the boy simply saw Servants as fantastic action figures. He wanted to see amazing fights. A clash of abilities and Noble Phantasms. Flashy abilities next to strong abilities. It was the main reason that he called Caster&#39;s plans &#39;boring&#39;.

For him to suddenly backtrack could only mean...

&quot;...I don&#39;t want to talk about it. I don&#39;t even want to <em>think</em> about it.&quot; Aratron spat the moment Tapio mentioned his decapitation. What would the boy say if he had known that Caster had done that for the vast majority of his summons?

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare feel pity, student. Don&#39;t compare yourself to trash that was willing to waste precious lives.&quot; Aratron said with much scorn. Clearly, he felt disgusted at his previous summons. Tapio could easily guess way: They hadn&#39;t summoned him as a Servant. They had summoned him before the apocalypse. Before nomadic cities. It had most likely been through arcane means too.

Human sacrifice was a prime catalyst for that.

&quot;I know that you are better than them, because you are <strong>my student.</strong> None of those that I consider my pupils have ever willingly taken a life. As incompetent of a magus you are, even you know not to cross that line.&quot; For once, Tapio was given credit where it was due. Aratron might consider him a pathetic mage, but he still saw him for what he was: A pure human.

&quot;...That being said,&quot; Caster&#39;s face morphed into a frown.

&quot;<strong>I have several complaints.</strong>&quot;

Tapio felt alarms ring in his head.

&quot;One, we have currently lost Assassin thanks to your little escapade. Our only possible alliance has vanished. Two, we failed to defeat Archer and exposed our hand to them. Consider them a threat, since they know how my Magecraft functions. And three: Deadlines are approaching soon, yet you have spent half of the last few weeks sleeping. What do you say to that?&quot; Aratron grunted.</span>

&#39;I&#39;m not taking pity on you. I just...I just don&#39;t want to sour our relationship.&#39; His head hung in shame as he was being reminded of his failures both as a Master and as a mage. Caster just had to put him down the moment he&#39;d finished praising him. Had they no heart? 

&#39;I know you aren&#39;t happy with me. I failed you on multiple accounts. I have nothing to say to all of that aside from I&#39;m sorry.&#39; 

Tapio prostrated himself on top of his bed and pressed his hands together in an act of apology.

&#39;<strong>I&#39;M REALLY, TRULY SORRY!!!!</strong>&#39; He howled into his blankets. &#39;I&#39;m sorry I lost us our only ally! I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do magecraft like you wanted! I didn&#39;t mean to make you mad, but there&#39;s nothing I can do! I&#39;m sorry you got stuck with a loser like me!&#39;

He stayed like that for a solid minute, until his back started aching from the awkward posture. There was no way Aratron would be satisfied with an apology. Were he in their shoes, he wouldn&#39;t write everything off just with an apology either. How could he make up for his mistakes? 

Tapio racked his brains. He was well aware that Aratron drew the worst possible hand when they answered to his summon. An ancient spirit capable of calling down a planet, stuck with a boy who couldn&#39;t even practice magecraft normally? He wouldn&#39;t have complained had Aratron simply walked out of the church and never looked back. Yet they stayed, and tried to mold him into a mage capable of holding his own.

Deadlines were approaching, and not just the ones Aratron had prescribed.

Tapio pulled himself back into a more comfortable sitting position.

&#39;There&#39;s something I can do.&#39; He said resolutely. &#39;It&#39;ll give you an edge against Archer, and other Servants too. I have rested enough. I can help.&#39; He steeled himself, then challenged his Servant.

&#39;Bond with me, Caster.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron stared at his student, dumbfounded. There was something very unique about his summoning. Something incredibly special about the current situation.

To tell the truth, this was one of the few times that Aratron had been summoned as a Heroic Spirit. The majority of his summons had been done through occult means, due to the volatile nature of his existence and legend. He had only been summoned by cultists, magi and organizations, usually for selfish purposes.

He never had the opportunity to wholly dedicate himself to his true passion. His primary mission: <strong>Teaching.</strong>

After all, he had promised this to his creator. The man behind Paracelsianism. The man who used alchemy not as a tool of the occult, but as a tool of love.

He had remembered his goal, at long last. Tapio might have been a complete nonce, but he finally gave him an outlet. He had never seen someone apologize to him, or attempt to understand him. None of them tried to, except Paracelsus himself. For once, someone understood him.

He felt flustered, but appearing composed was the first hallmark of any teacher. He kept a professional gaze trained on Tapio as the boy apologized. It was a struggle to keep a straight face in front of a selfish brat suddenly acting humble.

&quot;...There&#39;s an expression called &#39;too much of a good thing is bad&#39;. I feel like that is applicable to current situation.&quot; Aratron replied with a worried look. He appreciated that his student was suddenly being considerate towards him, but such prostration only filled him with embarrassment. Tapio could see a slight blush in Aratron&#39;s cheeks.

Of course, that disappeared the moment the boy proposed his plan.

<em><strong>&quot;No.&quot;</strong></em>

Aratron immediately replied with a scowl. Tapio felt like he had gone limp from that reply.

An awkward cough later...</span>

Were it not for your cloak, you would be putting the entire world into stasis.&quot; Aratron pointed out. It was true.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;No?&#39; Tapio&#39;s shoulders slumped. &#39;What do you mean, no?&#39; Was he not good enough? But he&#39;d thought that bonding didn&#39;t require any magecraft mastery. All he had to do was share his mana with his Servant like an extra battery tank. There was no effort involved. Aratron had everything to gain from this exchange. 

It was also his final wager. Tapio had nothing else to offer his Servant. Everything he could do, Aratron could do a hundred times better. For them to reject his offer without a moment&#39;s hesitation...

Tapio felt his heart sink. Was Aratron still mad at him?

As it turned out, Aratron neither misheard him, nor were they mad at him. The Olympian explained his reasons backed by facts and logic, and Tapio felt a laugh bubbling up within him. He&#39;d been scaring himself over nothing. Aratron wasn&#39;t dismissing his magic circuits. They were simply concerned about his condition. In fact, they placed so much importance his safety that they were willing to give up the biggest boon to their strengths.

Despite their Class and profession, Aratron acted surprisingly unmagelike sometimes.

&#39;Caster,&#39; Tapio stopped his Servant before they could divulge further. &#39;An additional source of mana drain doesn&#39;t matter. My magic circuits are in excellent shape.&#39; He boasted. &#39;If I didn&#39;t have the mana to waste, I wouldn&#39;t be here right now.&#39;

He proceeded to take off his cloak. Aratron felt a slight stir in the air as Tapio&#39;s mana spread out to fill the whole room. Unlike when they had unleashed their Noble Phantasm, nothing in the room was undergoing transformations, and so the mana lay dormant, simply enveloping the small collection of furniture and nothing more.

If you can figure all this out without even consulting the blueprint, then I have every reason to believe that you can fortify it for me too. You can do that easily, right?&#39; 

Tapio stared Caster down as he invited them to the challenge.

&#39;You are a top class mage. You know the benefits of doing this.&#39; He pressed further. &#39;Make it strong, and all my mana belongs to you. You&#39;ll finally get to be a proper Servant. Besides,&#39; He hesitated, then added as a final push. &#39;I don&#39;t have two decades to wait.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron remained silent. He stroked his chin repeatedly, listening to Tapio doing the best sales pitch he possibly could in order to convince his Servant about the boons of bonding. It wasn&#39;t a foreign concept to Caster, yet he wasn&#39;t an advocate for it: How could a student even match his mana hungry demands if they had yet to complete his coursework?

But Tapio wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. A demonstration later and the boy had quickly recalled Aratron&#39;s attention to stasis defying cloak. It was the only object that was keeping Tapio&#39;s circuits under control, and the main reason Caster was reluctant to bond with him.

A possible solution was to, therefore, fortify it.

An haphazard way of bonding. Fortifying the cloak made sense, but it also meant that the strength gained from bonding would be lost the moment Tapio lost his cloak. He had to take special care of it. A huge responsibility for a Master.

But his eyes were brimming with determination. Plus, they didn&#39;t have time to wait, with aristocrats and enemy Servants knocking on their door.

&quot;...Can you keep up with me?&quot; Aratron asked with a determined glare. There would be no going back from this point onward. If Tapio was absolutely sure he could handle a Caster&#39;s mana output, then he would accept that he would feel hell on his shoulders.</span>

Aratron grabbed the cloak from Tapio&#39;s fingers and stared at it. Its shoddy, man made design could be refined to ten times its effectiveness.

&quot;I&#39;ll need an hour. You should rest during that time. The bonding itself will put great strain on your circuits.&quot; Caster said as he left the tent and headed back to his workbench.

Tapio remained alone, but he wasn&#39;t worried. Staying without his cloak in a fake, sterile environment was far from hard. An hour passed by in a flash, as his Servant returned with cloth that felt brand you. Tapio could sense new runes and sigils being embedded on it.

&quot;Put it on. Once you do, the bond will be official. Steel your nerves for the feedback.&quot; Aratron said. It was clear that he had tampered with the cloak, increasing not only its output, but turning it into a bonding device of some sort. The first magus to wear it would become Aratron&#39;s de facto partner. There was no turning back... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;<em>Can</em> I? I bet you&#39;ll never want to go back to using mana batteries. You can trust me on that.&#39; Tapio put on a brave face and sent Aratron off with a wave of his hand. The environment inside the tent was stable enough that he didn&#39;t need the protection of the cloak. While Aratron set to work on its runes and fortification, Tapio would go back to his bed for one last snooze. Then everything would be different.

<em>Can he keep up?</em> He asked himself once he was within the cozy cocoon of his blankets. He had never measured the quality of his magic circuits, but he had been told time and time again that it was a miracle that his condition hadn&#39;t killed him in the crib. If he&#39;d been unconsciously wasting mana all his life and lived to tell the tale, then there was no reason to think he didn&#39;t have the capacity to support Caster&#39;s mana consumption.

Of course, thinking is one thing and doing is another. Tapio had never successfully created a bounded field larger than his own palm before, let alone summon a myriad of mythical creatures within it. Would he be a good mana tank for Caster, or would he become a liability yet again? Now that Aratron had left the room, doubt started creeping back into his head. 

Tapio shook his head and curled up under the sheets. He hugged himself, as if the motion was enough keep the uncertainties at bay.

The issue wasn&#39;t up for debate in the first place. He <em>must</em> do it, simple as that.

When he opened his eyes again, Caster was at his bedside again with his cloak. Tapio sat up in a daze. Had it already been an hour? 

He took the cloak and turned it over. The runes inscribed on its underside had changed. Brand new sigils invaded the once familiar pattern, creating a foreign scheme that was far too advanced for him. Aratron wasn&#39;t joking when they said they needed an hour. Tapio&#39;s brain was already fizzling from looking at the new design despite not understanding even a lick of it.

He threw the cloak around his shoulders.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The moment Tapio donned his new cloak, he felt like he was about to choke. Raw mana permeated the entirety of his skin. He could see it crack and display his circuits on top of his flesh. It was unsightly, like an apple that had been left out in the sun. His body ached and he felt an invisible rope around his stomach. It was constricting him like a snake, dragging him towards some unseemly darkness as he realized that it was his artificial circuits. They were being overloaded...

Eventually, everything stopped. No pain. No feelings at all. The boy felt like he had just become part of something larger. That someone else could feel the same sensations he could. His sense of touch, taste and smell slowly returned. Sight and hearing followed soon after.

When his eyes opened, Caster was staring back at him with an approving smirk.

&quot;Seems like the bond was a success. My body no longer feels as heavy as stone.&quot; Aratron muttered, before throwing a few quick jabs in the air. It was an odd sight, to see a Caster be so free with their hands, but Tapio felt liberated as well: He was no longer just a student on the sidelines. He was now paying his Servant with his own blood and mana. A true Master.

&quot;Of course, this means that you&#39;ll be consuming mana at a faster rate. At this point, it might be wiser to monitor your condition instead of mine.&quot; Caster pointed out.

&quot;Therefore, we need to make the best out of your limited mana reserves. Being wasteful will lead to a slow death. In other words...&quot;

&quot;<strong>We should eliminate the remaining enemy Servants at once.</strong> If we can do that before you run out of mana, then we will have all the time in the world to regain our strength afterwards.&quot; A sound, solid plan. If only it didn&#39;t sound batshit crazy to Tapio&#39;s ears...

Could an awakened Aratron really take down the remaining Servants? One way to find out.

&quot;As our first target, I recommend Szrac Vaughn. He is the bigger threat, compared to Archer.&quot; Aratron suggested.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It was an odd sight to see Aratron shadowboxing the moment he regained his sight. The Olympian had always carried themselves with grace, but seeing them this energized wasn&#39;t so bad. If anything, it could only mean that their bonding had succeeded. 

Tapio rubbed his stomach and examined his arms. His skin looked unblemished and he no longer felt constricted. He could feel a brand new sensation lingering within. It made him feel like a cog in a machine, made him feel a connection tugging at him in the back of his mind. Tapio became aware of another entity at the end of his metaphorical circuits, and his mana happily poured into them as if they were one of his own.

Tapio clenched his fists, unable to suppress his smile. He had just become a Master.

&#39;I can barely feel a thing. Actually, I feel great!&#39; He responded to Caster with sparkles in his eyes. &#39;I can tell you&#39;re there. This is so weird, but it&#39;s so <em>cool</em>.&#39; He emphasized, barely able to contain his excitement. No one in his family had bonded with a Servant before, so everything he was learning, he was learning for the first time. It came as an honest relief that it didn&#39;t take much mana to maintain a Servant&#39;s existence. He was probably wasting just as much mana before Aratron had improved the runes on his cloak.

Of course, Aratron didn&#39;t leave the boy much time to revel in his promotion to Master. They started laying out plans, and even Tapio was taken aback by how bold they sounded.

Did you flip a switch somewhere? Do I need to unflip it for you?&#39; He joked, but once Aratron disclosed their first target he understood. Despite no longer being Saber&#39;s Master, Mr. Tin Can had never left Aratron&#39;s shitlist. In fact, Szrac&#39;s mere presence in the Holy Grail War was the sole driving force behind many of their actions. It was no wonder Aratron wanted Szrac out of the picture. 

&#39;Can&#39;t say I have any objection to that.&#39; Tapio nodded gravely. &#39;I have a feeling you wouldn&#39;t have babied me so much were it not for him. If taking him out will put your mind at ease, then let&#39;s go look for him, right now.&#39;

&quot;Whatever do you mean? My primary objective was always my student&#39;s safety. My secondary objective is their education, for these two tasks are deeply linked to each other. Once I have guaranteed your safety, we shall return to our usual lessons.&quot; He replied. Tapio wondered if it was possible to use the Grail to cancel Aratron&#39;s lessons, but that would be a thought for another time. Right now, their main focus was Szrac.

&quot;I&#39;ve been using my familiars to scout out Persepolis&#39; condition. The aristocracy is currently in disarray, since Szrac and his Servant have taken residence in one of the larger manors and are demanding payment on a daily basis. This payment includes riches, gold, valuables and so on. Clearly, they are related to the Servant&#39;s ability.&quot; Aratron muttered.

&quot;However, this also means that we know their base of operations. Finding them won&#39;t be difficult. I was unsure on our chances of victory due to limited information, but with this newfound power...&quot;

He clenched his fist.
