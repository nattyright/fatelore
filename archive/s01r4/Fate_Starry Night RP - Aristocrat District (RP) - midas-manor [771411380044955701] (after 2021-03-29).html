However, I doubt they are anyone significant.&quot;</strong> Szrac explained, recalling what little he bothered to remember of Caster. <strong>&quot;He certainly did not have the seem of a Merlin, nor that of an Abe-no-Seimei. He is more akin to a footnote in history than a figure of true intrigue.&quot;</strong>

And yet, this fractured Grail still saw fit to summon him from the Throne of Heroes. That, combined with the fact that he had outlasted Saber, Lancer, and Assassin, meant that perhaps there was more to him than met the eye.

But once his master was torn to pieces and his spirit core obliterated, that would no longer matter.

The cyborg walked with Midas down the barren halls, eyeing the empty space. A prime position to place turrets. They&#39;d have ample range to fire, and enemy servants would have to clear a great distance before they could break them. 

<strong>&quot;Their exact location does not matter.&quot;</strong> Szrac explained, using his metallurgy to open the front doors of the manor. <strong>&quot;When enough blood is shed, people grow desperate. They cry for the strong to liberate them. Either they arrive to face us, or we force those who know of them to inform us of where vermin scurry.&quot;</strong>

Midas walked out of the front doors, gazing up at the sky. That infernal box, the Radio, had spoken of rain and overall gloomy weather. Seeing as the weather was manipulated in these areas, it was spot on. Darker grey clouds accompanied a slight chilling breeze. Even those of the outside variety would balk at such a terrible state of the outside.  A terrible day for the battle deciding the potential fate of the city, and even worse for himself. If that idiot got a hold of this body, their entire conquest could be for naught.

“When we defeat Caster, our next step of conquest is that damned Weather Dome controller,” he said, crossing his arms in the vain attempt to warm himself. “ I daresay they rigged the skies above to counteract me and my abilities. Fill me in on where that particular rodent lies, while we consider the dozen other rats and their burrows.”

Berserker was still not yet accustomed to the fluctuating weather of Persepolis, still wearing his custom attire which was more suited for summer weather. Even more perplexing was his sudden shift of conversation. Perhaps his disdain for the current weather was born from a childhood fear, or a later in life event.

The pair was now standing right at the footsteps leading to the newly crowned Midas Manor. Their eyes would be almost blinded by the radiant rays of reflective gold. So, this is what Szrac and his Servant have been up to...

&quot;I shall remind you, student, that these are actual opponents. They will attempt any sort of tactic in order to win the Grail War. The easiest solution is to always aim for the Master.&quot; Aratron lectured Tapio as they started walking on the steps.

&quot;I cannot fight at my fullest as long as it might endanger you. If you wish to leave now, then I recommend doing so.&quot; He gave Tapio one last chance to back away and let Aratron handle things instead. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

Aratron looked to his side and saw nothing but empty space where his Master should&#39;ve been. Tapio lagged behind by quite a large margin, still hanging out by the foot of the stairs as he crouched to examine a few blades of grass that had been turn to gold along with the mansion. 

It was quite the foolish act to leave himself so vulnerable right at the edge of enemy territory, but could anyone blame him? Much like Aratron&#39;s stone familiars, it wasn&#39;t everyday that one would get to witness so many otherwise mundane objects being cast in an entirely different material. A precious metal at that! 

Tapio was shook. His entire worldview had been challenged. Persepolis was going to start another global financial crisis, and his personal saving wouldn&#39;t even be able to buy him a new soccer ball in a few months.

This Berserker was a menace. They had to be stopped.

He hurried along the stairs to catch up with Caster, just in time to hear the tail end of his lecture.

&#39;Aim for the Master.&#39; He repeated after them. &#39;Isn&#39;t it a given then, that they&#39;d go for me too? If I leave now, it&#39;s going to be the two of them against you. What kind of Master would I be to leave you alone?&#39; He squared his shoulders, unwilling to budge.

&#39;However, if I stay, I can be the perfect distraction you need to get to their Master. Don&#39;t underestimate the importance of having a decoy!&#39; He lectured Aratron back.

As Szrac stepped outside to join his servant, however, he was alerted to the distant footsteps along the path. Twisting his neck, he would soon be alerted to the source - two figures, walking up the steps to the manor. 

No doubt, two intruders who sought to claim their bounty.

<strong>&quot;It appears in this instance, you are proven correct.&quot;</strong> The cyborg growled, turning to look at Berserker. <strong>&quot;Ready yourself. I doubt they are here for idle chatter.&quot;</strong>

It took a few seconds before he too noticed them, and he was thoroughly… unimpressed. They only appeared to be two ne’er-do-wells, incapable of even making a dent into his glorious estate.

“They appear to only be capable of, Szrac. I’m unsure they will even pose a serious threat,” Berserker said. Even saying that felt generous, unbefitting of his legend. One of them looked to be no older than twenty, a young and probably reckless child who had never seen an actual fight, let alone battle. 

But the older one, that one looked serious. This was no doubt the stronger of the two, perhaps a guardian of sorts. A terrible one, though. What kind of overseer would let their charge get in harm&#39;s way?

Before they got much further, they would see Midas lift one of those beefy crossed arms, holding it out in a dramatic fashion towards them. “<strong>Stop.</strong> State your name and your business with the owners of this land before coming any closer. Failure to do so will result in your execution.”

Something about the way he talked indicated it would be himself performing said ‘execution’. Physically he looked no more capable of such acts than a bodybuilder who spent way too much time and money at the gym. However, his mana ‘leakage’ told another tale: either a capable magus, or a Servant.

He looked at his robust frame, rings adorning his fingers, his elongated ears, and decided that he wasn&#39;t human.

&#39;Hello!&#39; He smiled. &#39;You must be a Servant. Can you get Szrac over here? We&#39;re here to kick his butt.&#39; He asked bluntly and excitedly, even as Midas threatened to crush him with his immense mana alone. Was he a dunce or was he playing dumb? Tapio straightened his back and folded his arms, striking one of Aratron&#39;s favorite poses albeit to a much lesser effect. 

&#39;Quickly now, our itinerary is packed.&#39; He urged the King on. &#39;Or you can fetch us an umbrella while we wait...&#39; He broke his pose temporarily to shake beads of water out of his hair.

&quot;New rule: Do not leave my side. <em>Ever</em>. We are currently in enemy territory.&quot; Aratron reprimanded the boy, before hearing his reply to his plan. He squinted his eyes a bit, before raising his hand and lightly flicking Tapio on the forehead.

&quot;A decoy is only needed when the main prize is hidden. Since I&#39;m here, they already know that I&#39;m their main threat. I doubt they will follow you, but hmmm,&quot; Aratron stroked his chin for a second, as if formulating a plan in his head. &quot;stay put and wait for my command. It seems like our hosts have noticed us.&quot;

Rain poured over Aratron&#39;s clothes. Droplets slid off gracefully from his attire as he barely appeared wet. A barely noticeable shroud of mana was keeping the rain away from him. An odd flex, but perhaps he was doing so in response to Midas&#39; own aura. He was gauging Berserker&#39;s own mana reserves and comparing them to his.

Aratron frowned.

&quot;The aura that this Servant is exuding is more powerful than most. I wasn&#39;t wrong to expect heavy resistance.&quot; Aratron muttered, making sure Tapio could hear. The boy needed to understand the severity of the situation.

Of course, Tapio responded by taunting Midas instead.

&quot;....&quot; Aratron remained silent, thinking about the long talk he would need to have with Tapio after all this was done. Bond or not, he was still far off from being a proper Master.

&quot;I suppose there&#39;s no point in hiding it further.&quot; Caster spoke up as he slowly dragged Tapio back by the collar and stared at Midas. &quot;I am Caster, and this is my student. Judging from your lack of a steed, I can safely assume that you aren&#39;t Rider. Are you perhaps Berserker, then?&quot; He prodded Midas immediately.</span>

Speak of the devil, and he shall appear? It seemed almost too good to be true, to have the target of their ire simply arrive to greet them.

Well, best to not worry. After all, this gifted horse was simply too great to look in the mouth.

<strong>&quot;No. Die.&quot;</strong> Szrac snarled in response to Aratron&#39;s question, his magical circuits flaring to life. The gutter that adorned the roof of the mansion tore itself free, ripping itself apart into a dozen different shards, before launching each one like a javelin towards Caster and Tapio. A cruel and vicious attack, one with little cause or reason. However, that only added to the efficiency.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Berserker winced at the sound of metal creaking, bending apart until torn to pieces by Szrac. That was theoretical money down the drain, all in an attempt to strike the first blow against Caster. It would be wonderful if it worked, but surviving the first few eliminations of a war shows that one is perhaps not entirely stupid.

And this blasted rain. Constant droplets rained down onto his hair and threatened to obstruct his hearing, only stopped by the constant flicking every other second. That utter buffoon coming out was a concern as well, but unfortunately he doubted his enemies would consider a parley until the sky stopped its crying.

Thus, his only courses of action were to either wait to see if Szrac’s assault would prove deadly enough the first time around, or to finish what he would be starting. The former considered his master a perfect shot, while the latter would prove that this would be no easy victory.

Midas went with the latter, like any smart person would. While pellets of gold flew towards his opponents, he readied himself for the long run ahead. It took only a few seconds before he was off, running down the pair like a bull in the ring. 

And thanks to his Golden Rule, he seemed… faster than one of his stature ought to be. It wouldn’t be long before the distance was closed and his decree would be executed. The target was Caster, and his attack was a tackle. How could such foolish people survive this onslaught?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Szrac&#39;s lack of a reply was a reply of its own. A manor turned to gold. A suspicious lack of Lancer&#39;s presence. The dots were easy to connect.

They really were just steps away from winning the Grail War.

Szrac launched his golden shards with clear killing intent. Each of those was like a spear aimed to one&#39;s heart. He was brutal, efficient and didn&#39;t waste time on games.

Which is why he was utterly befuddled when Caster just stared the projectiles down. Instead of retaining their sharpness, the gold daggers started to turn brittle and frail. Their texture changed to something more gray and stone-like. A far cry from the resplendent gold from a few seconds ago. Aratron then simply raised his hand as the pellets crumbled to dust.

Petrification. Far more powerful than the one Szrac had witnessed back at the market.

&quot;I can hardly afford holding back now, if this is the hospitality you give me, Szrac Vaughn. I let you leave unharmed in our first encounter because of the crowd around us. There are no such limitations now.&quot; Aratron replied with a disdainful glare.

<em>&quot;After all, this might be my last opponent.&quot;</em> Caster thought begrudgingly. While dealing with Szrac might be simple, he was actually worried about his Servant. The mana concentration within those golden pellets was odd. It felt stronger than the average enchantment...

He wouldn&#39;t have the time to think about it, as Midas proceeded to charge at him like a raging bull.

&quot;Student, on second thought, the decoy plan is acceptable!&quot; Aratron quickly shouted out before taking Midas&#39; blow head on. The two were propelled elsewhere, colliding with some nearby street lamps and golden bushes as Aratron coughed sand. At least his Master was safe and far away.

Meaning that this next blow would <em>hurt.</em></span>

&quot;...Greco-Roman attire. A crown. A golden manor. Interesting.&quot; Aratron muttered as Midas felt his body suddenly restrained. Three gigantic rings were wrapped around his body, resembling hula hoops as he felt the scorching of various elements around him. One ring was of fire, one of ice and the other of earth.

&quot;Unfortunately, Berserker, I never saw the appeal in toying with wild game such as yourself. Perish like the beast you are. <strong>Rings of Galileo!</strong>&quot; Aratron screamed as the rings threatened to simultaneously freeze, burn and crush Midas&#39; body like a fat pig. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio was so used to being handled like luggage that he didn&#39;t even bat an eye when Aratron unceremoniously dragged him back by the collar. Now that he was further away from Midas, he finally saw the human-sized Tin Can moseying behind his Servant&#39;s frame. 

And that was all he got to see. Gold shards rained down on them like deadly hail, then fell apart as Caster turned them into stone. Szrac&#39;s magic trick turned out to be completely futile in the presence of Caster&#39;s petrification. 

However, that was only the appetizer. Berserker charged at Caster at an inhuman speed, knocking Tapio to the side with wind pressure alone as he tackled Aratron into the street. Tapio only had a moment to digest Caster&#39;s multitude of orders. His face twisted into a frown. 

&#39;Make up your mind faster next time, Caster! Before our enemies make it for us.&#39; He complained out loud, but there was no masking the flush in his cheeks. Aratron had agreed to his plan! This had to the biggest achievement he&#39;d made yet. And now he had to see it through so as not to disappoint his Servant.

&#39;I liked your old Servant better,&#39; He turned to face Szrac. &#39;He looked cooler. Had a sword and everything. Still not as cool as mine, though!&#39; He bragged, then took a few deliberate steps away from where Caster and Berserker had landed. Would Szrac follow even though he&#39;d heard Tapio&#39;s primitive plan of playing decoy? Or would he ignore the idiot master and gun down Caster together with his Servant?

<strong>&quot;Any hospitality between us is nothing more than a figment of your perverse imagination.&quot;</strong> Szrac replied curtly to Aratron, watching as Midas surged forth to do battle against Caster. It was evident from their earlier exchange that his metallurgy would be incapable of matching the servant&#39;s grasp of petrification. Therefore, it was time for the second option.

When a rabid dog was wreaking havoc, you pulled upon his chain. 

Obviously, Tapio was there to act as a scapegoat, to prevent a disadvantageous two-against-one scenario. However, a decoy only worked when the distraction was unimportant. If the master died, the servant would soon follow. Therefore, the answer was obvious.

<strong>&quot;Shut up. I have no patience for idiots who do nothing but babble.&quot;</strong> The cyborg stated plainly, approaching Tapio. Like a serpent striking their prey, Szrac lurched forth, aiming to catch the lesser magus by the throat with his arm. A quick and brutal move, and one that would all but ensure a swift victory should it land.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There was good AND bad news. The good news was that Midas had succeeded in his opening attack. Two servants went through the front yard and back, past the golden shrubbery and even a stray lamp post or two. At the end of his charge, Berserker simply let go and let the Caster fall to the ground.

Bad news: he was currently in great danger, three rings threatening to absolutely eviscerate him. Scorching flames threatened to burn his skin and frame to a burning crisp, which was a much different feeling of the biting cold currently freezing his other appendages. Thankfully, the third one just dug into his skin and tried to go for the tried-and-true method of absolute crushing power. 

His first reaction was to grab onto whichever wring bound his arms, but they couldn’t bend that far without breaking entirely. That would be a last ditch effort should Caster prove more capable than binding him and watching Berserker squirm. 

Next, brute force.

His grunts and groans didn’t add much, but it was hard to keep a straight face when you were in danger of simply dying straight away. Not even his Golden Rule was much help against something nearly akin to a Noble Phantasm.

All hope seemed lost immediately, until he felt that at least one of them was giving way. He pushed harder, stretching himself to the absolute maximum of his strength. Just a little more…

There! Stone cracked, giving way to the King. Dozens of shards scattered into the street as the bottom ring could stand him no more. The relief was immense, but some other rings or so still remained. Open to attacks, but at least his arms were a little more free to grab and touch things than before. He went to grab onto the next ring above, seeking to end this little charade currently going on.

“A pity you chose death. Your Master will miss you greatly,” he said, staring daggers into the other servant. His blood was starting to boil over.

Rock crumbled first, as Midas was now slightly freer and ready to tear down ice next. No shackles could hold him.

He raised his head, deciding to stare at Caster in the eye in order to show them their upcoming demise. First, his rings. Then, Caster&#39;s body. He would tear it to pieces, before turning it into a grandiose golden sta--

Midas had failed to account for something: The rings weren&#39;t designed to kill them. No, it would have been incredibly lucky if they did. They were designed to <strong>distract him.</strong>

Caster had already moved upwards, having erected a gigantic pillar and now covering the sun as he raised his arms upwards. Midas saw the sky change, from a rainy overcast to a resplendent brown, almost as bright as his very own gold. The sun was no longer around, instead replaced by a gigantic planet with a ring around it.

&quot;Unfortunately for you, I have been given orders to no longer hold back. Fear my fight. My fury. My <em>godliness!</em>&quot; Midas could sense it. Aratron&#39;s divine aura. He wasn&#39;t dealing with just any Heroic Spirit...

He would get even further proof as Aratron soon shed his mortal shell. Wings erupted from his back. His head multiplied, to the point it was no longer human. He was like a gigantic hydra, the beast of myth...</span>

It was now separated into grids...ten, twenty, no, forty. Over forty grids were all around him, making the environment look like a gigantic chessboard.

&quot;Destruction...<strong>Approved.</strong> By the wrath of Saturn, here ends thy life, Berserker!&quot; Aratron shouted, as Midas felt scorching heat coming from the grids around him. They were turning into...magma? No, worse than that. Miniature volcanoes! Caster had somehow managed to replicate the chemical reaction of an eruption and channeled that raw energy in 12 grids!

&quot;Burn to cinders! <strong>Arbatel Saturn!</strong>&quot; The giant, dragonic beast shouted as the volcanoes aimed at Midas like cannons. Streams of magma imbued with mana collided with the Berserker&#39;s body, threatening to melt him alive. The rings were still on him, keeping him restrained in an effort to prevent him from deflecting the blast or moving away. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span></span>

&#39;Nope! Don&#39;t feel like it.&#39; He shook his head. The first task of a successful decoy was to get the enemy&#39;s attention, and the second was to hold out as a decoy for as long as possible. Ergo, avoid getting caught. Everything would become moot if he went from a decoy to a hostage. 

Tapio had fulfilled the first task with flying colors, but what about the second? 

He matched each step Szrac took towards him with two of his own, but Szrac still outpaced him greatly. A rat cast under the penumbra of the mercenary&#39;s mental shell, with nowhere to hide, nowhere to go...

But down!

As Szrac launched himself forward, Tapio ducked. He grounded himself on all fours, making an even smaller target of himself to evade Szrac&#39;s line of sight. The ground shimmered as raindrops collected into puddles. Tapio threw himself forward with a solid kick to the ground, sliding along the golden path like an amusement park ride as he sought to get away from Szrac.

The sky grew dark behind him. Tapio&#39;s heart rate spiked in that instant, churning out mana to fill an invisible void in the pit of his stomach. For a moment he forgot where he was, then the roar of the dragon jolted him awake. Tapio reached under his cloak and removed a few dice from his pouch.

Oh how he wanted to watch Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm... Tapio lamented as he scratched out the runes on the dice, then closed his eyes and threw them at the ground in front of Szrac&#39;s feet. Light erupted as the bounded fields on the dice eroded; the golden ground became the perfect reflector and surrounded the mercenary in pillars of light that was several degrees brighter than the midday sun.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Mayhaps Berserker had underestimated his opponent. If he was capable of thinking ahead maybe he wouldn’t be in this mess to begin with. Caster was no longer there, but above. Hanging in the sky like the gods of old, his own pantheon. Instead of Mount Olympus, however, there was a new sun. Saturn itself. It only served as the backdrop for the grandiose form of Caster: a winged hydra. 

Midas renewed his efforts to break these cursed disks, grabbing hold of the one lower first. He had to do a weird kneel-slash-bend-backwards to achieve it, but fortunately the deed was done. He gripped the ring, and started to pull. This one was marginally easier to do, thanks to the stone ring no longer binding him as hard.

Elements merged with a different element, weakening the ring all together. Within a few moments, he would be free to move as he--

Oh. Volcanoes. Great.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">It started to burn. The ring of hellfire was the least of his worries now, with the real deal bearing down on him. If it weren’t for his increased Endurance he would surely be a popsicle on the ground right now. Even then, he was eating far too many streams of it to last more than ten seconds if this continued on.

With one final pull, the bottom ring had been destroyed. Crushed to smithereens like the last one. Now it was just his arms being restrained. Arguably the least important thing in the current situation. When he was done here, he was going to show that godly figure a thing or two about strength and power.

That would have to wait. First, not dying. As soon as his lower body was free to move around, he bolted away from those tubes of fiery death. Clothes still aflame, his shirt no longer even being considered an article of clothing. Ashen remains tainted his tanned skin a dark mixture of the two, rippling muscles disjointed by the slight beer belly right below. 

All the while his right hand went to grab the other blasted ring. It took a few tries, contorting his arm in a seemingly unnatural way before he got hold of it. 

“You hear me, Caster?!” he screamed to the heavens above, spittle flying from his mouth. “Gods serve no place among the ranks of men! Your time of superiority is over! Roll over and <strong>die</strong> like the rest of them!”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron merely sneered at Midas&#39; words.

&quot;From your crown, I assume that you must be a king. How would you feel then, knowing that more than 49 provinces pledged their loyalty to me? You&#39;re staring them down yourself.&quot; He narrowed his eyes as Midas realized that his opponent&#39;s Noble Phantasm was a representation of that fact. 49 grids were around him. 49 provinces actively working to undermine a king...

Despicable commoners!

While Midas avoided the trails of lava, he wasn&#39;t out of the woods yet. He was still walking on grids, his mortal enemy. He watched as sudden vegetation spread around him, growing at an alarming rate before trees grew on the soil that he was currently stepping on. They grew so quickly, that trees started stabbing him and impaling him like stakes. He was being raised above, by trees towering over a hundred feet as his steel muscles tried their best to avoid any further lacerations. His vitals were safe and his organs were protected, but he could still feel the pain of having his flesh be slashed at by robust trees.

His opponent was using earth&#39;s own elements against him. The very ground was fighting back!

&quot;I serve no one, except humanity. Humans whose gifts are humble live peacefully under my protection. Your attitude and lavish manor tells me that you are anything but that.&quot; Aratron growled. &quot;Then perish in ash, Berserker! This is no place for an unruly king!&quot;

The dragonic creature proceeded to fire a beam of lava at Midas from one of its many mouths. Being restrained by branches and having his arms trapped by a disc was incredibly tedious. Infuriating, even. At this point, a direct hit wouldn&#39;t be surprising.

However, Midas noticed two important things during his scuffle with Caster. One, it had stopped raining, as if Saturn itself was a planet devoid of rain. Two, it seemed like Caster&#39;s Noble Phantasm only worked on targets within the 49 grids... <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Just like any other despicable vermin, this one was proving obnoxiously slippery, ducking under his grasp before scurrying away. It seemed he was using the puddles beneath as some kind of accelerator for his escape. How annoying. Rain truly was an irritating thing.

However, this changed nothing. It was in the nature of a pest to run, to try and avoid those who wished it dead, to eke out a few more miserable seconds of life at any costs. In the end, they would still die, and their previous life stopped mattering. All that this foolish display of cowardice did that further stoke the flames of Szrac&#39;s disdain, one that continued to grow larger with each passing moment.

And then, the sky darkened, and in the distance, a roar. Another of Caster&#39;s familiars, like that pathetic gargoyle? No, this one was different. The air had changed, as though it had suddenly been flooded in excess mana. Then, a Noble Phantasm? 

As the cyborg pondered what could be occurring between Midas and Aratron, Tapio set to work, tossing his arcane dice at the feet of Szrac,  before they exploded forth into shining light. Any heat they may have produced did little against his plated metal exterior, but the brightness managed to pierce through the lenses of his suit and blind him, forcing his eyes shut.

However, he did not thrash or flail about wildly, as a fool might. No, just because he was blind, did not mean he was without the ability to sense his foe. Instead, the cyborg quietly increased the sensitivity of his hearing apparatus, to better gauge Tapio&#39;s next move. Of course, that would only work if he was idiotic enough to make sound.

That meant it was a foolproof plan.

<strong>&quot;You think your parlor tricks are capable of defeating me? How moronic. You are talentless. You should have died quickly when you had the chance.&quot;</strong>

Lumbering giants sprouted out of the ground and brought him along for the ride. Five, ten, no, dozens of feet up high in the sky. Cutting and stabbing him all the way, He lost his grip on that last ring, watching painfully as the blasted thing kept its form. Worse for wear, but still intact. 

“Shut your mouth, despicable creature! Your <strong>tongue</strong> will catch the sunlight rather well once I change it to gold!” he bellowed, face shaking in frustration. Man, even the taunts were getting the better of him! His pride had so far taken a massive blow, more so than his physical body. All it would take is one forced handshake and this entire charade would be done!

But first, that last ring. He went for it again, wrapping meaty digits around the elements and holding on tightly. His progress continued, but so did the mighty dragon. This time they opted to instead cut the middle man out, directly spewing liquid magma from one of those daunting maws. And it was coming right this way…

He pulled harder on the ring, desperate to break it apart. It was only at the last moment that it complied much like the rest, releasing his arms to their full extent. No longer was he being assaulted on multiple fronts.

Just the one massive front that threatened to kill him outright.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">What to do? Action was needed, and fast. Already the heat was causing quite the sweat, much more than before. A quick scan of his surroundings showed that he was in fact on top of a treacherous tree of terrible towering heights. Yet it also showed perhaps a useful piece of information: those blasted squares eventually stopped. Just a little over yonder, through a few more ‘provinces’. 

And where else to go but down? It would be a descent full of splinters and cuts, but that beat melting. Or burning. Whichever occurred first. With a little more brute force and finangling, he was able to start his long journey down. Fire threatened him at every inch, even his hair starting to singe an awful lot. Burning hair filled his nostrils. Some of the melted rock even left its mark on his back, turning the already hurting skin an awful black. Movement at this point was starting to become a chore. Singed and even hints of burnt flesh was becoming more than a nuisance.

But a slowly building cascade of golden handprints left a trail of his progress. Caster had ridden themselves both of those awful clouds, yet Midas couldn’t help but feel he was the one gaining from this trade off. First, this tree.

Next, each and every single foot of this altered reality.

The king was far more agile than his stature implied, purposefully letting horrific branches and sharp leaves slash at him as he descended down the gigantic plants. He collapsed back to the grinds, worse for wear, but not broken. A mad beast that would not stop: A true Berserker.

Meanwhile, Aratron was actually wondering whether he could keep this up. He was exerting huge amounts of energy and mana by having his Noble Phantasm active. He wondered how Tapio was handling it, before shaking his head.

As long as it meant Berserker&#39;s defeat, it was far from a waste.

He focused back on his opponent, noticing that several golden prints had started to infest his structure of trees. Even worse, Berserker was currently touching one of the trees. The longer he did, the more golden it became, to the point Aratron couldn&#39;t even manipulate said tree anymore. Berserker&#39;s ability turned things to gold on touch, it seemed...

&quot;...Midas.&quot; The dragon muttered while narrowing its eyes. The clues were all there. &quot;A king consumed by greed and power. Humanity would be better off without you!&quot; Aratron growled. His numerous heads aimed towards his target as they proceeded to fire beams of magma in unison. If one head didn&#39;t work, simply increase the number until the manor garden was turned to ichorous earth. <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">All this sliding around, and Tapio&#39;s clothes remained dry and airy. Contrary to Caster who had created a barrier with his mana, the fabric of his clothes simply refused to absorb water. Instead of weighing him down, water acted like a layer of lubricant and propelled him further along the golden path, until he came to a graceful stop in front of some shrubbery that had also been turned into gold.

Even under the dull skylight, Tapio&#39;s eyes hurt from the sheer monotony of the scenery around him. Gold, gold as far as he could see! It was quite the odd aesthetic even for an aristocrat, but Tapio couldn&#39;t complain now. Had the ground remained tarmac and soil, he wouldn&#39;t have slipped away so easily.

Besides, even Szrac himself seemed to have fallen prey to his surroundings. The mercenary stopped in its tracks, evidently stunned by the light Tapio had released from his dice. Tapio took Szrac&#39;s inaction as an absolute success. There was only so much a giant suit of armor could do without vision, after all.

&#39;I don&#39;t need to defeat you, silly. I just gotta distract you long enough for Caster to get through your Berserker.&#39; Tapio chided Szrac as if he had asked something totally inane. &#39;And don&#39;t call me talentless when I know that already. What you should do is air out your armor more. You sound even more depressed than Caster.&#39;

Tapio stuck out his tongue at Szrac, then turned tail and ran towards the mansion. Szrac may be a huge bully, but he was human just like him. Tapio still remembered Aratron&#39;s vow to never lay a finger on humans. He was determined to not get in the way this time round.

Szrac&#39;s held pivoted slightly, tracking the sound of Tapio&#39;s taunt. The boy began to run, but now that the cyborg had got a lock on him, it was too late. He heard the footsteps upon the gold-stained floor, the shifting of fabric as it fluttered about in the wind. Even as the flash of light began to fade from his eyes, he was already calculating his next move.

<strong>&quot;You believe your Caster will best Berserker? How inane. Your delusions of grandeur have no place here.&quot;</strong> The magus snorted, surging after the boy like a famished dog that caught the scent of cooking meat. His metal arm was extended like a sickled talon of a hawk, intent on ripping out the neck of their prey. Tapio may have been more nimble than the lumbering cybernetic titan, but Szrac made up for it in terms of raw, overwhelming power. Such was the case when one&#39;s legs were aided by industrial grade pistons, and driven by hate.

The vermin ran towards the manor, a foolish move. Now that it had been reforged in Midas&#39; gold, it&#39;s existence became akin to a death trap to any intruder. As if to prove this point, the cyborg channeled his metallurgy once more, tearing a few golden bricks from the exterior and flinging them at Tapio with intent to concuss.

Tapio wasn&#39;t sure what he was hearing anymore, the sound of Szrac&#39;s footsteps or the beating of his heart. He felt reasonably warm despite only running a few dozen steps. Strange. Or was it really?

Somehow, without seeing it through his eyes, he knew what Caster was doing. At least, the ramifications of their actions. Aratron was drawing a sizable amount of mana from him, and his body started working harder to compensate. There was a jolt in his stomach as well as his artificial circuits spun up to support his own mana reserves. 

Tapio felt like a well-oiled machine, each part humming in unison as they pumped out mana and fed them down the bottomless drain that was his Servant. He wasn&#39;t just mindlessly wasting it on himself. He had a purpose.

It made him proud.

&#39;I don&#39;t want to hear that from someone who lives in a house of gold.&#39; The boy retorted as he clambered up the stairs. Szrac aimed to put him down, and he felt compelled to reciprocate. &#39;You&#39;re already living the life of a fairytale, yet you still seek the Holy Grail. You even summoned <em>two</em> Servants when everyone else only had one. That&#39;s pretty crazy if you ask m-&#39;

Tapio heard wind behind him. He whipped around just in time for a few lumps of gold to enter his vision. Tapio instinctively cowered, but he was too late-

<em><strong>THWACK!!!</strong></em>

One brick lodged itself square in the side of his head before bouncing off, while another drove itself into his chest, knocking the wind out of him. Tapio staggered in his steps, then lost his balance and collapsed at the top of the staircase.

&#39;...&#39;

&#39;As I was saying.&#39;

Tapio&#39;s annoying voice flared back to life in Szrac&#39;s audio feed. The boy stirred, then sat up like a small zombie. His head looked intact, and so were his ribs by the way he talked. The brick fell into his lap, then clattered to the ground as the boy hopped back onto his feet.

There didn&#39;t even seem to be a scratch on him. Fortification magecraft, or something far more advanced? Could Tapio actually be...competent?

Szrac would quickly dismiss that thought as the boy claimed the brick, then kicked off the staircase and dived for him. &#39;An eye for an eye!&#39; He yelled as he brought the brick down on the mercenary&#39;s helmet.

After this was all said and done, maybe destroying some local fauna was in order. Show Gaea who really was the boss around here.

For now, he would have to do with this creature of legend. Already another barrage of lava was coming forth-- no, make that numerous streams. A certified frontal assault rivaling even the zealous Zeus was Trying to fix the problem of him being alive. At least this time they were being honest about the endeavor.

Yet the time for passivity was over. A challenge of seeing who would be worn out first, himself or Caster’s mana reservoir, wasn’t one he was keen to take on. And running outside the range of this Noble Phantasm was cowardice. No, his only choice was to try and take back the offensive. 

The first course of action was a weapon. All that remained in the area right before the lava hit was the golden tree currently in front of him, pointy branches a plenty.

Perfect.

Midas wasted no time, walking back towards the tree he had grown too acquainted with and taking twisted revenge by prying off three bulkier, lengthy appendages. They snapped easily, no longer held together by fibers and vascular bundles but instead pure metal alone. With one makeshift spear held underneath his armpit and the others firmly in his hands, he was ready to wage war.</span>

Typical of any Divine being. That should’ve been his target long ago, in the mountains and plains of Greece.

And much like a god, they chose to spare no expense in making sure they removed the problem. This was certainly going to hurt, the area a certified sauna at this point. Berserker’s newfound speed would be put to the test here, either allowing him to survive the assault or not enough to escape the tomb.

For the most part, it was. Each beam was certainly scary, creating hard to dodge scenarios that required even more bits and pieces to splash down. It was impossible to dodge it all without further increases to his base parameters. That’s all it was, however, that made contact: bits and pieces. Brushed away as if no more than droplets of boiling water on his skin than anything else. 

Exposure to new squares was not an enjoyable prospect, but any created obstacles could be used to supply himself with more ammunition for this assault certainly approaching. Yes, it was nearly time...

And of course, he had another <em>&quot;witty&quot;</em> comment to back up his escape from a slow death.

However, while he proved victorious in the duel of clever commentary, his victory in combat was less assured. The golden brick slammed against the steel head of Szrac, only to completely crumple, as though he had swung a soda can and not a lump of metal. Perhaps trying to attack the metal magician with more metal wasn&#39;t the greatest idea.

<strong>&quot;I do not require the critique of the dead.&quot;</strong> Szrac replied simply, eyeing Tapio with the utmost contempt. His iron gauntlet seemed to shift and warble for a moment, before the exterior shell dragged itself forth, sharpening into a razor-sharp blade. It was akin to the claw of a mantis, if it were ten times more lethal, and attached to someone more cold-blooded than an insect. 

Aiming to skewer the lesser magus, the cyborg aimed his newfound blade and thrust it forth, aiming to stab him through the torso and mangle his insides.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron watched as Midas regained his bearings. The initial surprise of the Noble Phantasm had worn off, with the golden king having understood the mechanisms that made Caster&#39;s trump card work. As long as he was within the grids, he was at Aratron&#39;s mercy.

But it was still a fact that Aratron&#39;s mana reserves were rather limited. A Caster was only at their peak when fighting inside of their workshop. However, Caster was currently inside enemy territory. Not only that, but his mana source was Tapio, who was a far cry from an adept magus. In a battle of stamina, Aratron wouldn&#39;t last.

Midas knew this well, hence why he decided to go on the offensive. If he had known that bonding resulted in Servants gaining so much power, he might have asked Szrac to do it as well. Not that his Master would trust him to that extent, of course.

This was his biggest advantage: He wasn&#39;t tied down to his Master&#39;s mana supply. He couldn&#39;t be as explosive as Aratron, but he could definitely last longer. It was just a matter of waiting the Servant out and repurposing his materials as golden weapons...</span>

Aratron knew this well. After all, Midas was dodging his streams of liquified magma with ease. His speed did not befit his size, and he had never heard of Midas being the athletic type in myth. Come to think of it, if Midas has been so strong, why did Szrac bother wasting time extorting valuables and riches from the commoners near the church?

The pieces were coming together.

The golden manor. The trees turning into gold. Szrac bothering to only collect gold and valuables over items with practical values. <strong>Wealth was somehow linked to Midas&#39; strength.</strong>

&quot;Your affairs involved extorting the poor, and now you even go after the rich. Your fingers are more poisonous than my fiery breath.&quot; Aratron lamented, staring at his trees being corrupted by the golden touch.

&quot;But I have come to bring judgment to you, Midas. Judgment to a beast under the guise of man!&quot; 

As Aratron roared, Midas felt the ground quiver. New creations were emerging from the tiles, but they were far less...static, than he had hoped.</span>

Familiars had spawned. Some with wings. Some crawling on all fours. Some looking almost identical to ancient warriors were it not for their terracotta complexion. Seven familiars had emerged, all with different traits and characterics.

They were all weak, of course. Individually, none of them were a match for a Servant. Together, however, they were more than the sum of their parts...

The terracotta warrior lunged at Midas, stopping him in his tracks with his stone blades. They were nothing compared to his golden lance, of course, but his purpose was merely to serve as a roadblock.

The other familiar was far more gelatinous, proceeding to drench Midas&#39; legs in goo before solidifying. He was now trapped on a tile as his newfound speed was rendered useless.

But he still had his strength! These restraints were nothing compared to the three hula hoops he had endured just minutes ago. He would crush these two familiars, then move onward--

&quot;Bethor, Phaleg, Och, Hagith, Ophiel, Phul...<strong>Aratron.</strong> Have you ever heard of the Olympian spirits? They are from beyond your time...&quot; Aratron muttered as a third familiar appeared on Midas&#39; back, restraining him with all four limbs as said limbs proceeded to morph into steel shackles. He was being chained like a dog.

&quot;Galaxies are our veins. Our pulse beacons the planets. There is no room for evil in the cosmos of our life!&quot; Aratron growled, his magma surging as his rocky, dragonic exterior was now blazing like a sun in supernova.

Midas was completely restrained now. He wondered if Aratron planned this so he could get a direct shot in. How futile: These restraints were just about as weak as the tree and the three discs! He would escape, and he would d--

Aratron&#39;s heads stopped aiming at the ground. Instead, they raised themselves upwards and stared at the far beyond. Midas&#39; eyes followed suit, as he shivered once he realized Aratron&#39;s new target.

&quot;If you truly love your riches...<strong>Then you can mourn them!</strong>&quot; Aratron shouted, firing five beams of concentrated magma at the manor. Turns out, that a immobile object is a far better target than a king with insane speed. If his theory proved to be correct, then destroying Midas&#39; riches would greatly weaken the king himself.

Tapio and Szrac would witness a rain of magma coming straight towards them. It was directed towards the manor, but they might still get caught in the aftermath. Aratron was trusting Tapio to stay out of harm&#39;s way.

Midas himself would feel distraught. How dare this insolent pest go after his hard earned gold?! This was an offense too grave to be forgiven... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

He&#39;d expected this. The rain of shrapnel, the stray bricks out of nowhere, everything clued him in on Szrac&#39;s expertise. Something to do with gold, he was certain of it. Otherwise, he couldn&#39;t fathom how anyone would find a golden manor appealing outside of storybooks. 

Which meant his plan to smack the mercenary silly was nothing short of suicide. How would Tapio, who couldn&#39;t even erect a proper bounded field without external help, hope to beat Szrac at his own game?

<em>CLANG.</em>

Tapio hung onto Szrac regardless, still whacking him with what was left of the shriveled brick. Damage aside, he sure was making a hell lot of noise and turning the helmet into an impromptu drum set. 

<em>CLANG.</em>

&#39;Ouch. You&#39;re not very good at making friends, huh.&#39; He commented dryly, then raised his arm for another strike-

Unfortunately, his streak ended there. Tapio didn&#39;t even have time to blink before he felt something sharp on his stomach. Szrac had transformed his dull metal gauntlet into a blade, then drilled it into the pest on top of him and planned to end this farce once and for all.

The tip of the blade connected and tore the boy off of him, yet Szrac missed that satisfying feedback of metal tearing through flesh and bone. An odd resistance was all his sensors had managed to pick up, and as if to reaffirm his suspicion, the boy looked up with a wide grin, not a hint of hurt on his face. Like a cockroach that refused to die, he grabbed onto Szrac&#39;s arm like a monkey bar, completely disregarding the blade as he dug his hands into its sharpened edge without a care in the world. He climbed, then swung himself back onto Szrac&#39;s shoulders.

I don&#39;t think your Servant is doing so good-uh.&#39;

His eyes widened as the multi-headed dragon turned their maws in his direction, scorching hot lava and all. Much to Aratron&#39;s chagrin, Tapio&#39;s first thought was that he had done something wrong and incurred the wrath of his Servant.  As much as he was willing to place blind trust in Caster&#39;s plan, the primal fear incited by witnessing one of nature&#39;s disasters wasn&#39;t something to be dispelled with words alone. 

Tapio hammered Szrac&#39;s helmet, as if he hadn&#39;t already caught their full attention already.

&#39;Run, run!&#39; He urged him on. &#39;Go left, no, up!&#39;

No matter what he did, Tapio seemed to simply not die. He was beaten, bludgeoned, and stabbed, but he seemed to simply shrug it off and make another oh-so-witty comment. Did he lack the dignity to die quickly? He had no chance of attaining victory, yet he clung to his sleeve like an unwanted stain instead of simply giving up. 

However, while he was managing to avoid any real harm, the boy wasn&#39;t doing much damage in return. His fists did little in terms of damage to the Iron Sarcophagus, barely even denting the steel exoskeleton. At this rate, the passage of time and natural erosion was doing more damage than he was. If only he had a powerful spell strong enough to melt through it, like a giant blast of magma.

Like one of the five currently soaring towards Midas&#39; manor.

<strong>&quot;Curious. It seems that your servant is more psychopathic than mine.&quot;</strong> Szrac simply stated. It was a complete insane attack, to destroy an entire manor in some vain attempt to weaken Berserker. To cause such wanton property damage, not to mention risking the lives of the scientists and engineers still inside, was hardly a heroic endeavor.

Then again, Szrac did not care.

<strong>&quot;Running is for the fearful. Your mass murdering psychopath does not scare me. I will prove such to you.&quot;</strong> The cyborg explained. With Tapio still clinging to his shoulders, Szrac turned and began sprinting towards the source of the magma beams. 

It was time for this farce to end.

Unforgivable.

A line had been crossed. Reason and logic had so far been <em>somewhat</em> prevalent in his course of actions. After all, it would’ve done no good to simply flail around earlier while being burnt or melted alive. However, Caster was throwing out the dirty blows, and this one landed right below the belt.

Once the course of action had been started, there was no going back. Midas flopped flat on his back, preparing himself to be pushed to the outermost of his physical limits. Legs and arms raised, block still firmly attached and shackles hanging on. 

And he slammed them down. <strong>Hard</strong>.

Without any time to recover, his muscles retracted and relaxed with another SLAM. Arms followed suit, instead above his head. There was no point trying to save his riches: those were a forgotten dream at this point. Already he could feel his Golden Rule starting to subtract from his power.</span>

His strength was still intact. It showed, cracks forming in the block faster than they had. Shackles were touched by the tips of his fingers, enough to start the process of material change. 

Before he knew it the block of gel had been broken, smashed to bits and pieces beyond recognition. Iron chains were close to following suit, nearly changed in their entirety. He pulled, harder than he had ever done so before. Better than in Greece. Better than in his castle.

Better than even the gods.

Cracks formed, a web of breaks and stressors that branched out until those too could stand no more. All the connectors lost their support, bending to his will like everyone else had done before. Mostly everyone, at least. This Caster would soon <em><strong>kneel</strong></em> like every good subject would

Once the things restricting him were gone once again, he was back on his feet. Everything felt sluggish, like molasses had been poured all inside his limbs. There was no time to reminisce about that, though. It was time to finally launch his first attack.

From the ground, he grabbed both remaining spears. The third one had lodged itself nicely into that stone soldier a minute before, fragmented beyond use. And he took a crude stance, first spear at the ready. Left arm aiming, right one throwing.

 One step, then two, three, four-- and the spear was airborne.

If his mansion had been an easy target, so too was the beast hell bent on destroying it. An eye for an eye, so to speak. Already the next one was being aimed, the time for gloating and taunting over.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The manor was now burning, magma having started to melt its golden exterior as Szrac&#39;s scientists sensed the scorching heat and proceeded to start fire emergency procedures. The metal man didn&#39;t know whether Caster was naive or shrewd: Those magma pellets lacked explosive power, focusing more on corroding the manor than blowing it up. This meant that it was a slow destruction, slow enough for the staff inside to evacuate.

Of course, this meant that Midas had time before he completely lost the perks of his Golden Rule. Enough time to incapacitate the remaining Olympian familiars and take aim at Aratron...

Caster felt something pierce his dragonic form. Truth be told, his gigantic form was akin to a giant target, despite all the additional defenses that came with it. It made him invulnerable to weaker Classes of course, but against Berserkers? His armor might as well be made out of tissue paper.

The golden spear stabbed him straight in the chest, or whatever could be considered a chest in that hive of hydra-like heads. The beasts screamed in unison, feeling the sharp end of Midas&#39; weapon of choice. Pain coursed through Aratron&#39;s body as he felt his attachment to the mortal realm being threatened.

But it was just pain. Fleeting and temporary. He knew that his body could do more, that it was not bound by the shackles of flesh, and instead cradled by immovable stone.</span>

&quot;Just one spear, Berserker? Fool! If you plan on striking me down, you should have brought at least seven!&quot; Aratron growled. With the manor dying a slow death, he could now fully refocus on his primary target. Midas watched as the bodies of the destroyed familiars sunk back into the earth. A sign that something else was coming.

As he aimed his second spear, he immediately felt something else that was sharp penetrate his back. He turned around, but the projectile had vanished. All that remained was the wound, a bloody patch on his back.

The same thing happened again, as his leg was struck by something razor sharp and painful. He stared down, but just like before, he only found his wound.

These projectiles weren&#39;t too damaging, but they were far from painless. Enough of those could probably put him out of commission. His main worry, however, was where they were coming from?

He understood once he inspected his wounds closely, realizing that water dripped from his flesh. His face instantly turned pale as he was now close to his mortal enemy.

&quot;Your golden touch works extremely well with solids. But tell me, can it match the changing of elements?&quot; Aratron taunted, as another projectile fired. This time, Midas could see it quite well, since it stabbed him in the chest.

An icicle.

Before he could even pull it out, it melted at an incredibly fast rate, leaving only a shirt drenched in water. He could feel his power fading...

&quot;<strong>But can you even touch something that you cannot grasp?</strong>&quot;

The first three blows were to test. The next three blows would be to press. The last blow would settle it all. Seven strikes, just what Aratron liked.</span>

Once Midas realized Caster&#39;s plan, the latter had no reason to hold back anymore. The grids now launched icy spheres and spears towards their target, hoping to crush his bones, penetrate his skin and most importantly, prevent him from striking back at Caster. Caster didn&#39;t seem to be aware of Midas&#39; inherent weakness to water, but his theory of him being averse to mutable materials seemed to be rather correct. Just what you would expect from a master alchemist.

&quot;Did you think that only stone and metal could form sharp edges? Don&#39;t presume so much, na&#239;ve mortal!&quot; Aratron growled as an icicle stabbed Midas&#39; spear throwing arm. The fourth blow.

&quot;Under the correct conditions, <strong>grass can split flesh and water can shatter gold!</strong> Remember that in Hell!&quot; Even in battle, Caster was prone to lecturing. Tapio would most likely groan if he had the chance to hear his words in action.

As he gave Midas one last lesson, the fifth shard of ice proceeded to pierce Midas&#39; foot while simultaneously embedding itself in the ground. His movement was now impaired. The fifth blow.

Only two strikes left... <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span> <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;...No. I think you meant <em>stronger</em>. Why are you so difficult? Just admit it already.&#39; Tapio retaliated. Naturally, he had no idea what Szrac was getting at. Who would be willing to room with someone like him, anyway?

Behind them, the mansion melted under the sheer heat of the lava jets like ice cream that had met hot fudge. Szrac wasted no time in securing his escape, and Tapio clung onto him for dear life as he steered them both away from the molten gold. It was taking all he had just to stay on the Tin Can. His limbs felt like jello and his stomach started to burn as if he&#39;d eaten a full plate of chili peppers. 

Unlike some Servants who possessed Noble Phantasms that could burst down their opponents in an instant, Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm was more akin to running a marathon. It sought to overwhelm its enemies until they could no longer keep up with its ever morphing reality. So long as the Noble Phantasm was active, Aratron was nigh invincible. So long as they kept toying with its captives, Arbatel Saturn would continue to require mana equivalent to firing off multiple Noble Phantasms in succession. 

On top of that, Aratron&#39;s draconic form and its seemingly endless supply of lava did not come for free either. There was a reason most Casters required a workshop in close proximity in order to fight at their full strength: they were simply to expensive to sustain otherwise. 

<em>&#39;Can you keep up with me?&#39;</em>

Aratron&#39;s question replayed in Tapio&#39;s mind over and over again. <em>Yes,</em> He thought, gritting his teeth. <em>A hundred times yes.</em>

Tapio focused his mind on what was immediately in front of him: Szrac, his personal carriage. He supposed he should thank the man for not already tossing his away. He didn&#39;t think he was capable of running right now.

&#39;Shut up, shut up. You&#39;re running right now. You&#39;re not proving anything.&#39; He bonked Szrac on the head with his chin as he rested head on the cool steel. He wished he had a cool drink right now.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Every step he took towards where Berserker and Caster were waging their war, a new warning seemed to make itself known within his exoskeleton. An ear-piercing beep, a flaring light upon his visual display, or a vibrating buzz. 

<em><strong>WARNING - HEAT LEVELS INCREASING TO UNTENABLE LEVELS. COOLANT SYSTEMS SET TO 150%.</strong></em>
<em><strong>WARNING - TERRAIN UNEVEN, PLEASE ADJUST LEG SERVOS MANUALLY TO BETTER SUIT SITUATION.</strong></em>
<em><strong>WARNING - UNNECESSARY WEIGHT CLINGING TO HULL. PLEASE CLEAN EXOSKELETON TO REMOVE.</strong></em>

Szrac ignored each and every one, continuing to march on as Tapio clung to him. It was like some perverse parody of fantasy, the knight in shining armor riding their steed to battle a dragon and save the king. Except that the &quot;knight&quot; was an obnoxious little runt who wouldn&#39;t shut up, and the steed and uncaring cyborg, with little on his mind but victory.

In hindsight, it wasn&#39;t a particularly strong metaphor, but considering the circumstances, wordplay wasn&#39;t a high priority.

Eventually, after a brief sprint, Szrac and the parasite clinging to him would arrive at the site of Arbatel Saturn, an arrival signified by the strange grid laid out upon the ground. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that this was a Noble Phantasm, mainly because of the absurd amounts of mana it was consuming at the second. 

<strong>&quot;Hmph. Let me prove to you your own folly, right here and right now.&quot;</strong> The cyborg retorted simply, grasping one hand around Tapio&#39;s ankle like a shackle before venturing further in to the treacherous landscape.

It was time for Caster to die.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This new form of offensive was sneaky at first, but once it became clear what was going on Midas grew furious. A key part of this frustration was that it did not resemble the previous ‘feral animal’ tendencies of most Berserkers. No, the water did not allow such actions to take place. No, this disdain was the normal kind Caster would feel after he finally got a hold of him.

It meant that the ‘other’ him was poking his ugly, misshapen head through the bars he was locked behind. If that rain had not been stopped by the Noble Phantasm, he would’ve made an appearance by now. An appearance followed by a self gutting due to his overall lack of empathy or value of human lives.

He spun around desperately, trying to see where the <em>hell</em> these icicles were coming from. The perpetrator was obvious, but the location was not. 

Well, it wasn’t at first. Once he caught on, all sense of secrecy was abandoned. Instead of the piddly couple of shards it was a full on assault. Every direction, every angle. With Golden Rule still fully activated this wouldn’t be a huge concern, but with that gone…

And then came fourth icicle spear, impaled directly into his right arm. That one really drove home how out of his element (heh) he really was. This was a foolish endeavor, make no mistake. Confidence was truly a slow and insidious killer.

<em>Let me help you</em> 

<em>I’d rather die then let you have control!</em>

<em>Then go ahead. I thought I would ask, just to put that divine being in their place.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">“O Dionysus…” Midas muttered. He did not have time to do the proper ritual, instead opting for an ‘on the fly’ chant instead. Szrac would feel a larger than average energy signature coming off of the King, as well would Caster. He was finally unleashing an actual Noble Phantasm!

It wasn’t even flashy. As Midas finally decided to move, the drain stopped. Back to normal, still in the same terrible shape as before. And moving.

Moving as fast as he had been before, with his Golden Rule. Worse for wear, bleeding from multiple puncture holes, yet as agile as ever. Something had happened, but what?

“Caster,” Midas yelled, “I apologize for my actions prior! And I will apologize in advance for any future harm brought to you!”

Something was definitely wrong. Now he was talking normally. Apologizing? He wasn’t capable, for his Madness Enhancement made it incapable. It just happened, and it was odd. This must be a Self-Altering Noble Phantasm, changes happening inside rather than out. 

Once the spear imbedded itself inside his foot, he was quick to pull it away from the ground. It took precious seconds, but unlike before the ice released its grasp from the <em>ground</em> much quicker. Not even before would such a thing happen.

And it wasn’t the end of it. Unless his opponent could keep up with the newfound pace, he would have another chance to strike. And this time, it would hurt a lot more.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With five strikes have reached their target, that left only two strikes. One to press Midas further and the other to end the fight by hitting him in a fatal position. Midas might be a Berserker, but his reliance on touch had doomed him. How could he counter projectiles that he couldn&#39;t grasp?

Of course, this would be far too easy were that true.

Aratron sensed a sudden rise in Midas&#39; mana levels, something impossible if Midas was truly being cornered. Caster then remembered that his opponent had nary shown something comparable to a Noble Phantasm. The only thing he could even consider to be on that level was the king&#39;s golden touch.

Could this be his <em>true</em> Noble Phantasm?

Even more peculiar was the fact that Midas was speaking, and even <em>apologizing</em> to Caster for his folly. It felt like the crazed king was less Berserker and more just a brute.

A brute that, somehow, was avoiding any future icicles in his path, not to mention shrugging off the effects of the fourth and fifth icicles like they were flesh wounds. Aratron was flabbergasted.

<em>&quot;...But how? The manor is burning by now. His strength should have decreased from the lack of riches, not increased!&quot;</em> Caster faced a new conundrum, one that he had no certain answer to. It drove him to a frenzy.

Forget seven strikes. By the time Caster had tossed his eleventh icicle, Midas had covered enough ground to stand directly underneath the giant dragon. Of course, he proceeded to dodge the eleventh projectile as well while doing so.

&quot;...Don&#39;t underestimate me, human! So what if you&#39;re faster or stronger? All I need to do is trim those unnecessary aspects!&quot; Aratron shouted, as his familiars rose from the grids once more. Their main purpose was to restrain Midas and allow Caster free potshots at his target.

But would that same strategy succeed twice? <span class="mention" title="RaptorAttacks#0350">@The Survives</span> <span class="mention" title="ProjectRysa#6837">@ProjectRysa</span> <span class="mention" title="Nat#6572">@Nat</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The two Masters ventured into Aratron&#39;s chessboard of death. While the Iron Sarcophagus spat out warnings and went haywire in response to the extreme landscape, Tapio cruised on top of the scalding armor. The heat from the nearby lava grids was barely hotter than a summer breeze. In fact, his own skin had been heating up not from the environment, but from his own taxed magic circuits. 

Tapio was feeling the full brunt of the drain. He had been asked to run a marathon like a sprint, as Caster raised one natural disaster after another against his foe. Thankfully, Berserker seemed to be in tatters, both fabrics and flesh. Tapio sat up with renewed vigor at the crazed King&#39;s pitiful sight. He was getting a front-row seat thanks to Szrac. The boy waited with bated breath, eagerly counting the seconds until Berserker&#39;s demise...

He kept counting, and counting...

Yet Berserker started moving with barbaric grace with each onslaught of lava, stone and ice. The elements battered his body, yet each of them reforged him with a new burst of strength. A queer dread bloomed in Tapio&#39;s chest. He was starting to get the feeling that if Aratron&#39;s didn&#39;t strike Midas down soon, that window of opportunity might start to slip through their claws.

&#39;Caster-&#39; A tightness wrapped itself around his ankle. Tapio looked down and realized that Szrac had locked his leg in place and essentially trapped him on top of his shoulders. Just a moment prior, the cold-blooded magus had been trying to fling him off like an annoying fly. This was by no means an act of kindness.

Tapio kicked him with his other foot.

&#39;Let me go,&#39; He protested. &#39;I want to get off now.&#39; And when that failed, he resorted to cupping his hands and shouting at the dragon at the top of his lungs.

&#39;<strong>CASTER! DON&#39;T BE STINGY! BLAST HIM WITH EVERYTHING YOU&#39;VE GOT!</strong>&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After a moment of trekking, Szrac crested a hill, being granted a vantage point of the battlefield for his efforts. What was once the gardens of the Jamie Manor was now a hellscape, full of magma and frost, and crawling with a variety of familiars.

Indeed, the odds were against Berserker. Midas may have been a mad king, but that was it - a king. He was not a mighty dragonslayer, like the heroic Siegfried or the warrior Heracles. Even with the activation of his Noble Phantasm, unknown to the metallurgist, the odds were inherently against them. It was a dangerous race against time, where victory was survival, and death was absolute incineration. 

The deciding factor was mana. How much did Caster have left? How much was Tapio providing him? If even one of those full-power blasts landed a direct hit, it likely meant the end for Berserker. The sword of Damocles hung over both servants, the string straining with every second...

However, Szrac was no idiot. A fool might simply hope that the sword did not fall. Szrac was intent on grabbing the sword, tearing it free, and stabbing it through Aratron&#39;s heart.

<strong>&quot;Are you aware of Chaoskampf, boy?&quot;</strong> The cyborg inquired to the parasite upon his shell, glancing upwards as he did so. Before Tapio could even consider answering, Szrac continued on. <strong>&quot;It is the art of dragon killing, brought about by the hands of storm gods. Beings of thunder and lightning, clashing with great serpents... perhaps it would be best if you observe.&quot;</strong>

As the magi spoke, Tapio would suddenly feel the atmosphere around him change. A static-like energy surrounded him, accompanied by jolts of electricity that seemed to arc off from the Iron Sarcophagus and strike the surrounding area. As the cyborg moved forward to join Berserker, it wouldn&#39;t take much thought to decipher what he was intended.

A dragonslaying for the modern age. The question was, how?

Yet he could, would, and should. Dodging was the best strategy, as eating even half a dozen stray hits would probably end his current summoning right here and now. Before, he would gladly take such blows and apologize for ‘his’ actions and die like the good little Servant he was, desperate for his struggle to be at an end. However, this world was in dire need of fixing. The seeds of rebellion were being planted in this War, despite the common folk not even having a stake in it. His own hands were the growers, and his actions were the water. All they needed was a little sun…

Unfortunately, any further thoughts on how to help fix the socio-economic problems in Persepolis would have to wait until later. For now, there were more familiars to deal with. The other guy had problems with these lot, yet he barely remembered what their purpose was. Was this stone soldier one that locked him in place or distracted him? And that blob of goo…

It would mean little in the end. As the mighty rock man tried to stop him dead in his tracks, he did anything but by simply <em>punching</em> the golem square in the chest with his off hand. Before, that would’ve cracked it but left it standing if barely. He couldn’t afford to lose the spear, either. That was going to be the final nail in this ‘two-nailed’ coffin. 

Berserker’s increased strength more than covered for it, though. His fist collided and went straight through, shattering the boulder into dozens of mis-matched pieces. It stung his fist, even demolishing his own thumb in the process. That would be an absolute pain to fix later. His other persona would have to deal with that, though, so it was alright to do so.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The goo was quick as well, trying the same trick as before. It made a made dash for his feet, desperate to lock itself around those precious digits like it’s brother had. Unlike the last time, the creature wouldn’t even make it the full way. It received a flurry of stabs to its… face? Head? Frontal region. It was practically diced into multiple segments, now unable to properly launch an assault on his regained mobility. That left…

That shackle summon! He knew there was one more! Steel-like appendages latched on, starting the process all over again. Already they were snaking down to his legs and ankles, tightening and--

<em><strong>Crack!</strong></em>

Slowed speed led to a precise strike. Bonds weakened, crumbling before his raw might alone. All it took was a choice two stabs for that little pest to fade away to the nothingness it arose from. Shackles stayed from before and now, resulting in a fresh criminal look that suited him and his abilities. A rampaging, psychotic devil hellbent on doing whatever they so desired.

And now he was under the great and might hydra. He thought Hercules had ridden the world of this abomination, yet here it flew once more. The first one didn’t fly though, did it? Cursed Throne, not gifting him precise knowledge on the subject!</span>

No, this time, it was more than wrong-doings and sins of the past. Now, he had a purpose, a goal. Sure, a personal vendetta mixed in there too. A justifiable one in his eyes, though.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t give up on this matter,” he called to his opponent. “I’ve done many a wrong in this life, but this time I will not let myself perish when there is a divine being roaming around! Your kind serves no place in this world, toying with the lives of mortals as you deem fit. Forgive me if I sound hypocritical, but I have a plan to fix all of this!”

He finally decided to act, launch a real attack for a change. He raised his right hand, spear at the ready. His feet dug into the surface of lucious earth below. 

One shot. One chance.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron&#39;s familiars were fantastic, being superior to most golems or homunculi in existence. He could create in a few seconds entities that would take decades for humans to replicate. Arbatel Saturn was also a Noble Phantasm capable of strengthening his familiars.

Then why were they crumpling like dust, in the face of a tyrant who was eviscerating them like wrappers and cloths? Berserker felt like a different person almost, crushing his familiars as if they were nothing.

Phul, Ophiel, Bethor...All of the six familiars styled after the other Olympian spirits were falling, one by one. In the end, none of them managed to hold Midas back. Aratron was alone once more, as the Berserker raised a spear and pointed at him. Called him a monster. A divine being that could not understand the heart of humans. A creature that should be gone from the human world.

<em>He was right.</em>

Truth be told, why was Aratron even here? All of his past summons had only resulted in suffering. After all, he wasn&#39;t a noble figure, nor a popular one. His past was shrouded in darkness and mystery, to the point that only nutcases and cultists were willing to summon him, usually with nefarious motives and purposes too.

He could remember their faces. The disgusting faces of selfish humans that he had petrified throughout the centuries. Cultists who freely indulged in blood sacrifices and unholy rituals just to summon him and abuse his power.

He had no place among humans, that much was true.

....

Midas tossed his spear, replicating the great Zeus striking down his own father with the power of thunder and lightning. A similarly golden spear struck Aratron straight into the heart, piercing all of his defenses as his core had now suffered severe damage.

Was it curable? Maybe. Could he entrust Tapio to do so? Not a chance. The boy had no idea on how to erect a bounded field, let alone magical arts dedicated to healing Servants.</span>

If Tapio were wise, he would hear his Servant&#39;s cries and run away. Aratron couldn&#39;t fathom a way to restrain Midas without expending all of his mana reserves. And if he did so, what would be the point? He would chain him, but lack the energy left to finish him off. Likewise, concentrating all of his energy into attacks was worthless against such a nimble foe. He was a bike out of gas. Doomed from the start because of his Master.

He could only hope the boy made it out.

But they didn&#39;t. They reached the heart of the storm instead, refusing to let things end there. Aratron could see them from afar, riding Berserker&#39;s Master like a steed as Tapio stared at his own Servant with the eyes of a frightened animal.

Yet those same eyes held an amount of courage.

Give it everything you have got. Blast the enemy to pieces. Never give up. Inspirational quotes that had been shared by humans since the dawn of time. Aratron never understood the banality behind such words: If someone could do something, they would simply do it. If they couldn&#39;t, they simply wouldn&#39;t. Encouragement wouldn&#39;t affect the outcome. You could either defeat someone or you couldn&#39;t. In Aratron&#39;s case, he knew he couldn&#39;t defeat Berserker.

<strong>But now, he understood.</strong> He understood why humans still struggled like that. Why Tapio insisted he fight despite his mana reserves being spent. It wouldn&#39;t affect the outcome. It wouldn&#39;t change fate. But...

...If he didn&#39;t at least try, <strong>then what sort of teacher was he?!</strong></span>

&quot;Heh. Hehehehe...<strong>HAHAHAHAHAHAH!</strong>&quot;

Midas narrowed his eyes. The ears of an ass perked up as they felt like they had heard something unnatural. His opponent, the stone-faced Caster...was laughing?

Tapio and Szrac were similarly surprised. Had Aratron gone mad?

&quot;Foolish student! Did you really think that I was lying? That I would simply crumble like an unfinished statue?&quot; Aratron gloated, his core leaking yellow fluids as it was apparent his life force was draining. Yet, he bore that pain as he spread his wings.

&quot;I have already told you: <strong>We have a 0% chance of losing.</strong> My statements always hold true.&quot; He boasted as his numerous heads laughed in unison.

&quot;Berserker, I accept your apology and rescind my previous statement: You truly are a King. Whoever resides behind that fa&#231;ade of a beast, at least. I am at least glad that I was able to witness the real King Midas.&quot;

While Midas felt honored to gain Caster&#39;s respect, he knew that something else was afoot.

&quot;<em>But</em>, I cannot accept this outcome. What good is a teacher if they can&#39;t even obtain a future for the young?! No matter what becomes of me...You. Will. <strong>Fall.</strong>&quot;

Aratron let out one last growl. One loud enough to echo throughout the entirety of Persepolis. Rider and Archer could hear it. Neighboring cities could sense it. It was as if the cosmos had cried out.

He then started his assault once again. Five heads, working as one as they fired beams of magma, ice, steam, water, sand and wind at Midas. Berserker avoided that barrage with ease. The icicles gave him more trouble!</span>

Then a gooey substance clutched at his leg...

...Followed by a stone figure blocking his path.

These darned familiars! They were sturdier than cockroaches! Aratron kept resummoning them en masse. For every one Midas destroyed, two more would spawn. The maximum number was still seven, but Caster ensured that they would never go below seven.

Five beams from all sides, seven familiars attacking Midas from multiple angles...It was a struggle to keep track of it. But it wasn&#39;t easy for Caster either. He was burning mana and life force at a rapid pace, to the point Tapio felt feverish. Szrac sensed that the kid was too weak to even stand anymore. He felt worried.

They were going all out.

The 49 grids removed their restraints. They now all focused on a singular goal: Defeat Berserker. The ground itself became his enemy, with spikes, quicksand, poisonous swamps and heated coals appearing at every corner to block his path. Traps were created sporadically in a randomized pattern to confuse him. He didn&#39;t even have the time to breathe as noxious fumes emitted from a few grids near him. It felt like he was trapped in a chamber designed to specifically torture him.

So, this was the true power of Caster. He felt death and treachery at every corner. Were it not for his huge mana upkeep, Aratron would have been a threat to be feared by all. Midas almost felt glad that such a monstrous Servant was limited by the whims of the mafia. Had an aristocrat obtained this Servant, no, had Szrac obtained this Servant, he would have ruled Persepolis with an iron fist.

Five heads, seven familiars, forty nine grids. At this point, Midas&#39; day couldn&#39;t possibly get any worse. His only solace was the fact that Aratron had sustained fatal blows. If he survived a minute, perhaps even two, then Caster would simply collapse from his own strain.

<strong>Which is what Caster wanted.</strong></span>

&quot;Since when were you under the impression that my death meant my defeat, oh great king Midas?&quot; Aratron snarled from above. He felt a tiny bit closer. Did he grow in size?

....

No. His wings had grown weaker. The injury was too severe. He was starting to fall.

Wait, fall? No, his wings were barely flapping anymore. He wasn&#39;t even putting up any resistance. Hold on...

<strong>He wanted to fall.</strong>

A gigantic dragon, most likely one as large as Midas&#39; manor, was currently plummeting towards the ground like a meteor. A creature of that scale would generate enormous earthquakes and shockwaves upon colliding with the floor, not to mention what would happen if they fell on top of Midas themselves.

It was Caster&#39;s last ditch effort. A final nail in the coffin, in case the rest of his attacks failed!

&quot;I did not lie. There is a 0% chance of us losing this battle. Of course, this never meant that I had to win.&quot; Caster gloated as he descended like a bright comet. 

&quot;As long as my student survives, I&#39;ll count it as my victory. A teacher survives not by preserving their own life, <strong>but by making sure their knowledge lives on through their pupils!</strong> Carry this lesson to your grave, Midas. Your gold could never hope to match even a speck of mankind&#39;s knowledge!&quot; Aratron exclaimed in his death throes. Just a minute away from impact...

<strong>ARBATEL SATURN: PLANET BEFALL</strong>

Tapio was amazed. Szrac was shocked. Berserker would most likely perish if his Master did not act quick enough. Likewise, Tapio most likely wanted to escape to a proper vantage point. There was no purpose in him surviving if he couldn&#39;t at least witness Aratron&#39;s brightest moment in all of its glory.</span>

They were the words of a man at the end of his life, the words of a man who had made peace with his coming death. He was content to sacrifice himself for the greater good, to destroy his body, and in return, destroy the tyrant who threatened mankind.

He would witness as the cosmos descended from the heavens, with the intent to strike the earth. A cataclysm born from the sky, with one singular purpose in mind.

A purpose that would be denied.

<strong>&quot;How bold, for a beast to speak on behalf of mankind. Unfortunately, you are not the one who gets to make that decision.&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio would found himself discarded, thrown away by the cyborg as he took the final steps upon this, the pilgrimage to Saturn. The mechanical monster did not spare the boy even a single glance back as he began to climb the hill on which King Midas stood, his face emotionless.

<strong>&quot;We are not your pets, your pathetic lapdogs who require teaching, who must be saved from ourselves. We are beyond the need for you, dragon. We are beyond the need for your tyranny disguised as kindness. We are beyond the need for your tutelage, that which would confine us solely to the path you choose.&quot;</strong>

As the cyborg moved further up the hill, the Iron Sarcophagus began to change. Upon the right arm, portions of the exterior plating slid back of popped off, revealing four plug-like slots underneath. Likewise, the same occurred with his chest, revealing four coils of wire.

<em><strong>”AS ZEUS, WHO LAID LOW THE MONSTROUS TYPHON, AND IMPRISONED HIM IN THE DEPTHS OF TARTARUS.”</strong></em>

Various systems and sub-systems of the Iron Sarcophagus reduced their functioning or shut themselves off entirely, funneling as much power as it could towards the reactor at his heart. 

<em><strong>”AS INDRA, WHO WAGED HIS WAR AGAINST THE FOUL VRITRA, WHO DESTROYED HIS FOE WITH THE MIGHTY VAJRA.”</strong></em>

Alarms, once blaring, went silent.

His HUD, once filled with information, became empty.

The servos that once aided his every movement, began to falter.

<em><strong>”AS SUSANO&#39;O, WHO OUTSMARTED THE VILE YAMATA-NO-OROCHI AND SEVERED HIS MANY HEADS.”</strong></em>

Szrac&#39;s breathing grew ragged. Every step was a marathon. Every second felt like it could be his last. This was a foolish endeavor. This was not the Age of Gods. Man alone could not stand against a dragon.

But he was not a man. He was a weapon.

<em><strong>”AS THOR, WHO DEFEATED JORDGUMANDR AT THE EDGE OF OBLIVION, STANDING UPON THE DOORWAY TO DESTRUCTION.”</strong></em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With great effort, the magus reached the top of the hill. Though it was unimpressive in size, it felt as though he had just climbed a great mountain. He took a few more burdensome steps, each one accompanied by ragged breath, before his legs finally froze. They would carry him no further, but that was fine. They had carried him far enough. Side by side with King Midas, his servant, a spear held in his hands, ready to throw.

His left arm reached out, dragging along the weight of his armour, plugging each of the four wires into the corresponding gap. With each wire plugged in, a new circuit was formed, further amplifying the electricity that wildly arced off of his body. No, by the point the fourth circuit had been completed, it could no longer be called electricity. It was <em>lightning</em>, pure and true, like that of the gods of eld.

”This power, stolen from the divine by Tesla, the modern Prometheus, pioneer of the stars, who forged a new road for humanity to walk upon...” Szrac rasped. Gone was the voice like iron, modulated and twisted beyond humanity. Now, it was little more than the voice of a human, a mortal man beneath this shell of metal, broken and beaten, one who had already lost all he once had.

But that didn’t matter. Not now. With great effort, he raised up his right arm, pointing it towards the draconian comet that threatened to annihilate Midas. Despite the overwhelming odds that bore down upon them, Szrac felt no fear.

After all, they had a 0% chance of losing.</span>

As if answering his question, the lightning that surrounded his body condensed itself into a single location, located within the palm of his land. With one last roar of defiance, he demanded all that he could of his wounded body, his blackened heart, and his desolate soul. He called for all they could muster, and thrust his arm forth, sending forth the ball of sheer electricity. Like a butterfly escaping it’s chrysalis, a blinding bolt of lightning surged forth like a spear of the heavens, aiming to pierce the descending Arbatel Saturn.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Midas’ aim was true, golden rod piercing that scalie hide thoroughly and penetrated the heart of the beast. With his enhanced power from this new form, there was absolutely no way that thing could survive such a hit and stay in their Noble Phantasm. Without that thing enhancing their combat power, it would be trivial to outspeed and pummel Caster into the ground.

Victory was all but assured... So why did the hordes keep coming?!

More golems, treacherous terrain at every step, traps scattered amongst the landscape to keep him constantly in threat of dying outright. An onslaught of epic proportions that never kept him more than two wrong steps from an untimely end. Not that he opposed it, but it would feel wrong to die here after having this productive mindset come to fruition. 

His gameplan? Survive. A hard feat, much easier said than performed. Already he had taken an easily dodged blow from another stone soldier. A whiff of gas. Trap nearly removed his foot. The King himself was running on fumes at this point. Where the hell was Szrac?! If they didn’t do something now…

That slowly approaching Caster would--wait, what?

A few cursory glances revealed the true nature of this ploy, this sudden rush of power and strength: one last decoy attack. The body weight of that creature would make him into a scrumptious pancake! No, that was putting it lightly. He’d be lucky to be as thin as a crepe. 

Was this all for naught, then? A suicide attack was going to be the way this ended? It certainly beat the plethora of other ways to leave this world and vessel yet felt so unsatisfying. Perhaps dreaming that he could actually do some right for a change was too hopeful, too naive. This Humbled King should know his place better.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Well, that was until he noticed Szrac. Emanating from his cocoon of metal and cables was a magical energy to put any being in their place. A grand spell was being weaved, and his speech signified it as one. But what kind of spell from a mortal would be capable of stopping the mighty hydra, being of old, dead in its tracks? 

Lightning. Of course. Zeus still had a way of signifying his dominance over man, even if in subtle ways. A grandiose display of raw power surged forth, from the palm of his master&#39;s hand. Mayhaps a little emotion and heart was put into that magic, letting him bring forth the energy to make it where they stood in the first place. If this King was allowed to stay for even an hour after this moment, maybe the two could talk like normal people for a change, instead of the usual stuff.

Hold on, he was still in danger! Enough time had been spent reminiscing about such silly things. He quickly side stepped another earthen opponent’s blow to match it with his own, and kept up his running. Just a little longer…

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tapio struck the ground in a messy heap. He lost his only support now that Szrac had done what he&#39;d asked and actually discarded him. To get up was a fight and a half, to keep track of Berserker and his Master on top of the terraforming landscape was impossible. His vision blurred, his fever flared up with each new obstacle Aratron conjured from his 49 grids, intent to follow his Master&#39;s orders through as he directed one obstacle after another towards Berserker.

Aratron was a capable mage. One fatal wound would not be the end of them. Had they deactivated their Noble Phantasm and reverted from their draconic form, perhaps, with what remained of Tapio&#39;s mana, they could still mitigate enough damage and retreat in one piece. They could find a new base, erect a new bounded field that slowed the deterioration of their spirit core, and this time, Caster would make sure to get it through Tapio&#39;s thick skull that they would withdraw from the Holy Grail War and spend the rest of their time going through magecraft basics instead. 

Numerous Masters still remained on the battlefield. Caster could simply leave it to them to prey upon a wounded Berserker and their overexerted Master. Aratron had always been cold and impartial; they were not one to be swayed by emotions, let alone go along with the stupid whims of their Master. Yet, in the final moments of their life, Caster had thrown caution to the wind and decided to grant his Master&#39;s wish, even if he had to do so by burning up the rest of his own spirit core. 

Berserker&#39;s spear crippled them, Szrac&#39;s lightning defanged them. But the one who hammered the final nail in the coffin was none other the selfish words of a kid who was still wet behind the ears.

Tapio had asked Aratron to die.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And Aratron obliged with the most fantastic show that had graced Persepolis&#39; dour skies. Elements ravaged the land as the five-headed dragon hardened their body and plummeted to their inevitable death.

Then the sky lit up as lightning coursed through the dragon, white-blue sparks eviscerating their polished black scales. Golden liquid leaked out and rained on the spectators below, rolling off of Tapio&#39;s cloak without so much as a stain as his condition preserved the fabric&#39;s integrity, refusing to even let his own Servant leave their final mark. Tapio faded in and out of consciousness as mana poured out of his body into the leaky container that tethered his Servant to this world. Then he heard the dragon&#39;s roar - not from the sky, but next to his ear, as if his Servant had been whispering directly and only to him. A dignified cry from a falling star, a supernova burning brighter than a billion suns.

<strong>Watch closely,</strong> the voice said.

How could he say no?

Tapio put his hands on the foot of the hill and began to climb.

It wasn&#39;t as if he had never seen a dragon before. On Agamemnon&#39;s shield, in the Twelve Labors of Heracles, anecdotes from the Age of the Gods. Men, Gods and phantasmals alike had coexisted in dissonant harmony, a dying dragon wasn&#39;t enough to turn heads in a city that was on the verge of breaking down. Yet the mere sight of this dragon still took Tapio&#39;s breath away. This was what he had wanted all along. Not some teacher-student relationship that had been forced onto him, nor the tedious schemes among Masters as they fought tooth and nail for the Grail. All he had wanted was to witness a spectacle, a real-life fairytale enacted by an automated action figure that required naught but some cheap mana as fuel. He wanted to pit his own toy against others until one or the other wore down. It was just a puppet show. A stage play. It was never meant to last.

He didn&#39;t want it to end.

He still wanted to see more.

So much more!

&#39;<strong>You haven&#39;t taught me anything yet! Don&#39;t you dare leave!</strong>&#39;

Tapio mustered his remaining strength and mounted the rest of the hill in one go. Szrac&#39;s dysfunctioning frame came in clutch; Tapio latched onto the armor and pulled himself back onto shaky feet. He leaned against the armor for support, and only then realized that it was not a tree, but the executioner who had colluded with Berserker and put an early end to Aratron&#39;s life with a one-two punch. 

&#39;You suck.&#39; He gave the mercenary the worst possible insult he could come up with, then shoved against him with all his weight. &#39;Go away.&#39; He shoved harder. &#39;I&#39;m going to push you off if you&#39;re even thinking about laying another finger on Caster.&#39;

The Iron Sarcophagus didn&#39;t budge an inch under Tapio&#39;s puny strength, but the boy was too feverish to tell the difference between him moving mountains and the mountain moving him. When he thought he&#39;d pushed Szrac far enough, he relented and hinged his fingers over the buttons of his cloak.

<em>I can still save Caster,</em> Tapio thought in his delirious mind. He had managed to halt Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm once. He could halt Aratron&#39;s demise. Probably.

Wouldn&#39;t hurt to try.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Had Aratron&#39;s fall been left undeterred, then Berserker would have truly perished. A huge chunk of the aristocratic district would have been blown away, but Persepolis would have survived. A fitting end for such a noble attack.

Of course, Szrac had been waiting all along for this moment. Berserker&#39;s role was not to defeat his opponent, but to weaken them to a point that Szrac could unleash a finisher of his own. 

<strong>Spark of Ingenuity.</strong> An incantation designed to strike down the Gods. Noble Phantasms of all types would be nullified. Not even Reality Marbles, nor Anti-Army, nor Broken Phantasms, could compete with such a landmark of human spirit.

Indeed, Aratron did not expect this. He had dealt with a mage that was far more impressive than Szrac, after all. He hadn&#39;t expected to see Szrac surpass them with a technique unbefitting of a magus. Caster&#39;s lack of experience in anything but Magecraft was what led to his downfall.

Arbatel Saturn was waning. The grids were disappearing. Midas went from fighting for his life to feeling like taking a light jog. It was pathetic to see his final attack be reduced to such a state. Not even a Noble Phantasm as powerful as Saturn itself was capable of resisting humanity&#39;s advance.

The question is, <strong>did Szrac really embody humanity&#39;s wishes?</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Tyranny...tutelage...Since when have you heard of such words?&quot; Aratron snarled as his descent was imminent. Impact would most likely occur within a minute or so. Enough time for Midas to get away.

Szrac&#39;s strategy was perfect. Perfect to a fault. He had struck down Aratron&#39;s core with his crystallization of lightning Magecraft. A Spiritron Core was the weak point of any Servant, even those who were gigantic dragons in appearance. Aratron was no exception to that.

&quot;You say Gods had no love for you humans? You call our benevolence heresy?&quot;

Two of Aratron&#39;s hydra heads proceeded to block Szrac&#39;s blast. Of course, it was a futile attempt, as they were swiftly incinerated in a matter of seconds. Only three heads remained.

&quot;Yet the bond between us is intrinsically linked. I realize that now.&quot;

But that wasn&#39;t the purpose of those heads. Their purpose was to simply disintegrate and turn into fresh material for Aratron to manipulate. They were mere specks of dust, yet they had polluted the very tip of Szrac&#39;s beam.

Szrac felt something off. He noticed that his beam was now intently penetrating Aratron&#39;s core. A normally fatal blow...Could this mean an early demise for the capricious Caster?

No, his beam was being <em>siphoned.</em> Sucked inside of the core like dust in a vacuum. Szrac found the very concept impossible: Spiritron Cores were unable to sustain such power. It would fry the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame&#39;s circuits at the very least. Yet Aratron was still going strong. He realized what was going on once he saw Caster&#39;s Master nearby. They was slowing down his <em>death.</em>

The energy was being stolen, and used to create something else. Aratron&#39;s descent started to slow down, as Szrac and Midas witnessed something propel their opponent upward instead. Saturn was cracking in the background, dissolving into something much more ethereal...

<em>A wormhole.</em></span>

The sky turned into a galaxy as Szrac wondered if Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm was still active. He stared at the ground below him.

The grids were gone.

The familiars were gone.

<em>Then what was this?</em>

Aratron&#39;s core grew bright. Brighter than a lone light in the darkest night. It shone like dawn, sucking all of Szrac&#39;s beam in its entirety as his golden core morphed from a pale yellow into a beautiful ruby.

Midas narrowed his eyes. It was a jewel far more beautiful than gold. It reminded him of a stone of legends, something that he had only come to know through modern memories.

Szrac felt the same, sensing an odd familiarity behind that rock. It terrified him.

&quot;So, this is what he wanted me to see. This is how I was meant to realize my full potential....&quot; Aratron reminisced out loud, confusing everyone but Pascal. He knew exactly who Caster was thinking of. His mentor. His creator. His father.

<em>A mere human.</em>

The sky glistened with galaxies as Aratron knew what had to be done. He grasped the last amount of strength he had and flew upward, towards the wormhole.

&quot;Galaxies are stars united into one, like the clustering wishes of humanity&#39;s hopes and bonds.&quot;

His body was morphing. Changing. He soared through the wormhole as a new being. No longer Aratron, Governor of Saturn. No longer Caster, of the Holy Grail War.

<strong>&quot;Become the path that lights the way!&quot;</strong>

Midas was shivering, mouth agape. Caster had somehow managed to turn into gold that completely overwhelmed his golden touch. His spears paled in comparison. His manor looked second-rate. Yet the quality of the gold wasn&#39;t the issue. Both were on par.

Then why...why did he shine so bright?

It was then, that he realized what Aratron&#39;s core truly was. It wasn&#39;t just a Spiritron Core.

It was a <strong>Philosopher&#39;s Stone.</strong></span>

&quot;It is a teacher&#39;s greatest dream to see their students surpass them. Yet, if you couldn&#39;t even understand what drives humanity forward, then you have much to learn!&quot; Aratron berated Szrac from his towering height.

&quot;Humans do not fight back at Gods because they despise them. Likewise, Gods do not fight back at humans because we enjoy tyranny. <strong>We simply develop from one another.</strong> Your final lesson has finally reached your student&#39;s ears, Paracelsus.&quot; Caster stated. He sighed in reprieve, as if hoping that his mentor could hear him.

&quot;...Which is why you get an F, Szrac Vaughn. Not only is your knowledge of coursework lacking, but you have severely underestimated the subject matter. Did you really believe that a supreme being such as I, could be defeated by simply sealing their Noble Phantasm?&quot; He returned to his usual arrogance soon afterwards. He was running on fumes, but he owed it to all to end things with one last hurrah.

He owed it to <em>him.</em></span>

<strong>BROKEN PHANTASM: SWORD OF PARACELSUS</strong>

Three heads coalesced into one as the hydra fired one last burst. A blue beam of resplendent fury emerged from Aratron&#39;s mouth. It was filled not only with Szrac&#39;s energy, but the entirety of Aratron&#39;s mana as well. A crystallization of his very soul to be fired as a mere projectile.

He wasn&#39;t even siphoning mana from Tapio anymore. He knew better than to be a sore loser.

Truth be told, it wasn&#39;t enough. Expending all of his mana for a single attack was glorious, but it was a far cry from the terrific setup of his Arbatel Saturn. Casters were those who made minefields, not the bombs themselves. It was an attack doomed to failure. 

Yet, he still did it. Because it was far more important for a teacher to leave a lasting impression than to be forgotten by his pupils. As long as they remembered him, then he would live on.

.....

<em><strong>BOOM!</strong></em>

The beam collided on the ground, far too heavy and imprecise to score a direct hit. Midas, Szrac and Tapio would all be sent flying...

Midas and Szrac landed at the place they least expected to be: The golden manor, which was currently still in flames. It was far too late to salvage the place as the magma had melted over 80% of the buildings insides and outsides. The King had been greatly weakened as a result, along with receiving a wounded pride as a result. Despite knowing very well that he had won, Midas&#39; victory felt unearned. He never saw despair in Aratron&#39;s eyes, even in the latter&#39;s death...</span>

Szrac paid no attention to the manor. He was just glad his staff survived: They were useful to him, after all. His armor received plenty of damage from the blast, but it had survived far worse. For a swan song, Aratron&#39;s final attack was pathetic.

As he stared back to the site of the battle, he narrowed his eyes. Aratron was long gone, with sparkles of gold filling the air in his stead. The sign that a Servant had long passed.

He had won.

.....

Tapio landed further away from the manor. Either it was a trick of fate, or Aratron had purposefully aimed his shot to avoid harming his Master. He received few injuries too, thanks to his unique condition.

He was also still alive. Alive, and still capable of walking. What little bit of mana he had left was enough to keep him alive. Aratron hadn&#39;t bled him dry.

But now what?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After he had launched the Spark of Ingenuity, everything Szrac could once sense devolved into a blur. His Iron Sarcophagus was slow to restart, working overtime in a desperate attempt to funnel power to the necessary systems. That left him nothing to do but to pant, to heave, to breathe, to survive.

And to listen.

<em><strong>&quot;Humans do not fight back at Gods because they despise them. Likewise, Gods do not fight back at humans because we enjoy tyranny. We simply develop from one another...&quot;</strong></em>

This crescendo wreathed in gold, not the accursed gold of King Midas, but a pure, clean gold. The cyborg knew what it was, and he knew it well. Any magus worth their salt knew what it was.

A philosophers stone.

<em><strong>BANG</strong></em>

Before he knew it, Szrac was sent flying back by the Broken Phantasm, landing in the dirt next to the manor. His exoskeleton was inert, as though it had simply stopped functioning. Instantly, a horde of scientists and engineers rushed to his side, fear in their eyes. Had the stress of unleashing his trump card weakened him so much that even the false Sword of Paracelsius had killed him?

After about a minute of frantic work, a noise would come from Szrac&#39;s inert body, the first noise since he had hit the ground.

A laugh. 

A hollow laugh.

A hollow, malicious laugh.

<strong>&quot;Without the masses of peasants underneath the feet of the rich, where else would we stand but the filthy ground?&quot;</strong> He spoke, turning his head ever so slightly to look at Berserker. The damage to his mechanical body was extensive, and it seemed that they lacked the materials to properly repair it.

But their victory had provided them with an even greater trump card than his lance of humanity&#39;s lightning.

<strong>&quot;Very well! I shall take Caster&#39;s words to heart and develop from this battle. Berserker, fetch the dragon&#39;s carcass. Fetch his spirit core. Fetch the</strong> <em><strong>Philosopher&#39;s Stone,</strong></em> <strong>and bring it to me.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Awe. Inspiration. Beauty. These were words the King <em>attempted</em> to attribute to the beautiful spectacle he saw before him. In his Humbled form, these words were inspirational at worst. Truly a wonderful sight indeed. His opponent was shocked by the lightning, yet still was able to create something from the tattered remains of their body. A jewel so bright, so powerful, so… stunning! 

Both personalities yearned. One to possess that illustrious object, that Philosopher’s stone. Hold it and cherish it in his hands, to never let go. To stare into that swirling crimson abyss forever more, until the tests of time itself washed away all that he owned.

The other, the servant themselves. To debate, to argue, to scowl at each other over differing philosophies and subjects until their faces grew red and the mead started flying alongside fists. To learn, to grow, to be in company with such a unique individual regardless of how much he despised him.

Yet neither would come to fruition. Before he could even take a step, there was the final salvo. A significant burst of energy, nowhere near yet devastating all the same. The force of that final lazer was enough to send him and his master flying, back to where this cursed encounter started: The Midas Manor.

Well, what remained of it. Burning, bubbling ruins were all that were left. Noxious fumes and scalding temperatures greeted Midas upon his hard landing. All wind was knocked from his lungs, replaced with the burning smells of hair and gold. His Noble Phantasm threatened to kill him outright, which required him to relinquish control back to that monster.

<em>I’m glad we could work together, even if for a moment.</em>

<em>...We shall see if that ever happens again, naive fool.</em>

<em>I guess, wretched abomination.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And he was back. He sat upright, careful not to touch anything in fear of the mana drain weakening him even further. Already a small group of scientists from the Power Plant were ogling the metal monster, poking and prodigy as if he were a science experiment rather than a man. Maybe he was soon to leave this world regardless of his feelings. 

Fate had other plans. A rumbling mechanical laughter. Broken beyond recognition, but recognizable. 

“<em><strong>Without the masses of the peasants underneath the feet of the rich, where else would we stand but the filthy ground?”</strong></em>

Midas smiled back, radiating a positive reaction to those words. “You finally understand! Perhaps you are more than meets the eye, Master!”

A right hand man perfect to conquest into battle with. This was a blessed pairing after all! With their powers combined not even a <em>god</em> could stand against them. What else would there be to stop their pursuit of that Blessed Grail, if not for a Divine being?
Unfortunately, he request was a little off putting. “I shall take a gander upon where that Caster gave into their end, but I doubt there will be anything more than dust and ashes. Let alone a spirit core.”

Finally, a man where the two could see eye to eye on the same matters and devise a course of action through trust and understanding. A bond had formed, through blood and fire and a godly amount of magical energy. If they still had a base to operate from, and weren’t on the cusp of death respectively, then victory was all but assured.

“In the meantime, procure some mana batteries from a local store. Threaten them if you must,” he demanded from anyone in the small group idolizing Szrac. “I feel that the climax of our ascent to Kings is nigh. We will need all the power we can obtain to procure a victory. A <em>true</em> victory. Not one with sacrifices and lack of emotion, but one of soul crushing defeat for our foes. Despair.”

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aratron&#39;s Noble Phantasm finally ended. The grids disappeared, taking all the lava and stone and spikes with them as the ground transformed back into plain old tarmac. The dragon shed its old shell, funneling every last drop of mana into their core as they delivered their final attack.

A blast of pure mana razed the ground. Tapio was sent flying into the nearby bushes as golden sparks rained down from the sky. He tried to catch them as they fell, but they fizzled out like a fleeting dream, too beautiful to last.

Tapio sat up. His mind was sluggish, his body on fire, and everything hurt. He had been cut, grazed and bruised during his fall, as his mana was no longer sufficient to fully shield him from harm. Tapio tried to get up the usual way: by propping himself into a kneeling position then pushing himself back up, but that quickly sent him rolling into a fetal position as his scuffed knees tore open and bled from touching the ground so roughly.  

<em>God damn, that hurt!</em> 

In the span of a few minutes, Tapio felt as if he had gone through all 18 levels of hell as he aggravated every single wound to be found on him. The scuffed knees were only a beginning. By the time he finally managed to get back on his feet, Tapio felt ready to crumble all over again.

If nothing else, Caster had managed to teach his student a final lesson: the concept of pain. 

In the span of a few minutes, Tapio was forced to rewire his brain as he dealt with the repercussions of a lifetime&#39;s recklessness. He had always thought himself to be invincible, but now that his defenses had been breached, his origin actively worked against him and preserved the state of his injuries rather than letting them heal naturally. 

Tapio regretted not picking up healing magecraft while he had the chance. Not just healing magecraft, but a slew of other spells as well. He was learning for the first time how vulnerable it was to be a human.

If only he had just one more chance...!

Tapio willed himself to put one foot in front of the other as he trudged through the crash site of his Servant. Aratron had delivered a vision in their final moment, a red spark of hope that shone too brightly to be a fever dream. It was real. It had to real. He was certain of it. 

He could <em>feel</em> it.

The inside of his cloak began to glow. The bonds that Aratron had forged into the fabric fought to slip away, but Tapio&#39;s origin intervened, feeding mana into each sigil and binding them in place. Even now, his nature was fighting back against his teacher, reprieving them of their right to leave.

He plunged his hands into the rubble and began to dig. One stone at a time, one handful of dirt at a time. One breath at a time.

<em>A bit too soon, don&#39;t you think?</em>

Tapio thought, then closed his hands around the small stone.
