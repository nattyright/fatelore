                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;...And you need to be exceedingly careful with the summoning circle. I know you managed to do it under pressure but one wrong move could result in you getting hurt.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Father.&quot;

&quot;The chant is exceedingly important. I&#39;ve heard rumors that mistakes are allowed but we&#39;re tampering with some strange pieces of Magecraft. Do you have the chant memorized as a precaution?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Father.&quot;

&quot;This frame was given to us for this Holy Grail War, and nobody knows we have it. Wait until the storm outside reaches its peak before conducting the summon. We&#39;re going to want as much interference as possibl—&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Father. I&#39;m fine. If I can summon him under terrible conditions, this time will be a cinch. 

A young boy interrupted as both he and an older man with shoulder length hair exited the elevator, and began walking down an ornate hallway. Two butlers followed behind, alert and aware. The older man, Auster, smiled at his son.

&quot;Of course. Sorry, son. I&#39;m nervous. I still can&#39;t believe that a Holy Grail War is actually beginning. In this wreck of a city, of all places.&quot;

Lorenzo nodded nervously as they passed through a doorway set at the end of the hall. The room was fairly massive for being underneath the manor. Ventilation ducts pushed fresh air into the room as two guards carried a massive barrel into place, red liquid sloshing within. Blood.

&quot;We&#39;re lucky that Lancer was willing to shut down for us. Will we be able to resummon him?&quot; One of the butlers asked. Auster chuckled.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;It&#39;s certainly possible, Rodrick. We have the spirit core needed. It&#39;s a nonissue. As long as we can resummon him, victory is ours. No Servant should stand up to a Lancer as powerful as the one summoned previously...&quot; Auster trailed off as Lorenzo halted, looking at the barrel. 

Dipping his hand into the blood, Lorenzo kneeled down and began to construct the summoning circle. It was beautiful work. If Lorenzo&#39;s circle under pressure was impressive, this was a genuine work of art.

Half an hour passed. Then an hour. Then two... &quot;It has to be perfect. No half measures...&quot; Lorenzo murmured as he touched up the inner ring. He nodded. 

&quot;Done.&quot; He called. Auster nodded.

&quot;Bring in the frame!&quot; He shouted as two guards picked up the new S.E.R.V.A.N.T suit, and placed it in the center.

Auster raised a hand. &quot;Start!&quot; He barked.

Lorenzo nodded as he wiped his hands off. He closed his eyes. <em>Lancer...</em>

The chant was completed with great ease. Lorenzo knew it by heart.

&quot;<strong>Come forth, guardian of the scales! Protect me, be my knight!</strong>&quot;

The circle began to glow, just as it once did on that fateful night.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">And glow the circle did. Instead of the malicious purple haze that had threatened to suffocate Lorenzo, the circle emitted a clean blue light not unlike that of the open sky. Gone was the sense of impending disaster from before, replaced by an unplaceable promise of security and justice. Still the circle demanded much from the young master and would pull deeply from his reserves, leaving his right hand numb from the experience.

In front of the father and son, the silvery construct’s skin would erupt in large welts, tumors and masses as the skeleton itself swelled with the influx of power and potential. It was as if it was forcefully reconstructing into some heroic colossus. Yet as it reached a towering height, a crack formed in its chest and out came a single liquid ruby that fell to the circle below. And it would be followed by another and another until a veritable red cascade was pouring from the frame. From this consecration of the circle, many small red and white flowers would emerge, turning the ground into a macabre meadow.

All of them would then suddenly tilt if caught in a gale and this would soon turn into a spiraling ribbon of petals that obscured the mechanical suit from sight. They would wind tighter and tighter until a bright golden light could be seen within. And as quickly as it started, the whole ritual ended abruptly with the petals cast around the room and revealing a familiar figure to Lorenzo. His indomitable guardian had returned.</span>

He smiles briefly and and whispers an inaudible name before realizing his audience.

“My apologies, dear masters. I did not expect to be here in this form but it is incredibly lucky for you nonetheless. I am the Warrior of the Bloodstained Meadow, Lancer of Delphi.”</span>

Despite his body&#39;s fragile nature, it was still chock full of the energy needed to summon a Servant. His legs shook, and his arm burned.

The summoning had been a success, and Lancer had been successfully resummoned. Lorenzo fell to his knees from weakness. &quot;You came back.&quot; He murmured, breathing heavily. &quot;Aetos, welcome back.&quot; 

Auster stepped forward, clapping loudly. &quot;Welcome back indeed! Aetos, you&#39;ve been desperately missed. It&#39;s glad to know you&#39;ve been successfully resummoned, even if you have no memories of your previous encounter. Your lance is needed to win this Holy Grail War!&quot;

Lorenzo dipped his head in agreement, eyes shining brightly. &quot;You&#39;re finally back! Thank you for answering my summon once again, Aetos!&quot; This was certainly a surprise. The two seemed to recognize Ajax, which could only mean one thing...

Totally unfit for service in any phalanx, yet there was no shame in that. A sickly child who persevered in the face of his condition was just as strong in will as a seasoned hoplite. While he had nothing to base that statement on, his intuition led him there for some reason he had yet to figure out. &quot;If you know that name, I must have been summoned by you before. There is no other way.&quot;

&quot;You had to be quite lucky to summon me in this form for the Grail more often tortures me with the memory of my mistakes than my aspirations.

The elevator ride up to the Jamie Manor was claustrophobic at best, and downright dangerous at worst. Lancer&#39;s massive frame meant that Lorenzo and Auster were clammed against the wall, despite Ajax&#39;s attempts to make a little room for the two Jamie men.

&quot;Should&#39;ve taken the freight elevator...&quot; Auster muttered.

&quot;You know we can&#39;t. It only goes up to the garage, and it&#39;d take an extra ten minutes to make it into the manor anyways. Please tough it up, father.&quot;

Eventually, the trio made it up to Auster&#39;s office. Lorenzo took a seat in front of the desk, while Auster took a seat behind it. He gestured to Lancer, before continuing.

&quot;This city is Persepolis, site of a Holy Grail War. My son is your Master, and your original summoning was a mistake.&quot;

Lorenzo nodded, before interjecting, explaining the events that had led to Lancer&#39;s summoning, as well as the grim details of what happened.

&quot;We need your strength, Lancer. You&#39;re strong! Strong enough to step over the other six classes. Please help us.&quot;

He made the best accommodations he could for his master yet it was still a tight fit. At the Jamie family office, the servant’s pensive look only deepened as he was told the story of his past self, leaning in and seeming particularly interested with the circumstances of his first summoning.

“An accident it may have been on your part but it was destined to happen. Fate has a way of turning such things into purpose and it seems my duty is bound to you for a noble cause. Do not doubt that I will hold myself to the same goals and responsibilities as my past self for we are one and the same...” Aetos said, kneeling down before father and son.

“You will have my power and you will need it too. For while I can not fully determine the positions and identities of the other servants, I can roughly sense their headings and potency through my shield here...” his tone now stern  while he summoned his shield and balanced it on his knee. It spun slowly for a moment before fixing itself in alignment like a giant flat compass needle. “There  seem to be several divine or semi divine figures. We will have to be wary but firm in our actions if we are to emerge victorious for they will be pulling every trick they can to defeat and kill us. Is this understood?”

This manor is like a fortress to those who aren&#39;t us. Checkpoint after checkpoint. Bounded field after bounded field. I invite you to survey them at your leisure.&quot;

Auster was extremely confident in his defenses. No expense had been saved in turning the Jamie Manor into a fortress comparable to Troy. Security had been doubled, and everyone had been checked personally by Rodrick.

&quot;Most importantly, those <em>goons</em> in the Mafia aren&#39;t allowed to win the Holy Grail. If they&#39;re willing to undermine our authority with violence, I can&#39;t even imagine what would happen when they got the authority they so desperately crave.&quot;

Lorenzo looked like he wanted to say something. He struggled with it for a moment, before speaking up. &quot;Father, may I show Lancer around the estate? I feel he&#39;d rather see the real thing rather than look over blueprints.&quot;

Auster shrugged and gestured towards Lancer. <em>Ask him.</em> Lorenzo nodded, and turned to Aetos.

&quot;Would you like to check the estate yourself? I think you&#39;d find more value in seeing it.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax gave the Jamies a snort of protest as they described the intricacies of the manor they had made into their personal castle. Did they think themselves so safe behind these walls, the men that man then and the contraptions littered throughout. While he dare not mention it to them, the memory of that charismatic trickster had come to Ajax’s mind and how he brought down a far greater fortress with only a few men and deception. 

“This place is only as safe as you are wary and well-rested. You may be confident in your men’s ability to protect it from petty thieves and those who brought about my form last time, but those determined to break in, will eventually. However it sounds almost like you have made some moves to prevent that…” Ajax said, as Auster suggested that there was a possibility the Aristocrats rigged the competition in their favor. He would elaborate but his master spoke up and offered to take him on a tour. 

“Keep my words in your mind, Auster. This war is a new world in which the ways you had used previously may fail to keep you safe or worse... “ While Aetos may have been reflective and somber in the past, why was he so much more critical of them and their sophisticated defenses? “Now I will accompany Lorenzo. Farewell.” 

“Of course, Lorenzo, lead on and show me these defenses your father has decided to brag on about. I have heard similar words from the men of my time and hardly have they proved to be accurate or correct for long,” Ajax said to Lorenzo as soon as they were out of earshot.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nodding at Lancer, Lorenzo led his Servant down a few flights of stairs, and through a few doors, before standing near a small, unremarkable door. &quot;This is a back exit to the grounds.&quot; Lorenzo explained, opening it. 

As Ajax went through, he became acutely aware of several pairs of eyes boring into him. One behind him, around a corner. If he chose to check, it would be nothing more than a butler, probably checking on Lorenzo out of concern. All other pairs were coming from guards stationed on the grounds. All of them saluted to Ajax, or more likely, Lorenzo.

The grounds were made up of a field of green grass, sparingly decorated by trees and bushes. Close to the manor, a few go karts remained parked. A few guards got into one, and began to patrol. &quot;Father invested in a more efficient way for guards to move around. They&#39;re activated by a keys. According to father, they&#39;re on the guards at all times.&quot;

Read: <em>If someone killed a guard and took his key, they&#39;d be able to run around the grounds without much hassle.</em> At least they were close to the manor...

Lorenzo pointed at the fence around the property. &quot;Bounded field. Alerts us if there are people on the property. It also has a few <em>extra</em> functions.&quot; Lorenzo lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, as though sharing schoolboy gossip. 

&quot;It affects time in a few very special ways. When it&#39;s active, anyone approaching the house will be frozen in time. The amount of mana required, though...&quot; The young boy shuddered. &quot;Not ideal. Enough for three minutes, if father and I both pour energy into it.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ajax took in all the information silently, nodding his head at some of the points Lorenzo made as they passed them or scratched his beard thoughtfully as he assessed others. He frowned slightly when Lorenzo brought up the key situation but also kept that to himself. There was much he was going to have to discuss with the boy’s father the next time around. 


He could feel the presence of the bounded field before they even came within eyeshot, his left arm buzzing with a slight electric tingle, hairs oriented up and towards the fence. It was a potent spell to be sure, any that interfered with the fabric of reality had to be. Time was the world’s strongest river and it took a mighty dam to stop its flow for even a few seconds. Clearly the Jamies were no second-rate magi. 


“So I see, that’s quite the accomplishment of witchcraft you have there. If there is nothing else to review, then your defenses are . . . satisfactory to my standards and will give us comfort in planning our first move,” Aetos said, evaluating the unseen field ahead of him and tracing the flow of mana with his eyes.  “Which we will have to make soon. This is a Holy Grail War after all, is it not? We will have to fight the other servants if you wish to come out on top. You said there were alliances among the Aristocrats, yes? Do we know what class container the other families have access to?”

Father has people checking for Servant summonings constantly, and he&#39;s certain that we&#39;ll find something soon. There&#39;s rumor of an aristocrat summoning a Saber, but nothing concrete, sorry.&quot; Lorenzo hung his head in disappointment, upset that he couldn&#39;t answer Lancer&#39;s query. 

The two walked around the perimeter of the fence, before making it to the front. Lorenzo was breathing heavily by this point, as his frail body could barely take a thirty minute walk. What the boy lacked in visible authority, Ajax made up for, tenfold. The Servant oozed authority, as many soldiers noted as they saluted the hulking Lancer.

&quot;This is... the front gate...&quot; Lorenzo huffed as he gestured. A massive front gate made from iron towered just up to above Ajax&#39;s head. While the gate looked simple, who knew what magecraft was held within. At the gatehouse, a guard read a newspaper. He did a double take, before quickly saluting.

Lorenzo took a cross legged seat. &quot;I need a moment. Forgive me, Aetos... Sorry... This is the one gate onto the property. This is where service vehicles and transport drops off equipment. It&#39;s pretty boring!&quot; Lorenzo added.

As I mentioned earlier, I already know there have been at least seven servants summoned recently, the power of their auras fresh. I simply asked if there were alliances we could use to narrow down our choices for a first target. Do not stress about it, just improve and learn from the experience. That’s all an old warrior like me can ask for…” Ajax said, gently resting one of his massive paws on Lorenzo’s shoulder, taking great care not to bruise the boy. 

Aetos watched with some concern as his master tired out from just a simple walk. He had only seen such cases in the lame for any overt sign of weakness in a child in his era meant a death sentence for the child. Perhaps the era he live in now was a kinder, more merciful one that rewarded those that preserved through strength of will alone. Still, the fact such a boy found himself in the Grail War was a cruel twist of fate. He would have to work on his master if they were to operate at peak performance. 

“Take the time you need, I do not expect you to outrun me. Should you need it, I have no qualms in letting you ride upon my back. Otherwise, please hold my hand from now on in our walk. I will help you move when your breath comes back,” the warrior said in a soft tone, kneeling beside the sickly boy. He chuckled for his master’s benefit. “Aye it is rather boring here. Is there somewhere else you wish to show me that you find more enjoyable?”

After all, a Servant should help their Master!&quot; Lorenzo puffed out his chest, which did little to increase his authority or size.

Grasping Ajax&#39;s hand, Lorenzo pondered Ajax&#39;s question for a second. His brow furrowed, before clearing up as the young boy pointed at the fence. It was a bit odd, what was so special about the fence?

&quot;Outside, into town, into the world.&quot; Lorenzo said quietly. The reasoning was pretty obvious with thought. Lorenzo, being as frail as he was, was most likely not allowed outside due to constant danger, as well as being an aristocrat. As such, he was never allowed to leave. A mage&#39;s duty triumphed their own desires.

&quot;The Grail could solve this, but it wouldn&#39;t feel right...&quot; Lorenzo muttered, not looking up as Servant and Master stared beyond the fence, into Persepolis.

To take to the seas and make a name for yourself. In my time it was mainly for war on the other side of a great sea.

His posture and tone was not unlike that of a weathered fishing captain reminiscing as he stood on the dock, waiting for a boat that would never come. 


“Perhaps, that is what you should wish of the grail . . . freedom. For me, I’ve long since surrendered that right but you, you can take it for yourself. Or is it the possibility of improving yourself as a man that you desire, to make that freedom for yourself rather than have the grail hand it to you. What do you think?”</span>

Even if Lorenzo was comfortable with his weak body, even if there was no way to change it, he&#39;d keep trying. Maybe he and Lancer winning the Grail was the first step.

Turning away, Lorenzo began slowly walking over to the manor. Turning back to Aetos, he gestured. &quot;Come! You&#39;ll still need to get a feel for the blueprints if you&#39;re to properly defend this position. No matter how strong you are, you&#39;ll need help. I&#39;ll help you!&quot; 

Once again, Lorenzo looked down. He muttered something intelligible. When Lancer listened closer, it was still difficult to hear. &quot;Um... Lancer?&quot;
