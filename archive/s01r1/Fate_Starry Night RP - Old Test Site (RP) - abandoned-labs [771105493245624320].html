Help me carry this in!&quot; Kari said in her typical tone, putting back the hood of her rain jacket and revealing the bright red bandana covering the top of her hair, the rest of it flowing out the back.  She was pointing at the rucksack at Ada&#39;s feet. &quot;Seriously, before you or the bag rust!&quot;

Considering the gloomy sky and incessant rain outside, Kari was unusually energetic and seemed to almost skip on their way over to the old Test Site, dressed as if she was more going for a hike in a cloud forest than rummaging around in a decrepit facility. Of course, it was partially due to the daily consumption habits that she was a bit giddy but Kari had made it abundantly clear earlier that they were to get to the bottom of why the Mafia wanted to start a fake Holy Grail War. Something about investigations really put an odd type of fire in her.

&quot;Sooner we can get a base camp and surveillance up, the sooner we can start prying this place apart  for that fake grail of those lowlifes, and you are going to help me with that, no time for standing around looking pretty and just giving sassy remarks!&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&#39;No need to state the obvious.&#39; Ada replied over his shoulders as he dawdled at the lab&#39;s entrance. Rain droplets slid down his hair and no, he was not trying to live up to Kari&#39;s words and reproduce that dreamlike idol magazine cover look, nor was he trying to compete with the sack of junk at his feet over who could rust faster. For starters, Ada was confident that he would not let even a speck of rust grace his S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame, which he had yet to grow accustomed to, but he was working on it. There was no machine he couldn&#39;t conquer, after all.

The weather wasn&#39;t ideal for an outing, and that was concerning. If any folks chose to linger in deserted locations such as the labs, then chances were high that they lingered for very specific reasons. Specific reasons like Kari&#39;s, and as such it would be slightly problematic should they cross paths with each other.

Though, having said that, Ada hadn&#39;t exactly detected any presence other than theirs around the perimeter. He prodded the lump sack with his feet. 

&#39;Fancy a piggyback?&#39; He grabbed the sack and slung it over his shoulders, then followed Kari&#39;s voice and dove into the hallway behind him. &#39;I hope you brought over a towel or two. I may be rustproof, but no guarantees on my friend here.&#39;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Oh geez, so sorry about that, didn&#39;t know there was something wrong with a master giving orders to their servant,&quot; Kari bit back with jesting sarcasm, the smile on her lips dulling the sass by a good portion. Seeing Ada try his best to remain stylish in such conditions was enough to make her exhale heavier than normal. It really reminded her of how some rival family of the Toveskys always insisted on &quot;being elegant&quot; back when the world wasn&#39;t flooded. She waved the servant to follow her off into one decently lit room that looked to once be a break room of sorts. &quot;Ah this looks good enough as any place to set up,&quot;

For the Tovesky family, there was a certain pride in being practical in what they did and Kari was certainly no exception. She had Ada set the sack on an old patch of carpet and quickly set about unpacking its contents and providing the both of them with a small but functional mobile workshop that came pre-equipped with survey equipment and protective wards against prying eyes. 

&quot;Father taught me that you should always be prepared for every mission at hand and especially those you don&#39;t expect,&quot; how one went about the latter was anyone&#39;s guess but the sheer number of liquid compact mystic codes Kari had brought along either in her belt or in the pack sure seemed to help with that conundrum. &quot;Now why don&#39;t you try to find a vantage point nearby while I set up our surveillance system?&quot; Kari said, already holding four vials filled with golden liquid in her fingers while four more identical ones rested on the travel desk in front of her. 

Regardless of what Ada would do next, Kari just went straight ahead and whispered a short incantation and poured the four vials out on the floor in front of her. The golden puddles glowed with a silvery light before revealing their function: small serpentine familiars that could easily hide in cracks and crevices and provide Kari with constant awareness of their surroundings.</span>

With no one willing to give it care, it didn&#39;t surprise him that the end result was a desolate environment, albeit one perfect for shady activities to be hidden away from the public. 

Besides, he was used to such desolation; the Japan that existed during the Bakumatsu Period could never envision the futuristic touches that characterized the modern age but poverty was a force that existed through time and it ravaged anywhere that wasn&#39;t favored by the Shogunate. 

His movements weren&#39;t really with much purpose besides observation. His classification as an Assassin gave him Presence Concealment, which meant that his presence as a Servant was hidden away for the time being. 

He heard voices, two of them, which was more than enough to alert him that he wasn&#39;t alone. That was fine; if things spilled out of control, he could always just kill them. 

Though, for now, he decided to follow in the direction of the voices, walking along. Observing also meant learning about any new identities, after all.</span>

So, apology accepted, Miss Kari.&#39; Ada said with a straight face. He flicked water off his glasses and stepped back as the woman started setting up her mobile workshop. 

Magecraft wasn&#39;t something Ada specialized in, nor did he take particular interest in it. It also didn&#39;t help that he had manifested as an Archer with a penchant for end results. It was enough for him to learn the multipurpose nature of those liquid compacts, as he had witnessed two distinct types over the course of one day. He went over and made to grab one of the serpents before it could disappear into the floor cracks.

Kari hadn&#39;t instructed Ada to go anywhere specific, and he fully intended to use the chance to roam the entire area first. She wouldn&#39;t miss one serpentine friend, and he&#39;d have something to entertain himself with as he set about on the mundane task of walking the hallways yet again. Wires shot out from Ada&#39;s glove and wrapped themselves around the creature as he intended to study it his way.

&#39;A bit old-fashioned to be communicating via familiars, aren&#39;t we?&#39; Ada laughed as he navigated around Kari&#39;s equipment and made for the exit. He&#39;d never give up on the chance to get the final word.

The serpentine familiars were programmed to slither out and investigate everything within a 500m radius of her location. The curious thing was when she opened her monitor to flick through their perspectives and data, one in particular was detecting an abnormal spike in mana output. Naturally curious, Kari took direct control of the familiar and panned it&#39;s head around to face Ada, its silvery orbs refocusing and becoming more defined. It opened its mouth as if to speak but it&#39;s whole vibrated like jello on a speaker.

&quot;It&#39;s been five minutes, Ada. Hope you found a  good spot and haven&#39;t just been fooling around with my familiar. You do know each is packed with a special surprise, right?&quot; Kari said, a fake weetness in her voice distorted by the static of transmission. &quot;Drop it or you&#39;ll find out what that surprise is ~~&quot;

However she did not notice that another one of her familiars was getting closer and closer to their unknown follower in the shadows. The serpent&#39;s tongue flickered as it tasted the air for mana trails.

The fact that he was roaming about within the unknown territory without so much as a care already meant that he was bound to cross paths with someone or something sooner, not later. 

As the serpentine familiar followed him throughout the shadows, he briefly pondered over his options, his eyes glancing over to one of his swords. He could always destroy it, he was certainly fast enough to kill it and continue on his way. 

However, he wondered that was a wise choice in the grand scheme of things. His class was not Saber but Assassin, bestowing upon him the coveted skill of hiding his presence as a Servant within these very shadows. It would be a shame to destroy it for such a haphazard reason.

Although...perhaps it would be fun to send others on the edge for a bit of fun. His other skill could still hide his tracks and like a true samurai, he held enough confidence in himself to hold his own in a fight. 

And so, the Manslayer made his decision. 

His hand moved to one of his swords, the longer katana, his Presence Concealment fading away as he turned on his heel. 

The first move, drawing the blade from its sheath. 

The second move, stepping forward and swinging a one-handed slash towards the familiar, aiming to separate head from body. 

The third, sheathing the blade once more. 

That was the art of Battojutsu.

Perhaps hiding in the shadows was necessary for Assassins but manslayers had no need of it. Their art of killing was deadly, regardless if surprise was on their side or not.</span>

Ada had somehow found his way into the archives of the building and was sitting comfortably in a swivel chair, surrounded by computers and other devices he had scavenged from the rubbish left behind by previous inhabitants of the building. His serpent friend was now resting on his shoulders as he whiled away the time hooking himself up with the machines all around him.

The Servant visibly scowled when the serpent spoke up, but it was gone just as quickly when he recognized the voice behind it.

&#39;Of course, Miss Kari. I have secured the perfect location for a stake-out. Ready to fire at any hostility in the vicinity of the building at your order.&#39; 

Ada spoke with such certainty that had Kari been unable to see through her familiar, she might have been fooled. The archive was on the second floor of the building, but it had neither windows nor easy access to staircases leading to other floors. Archer was clearly bullshitting his way through Kari&#39;s inquiries as he continued tinkering with his newfound toys.

&#39;As for your familiar, do not worry. It is in good hands. I have examined it to my heart&#39;s content and have found ample enjoyment in the silence that we share-&#39;

A surge of mana flared in the distance. Somewhere downstairs, but it was gone in a flash and gave Ada no time to discern its exact location.

&#39;-Miss Kari. I believe that you have some company. Now would be a good time to demonstrate this special surprise that you speak of, preferably at this stranger instead of me.&#39;

Wherever he was was definitely not somewhere with a commanding view of the area. Ada would hear a distinctive thud through the static followed by eerie silence for a moment.

“<em>Archer,</em>” Oh that wasn’t a good sign, there waa hardly a moment Kari had addressed him like that before. “you are so very fortunate I do not have access to your serial code at this moment. I should have known you’d try to BS your way out of even the simplest work.”

“Unfortunately for you, I’ve got eyes and ears everywhere and that’s not going to fly again. Next time around, I’ll have Marie tail you. I’m sure you’ll just love that!” Kari said, venom lacing every word she spoke. Perhaps there was more to her choice of familiar than just practicality after all. 

She was about to continue her lecture when a warning flashed across her screen followed by the loss of data from one of her familiars. “Shit, well here’s your chance to redeem yourself, Servant. Meet me at the coordinates I’m sending you now or I’m cutting down your access to mana batteries.”

It was a masterful stroke, cleanly decapitating the golden fluid snake. Its body collapsed to the floor and began to spill itself out. However, that was not the end of the familiar, not quite. It began to violently vibrate and stiffen its headless body before freezing still. Not even a second later and the immediate area was assaulted by an explosion of ice shards. The art of surprise struck both ways and the Assassin may find himself pricked by the many icy quills.

A few moments later, rapid footsteps could be heard in the hallway along with a surge in mana useage as Kari came around the corner, six icy daggers flanking her to either side, floating in a cloud of frost.</span>
