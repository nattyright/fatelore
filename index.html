        The 5th Holy Grail War (Fuyuki, 2004) went awry. In an attempt to save the world from being consumed by the <b>Grail Mud</b>, a mysterious magus <b>flooded</b> the entire world. Many countries and associations <b>perished</b> during the cataclysm (non-canon chars only). A <b>century</b> passed (2104 now) and humans now live in <b>nomadic cities</b> floating on the ocean.<br><br>
        
        Each nomadic city is shaped like a <b>star</b>. The more arms they have, the more developed they are. Each city has their own internet, radio signals, and databases. They are essentially <b>isolated</b> from one another in terms of intercity communication. <b>Ships</b> make up the majority of intercity transportation. Planes and other vehicles exist only in limited quantities across the globe due to the scarcity of fuel. <br><br>
        
        Magecraft became <b>public knowledge</b> after the cataclysm. <b>Artificial Magic Circuits</b> were developed, as an extra organ, to help humans consume the New World's atmospheric mana. Their <b>placements</b> on the human body dictate their effectiveness. <br><br>
        
        The Grail is currently missing. Instead, expensive exoskeletons called <b>S.E.R.V.A.N.T.</b> mystic codes were developed to summon Servants. Their core is a <b>processor chip</b> containing 10% of the Grail's data. An organization called <b>Republic</b> is responsible for discovering and mass-producing them. <br><br>
        
        S.E.R.V.A.N.T.s produced by Republic <b>do not</b> come with Command Spells. Instead, they each have a <b>kill switch</b>, accessible only via <b>bonding</b>. Summoned Servants can only replenish mana via <b>bonding</b> with a Master, or ingesting <b>Mana Batteries</b>, which is a common commodity. <b>Severing</b> a bond will backfire on a Master's Artificial Circuits, which can be dangerous depending on its location.<br><br>
        
        An online database called <b>ServantPedia™</b> has info on most Heroic Spirits summoned to date. Each city has a copy of the database, which is periodically updated.<br><br>
        
        Aside from Republic, 2 other organizations are known worldwide (to the players):<br><br>
        
        <b>Neo Holy Empire</b>, the New World's holy church. It has its own mission of recovering 100% of the Grail's data and is often at odds with Republic, who refuses to cooperate. The Church often dispatches its followers and Executors to oversee HGWs, in addition to other missions.<br><br>
        
        <b>Alexandria</b>, the New World's archive. A megalopolis that aims to recover and preserve every piece of data and artifact from both the Old and the New World. Despite its neutral stance, it has an amicable relationship with the Church, who is open to information exchange unlike Republic.<br><br>
        
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size:13px; text-align:center;">Endnote: This page only serves as a <b>refresher</b> and <b>quick intro</b>.

        <h1 class="text--big">History</h1>
        <p class="text--normal">
        
        
        During the 5th Holy Grail War set in Fuyuki (2004), a catastrophe occurred near the end of that ritual. A Grail failed to produce a wish and there was no determined winner, resulting in the leftover energy produced by the defeated Servants to turn into thaumaturgical energy, also known as the 'Grail Mud'. This mud spread across Fuyuki, devouring the entire city as it grew in size with each landmark, building or organism it consumed. As such, it wasn't long until the rest of the world had to contend with the Grail Mud.<br><br>

        At its current rate, it was simply a matter of time until the mud consumed the entirety of the Earth. As such, Magi were forced to take the spotlight and defend themselves from this catastrophe via Magecraft and Servants of their own. This resulted in commoners finding out that Magecraft was real, gradually reducing the overall Mystery in the world and weakening Magecraft itself.<br><br>

        Unfortunately, not even the combined efforts of the Mage's Association and several other Magi organizations could halt the mud's pace. At best, it could be slowed down. Because of this, some Magi started to think about how to survive in a world completely corrupted by Grail Mud. This resulted in Magi working alongside scientists and engineers, which led to the creation of the nomadic cities. Unfortunately, their structure was deemed too weak to resist the potent curses of the mud.<br><br>

        At least, until one lone Magi appeared. They had no backing from any organization and no one knew their identity, but they had apparently been inscribing runes all around the world. Once they were done, they confronted the mud itself and activated the runes, resulting in a massive flood of purifying waters all around the globe. This dramatically stopped the advance of the mud, since the purifying waters seemed to oppose it somewhat.<br><br>

        The catch, however, was the fact that the entire world was flooded. Due to how sudden and mysterious the flood was, certain Magi organizations had no time to prepare at all and therefore, perished by the very flood that was supposed to save them. Only the Mage's Association survived, albeit its numerous branches dwindled in size as it was forced to turn the Clock Tower into a nomadic city to survive. The rest of the world followed suit, using the nomadic cities as a way to live in the flooded world.<br><br>

        A century passed and the year is now 2104. Nomadic cities have become the de facto way of life as both commoners and Magi live alongside one another. Magecraft and Servants have become commonplace, resulting in the overall death of Mystery and the gradual erasure of Magecraft's power. As such, Artificial Circuits have become commonplace, along with S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes to ensure the summoning of Heroic Spirits without a Grail. The mud still exists and is still a threat, but far less so than it was in the past. The world is slowly returning to something inhabitable...<br><br><br><br>

        Under this setting, True Magic is considered a dead art, while Magecraft and the Throne of Heroes have been greatly weakened due to them becoming public knowledge. Even the Counterforce has ceased its activity altogether in this world.<br><br>

        Because of this, Magecraft has been modernized and supported by technological advancements such as <b>Artificial Magic Circuits</b> and Mystic Codes. <br><br>
        
        <b>RP Tips</b><br><br>
        
        The most important takeaway is that the world has been flooded and humanity has coexisted with magecraft for almost 100 years. If your character is from an old mage family predating the flood, please provide adequate reasoning as to how they were able to preserve their bloodline/family crest/artifacts etc. Likewise, if your character is a New World magus, provide some background on how they came to learn magecraft.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="22">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Mages in the New World are unable to harvest atmospheric mana through their own magic circuits. Instead, <b>artificial magic circuits</b> are installed as an extra organ in order to bypass this restriction, filtering and converting atmospheric mana into something a mage can use.<br><br>
    
        <i>Placements</i> of artificial circuits matter a great deal when it comes to their strength and efficiency. Installing them in low risk locations (limbs, shoulder etc.) will result in reduced effectiveness, while high risk locations (spine, heart, eyes etc.) will raise their compatibility past a magus' natural parameters.<br><br>
        
        <i>Overloading</i> artificial circuits can result in harm to the user's internal organs, the destruction of their natural circuits and in more extreme cases, death. Aside from stress accumulated from using magecraft, severing the <b>bond</b> between a Servant and their Master can also place the Master's artificial circuits under great stress, which usually results in the destruction of those circuits.<br><br>
        
        <b>RP Tips</b><br><br>
        
        Under our setting, artificial circuits serve two main purposes:
        <ol>
        <li>Give everyone (yes, even commoners) access to atmospheric mana and hence, allow for more diverse backgrounds when it comes to creating a magus.</li>
        <li>Allow one to bond with a Servant, which enables mana sharing (See <b>Summoning &amp; Bonding</b>).</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="23">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Concentrated storage of mana filtered from the atmosphere through new and improved scientific methods. They resemble tiny capsules similar to multi-vitamins and are commonly drunk by <b>S.E.R.V.A.N.T.s</b>. They are sold in a variety of stores, ranging from convenience stores to supermarkets. Servants aren’t allowed to purchase them legally, unless accompanied by a master. This does not stop certain Servants from trying to obtain them illegally or without consent, of course.<br><br>
        
        Without bonding or mana transfer, this is the only way for a Servant to replenish their mana.<br><br>
        
        <b>RP Tips</b><br><br>
        
        It takes time for a Servant to digest mana batteries. Translated into RP terms, this means you cannot use mana batteries to insta-replenish a Servant's mana in a fight thread. You can only do so when out of the fight or, with the consent of everyone in that thread (including your opponents).
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="24">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Artificial Magic Circuits granted everyone the privilege of becoming a magus. However, access to mana and competency are different matters. Most people with no prior training in magecraft can only use their artificial circuits to perform menial tasks at best.<br><br>
        
        However, while artificial circuits do not automatically make a great mage out of everyone, they can still turn them into living mana batteries and allow them to interact with an array of mana-powered contraptions:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Leylines in nomadic cities can be ridden by those with access to mana as a form of transportation.</li>
        <li>Servants only require mana to function. One's magecraft prowess has nothing to do with this.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        Due to the prevalence of magecraft, there is no discrimination between those born with natural circuits and those who solely rely on artificial circuits. However, mages with <i>both</i> high ranking natural and artificial circuits are still rare.<br><br>

        Due to how closely Magecraft and Technology have been linked ever since the cataclysm, both of these development paths have been supporting each other ever since. This caused humanity’s technological progress to skyrocket, thanks to the assistance of Magecraft which made the ‘impossible possible’.<br><br>
        
        <b>RP Tips</b><br><br>
        The most important takeaway is that humans now live in nomadic cities floating on the ocean, and cities usually keep to themselves. Some cities are fully developed, while others struggle for resources. You are more than welcome to base your character's background on a made-up city (provided it's not too far-fetched), or use any of our established ones (See <b>Location</b>). 
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="32">
        <p class="text--normal">
        The majority of humans have taken to the sea ever since the cataclysm destroyed and flooded most of the habitable lands. They reside in nomadic cities, which are not only propelled by modernized sea rune Magecraft, but high tech stabilizers and artificial soil. The <b>leylines</b> present in nomadic cities have been shaped like railway systems, allowing citizens to ride them via high tech boots.<br><br>



        Each nomadic city takes on the shape of a star with either 8, 6, 4, or 2 arms. The more arms there are, the bigger and more developed the city is.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/QdEj7mB.png">
        
        <center>The 8 armed star (Stella Maris)</center>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        These are mostly megapolises that have fully developed. They act like an average old world city, with a wide array of facilities that cater to people from different backgrounds. While they don’t specialize in anything specific, these cities tend to be the most robust in both the technological and magecraft scene, since they have become hotspots for other, lesser cities to latch onto and trade with.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/10PKwoz.png">
        
        <center>The 6 armed star (Cynosura)</center>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        These cities’ developments are usually propelled by specializing in specific departments such as being the center of commerce, research, and the cultivation of various goods. While more ambitious cities set out on turning themselves into a megapolis, the majority are content with their status and are happy to remain as a lesser, albeit fully functioning city.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fo9Pszo.png">
        
        <center>The 4 armed star (Dhruva)</center>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        These cities are a lot smaller and a lot more restricted in function, usually unable to fully sustain themselves and have to import various goods to keep the city running. However, this in turn makes them more focused in serving their respective purposes. In addition, their smaller size grants them the capability to migrate on water, albeit at a much slower pace that most ships.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <img class="subtitlepic" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/dd8Ch8w.png">
        
        <center>The 2 armed ‘star’ aka ships (Polaris)</center>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        Due to resource constraints, ships make up the majority of the new world's <b>intercity</b> transportation. For simplicity’s sake, all ships are classified as 2 armed 'stars' due to them taking on the shape of a thin diamond from the bird’s-eye view. These can be as small as a boat or as large as a cruiser, serving various functions such as transportation, entertainment, cargo, or militaristic.<br><br>

        The World Wide Web has fully collapsed due to the flood. Radio and phone signals also became a thing of the past as humans were forced to restore their world without having these tools at their disposal.<br><br>

        However, once the nomadic cities finally found their footing, so did magi and network specialists. They cooperated in an attempt to revive these lost arts of humanity, and succeeded with the development of the <b>City Wide Web</b>, known as <b>CWW</b> or <b>Citynet</b> for short.<br><br>

        CWW functions similarly to the internet, except that it is tied down to a nomadic city instead of having multiple data centers across the globe. As such, humans can only access data from their city, meaning that <b>they cannot obtain data from neighbouring nomadic cities easily</b>. It is possible to send data to other cities and access their data, but the further away a city is, the longer it takes to receive a response.<br><br>

        Sending an email from one city to another city on the opposite of the globe, for example, would take at least 2 hours. This is because the signal would need to pass through numerous cities in order to reach its destination, due to the lack of fiber networks in a world filled with water.<br><br>

        However, some resources are shared between all cities. Important resources such as <b>Servantpedia™</b> and old world data are stored inside special hard drives belonging to the network managers of each nomadic city. These drives are periodically updated with new data and constantly monitored by the city network. Every city owns at least one of these special hard drives. This allows even the average citizen to be able to access these resources through the city's own search engine.<br><br>

        But this only applies to events from the old world or news that is more than a few months old. <b>Recent events, in comparison, are usually kept under wraps and limited to the city in which they occurred in.</b> Most nomadic cities usually keep to themselves, unless their information is incredibly useful and needs to be accessed by another city for political or financial reasons. In these cases, an exchange of data between the two cities usually occurs, or in the worst case scenario, negotiations break down and nobody walks away with anything.<br><br>

        Cities that take smaller cities under their wing also take advantage of the CWW. When two cities form an alliance and merge into a single city, their data centers are usually merged with each other, resulting in both of them sharing the same CWW and allowing citizens from both cities to access each others’ resources. Said data centers are also constantly synced and updated with one another. Of course, this doesn’t apply to allied cities that haven’t merged into one entity.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="34">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Just like the CWW, magi and network developers united forces and managed to restore radio and mobile towers to the world. These towers are bound to nomadic cities and manage to transmit a signal that encompasses areas that go beyond the city, allowing the signal to reach even people outside of the city. This is incredibly helpful for contacting neighbouring cities or nearby travellers.<br><br>

        <b>Every tower in a city utilizes its own network</b>, meaning that travellers with phones will have to change SIMs at every city in order to be able to make calls. As such, some make it a habit to carry multiple SIMs on them, especially if they often travel from city to city. <br><br>

        Of course, dead zones are far more common in this world than they were in the old world. As such, phones are mostly only used in the city, and rarely used outside of it.<br><br><br><br>

        Persepolis went into decline in recent years due to rental requests being scarce, and its Aristocrat and Mafia factions waged their own Holy Grail War over the ownership of the city (Season 1).

        <b>Background:</b>
        Two Cynosura type cities that caught wind of Persepolis' demise and sought to claim its resources for themselves. 
        

        
        <br><br>
        <b>Olympia</b><br>
        A Church-affiliated, heavily industrilized city that makes a living on the manufacturing and exportation of various goods. Factories are Olympia's lifeline; some of them far exceed the scale and capability of standard factories in other lesser cities. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that there is nothing Olympia cannot mass-produce.
        <br><br>
        Olympia gives priority to fulfilling orders that directly come from the Neo Holy Empire. It likely holds several valuable blueprints frequently used by the Church staff. As such, the Church often stations their agents within the city under the name of protection.
        <br><br>
        In Olympia, one's social standing is dictated entirely by their lineage. The aristocracy monopolizes the factories and, by extension, the factory workers. The average citizen is able to lead a comfortable life in Olympia so long as they abide by the law and work hard. However, they have no say in political matters.
        <br><br>
        Currently, Olympia is in the middle of a bidding war over Persepolis' corpse. Since the city itself lacks no resources, its ruling class is doing so entirely as a display of wealth and power.



        <br><br>
        <b>Delphi</b><br>
        An independent trade center that actively involves itself in intercity business around the globe. Trading, sharesholding, consultation, investment, so long as there's profit, Delphi won't ever turn down an offer. 
        <br><br>
        Delphi's social hierarchy could be described as 'lawless'. Within the city, it's every man for themselves...but only in a business sense. Anyone is allowed to open up their own firm, and anyone is allowed to crush their competitors, so long as it's within legal confines. As a result, one's political standing in Delphi is almost always tied to the success of their business.
        <br><br>
        As such, Delphi's ruling class changes annually. Only those who are competent, or lucky enough to make it in have the right to make major decisions for the city.
        <br><br>
        Currently, Delphi is in the middle of a bidding war over Persepolis' corpse. It wishes to use the extra resources to expand itself into a Stella Maris grade city. With its economical prowesss, it's extremely confident on winning the bid.

        <b>Background:</b>
        Also known as the New World's Archive, Alexandria is a megalopolis that aims to recover and preserve every piece of data from both the Old and the New World. It houses the world's largest, most up-to-date database, as well as public libraries, museums and warehouses full of books and artifacts that are available for rental. <br><br>
        
        Alexandria's only goal is to archive human history. It does not meddle in political affairs, nor does it seek to use its information network for monetary gains. As such, it manages to maintain an amicable relationship with most major factions, especially those who are open to information exchange.<br><br>
        
        Aside from Alexandria, multiple smaller-scale library cities also exist as its subsidiary. Some of them report directly to Alexandria, while others choose to work for other cities or factions. Those that do not work directly under Alexandria usually do not have the authorization to access more classified data.

        <p class="text--normal">
        Technology now has a symbiotic relationship with Magecraft, which is further proven by the newly developed <b>S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes</b>. <br><br>

        S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes are similar to normal Mystic Codes. They are magical artifacts that are similar to golems and automatons in design, but with modern technology serving as their structure. Their chassis and exoskeleton is entirely manmade, being a husk that is similar to a cyborg-like body merged with their properties enchanted by magecraft.<br><br>
        
        S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes enable the summoning of Heroic Spirits in the absence of the Holy Grail.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="52">
        <p class="text--normal">
        The Core of a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame is designed on principle to be the closest thing possible to a Spirit Origin Core. Engraved in that core is a powerful processor, one strong enough to hold a mere 10% of the lost Holy Grail's data within.<br><br>

        These complex calculations and remnants of True Magic are normally idle, but activate upon interacting with a summoning ritual. A singular command is then run through the processor, the only feasible command out of the 10% that could be obtained from the Grail: <i>‘Summon Heroic Spirit’</i>.<br><br>

        Once a Heroic Spirit is summoned, the Mystic Code’s functions gradually change. The processor goes inactive, preventing further summons and becoming the Servant’s own Spirit Core.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="53">
        <p class="text--normal">
        The creation of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames is still a mystery. No one knows who created the first processor, but it most likely was someone from after the cataclysm. Aside from containing 10% of the Grail's data, the processor is also engraved with information on what happened to humanity after that tragic event, keeping summoned Heroic Spirits up to date with the most recent happenings.<br><br>

        However, this is most odd, since the Holy Grail is theorized to have been destroyed after the cataclysm, so it is unknown on how the Grail’s data could be stored inside a processor.<br><br>

        Regardless, <b>Republic</b> is credited as the organization that first discovered it. <br><br>
        
        <b>Republic</b><br><br>
        Currently, all S.E.R.V.A.N.T. factories are owned by a single organization known as <i>Republic</i>.<br><br>
        
        The average citizen doesn’t know much about them. Some don’t even know it exists, but <i>Republic</i> claims to be an organization dedicated to research, development and the betterment of humanity. They call themselves a charitable foundation dedicated to prevent abuse of Servants while utilizing them as tools to rebuild humanity.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>


        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="54">
        <p class="text--normal">
        
        <b>Tracking</b><br><br>
        
        Every S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame comes with its own unique <b>serial number</b> inscribed onto their core during production. Each Servant summoned through it can be <b>tracked and forced to shut down</b> via <i>Republic's</i> central network that monitors these Mystic Codes.<br><br> 
        
        <b>Serial Number Naming Scheme</b><br><br>
        
        Every serial number is formed by four sections.
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Class</li>
          <li>Origin</li>
          <li>Death</li>
          <li>Random Number Identifier</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        For example, the Serial Number for the prodigious Servant, <b>King Arthur</b>, would be written as SBGB050169.<br><br>

        <b>SB</b> = Saber<br>
        <b>GB</b> = Great Britain, their birthplace and origin of their legend.<br>
        <b>0501</b> = Start of 6th Century, which is Arthur’s rumoured death date.<br>
        <b>69</b> = Two random digits created by the system. Used as unique identifiers in case two Servants share the same class, origin and death.<br><br>

        Further examples are listed down below, but most serial numbers given to Servants abide by this standard. Certain Servants are given special serial codes, mostly unique identifiers that only owners of the central network can understand. They are usually given to ‘peculiar’ Servants that are worth paying special attention to.<br><br>
        
        <b>Serial Number Examples</b><br><br>
        
        <b>ARUR250033</b> = Gilgamesh<br>
        <b>LCIR000101</b> = Cu chulainn<br>
        <b>RDMA032367</b> = Alexander The Great<br>
        <b>ASJP161220</b> = Sasaki Kojiro<br>
        
        <br>

        <b>Serial Number Legend</b><br><br>

        <b>SB</b> = Saber<br>
        <b>AR</b> = Archer<br>
        <b>LC</b> = Lancer<br>
        <b>RD</b> = Rider<br>
        <b>AS</b> = Assassin<br>
        <b>CS</b> = Caster<br>
        <b>BZ</b> = Berserker<br><br>

        <b>FI</b> = Fictional Origin (If no birthplace)<br>
        <b>MY</b> = Mythical Origin (If no birthplace)<br>
        <b>DE</b> = Deity/Divine Spirit Origin (If no birthplace)<br><br>

        </p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="55">
        <p class="text--normal">
        
        The unique serial number in each S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame allows for its deactivation via <i>Republic's</i> central network. This essentially works as a <b>kill switch</b> that lets a master disable the Mystic Code, effectively killing their Servant.<br><br>

        A master has access to said kill switch <b>only if they have bonded with the servant and gained access to the serial on the Mystic Code’s core</b>. Otherwise, management of said servant is done via Republic’s central network.<br><br>

        A Servant can, however, technically escape the kill signal by leaving the city they inhabit and avoiding contact with a city’s radio waves. However, this is merely a temporary solution, since cities are the only locations in the world where one can obtain mana batteries. In a sense, they would be dooming themselves to a slow death since they cannot absorb atmospheric mana and lack a Master.<br><br>
        
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="56">
        <p class="text--normal">
        A Servant summoned within a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame has specific ways to manage their mana upkeep:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Obtaining mana batteries that are designed specifically for S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes. They are commonly available, be it at convenience stores or supermarkets. Only Masters have permission to purchase them legally (See <b>Magic-Mana Batteries</b>).<br><br></li>
          <li>Traditional mana transfer sessions.<br><br></li>
          <li>Mana sharing enabled by establishing a bond with a Servant (see <b>Summoning &amp; Bonding</b>).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        
        Unlike in the past, Servants in this setting cannot gather raw mana or ether from the environment itself (see <b>Magic - Mana &amp; Magic Circuits</b>).<br><br>
        
        <b>Power Level</b><br><br>

        Regardless of how much mana a Heroic Spirit obtains, they are a far cry from any version of them that could be summoned from the Counter Force or the Throne of Heroes in the Old World. Due to the identical specs used by all of the mass produced S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, it could be said that most Heroic Spirits summoned through them have the same baseline ‘power level’ as each other.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="57">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Despite the prevalence of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, they are still costly to obtain, both legally and illegally. Owning a unit is a hefty investment akin to owning a luxury car, and incidents such as stolen frames are rampant in poorer districts of nomadic cities.<br><br>

        Masters can either purchase a fresh S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame to activate themselves, or they can go to auctions and bid on ‘prebuilt’ Servants summoned by other, more competent mages. <br><br>

        Aside from competitive environments such as Holy Grail Wars, Servants have fully integrated themselves into the average city life. Their purpose isn't always stellar, sometimes reduced to being trohpies for the wealthy or doing manual labour that keeps a city running.<br><br>

        Naturally, not all summoned Servants are content with their new status. Rebellious Servants are quite common, but the existence of the <b>kill switch</b> forces most of them to be complacent. Despite this, Heroic Spirits are still very much necessary for humanity due to the amount of threats that pervade the world.<br><br>
        
        <b>Auctions</b><br><br>
        
        Many skilled mages are willing to summon Heroic Spirits for buyers in exchange for goods, wares or money. These buyers then put up the Heroic Spirits for sale on auctions, allowing any individual rich enough to purchase them, be it in person or online via the CWW.<br><br>

        These auctions are usually approved by <b>Republic</b> and a license must be purchased in order to legally hold an auction. This doesn’t stop black market auctions from happening, however.<br><br><br><br>

        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="58">
        <p class="text--normal">
        Much like magecraft, the widespread summoning of Heroic Spirits has caused humanity to devalue them as a whole. The identity of most Heroic Spirits can be deciphered from a quick online search via an app called ServantPedia™, which contains profiles of most summoned Servants to date. Each nomadic city keeps a copy of ServantPedia's database and syncs it periodically via <b>Republic's</b> networks.<br><br>

        Once a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame’s core is activated, it will instinctively attempt to summon a Heroic Spirit. A successful summon results in the core morphing the cybernetic body of the Mystic Code into a facsimile of the Heroic Spirit that was summoned. <br><br>

        At this point, the Mystic Code is considered more Servant than golem and it becomes impossible to treat it as a conventional machine. The summoning is permanent and the processor goes inactive, making it impossible to summon a Heroic Spirit twice while using the same Mystic Code.<br><br>

        A Servant summoned via this method will retain all of its memories from the Throne of Heroes, along with the memories it obtained from the processor (what happened to humanity post cataclysm). A Servant will also realize the nature of its mechanical body, but most likely won’t do anything about it since it is no different than having a body purely made of Ether (in FSN) or Data (in Fate/Extra).<br><br>

        It is possible to tether specific Heroic Spirits from specific time periods by utilizing an item from that time period as a catalyst, such as a piece of the Round Table to summon the King of Knights.<br><br>

        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="62">
        <p class="text--normal">
        As of now, <b>none</b> of the S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames on the market have been able to generate Command Spells upon summoning a Servant. The processor chip's 10% of the Grail's data simply does not include this necessary function.<br><br>

        Without this safety feature, Servant summons have become even more of a double edged sword. Clear, effective communication is more vital than ever, as the Servant is no longer forced to obey their Master and could easily turn on them at the drop of a hat. As a result, the only ways to exercise some degree of control over a summoned Servant is via their <b>mana intake and the kill switch</b>.<br><br>

        Despite <i>Republic’s</i> various research departments pouring vast amounts of resources into the endeavor, progress has been slow and no noticeable improvements have been made. In place of Command Spells remains only a crude alternative that aims to mimic the same role at controlling a summoned Servant: <b>Bonding</b>.<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="63">
        <p class="text--normal">
        It is possible for anyone (including commoners) to forge a connection with a Servant's processor core, so long as the following conditions have been met:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The potential Master has installed <b>artificial magic circuits</b> on their body, which are used to sync up to the processor core to establish an initial connection.<br></li>
          <li>The Servant in question isn’t bonded to anyone else at the moment.<br></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="text--normal">
        The bond grants the master unrestricted access to the processor core’s serial and by extension, the <b>kill switch</b> that can permanently shut down the Servant unit. This protocol bypasses any defensive mechanism the Servant may set up to prevent their shutdown, and overrides any command issued by the head company monitoring the Servant via their central network.<br><br>
        
        The act of bonding itself varies, depending on the traits of the Servant. Some Servants demand specific types of actions to form a connection, which is usually tied to their myth or their feats. As such, there is no universal way to perform a bond and it is a case-by-case basis. Because of this, some Masters forego bonding altogether, in case they do not fit the Servant’s criteria.<br><br>
        
        
        <b>RP Tips</b><br><br>
        
        The bonding process is being left vague on purpose. It's entirely up to the writer's interpretation. The moderation team did this to give players creative freedom in writing the bonding limitations for their Servants. If you intend on writing a bond, feel free to use cases of bonding IRP as reference or pitch your bonding idea over at <i>#character-creation-help</i>.<br><br>
        
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subslide__content" data-slide="64">
        <p class="text--normal">
        There are multiple ways to sever an established bond:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Deactivating the Servant via its kill switch (initiated by the Master).<br></li>
          <li>Destroying the Master’s artificial mana circuits (initiated by anyone).<br></li>
          <li>Killing the Servant and/or master (initiated by anyone).</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text--normal">
        <b>Risks of Severing the Bond</b><br><br>
        
        Severing the bond places great strain on a Master's artificial magic circuits, which they used to forge the bond. The damage caused is dependent on the location of said artificial circuit.<br><br>
        
        In addition, severing a bond will plague the current Master with memories of the Servant's previous Masters in the form of severe hallucinations, a condition labeled as <b>Erosion</b> by current day researchers.
        
        Prevention of this backflow of memory is impossible. Prediction of when the hallucinations will hit is impossible. Prolonged exposure to these hallucinations may have negative consequences on a Master's day-to-day life. Suppressants in the form of pills can alleviate the symptoms somewhat, but they will never truly go away.<br><br>

        Therefore, Magi and Commoners are generally ill-advised to contract with a Servant via bonding <i>unless they have adequately steeled themselves for the consequences</i>. Likewise, if you see a stray Servant in a cardboard box on the side of the street begging for a new owner and/or mana batteries, please call the Servant Shelter Hotline at <b>xxx-xxxx</b> to arrange a retrieval service instead.<br><br><br><br>

        Like in the original <i>Fate/Stay Night</i>, the Holy Church is an organization that specializes in the hunting of heresy and demons. Being a subsection of the Roman Catholic Church, it works from the shadows through zealots known as Executors and agents of the Burial Agency. They have a tenuous relationship with the Mage’s Association and are also known to monitor Holy Grail Wars as impartial and unbiased judges, albeit there have been rumours of them favouring certain sides over the other.<br><br>

        Unfortunately, like any other large organization in the world, the Holy Church crumbled and split off in the face of the apocalypse. The Grail Mud destroyed its base, and its unique miracles could not save it. Numerous holy relics were lost and the pope was reported missing once the Grail Mud submerged the entirety of Rome.<br><br>

        However, some of the agents of the Holy Church saw warning signs of the impending apocalypse. Rejecting the orders of the pope, they split off the Holy Church in advance and started roaming the world once the apocalypse started. Eventually, they came across a prophet. A ‘messiah’ that would lead them to salvation...<br><br>

        The messiah gathered more followers, and the former agents of the church assisted them in their endeavours. Eventually, the Holy Church would be reborn as the <b>Neo Holy Empire</b>, an organization that calls itself the spiritual successor to the Holy Church from 100 years ago. Being founded around a few decades after the apocalypse, this new organization focused on gathering researchers, scientists and traders, but most importantly, devout people who were willing to follow the Lord. They advertised themselves as an organization seeking to archive and preserve the traditions of old, such as numerous religions ranging from Christianity to Hinduism and Buddhism.<br><br>

        While the majority of its members are still Catholic, the sheer amount of variety in Holy Scriptures has turned it into a peaceful, accepting community that has gathered almost as many members as the Roman Catholic Church in its prime. In the year 2104, the Neo Holy Empire is rumoured to control at least 3 <b>Stella Maris</b> cities, while also having several smaller cities under its protection and guidance. Its relationships with other cities is amicable at best and neutral at worst, but the organization seems to have a distaste for remnants of the Mage’s Association.<br><br>

        The Neo Holy Empire, much like the Holy Church before it, abhors the use of Magecraft, considering it to be something that borders on heresy. Members of the Neo Holy Empire are forbidden from utilizing or learning Magecraft, but they are allowed to learn the Church’s own brand of magic, also known as <b>‘miracles’</b> and <b>‘baptism rites’</b>. Unlike Magecraft, which focuses on affecting the physical world, miracles focus on affecting the spiritual world. Therefore, they are incredibly effective at exorcising demons and evil spirits. They are also very effective against Servants, since their Spirit Origin cores are so fragile in a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Code that an Executor trained in the art of miracles could probably harm them far easier than any other mage. Magic Resistance skills still apply, however.<br><br>

        The Church instead places a bigger faith on technology, and one could say that most of the new world’s technological advancements are owed to the Church. Its Stella Maris cities are connected to one another via an intricate transport system that is fully powered by traditional means and devoid of Magecraft. The cities themselves are glorious technological megapolises inhabited by some of the greatest researchers of the time period. The only Magecraft present inside the cities are Sea Runes dedicated to letting them float, but the Church has kept this underwraps by claiming that it is a miracle instead.<br><br>

        The Neo Holy Empire also takes advantage of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes quite often. Due to the lack of Magecraft, most of the cities’ infrastructure was actually made with the assistance of Servants. Even now, Servants are considered to be the heart and soul of cities controlled by the Neo Holy Empire, and are given better rights due to their importance to the Church. However, they are still scorned and treated as second class citizens by most humans, causing some resentment to flow in the city’s darker areas.<br><br>

        Those who are under the Neo Holy Empire’s protection are not encouraged to utilize Magecraft either. However, the Church does not condone them for using Magecraft to survive, such as if the city they are protecting requires ley lines to allow public transport to function and so on. Its bias towards Magecraft is, however, abundantly clear.<br><br>

        Being an organization dedicated to research and development, the Church has state of the art science labs, along with numerous archives containing articles, research papers, books and tomes from centuries ago. The Church has attempted to archive all traditions and remnants of the Old World, in order to preserve its culture and allow others to be enlightened by the knowledge of the past while simultaneously pursuing the new. It is not surprising that it has attracted so many people under its care as a result, since numerous researchers have joined the Neo Holy Empire because of the facilities alone. Being devout is nonessential, since the Church knows it cannot be picky.<br><br>

        The Neo Holy Empire has four main goals in its doctrine:
        </p>
        
        
            <ol>
            <li>Retrieve the lost holy relics that were dispersed in the apocalypse.</li>
            <li>Oversee all manners of potential Holy Grail Wars and act as an impartial judge if given the chance to do so.</li>
            <li>Host Holy Grail Wars during specific seasons in the year.</li>
            <li>Recover 100% of the Holy Grail’s data.</li>
            </ol>
            
        <p class="text--normal">
            Due to these goals, the Neo Holy Empire is very interested in the numerous Holy Grail Wars that have erupted since the apocalypse started. It has been closely monitoring HGWs happening in minor cities via its Executors, who have now been repurposed as scouts and overseers of Holy Grail Wars.<br><br>

            Data obtained by the Executors is then filtered back to researchers located at the Church’s capital. The Neo Holy Empire aims to use the numerous Holy Grail Wars as a way to reverse engineer the Grail’s data by seeing it in action numerous times. So far, they have monitored around a hundred or more Holy Grail Wars, each one differing in size and being located in different cities.<br><br>

            However, the reward for such devotion has been minimal. In the span of around a hundred years since the apocalypse happened, the Church has only managed to gather around 10% of the Holy Grail’s data via monitoring alone. As such, they are currently working on an alternative method to gather data on the Holy Grail, but that relies on the assistance of <b>Republic</b>.<br><br>

            The Neo Holy Empire is ruled by various archbishops and popes, but its main leader is an enigmatic figure known as the Pater Patriae. Not much is known about them, besides that the inner sects respect them deeply and that their orders are usually absolute.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="text--normal">
        Despite being an amicable organization that has helped many, the Neo Holy Empire currently has a neutral stance towards Republic. Being an organization that utilizes Servants more than Magecraft, the Church tried its best to appeal to Republic and form an alliance with them. However, attempts to contact Republic seemed futile, as the Neo Holy Empire received radio silence for the most part. Eventually, Republic gave in and replied, only to give a rather blunt message.<br><br>

        <i>“Republic are currently not interested in forming any business partnerships with the Holy Church. If you require customer assistance, please contact our Customer Service hotline instead.”</i><br><br>

        The audacity behind that message was enough to infuriate most of the higher-ups in the Church. However, the Neo Holy Empire’s leader ordered the organization to stand down and to keep an amicable relationship with Republic. Their word was enough for the others to quiet down, as they resumed their activities instead and ignored Republic.<br><br>

        However, this was a huge blow to the Church, for the reason they contacted Republic was due to them wanting to obtain the 10% Holy Grail Data that was used in the production of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes. While the Church has obtained their own 10% of data, it is a different category than what Republic obtained, and one could say that their two fragments of data serve two different purposes.<br><br><br><br>
